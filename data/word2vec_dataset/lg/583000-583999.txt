 Because the game was never completed , only a small portion of the intended gameplay exists . During the playable segment , Mustafa , through conversations with other detainees , discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt . Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers , hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search , recover them at night ( which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in ) , and deliver them to the other detainee . The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers . Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who , after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground , mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Escape from Woomera is a point @-@ and @-@ click adventure game . The player , controlling Mustafa , explores the Woomera centre , which is populated with non @-@ player characters — computer @-@ controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own . Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa , giving him information about the facility , sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera , or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility . Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility . 
 The game has a meter that tracks Mustafa 's hope . As he completes tasks that take him towards the goal of escaping , the meter increases . Listening to the experiences of fellow detainees , which in some cases is required to gain access to other information or tasks , drains Mustafa 's hope . If he is caught breaking rules by the guards , Mustafa is placed in solitary confinement , which also drains hope . Should the hope meter run out , Mustafa loses the ability to continue to attempt an escape , and is deported . 
 = = Development = = 
 The idea for a video game centred on asylum seekers in Australia came to Katharine Neil , then an developer at Atari 's Melbourne studio , in the aftermath of the 2001 Tampa affair . Neil spent a year and a half assembling a team to work on the game and securing initial funding for the project . Fourteen people contributed to the game , with a core development team of four . Many of the Australian members of the development team , including Neil , contributed to the project anonymously to protect their jobs . 
 Neil stated that her motivation for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes . The purpose of the game , according to Neil , was twofold . The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia , and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task . At the time , the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner , and that they were a form of culture worth being taken seriously , had not caught on strongly . The game also was a statement against the Australian government 's attempts to suppress media access to , and coverage of , the detention facilities . 
 The original plan for Escape from Woomera involved several choices in playable detainees , each with a different story about how they came to seek asylum in Australia . The game would have players " battle the bureaucracy and try and survive day to day " while working towards any of several escape strategies . As originally envisioned , players could attempt to escape through the legal channels , using lawyers and activists , or could attempt to flee by scaling fences or digging tunnels . The development team worked to create the most realistic depiction of the Woomera centre possible , despite the media not being allowed in the facility . The team utilised interviews with former detainees and activists , existing press reports , and a copy of the facility 's floor plan obtained from a member of the Department of Immigration . Kate Wild , an investigative journalist hired by the development team to conduct research , was able to visit Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre . She witnessed guards using spotlights and helicopters to keep detainees awake throughout the night , and police on horseback trampling over tents . Aside from Woomera and Baxter , Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre and <unk> Immigration Detention Centre were also used as influences . Details from the daily lives of detainees , such as their being referred to by number and communicating with the outside world through payphones , were incorporated into the game . Tasks that players had to complete , as well as the escape strategies themselves , were also based on the experiences of real detainees . 
 Initial funding for the development of Escape from Woomera came from the Australian government 's arts funding organisation , the Australia Council for the Arts . The Australia Council gave the developers AUD $ 25 @,@ 000 , intended to get the game developed to the point that it could secure funding from other sources . While a playable section of the game was developed , the developers never received additional funding . The playable demo , which was built as a modification of the video game Half @-@ Life , was made available for download on the game 's website . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Australia Council 's decision to fund Escape from Woomera was poorly received . The game received heavy criticism before development even began . Australia 's Minister for Immigration , Philip Ruddock , released a statement saying that the " decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement , that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour " . Kate Wild , in a 2013 interview , recalled that she was surprised at how strongly Ruddock attacked the game , a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment . The leader of the Australian Human Rights Commission , Dr. Sev <unk> , released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of <unk> asylum seekers as criminals , and saying that " The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick . " Chairman Michael Snelling of the New Media Arts Board , the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money , defended the decision to fund Escape from Woomera , stating that the game 's purpose was not to promote crime . He characterised the team 's application for funding as both strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board 's goal of promoting cross @-@ disciplinary media . 
 In the 2010s , the retrospective view of Escape from Woomera is significantly more positive . In 2013 , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation called it " one of the first — and still one of the most important — politically @-@ focused videogames " . The textbook The Alternative Media Handbook used the game as a case study in culture jamming , and categorised it as an early example of video games carrying a political message . 
 = The Constant = 
 " The Constant " is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the American Broadcasting Company 's ( ABC ) serial drama television series Lost , and the 77th episode overall . It was broadcast on February 28 , 2008 , on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada . It was written by executive producer Carlton Cuse and co @-@ creator / executive producer Damon Lindelof and directed by executive producer Jack Bender . " The Constant " was watched by 15 million American viewers and is widely regarded as one of Lost 's best episodes . It was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards , a Directors Guild of America Award , and a Hugo Award . 
 In the episode , Desmond Hume ( played by Henry Ian Cusick ) and Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) are being flown by Frank Lapidus ( Jeff Fahey ) to the freighter where Lapidus ' mission is set . After going through turbulence , Desmond 's consciousness unexpectedly travels through time between 1996 and 2004 . The helicopter reaches the freighter and Sayid and Desmond are introduced to communications officer George Minkowski ( Fisher Stevens ) , who is " unstuck in time " like Desmond . The writers took twice the time expected to develop the episode 's script ; the biggest concern was the avoidance of a temporal paradox when dealing with time travel . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Desmond , Sayid and Lapidus experience turbulence while flying the 130 kilometers ( about 80 miles ) distance from the island where they were stranded to Lapidus ' team 's freighter , the Kahana . Desmond 's consciousness travels back eight years to 1996 , when he is serving with the British Army 's Royal Scots Regiment . Moments later , when his consciousness returns to the present day , he neither knows where he is nor recognizes his companions , and has no memory of his life since 1996 . After the helicopter lands , Desmond continues to jump between 1996 and 2004 . He is taken to the sick bay , where a man named Minkowski is strapped to a bed because he is experiencing similar problems . Minkowski explains that someone sabotaged the radio room two days earlier and that Desmond 's ex @-@ girlfriend Penny Widmore ( Sonya Walger ) has been trying to contact the freighter . Sayid uses the satellite phone to contact Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) on the island and explains that Desmond appears to have amnesia . Daniel Faraday ( Jeremy Davies ) , a physicist from the freighter , asks Jack whether Desmond has recently been exposed to a high level of radiation or electromagnetism . Jack is unsure , and so Daniel speaks to Desmond and asks him about his situation . Desmond responds that he believes that he is in 1996 and is serving with the Royal Scots . Faraday understands and tells Desmond that when he returns to 1996 , he needs to go to the physics department of The Queen 's College , Oxford University in England to meet with Daniel 's past self , and gives Desmond some mechanical settings to relay , along with an extra phrase that Daniel assures him will convince Daniel 's past self that the story is legitimate . 
 Desmond 's flashbacks become more frequent and longer . In 1996 , Desmond tracks down a younger Faraday at Oxford , who takes Desmond into his laboratory where he is experimenting with a time machine . Setting his electromagnetic device with the settings that Desmond has given him , Daniel places his laboratory rat , Eloise , in a maze and exposes her to electromagnetic energy . The rat appears to become comatose , then awakens and runs the maze . Daniel becomes excited because he had just built the maze and had not yet taught Eloise how to run it . Desmond realizes that , like the rat , he is caught in a time warp that is moving his consciousness between two different bodies at two different points in time and space . Eloise dies of a suspected brain aneurysm brought on by the exposure to the time lapse . Desmond becomes worried that he will die like Eloise , and Daniel instructs him to find something or someone — a constant — who is present in both times and can serve as an anchor for Desmond 's mental stability . Desmond decides that Penny can be the constant ; however , he must make contact with her in 2004 . To find out where she lives , Desmond gets her address from her father Charles ( Alan Dale ) , who is at an auction buying a journal owned by <unk> <unk> written by a crew member of the 19th century ship called the Black Rock . 
 In 1996 , Desmond finds Penny , who is still distraught over their break @-@ up and is not willing to see him . However , he gets her telephone number and tells her not to change it because he will call her on Christmas Eve 2004 . In 2004 , Sayid , Desmond , and Minkowski escape the sick bay and begin to repair the broken communications equipment . Meanwhile , Minkowski enters into another flashback , and dies . Showing signs of suffering the same fate as Minkowski , Desmond telephones Penny , who tells Desmond that she has been searching for him for the past three years and they reconcile before the power is cut off . Having made contact with his " constant " , Desmond stops alternating between 1996 and 2004 . Back on the island , Daniel flips through his journal and discovers a note that he had written , " If anything goes wrong , Desmond Hume will be my constant . "

 " The Constant " is the second Lost episode to deal directly with the concept of time travel after " Flashes Before Your Eyes " from the third season . While promoting that episode , Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device " in a way we never have before and never will again " and while promoting " The Constant " , he said that it " upholds that pledge , <unk> it , then <unk> it . " Lost 's writer @-@ producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel ; however , they were careful not to create a paradox . The rules for time @-@ travel in the series are outlined in " Flashes Before Your Eyes " — although , Lindelof has said that " The Constant " is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show — by Ms. Hawking ( Fionnula Flanagan ) , who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors . Had these rules not been established , the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened . The writers hoped that " The Constant " would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities . Lindelof reminisced that " just breaking that episode was such a massive headache " and Cuse added that " it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week " . 
 Cuse and Lindelof admitted they took some inspiration from the final episode of Star Trek : The Next Generation , " All Good Things ... " , where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames . The Lost writers compared Minkowski 's role to Q , as " someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist " . Faraday , on the other hand , was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction — as Lindelof put it , " He 's our Doc Brown here , who basically is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past " . Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write , " The Constant " took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories . Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Lost 's rules . Michio Kaku claimed that " the show 's producers did their homework " . According to Kaku , " there 's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel — just a lack of know @-@ how … [ but ] it would take a very advanced civilization to really do this " . Cuse stated that " we [ the writers ] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility " . " The Constant " was the first episode set on the Kahana , but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information — Lindelof has declared that " you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were in a constant state of crisis " . According to Lindelof , Desmond 's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter 's crew . 
 Shooting occurred in the second half of October 2007 . The scenes on the freighter in this and later episodes were filmed for several days on a freighter ten to fifteen minutes off the west coast of Oahu , Hawaii , where Lost is filmed . Instead of docking the ship and returning to the ocean each day , the actors and crew slept on the freighter in areas that were not being used for filming . The Oxford scenes were shot at St. Andrew 's Cathedral in Honolulu . In 1996 , Desmond has short hair and no facial hair and in 2004 , Desmond sports long and untamed hair with a full beard . Cusick did not cut his hair ; it was hidden underneath a short @-@ haired wig by " really talented hair and makeup folks " , according to Carlton Cuse . All freighter scenes were shot before Cusick shaved most of his beard for the 1996 scenes . A fake beard was glued onto Cusick for the episodes " Ji Yeon " and " Meet Kevin Johnson " while his beard grew back . The equations on Faraday 's chalkboard were written by a physicist who was hired as a consultant by the producers . The way the transitions between the 1996 and 2004 scenes would take place was frequently discussed during production . The producers took the advice of editor Mark Goldman , who suggested sudden cuts with " no fancy effect , and in some cases , no sound cut " , similar to the way " All Good Things ... " was edited . The original ending would set up the following episode by having Charlotte ( Rebecca Mader ) drop a bag containing a gas mask at Faraday 's feet . But the producers thought it did not work after the emotional scenes between Desmond and Penny , and decided to finish with Faraday reading his diary .

Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger said that " it was brilliantly executed , as both a brain @-@ twister and as a love story " with an " outstanding " performance by Jeremy Davies . Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as " the best single outing since season 1 's ' Walkabout ' " and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet @-@ to @-@ air season finale .

" The Constant " received high praise from IGN reviewer Chris Carabott calling it " a brilliantly executed hour of television " and " one of the finest episodes in the series " . He gave it 10 / 10 , tying it with " Pilot – Part One " and " Through the Looking Glass " as the best reviewed episode of Lost . LTG of Television Without Pity gave the episode an " A + " — the highest grade for any Lost episode . Erin Martell of AOL 's TV Squad loved the episode and its unique flashback structure . " The Constant " strengthened her love for Desmond and Penny 's story , saying " my heart won 't break if none of [ Jack , Kate , Sawyer and Juliet ] end up together [ but ] if Desmond and Penny don 't reunite , I will be devastated . " Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave " The Constant " an excellent review , saying that " my mind has never spun this fast after a Lost episode " and the writers have " really outdone themselves " and " do not get enough credit for constantly tinkering with their story structure " . Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post said that this " episode of Lost not only continued this season 's thrilling momentum ; it proved to fans that even in its fourth season , it still leaves us with our jaws hanging open … this was the make of possibly one of my favorite Lost episodes ever .

Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune wrote that " [ I was ] almost as touched and relieved by the reunion as Desmond and Penny are " ; however , she did not review " The Constant " as favorably as other critics , giving it an " A – " . Dan Compora of SyFy Portal gave " The Constant " a mixed review . He described it as " an entertaining episode [ with ] a fine acting performance by Henry Ian Cusick " , but criticized Desmond 's repetitive story arc , criticized Frank 's character , said that " Jeff Fahey is a fine actor , but so far , his character just hasn 't really evolved enough for me to care yet " and concluded , " this episode didn 't seem to really raise or answer anything of major importance , so I can 't help but feel that it was nothing more than mid @-@ season filler .

 = Multiple sequence alignment = 
 A multiple sequence alignment ( MSA ) is a sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences , generally protein , DNA , or RNA . In many cases , the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor . From the resulting MSA , sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences ' shared evolutionary origins . Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations ( single amino acid or nucleotide changes ) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column , and insertion or deletion mutations ( indels or gaps ) that appear as hyphens in one or more of the sequences in the alignment . Multiple sequence alignment is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains , tertiary and secondary structures , and even individual amino acids or nucleotides . 
 Multiple sequence alignment also refers to the process of aligning such a sequence set . Because three or more sequences of biologically relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time @-@ consuming to align by hand , computational algorithms are used to produce and analyze the alignments . MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than pairwise alignment because they are more computationally complex . Most multiple sequence alignment programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal alignment between more than a few sequences of moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive . 
 = = Dynamic programming and computational complexity = = 
 A direct method for producing an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique to identify the globally optimal alignment solution . For proteins , this method usually involves two sets of parameters : a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids ' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation . For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used , but a much simpler substitution matrix , wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered , is typical . The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix of positive and negative in the case of a global alignment , but must be both positive and negative , in the case of a local alignment . 
 For n individual sequences , the naive method requires constructing the n @-@ dimensional equivalent of the matrix formed in standard pairwise sequence alignment . The search space thus increases exponentially with increasing n and is also strongly dependent on sequence length . Expressed with the big O notation commonly used to measure computational complexity , a naïve MSA takes O ( <unk> ) time to produce . To find the global optimum for n sequences this way has been shown to be an NP @-@ complete problem . In 1989 , based on Carrillo @-@ Lipman Algorithm , Altschul introduced a practical method that uses pairwise alignments to constrain the n @-@ dimensional search space . In this approach pairwise dynamic programming alignments are performed on each pair of sequences in the query set , and only the space near the n @-@ dimensional intersection of these alignments is searched for the n @-@ way alignment . The MSA program optimizes the sum of all of the pairs of characters at each position in the alignment ( the so @-@ called sum of pair score ) and has been implemented in a software program for constructing multiple sequence alignments . 
 = = Progressive alignment construction = = 
 The most widely used approach to multiple sequence alignments uses a heuristic search known as progressive technique ( also known as the hierarchical or tree method ) developed by <unk> <unk> and Ben <unk> in 1984 . Progressive alignment builds up a final MSA by combining pairwise alignments beginning with the most similar pair and progressing to the most distantly related . All progressive alignment methods require two stages : a first stage in which the relationships between the sequences are represented as a tree , called a guide tree , and a second step in which the MSA is built by adding the sequences sequentially to the growing MSA according to the guide tree . The initial guide tree is determined by an efficient clustering method such as neighbor @-@ joining or <unk> , and may use distances based on the number of identical two letter sub @-@ sequences ( as in <unk> rather than a dynamic programming alignment ) . 
 Progressive alignments are not guaranteed to be globally optimal . The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA , these errors are then propagated through to the final result . Performance is also particularly bad when all of the sequences in the set are rather distantly related . Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors . This corrects for non @-@ random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program . 
 Progressive alignment methods are efficient enough to implement on a large scale for many ( 100s to 1000s ) sequences . Progressive alignment services are commonly available on publicly accessible web servers so users need not locally install the applications of interest . The most popular progressive alignment method has been the Clustal family , especially the weighted variant ClustalW to which access is provided by a large number of web portals including <unk> , EBI , and <unk> . Different portals or implementations can vary in user interface and make different parameters accessible to the user . ClustalW is used extensively for phylogenetic tree construction , in spite of the author 's explicit warnings that unedited alignments should not be used in such studies and as input for protein structure prediction by homology modeling . Current version of Clustal family is <unk> . EMBL @-@ EBI announced that <unk> will be expired in August 2015 . They recommend Clustal Omega which performs based on seeded guide trees and HMM profile @-@ profile techniques for protein alignments . They offer different MSA tools for progressive DNA alignments . One of them is <unk> ( Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform ) . 
 Another common progressive alignment method called T @-@ Coffee is slower than Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets . T @-@ Coffee calculates pairwise alignments by combining the direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence . It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program <unk> , which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences . The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used as a guide to produce new and more accurate weighting factors . 
 Because progressive methods are heuristics that are not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum , alignment quality can be difficult to evaluate and their true biological significance can be obscure . A semi @-@ progressive method that improves alignment quality and does not use a lossy heuristic while still running in polynomial time has been implemented in the program <unk> . 
 = = Iterative methods = = 
 A set of methods to produce MSAs while reducing the errors inherent in progressive methods are classified as " iterative " because they work similarly to progressive methods but repeatedly realign the initial sequences as well as adding new sequences to the growing MSA . One reason progressive methods are so strongly dependent on a high @-@ quality initial alignment is the fact that these alignments are always incorporated into the final result — that is , once a sequence has been aligned into the MSA , its alignment is not considered further . This approximation improves efficiency at the cost of accuracy . By contrast , iterative methods can return to previously calculated pairwise alignments or sub @-@ MSAs incorporating subsets of the query sequence as a means of optimizing a general objective function such as finding a high @-@ quality alignment score . 
 A variety of subtly different iteration methods have been implemented and made available in software packages ; reviews and comparisons have been useful but generally refrain from choosing a " best " technique . The software package <unk> / <unk> uses a hill @-@ climbing algorithm to optimize its MSA alignment score and iteratively corrects both alignment weights and locally divergent or " gappy " regions of the growing MSA . <unk> performs best when refining an alignment previously constructed by a faster method . 
 Another iterative program , <unk> , takes an unusual approach of focusing narrowly on local alignments between sub @-@ segments or sequence motifs without introducing a gap penalty . The alignment of individual motifs is then achieved with a matrix representation similar to a dot @-@ matrix plot in a pairwise alignment . An alternative method that uses fast local alignments as anchor points or " seeds " for a slower global @-@ alignment procedure is implemented in the CHAOS / <unk> suite . 
 A third popular iteration @-@ based method called <unk> ( multiple sequence alignment by log @-@ expectation ) improves on progressive methods with a more accurate distance measure to assess the relatedness of two sequences . The distance measure is updated between iteration stages ( although , in its original form , <unk> contained only 2 @-@ 3 iterations depending on whether refinement was enabled ) . 
 = = Consensus methods = = 
 Consensus methods attempt to find the optimal multiple sequence alignment given multiple different alignments of the same set of sequences . There are two commonly used consensus methods , M @-@ <unk> and MergeAlign . M @-@ <unk> uses multiple sequence alignments generated by seven different methods to generate consensus alignments . MergeAlign is capable of generating consensus alignments from any number of input alignments generated using different models of sequence evolution or different methods of multiple sequence alignment . The default option for MergeAlign is to infer a consensus alignment using alignments generated using 91 different models of protein sequence evolution . 
 = = Hidden Markov models = = 
 Hidden Markov models are probabilistic models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps , matches , and mismatches to determine the most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs . HMMs can produce a single highest @-@ scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance . HMMs can produce both global and local alignments . Although HMM @-@ based methods have been developed relatively recently , they offer significant improvements in computational speed , especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions . 
 Typical HMM @-@ based methods work by representing an MSA as a form of directed acyclic graph known as a partial @-@ order graph , which consists of a series of nodes representing possible entries in the columns of an MSA . In this representation a column that is absolutely conserved ( that is , that all the sequences in the MSA share a particular character at a particular position ) is coded as a single node with as many outgoing connections as there are possible characters in the next column of the alignment . In the terms of a typical hidden Markov model , the observed states are the individual alignment columns and the " hidden " states represent the presumed ancestral sequence from which the sequences in the query set are hypothesized to have descended . An efficient search variant of the dynamic programming method , known as the <unk> algorithm , is generally used to successively align the growing MSA to the next sequence in the query set to produce a new MSA . This is distinct from progressive alignment methods because the alignment of prior sequences is updated at each new sequence addition . However , like progressive methods , this technique can be influenced by the order in which the sequences in the query set are integrated into the alignment , especially when the sequences are distantly related . 
 Several software programs are available in which variants of HMM @-@ based methods have been implemented and which are noted for their scalability and efficiency , although properly using an HMM method is more complex than using more common progressive methods . The simplest is POA ( Partial @-@ Order Alignment ) ; a similar but more generalized method is implemented in the packages SAM ( Sequence Alignment and Modeling System ) . and <unk> . SAM has been used as a source of alignments for protein structure prediction to participate in the CASP structure prediction experiment and to develop a database of predicted proteins in the yeast species S. cerevisiae . <unk> is a software package for the detection of remotely related protein sequences based on the pairwise comparison of HMMs . A server running <unk> ( <unk> ) was by far the fastest of the 10 best automatic structure prediction servers in the CASP7 and <unk> structure prediction competitions . 
 = = Genetic algorithms and simulated annealing = = 
 Standard optimization techniques in computer science — both of which were inspired by , but do not directly reproduce , physical processes — have also been used in an attempt to more efficiently produce quality MSAs . One such technique , genetic algorithms , has been used for MSA production in an attempt to broadly simulate the hypothesized evolutionary process that gave rise to the divergence in the query set . The method works by breaking a series of possible MSAs into fragments and repeatedly rearranging those fragments with the introduction of gaps at varying positions . A general objective function is optimized during the simulation , most generally the " sum of pairs " maximization function introduced in dynamic programming @-@ based MSA methods . A technique for protein sequences has been implemented in the software program SAGA ( Sequence Alignment by Genetic Algorithm ) and its equivalent in RNA is called <unk> . 
 The technique of simulated annealing , by which an existing MSA produced by another method is refined by a series of rearrangements designed to find better regions of alignment space than the one the input alignment already occupies . Like the genetic algorithm method , simulated annealing maximizes an objective function like the sum @-@ of @-@ pairs function . Simulated annealing uses a metaphorical " temperature factor " that determines the rate at which rearrangements proceed and the likelihood of each rearrangement ; typical usage alternates periods of high rearrangement rates with relatively low likelihood ( to explore more distant regions of alignment space ) with periods of lower rates and higher likelihoods to more thoroughly explore local minima near the newly " colonized " regions . This approach has been implemented in the program <unk> ( Multiple Sequence Alignment by Simulated Annealing ) . 
 = = Phylogeny @-@ aware methods = = 
 Most multiple sequence alignment methods try to minimize the number of insertions / deletions ( gaps ) and , as a consequence , produce compact alignments . This causes several problems if the sequences to be aligned contain non @-@ homologous regions , if gaps are informative in a phylogeny analysis . These problems are common in newly produced sequences that are poorly annotated and may contain frame @-@ shifts , wrong domains or non @-@ homologous spliced exons . 
 The first such method was developed in 2005 by <unk> and Goldman . The same authors released a software package called PRANK in 2008 . PRANK improves alignments when insertions are present . Nevertheless , it runs slowly compared to progressive and / or iterative methods which have been developed for several years . 
 In 2012 , two new phylogeny @-@ aware tools appeared . One is called <unk> that was developed by the same team as PRANK . The other is <unk> developed by <unk> . Both software packages were developed independently but share common features , notably the use of graph algorithms to improve the recognition of non @-@ homologous regions , and an improvement in code making these software faster than PRANK . 
 = = Motif finding = = 
 Motif finding , also known as profile analysis , is a method of locating sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs . A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed , but all are based on identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a substitution matrix that reflects the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in the putative motif . The alignment can then be refined using these matrices . In standard profile analysis , the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps . Alternatively , statistical pattern @-@ finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA rather than as a derivation . In many cases when the query set contains only a small number of sequences or contains only highly related sequences , <unk> are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix . In particular , this corrects zero @-@ probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero . 
 Blocks analysis is a method of motif finding that restricts motifs to <unk> regions in the alignment . Blocks can be generated from an MSA or they can be extracted from unaligned sequences using a precalculated set of common motifs previously generated from known gene families . Block scoring generally relies on the spacing of high @-@ frequency characters rather than on the calculation of an explicit substitution matrix . The <unk> server provides an interactive method to locate such motifs in unaligned sequences . 
 Statistical pattern @-@ matching has been implemented using both the expectation @-@ maximization algorithm and the Gibbs sampler . One of the most common motif @-@ finding tools , known as <unk> , uses expectation maximization and hidden Markov methods to generate motifs that are then used as search tools by its companion MAST in the combined suite <unk> / MAST . 
 = = Non @-@ Coding Multiple Sequence Alignment = = 
 Non @-@ coding DNA regions , especially <unk> , are rather more conserved and not necessarily evolutionarily related , and may have converged from non @-@ common ancestors . Thus , the assumptions used to align protein sequences and DNA coding regions are inherently different from those that hold for TFBS sequences . Although it is meaningful to align DNA coding regions for homologous sequences using mutation operators , alignment of binding site sequences for the same transcription factor cannot rely on evolutionary related mutation operations . Similarly , the evolutionary operator of point mutations can be used to define an edit distance for coding sequences , but this has little meaning for TFBS sequences because any sequence variation has to maintain a certain level of specificity for the binding site to function . This becomes specifically important when trying to align known TFBS sequences to build supervised models to predict unknown locations of the same TFBS . Hence , Multiple Sequence Alignment methods need to adjust the underlying evolutionary hypothesis and the operators used as in the work published incorporating neighbouring base thermodynamic information to align the binding sites searching for the lowest thermodynamic alignment conserving specificity of the binding site , <unk> . 
 = = Alignment visualization and quality control = = 
 The necessary use of heuristics for multiple alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins , there is always a good chance that an alignment will contain errors . For example , an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the <unk> benchmark found that at least 24 % of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned . These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences , or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone . As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms . Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed , often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences . Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these ( usually minor ) errors , in order to obtain an optimal ' curated ' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling . 
 However , as the number of sequences increases and especially in genome @-@ wide studies that involve many MSAs it is impossible to manually curate all alignments . Furthermore , manual curation is subjective . And finally , even the best expert cannot confidently align the more ambiguous cases of highly diverged sequences . In such cases it is common practice to use automatic procedures to exclude <unk> aligned regions from the MSA . For the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction ( see below ) the <unk> program is widely used to remove alignment blocks suspect of low quality , according to various cutoffs on the number of gapped sequences in alignment columns . However , these criteria may excessively filter out regions with insertion / deletion events that may still be aligned reliably , and these regions might be desirable for other purposes such as detection of positive selection . A few alignment algorithms output site @-@ specific scores that allow the selection of high @-@ confidence regions . Such a service was first offered by the SOAP program , which tests the robustness of each column to perturbation in the parameters of the popular alignment program <unk> . The T @-@ Coffee program uses a library of alignments in the construction of the final MSA , and its output MSA is colored according to confidence scores that reflect the agreement between different alignments in the library regarding each aligned residue . Its extension , TCS : ( Transitive Consistency Score ) , uses T @-@ Coffee libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA . <unk> projections can be produced using fast or slow methods , thus allowing a trade @-@ off between speed and accuracy . Another alignment program that can output an MSA with confidence scores is FSA , which uses a statistical model that allows calculation of the uncertainty in the alignment . The <unk> ( Heads @-@ Or @-@ Tails ) score can be used as a measure of site @-@ specific alignment uncertainty due to the existence of multiple co @-@ optimal solutions . The <unk> program calculates a similar site @-@ specific confidence measure based on the robustness of the alignment to uncertainty in the guide tree that is used in progressive alignment programs . An alternative , more statistically justified approach to assess alignment uncertainty is the use of probabilistic evolutionary models for joint estimation of phylogeny and alignment . A Bayesian approach allows calculation of posterior probabilities of estimated phylogeny and alignment , which is a measure of the confidence in these estimates . In this case , a posterior probability can be calculated for each site in the alignment . Such an approach was implemented in the program <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 There free available programs for visualization of multiple sequence alignments : <unk> , <unk> . 
 = = Use in phylogenetics = = 
 Multiple sequence alignments can be used to create a phylogenetic tree . This is made possible by two reasons . The first is because functional domains that are known in annotated sequences can be used for alignment in non @-@ annotated sequences . The other is that conserved regions known to be functionally important can be found . This makes it possible for multiple sequence alignments to be used to analyze and find evolutionary relationships through homology between sequences . Point mutations and insertion or deletion events ( called indels ) can be detected . 
 Multiple sequence alignments can also be used to identify functionally important sites , such as binding sites , active sites , or sites corresponding to other key functions , by locating conserved domains . When looking at multiple sequence alignments , it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences . These aspects include identity , similarity , and homology . Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions . On the other hand , similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively . For example , in terms of nucleotide sequences , pyrimidines are considered similar to each other , as are purines . Similarity ultimately leads to homology , in that the more similar sequences are , the closer they are to being homologous . This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry .

 = The Naturalist on the River Amazons = 
 The Naturalist on the River Amazons , subtitled A Record of the Adventures , Habits of Animals , Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life , and Aspects of Nature under the Equator , during Eleven Years of Travel , is an 1863 book by the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his expedition to the Amazon basin . Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection , as well as exotic specimens to sell . He explored thousands of miles of the Amazon and its tributaries , and collected over 14 @,@ 000 species , of which 8 @,@ 000 were new to science . His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry . 
 The book contains an evenly distributed mixture of natural history , travel , and observation of human societies , including the towns with their Catholic processions . Only the most remarkable discoveries of animals and plants are described , and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned . Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start ; he also describes animal behaviour , sometimes in detail , as for the army ants . He constantly relates the wildlife to the people , explaining how the people hunt , what they eat and what they use as medicines . The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson , Josiah Wood Whymper , Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker . 
 On Bates 's return to England , he was encouraged by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven @-@ year stay in the Amazon as a book . The result was widely admired , not least by Darwin ; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book 's support for evolution , but generally enjoyed his account of the journey , scenery , people , and natural history . The book has been reprinted many times , mostly in Bates 's own effective abridgement for the second edition , which omitted the more technical descriptions . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The first edition , in 1863 , was long and full of technical description . The second edition , in 1864 , was abridged , with most of the technical description removed , making for a shorter and more readable book which has been reprinted many times . Bates prefaced the 1864 edition by writing 
 Having been urged to prepare a new edition of this work for a wider circle than that contemplated in the former one , I have thought it advisable to condense those portions which , treating of abstruse scientific questions , presuppose a larger amount of Natural History knowledge than an author has a right to expect of the general reader . 
 An unabridged edition was reissued only after 30 years , in 1892 ; it appeared together with a ' memoir ' of Bates by Edward Clodd .

 = = Approach = = 
 In 1847 , Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace , both in their early twenties , agreed that they would jointly make a collecting trip to the Amazon " towards solving the problem of origin of species " . They had been inspired by reading the American entomologist William Henry Edwards 's pioneering 1847 book A Voyage Up the River Amazon , with a residency at Pará . 
 Neither had much money , so they determined to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens of birds and insects . Both made extensive travels — in different parts of the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections , especially of insects . Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years ; on the voyage , his ship caught fire , and his collection was destroyed ; undeterred , he set out again , leading eventually ( 1869 ) to a comparable book , The Malay Archipelago . By the time he came home in November 1859 , Bates had collected over 14 @,@ 000 species , of which 8 @,@ 000 were new to science . His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to describe what is now called Batesian mimicry , where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species . Bates 's account of his stay , including observations of nature and the people around him , occupies his book . 
 In the abridged version , there is a balance between descriptions of places and adventures , and the wildlife seen there . The style is accurate , but vivid and direct : 
 The house lizards belong to a peculiar family , the <unk> , and are found even in the best @-@ kept chambers , most frequently on the walls and ceilings , to which they cling motionless by day , being active only at night . They are of speckled grey or ashy colours . The structure of their feet is beautifully adapted for clinging to and running over smooth surfaces ; the underside of their toes being expanded into cushions , beneath which folds of skin form a series of flexible plates . By means of this apparatus they can walk or run across a smooth ceiling with their backs downwards ; the plated soles , by quick muscular action , exhausting and admitting air alternately . The <unk> are very repulsive in appearance . 
 The book begins and ends suddenly . The journey out , as reviewer Joseph James observes , is dismissed in a few words . The last few lines of the book run : 
 On the 6th of June , when in 7 ° 55 ' N. <unk> and 52 ° 30 ' W. long . , and therefore about 400 miles from the mouth of the main Amazons , we passed numerous patches of floating grass mingled with tree @-@ trunks and withered foliage . Amongst these masses I espied many fruits of that peculiarly Amazonian tree the <unk> palm ; this was the last I saw of the Great River . 
 = = Illustrations = = 
 There are 39 illustrations , some of animals and plants , some of human topics such as the " Masked @-@ dance and wedding @-@ feast of <unk> Indians " , which is signed by Josiah Wood Whymper . Some illustrations including " Turtle Fishing and Adventure with Alligator " are by the German illustrator Johann Baptist Zwecker ; some , such as " Bird @-@ Killing Spider ( <unk> <unk> ) Attacking Finches " are by E.W. Robinson ; others by the zoological artist Joseph Wolf . 
 = = Chapters = = 
 The structure of the readable , cut @-@ down second edition of 1864 is as follows : 
 1 Pará — arrival , aspect of the country , etc . ( now the city of Belém ) 
 Bates arrives , and at once starts learning about the country 's peoples and natural history . 
 The impressions received during this first walk can never wholly fade from my mind ... Amongst them were several handsome women , dressed in a slovenly manner , barefoot or shod in loose slippers ; but <unk> richly @-@ decorated ear @-@ rings , and around their necks strings of very large gold beads . They had dark expressive eyes , and remarkably rich heads of hair . It was a mere fancy , but I thought the mingled squalor , luxuriance and beauty of these women were pointedly in harmony with the rest of the scene ; so striking , in the view , was the mixture of natural riches and human poverty . 
 He soon notices and describes the leafcutter ants . He stays in Pará for 18 months , making short trips into the interior ; the city is clean and safe compared to others in Brazil . 
 2 Pará — the swampy forests , etc . 
 Bates takes a house a few miles outside town on the edge of the forest , and soon starts to notice butterflies and climbing palms . He settles in to a routine of collecting during the day , and making notes and preparing specimens in the evening . At first he is disappointed by how few signs there are of larger animals such as monkeys , tapir or jaguar . Later he realizes these do exist , but are widely scattered and very shy . He meets a landowner who complains of the high price of slaves . There are colossal trees with buttressed trunks . 
 3 Pará — religious holidays , marmoset monkeys , serpents , insects 
 He witnesses Catholic processions , notably the festival for Our Lady of Nazareth at Pará . He describes the few monkeys that can be seen in the area , and the strange Amphisbaena , a legless lizard . There are beautiful Morpho butterflies of different species , and assorted spiders , including " monstrous " hairy ones . 
 4 The Tocantins and <unk> 
 Bates and Wallace travel up the Tocantins river , hiring a two @-@ masted boat , a crew of three , and taking provisions for three months . At <unk> he is astonished to be shown a young man 's books including Virgil , Terence , Cicero and Livy : " an unexpected sight , a classical library in a mud @-@ plastered and palm @-@ thatched hut on the banks of the Tocantins " . Their host kills an ox in their honour , but Bates is kept awake by swarms of rats and cockroaches . They see the <unk> macaw which can crush hard palm nuts with its beak , and two species of freshwater dolphin , one new to science . Bates visits <unk> ; Wallace goes to explore the <unk> and <unk> rivers . The large bird @-@ eating spider ( Mygalomorphae ) has urticating hairs : Bates handles the first specimen " incautiously , and I suffered terribly for three days " . He sees some children leading one with a cord around its waist like a dog . On the return journey , the boat with his baggage leaves before him ; when he catches up with it , he finds it " leaking at all points " . 
 5 <unk> and the Bay of Marajó 
 Bates stays three months in an old mansion on the coast , going insect @-@ hunting with a German who lives in the woods . His room is full of four species of bat : one leaf @-@ nosed bat , <unk> , bites him on the hip : " This was rather unpleasant " . He finds stewed giant anteater delicious , like goose . Several times he shoots hummingbird hawkmoths , mistaking them for hummingbirds . He catches a pale brown tree snake 4 ft 8 in ( 140 cm ) long , but only 1 / 4 in ( <unk> ) thick , and a pale green one 6 ft ( 180 cm ) long " <unk> amidst the foliage " . When he has shot all the game around his house , he goes hunting with a neighbour by canoe , getting some agouti and <unk> rodents . 
 6 The Lower Amazons — Pará to Obydos ( now the city of Óbidos ) 
 He describes how travellers went upriver before the steamboats arrived , and gives a history of earlier explorations of the Amazons . His preparations for the voyage to Obydos include household goods , provisions , ammunition , boxes , books and " a hundredweight ( 50 kg ) of copper money " . There are many species of palms along a river channel . A rare species of alligator and the armoured <unk> fish are caught . Obydos is a pleasant town of 1200 people , on cliffs of pink and yellow clays , surrounded by cocoa plantations with four kinds of monkey and the huge Morpho <unk> butterfly up to 8 in ( 20 cm ) across , as well as slow @-@ flying Heliconius butterflies in great numbers . He obtains a musical cricket , <unk> <unk> . 
 7 The Lower Amazons — Obydos to <unk> , or the Barra of the Rio Negro 
 Bates leaves Obydos ; he finds the people lazy , as otherwise they could easily become comfortable with mixed farming . They sail through a tremendous storm . He finds a <unk> grasshopper whose forewings perfectly resemble leaves , the Victoria waterlily , masses of ticks , the howler monkey and large Morpho butterflies . He meets Wallace again at Barra . Back in Para , he catches yellow fever . 
 8 Santarem 
 He describes Santarem and the customs of its people . He goes on short " excursions " around the little town . The pure " Indians " choose to build light open shelters , resting inside in hammocks , whereas those of mixed or African origin build more substantial mud huts . He enjoys watching small pale green <unk> and other kinds of sand wasps . He regrets that the people cut down the <unk> <unk> palm to harvest its fruits , which yield a milky , nutty beverage . He describes some potter wasps and mason bees . He meets a " <unk> " or witch who knows the uses of many plants , but remarks that " the Indian men all become sceptics after a little intercourse with the whites " and that her witchcraft " was of a very weak quality " though others have more dangerous tricks . 
 9 Voyage up the <unk> 
 Bates hires a boat made of <unk> for a three month trip up the <unk> river . He prepares for the trip by salting meat , grinding coffee , and placing all the food in tin boxes to keep insects and damp out . He buys trade @-@ goods such as fishhooks , axes , knives and beads . He witnesses poison @-@ fishing using lianas of <unk> pinnata . At Point <unk> he finds a line of dead fire @-@ ants , " an inch or two in height and breadth " , washed up on the shore " without interruption for miles " . Terrible wounds are inflicted by the stingray and the piranha . His men make a canoe from a trunk of the <unk> tree , and an anaconda steals two chickens from a cage on his boat ; the snake is " only 18 feet nine inches ( 6 metres ) in length " . Becoming weak from a diet of fish , he eats a spider monkey , finding it delicious . They notice the river is gently tidal , 530 miles ( 850 km ) from its mouth , " a proof of the extreme flatness of the land " . Bates is unimpressed by a homeopathy @-@ crazed priest , especially when his pills prove useless against fever . 
 10 The Upper Amazons — Voyage to Ega ( now the city of <unk> ) 
 He sails from Barra ( continuing the story from Chapter 7 ) to Ega . In <unk> ( the Upper Amazons ) the soil is clay , alluvium or deep humus , with rich vegetation . They catch a manatee ( sea cow ) which tastes like coarse pork with greenish , fish @-@ flavoured fat , and he is badly bitten by small " <unk> " bloodsucking flies . Pieces of pumice have floated 1200 miles ( 1900 km ) from the Andes volcanoes . Bates observes a large landslip on which masses of giant forest trees rock to and fro . He notes there are discomforts but " scarcely any danger from wild animals " . He becomes desperate for intellectual society , running out of reading matter , even the advertisements in the Athenaeum journal . He describes the food and fruits at Ega , and the curious seasons , with two wet and two dry seasons each year , the river thus rising and falling twice . The people regularly eat turtles . 
 11 Excursions in the Neighbourhood of Ega 
 Bates goes hunting with a native , who brings down a crested <unk> with a blowpipe at a range of 30 yards ( 27 metres ) ; he notes that the usefully silent weapon can kill at twice that range , but that he and Wallace " found it very difficult to hold steady the long tubes " . Around a campfire , he listens to tales ; the <unk> or river dolphin used to take " the shape of a beautiful woman , with hair hanging loose to her heels , and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega , to entice the young men down to the water " where the <unk> would grab them and " plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry " . They go turtle @-@ hunting ; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick . He finds many footprints of the jaguar , and " the great pleasure " of seeing the " rare and curious umbrella bird " . Arrived in <unk> , he admires a woman of 17 : " her figure was almost faultless " , and her blue mouth " gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance " , but she was " extremely bashful " . He is amazed at how much alcohol the " shy Indian and <unk> maidens " can drink , never giving way to their suitors without it . 
 12 Animals of the Neighbourhood of Ega 
 Having discovered over 3000 new species at Ega , Bates agrees that discovery " forms but a small item in the interest belonging to the study of the living creation . " He describes the scarlet @-@ faced and other monkeys , " a curious animal " , the kinkajou , bats , and <unk> . He found 18 species " of true Papilio ( swallowtail ) butterflies and about 550 butterfly species in all at Ega , among over 7000 species of insect . He describes some unusual insects and their behaviour , including a moth which suspends its cocoon on a long strong silk thread , which while conspicuous is hard for birds to attack . He describes at length various species of Eciton or army ants , noting that confused accounts of these have appeared in travel books , then copied into natural histories . 
 13 Excursions beyond Ega 
 In November 1856 Bates travels on a steamboat from Ega upriver to <unk> ; it travels all night despite the thick darkness , and makes the 240 miles ( 380 km ) in four days , with the captain at the wheel almost the whole time . He is delighted to discover a new butterfly , <unk> excelsior , the largest of its genus . He finds the forest at St Paulo glorious , writing that five years would not be enough " to exhaust the treasures of its neighbourhood in Zoology and Botany " : 
 At mid @-@ day the vertical sun penetrates into the gloomy depths of this romantic spot , lighting up the leafy banks of the rivulet and its clean sandy margins , where numbers of scarlet , green , and black tanagers and brightly @-@ coloured butterflies sport about in the stray beams . Sparkling brooks , large and small , traverse the glorious forest ...

 = = = Contemporary reviews = = = 
 = = = = Charles Darwin = = = = 
 Charles Darwin , having encouraged Bates to publish an account of his travels , read The Naturalist on the River Amazons with great pleasure , writing to Bates on 18 April 1863 that 
 My criticisms may be condensed into a single sentence , namely that it is the best book of Natural History Travels ever published in England . Your style seems to me admirable . Nothing can be better than the discussion on the struggle for existence & nothing better than the descriptions on the Forest scenery . It is a grand book , & whether or not it sells quickly it will last . You have spoken out boldly on Species ; & boldness on this subject seems to get rarer & rarer . — How beautifully illustrated it is . The cut on the back is most tasteful . I heartily congratulate you on its publication . 
 Darwin noted in his letter that Athenaeum magazine reviewed the book coldly and <unk> , while the Reader received it warmly . Darwin published An Appreciation of the book in the Natural History Review in 1863 , in which he notes that Bates sent back " a mass of specimens " of " no less than 14 @,@ 712 species " ( mostly of insects ) , of which 8000 were new to science . Darwin at once observes that although Bates is " no mean authority " on insects , the book is not limited to them , but ranges over natural history and more widely to describe his " adventures during his journeyings up and down the mighty river " . Darwin clearly enjoyed Bates 's account of the <unk> macaw , calling it a " splendid bird " with its " enormous beak " able to feed on <unk> palm nuts , and quoting Bates : " which are so hard as to be difficult to break with a heavy hammer , are crushed to a pulp by the powerful beak of this Macaw . " Darwin took the opportunity to hit back at the Athenaeum magazine which had criticised Bates 's book , at the same time painting a picture of Bates 's lonely life in the rainforest : 
 Mr. Bates must indeed have been driven to great straits as regards his mental food , when , as he tells us , he took to reading the Athenaeum three times over , " the first time devouring the more interesting articles — the second , the whole of the remainder — and the third , reading all the advertisements from beginning to end . 
 Darwin notes that " We need hardly say that Mr. Bates ... is a zealous advocate of the hypothesis of the origin of species by derivation from a common stock " , in other words that Bates was a staunch Darwinian . Darwin was happy to have the Naturalist on his side , and to use the book in the Origin of Species debate which was still heated in 1863 . In particular , Darwin was struck by Bates 's robust evidence of mimicry in " the Butterflies of the genus Heliconius " . Here Darwin quotes nearly a whole page from Bates 's conclusions , including Bates 's view of his own findings that hint at speciation actually in progress : 
 The facts just given are therefore of some scientific importance , for they tend to show that a physiological species can be and is produced in nature out of the varieties of a pre @-@ existing closely allied one . This is not an isolated case ... But in very few has it happened that the species which clearly appears to be the parent , co @-@ exists with one that has been evidently derived from it . 
 = = = = London Quarterly Review = = = = 
 The London Quarterly Review began with the observation that " When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of the best years of his life in any district , we may be pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading " . The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable , and free of the usual " personal twaddle " of travel and adventure books . The reviewer also remarks on Bates 's subtitle " ... of the origin of species " , that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully . In the reviewer 's opinion , Bates says little about " the Darwinian hypothesis " , focusing instead steadily on natural history , while making " very shrewd remarks " about human society and giving " most glowing " descriptions of tropical scenery . The reviewer notes that most of the people Bates meets " had a tinge of colour " but made the " lonely Englishman " comfortable with their " winning cordiality " , and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist , complete with insect @-@ net , hunting @-@ bag , pincushion , and an old pair of spectacles . As for nature , the reviewer considers that " in Brazil man is oppressed , crushed , by the immensity of nature " . 
 Bates 's occasional hints at Darwinian evolution are unwelcome or misunderstood by the reviewer , as when Bates writes that if a kind of seed is found in two places , we have to " come to the strange conclusion " it has been created twice unless we can show it can be carried that far ; but the reviewer finds Bates in " too great a hurry to come to conclusions " ( sic ) . The reviewer , too , objects to Bates 's illustration of " transition forms between Heliconius Melpomene and H. <unk> , which he thinks are no more different than " a couple of Dorking hens " . Bates 's assumption that all forest animals are adapted to forest life is rejected by the reviewer , who sees the same features as signs of a beneficent Creator ; while his mention of " slow adaptation of the fauna of a forest @-@ clad country throughout an immense lapse of geological time " is criticised for being " haunted " by this " spectre of time " . However the reviewer is fascinated by the variety of life described in the book , and by Bates 's " rapturous manner " of speaking about how delicious monkey flesh is , which " almost puts a premium on cannibalism " . The review concludes " not without regret " ( at such an enjoyable book ) , and assures readers " that they will not find him heavy reading " ; supposes that 11 years was " perhaps a little too much " of tropical life ; and recommends intending museum curators to try it for " a year or two " . 
 = = = = Joseph F. James = = = = 
 An unabridged edition was reviewed by botanist and geologist Joseph F. James ( 1857 @-@ 1897 ) in Science in 1893 . James was reviewing a book which was at that time already a 30 @-@ year @-@ old classic that had been reprinted at least four times . He compared it to Gilbert White 's 1789 The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne , Darwin 's Voyage of the Beagle , and Alfred Russel Wallace 's The Malay Archipelago , writing that 
 No one can err , we believe , in placing Bates 's " Naturalist on the River Amazons " among the foremost books of travel of this age ; and no one who has read it , but recalls its graphic pages with delight . 
 James notes that " on the appearance of the book in 1868 it met with cordial praise from all quarters " . Despite his professed liking for Bates 's " direct and concise " style , he quotes at length Bates ' description of the tropics , with the 
 whirring of cicadas , the shrill stridulation of a vast number and variety of field @-@ crickets and grasshoppers , each species sounding its peculiar note ; the plaintive <unk> of tree @-@ frogs , - all blended together in one continuous ringing sound , - the audible expression of the teeming profusion of nature . " 
 James spends much space in his review quoting Bates 's account of the strangling fig , called the " Murderer Liana or <unk> " , which he uses to emphasize the " struggle for existence " between plants , as much as for animals . Bates explains how the fig grows rings around the " victim " tree , which eventually dies , leaving the " selfish parasite clasping in its arms the lifeless and decaying body of its victim " , so that the fig itself must quickly flower , fruit and die when its support fails . James observes that " It is as much in the reflections that the varied phenomena under observation give rise to as in the descriptive portions that the value and charm of the book lie . " Unable to resist a final quotation , even after admitting he has " overstepped our space " , he cites Bates 's description of his last night in the " country of perpetual summer " , regretting he will have to live again in England with its " gloomy winters " and " factory chimneys " ; but after Bates has returned , he rediscovers " how incomparably superior is civilized life " which can nourish " feelings , tastes and intellect " . 
 = = = Modern assessment = = = 
 = = = = New Yorker = = = = 
 In 1988 , Alex Shoumatoff , writing in The New Yorker , makes Bates 's Naturalist his choice if he were allowed only one book for a tropical journey . In his view , it is " the basic text " and a monument of scientific travel writing . Shoumatoff had in fact spent eight months in Bates 's " glorious forest " ( he quotes ) with a copy in his backpack ; he thus admires Bates 's acceptance of the inevitable discomfort and homesickness from personal knowledge , noting that Bates only complained when all the following had occurred together : he had been robbed , he had gone barefoot having worn out his shoes , he had received no parcels from England , and worst of all he had nothing left to read . But otherwise Bates was " lost in wonder " at the astonishing diversity of the natural history of the Amazons . He was , writes Shoumatoff , one of the four largely self @-@ educated geniuses who pioneered tropical biology , and who all knew each other : Darwin , Wallace , Bates , and the botanist Richard Spruce . 
 Shoumatoff observes that " Reading Bates is an emotional experience for someone who has travelled in Amazonia , because much of what he describes so poignantly is no longer there " ; that the " charm and the genius " of the book is that Bates covers both natural history and everything else that is going on — as the subtitle so accurately says , " A Record of Adventures , Habits of Animals , Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life , and Aspects of Nature Under the Equator , During Eleven Years of Travel . " 
 He feels a dreamy quality in the best of Bates 's writing , as when he meets a boa constrictor : " On seeing me the reptile suddenly turned , and glided at an accelerated rate down the path . ... The rapidly moving and shining body looked like a stream of brown liquid flowing over the thick bed of fallen leaves . " However he is less impressed with Bates 's remarks about the " intellectual inferiority " of the natives , and observes that Bates was wrong about the fertility of tropical soils , which are often poor : the luxuriant growth results from rapid recycling of nutrients . He celebrates the " famous closing passage " of the book , where Bates expresses his " deep misgivings " about returning to England , and writes that recent " progress " in the Amazon is just as shocking . 
 = = = = John G.T. Anderson = = = = 
 In 2011 John G.T. Anderson chose to " recommend the reader ’ s attention " to Bates ' Naturalist in the Journal of Natural History Education and Experience , writing that 
 As much as I love Wallace , I feel that Bates is far and away the better storyteller of the pair , with a keen eye for landscapes , species , and peoples . 
 Anderson writes that Bates threw himself eagerly into the local culture , writing warmly about the people as well as delighting in everything from the odd to the mundane " in a modest yet engaging style that leaves this reader itching to go and see for himself . " Noting that Bates collected over 8 @,@ 000 species on the trip , the book shows , writes Anderson , how this was achieved : 
 the discomfort of narrow canoes , the encounters with alligators and giant spiders , drinking burning rum around a campfire while waiting for jaguars , and above all else the sheer fun and intense joy of seeing new things in new places through eyes of a keen observer and master storyteller ..

 The Zoological Society of London writes that " This fascinating , lucidly written book is widely regarded as one of the greatest reports of natural history travels . " It describes the book as " an eloquently written compendium of curious natural facts and observations on Amazon life before the rubber boom , revealing the amazing zoological and botanical richness of the region " and calls his specimens " a hugely significant contribution to zoological discovery .

 Bates 's book is cited in papers for its accurate early observations , such as of the urticating hairs of tarantulas , the puddle drinking habits of butterflies , or of the rich insect fauna in the tropics . The book and Bates ' Amazon trip are covered in lecture courses on evolution . The warm reception of Bates 's Naturalist was not confined to scientists . The novelists D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell both wrote admiringly of the book . Lawrence wrote to his friend S. S. <unk> " I should like , from the Everyman Library Bates ' – Naturalist on the Amazon ... because I intend some day to go to South America – to Peru or Ecuador , not the Amazon . But I know Bates is good . "

 = 2009 Palma Nova bombing = 
 The 2009 Palma Nova bombing occurred on July 30 , 2009 when a limpet bomb went off outside a Civil Guard barracks in the town of Palma Nova , Majorca , Spain . The bomb was placed under a patrol car and two Civil Guard officers died as a result of the explosion . A second device was found under another Civil Guard vehicle at nearby barracks and safely exploded by police . On August 9 , the Basque nationalist and separatist organisation ETA claimed responsibility for the attack , while four other bombs exploded around restaurants and shopping centres in Palma , Majorca , causing no injuries . 
 The bombing was ETA 's first attack in Majorca since it tried to kill King Juan Carlos I in the summer of 1995 , and its deadliest attack since it killed two Civil Guard officers in <unk> , France in 2007 . The attack came on the eve of the 50th anniversary of ETA 's founding , and days before the King 's yearly visit to Majorca . 
 = = Background = = 
 In mid @-@ 2006 , the organisation declared a ceasefire , and conversations between Batasuna , ETA and the Basque and Spanish governments started . Peace talks ended in December , when ETA broke the truce with a massive car bomb at the Madrid @-@ Barajas Airport . ETA officially ended the ceasefire in 2007 and resumed its attacks around Spain . At the same time , dozens of members were arrested by Spanish and French police . Despite that , the organisation did not lose the capacity of carrying out attacks . 
 In 2009 , <unk> López became the first non @-@ nationalist <unk> since the 1979 Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country . On June 19 , ETA killed inspector Eduardo <unk> García in <unk> near Bilbao , Biscay , when a bomb attached to his car exploded , and on July 9 , a powerful bomb exploded in a Socialist Workers ' Party local office in Durango , Biscay , causing no injuries . In late July , it was reported that ETA was preparing its " summer campaign " , with Spanish police looking for several vans the organisation had ready to explode . On July 29 , a van loaded with 300 kilograms ( 660 lb ) of explosives went off in front of a Civil Guard barracks in Burgos , injuring 70 , including women and children . 
 The bombing was the first time since 2007 in which ETA killed more than one person in one of its attacks . On December 2 , 2007 two undercover Civil Guards were shot dead in the French town of <unk> , Aquitaine . It was also the deadliest attack in Spanish soil since the Madrid @-@ Barajas Airport . 
 The attack was the first time ETA had killed in Majorca , one of the Spanish regions less targeted by ETA . On August 18 , 1977 a bomb was deactivated next to a seafront walk . On July 31 , 1991 two people were injured after two bombs went off in Palma . Two months later , a car bomb was defused in Palma 's main beach . In the summer of 1995 , Spanish authorities dismantled a cell of ETA ready to shoot king Juan Carlos I. In 2005 , the organisation attempted the <unk> once more in Majorca . 
 = = Attack = = 
 At 1 : 50 pm , a 3 kilograms ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) bomb placed under a Civil Guard Nissan Patrol went off , killing officers Carlos <unk> de Tejada García and Diego Salva <unk> . One of the officers died instantly , while paramedics failed to resuscitate the other officer . Both officers were inside the car when the bomb exploded . The vehicle had been parked in the Na <unk> street , in front of a government @-@ owned building used as a post office and Civil Guard barracks , among other functions . Many hotels are located in the area , something which caused many foreign tourists , mainly German and British , to witness the blast . 
 After the attack , authorities started to look for other possible bombs in the area , with the Civil Guard giving the order to search in all barracks on the island . Soon after , a detection dog found a bomb attached to another Civil Guard Nissan Patrol parked in front of a barracks located 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) from where the first bomb had exploded . The area was cordoned off and people evacuated from nearby houses and hotels . At 6 : 30 pm , Civil Guard bomb disposal officers <unk> carried out a controlled explosion . The bomb had been placed in a broken down vehicle and was therefore not in use . 
 = = = Victims = = = 
 Diego <unk> <unk> ( Pamplona , 1981 ) lived in Majorca and became a <unk> Guard on August 25 , 2008 . He started working as an intern on January 31 , 2009 . A few months later , he suffered a motorbike accident which left him several weeks in coma . Once he recovered , he was assigned to the Palma Nova barracks , just four days before the attack took place . He was buried in Palma . 
 Carlos Sáenz de Tejada García ( Burgos , 1980 ) tried to join the National Police Corps after finishing his high school studies . He failed to do so and became a member of the Spanish Army , being stationed in an army barracks in <unk> del Val . He joined the Civil Guard on February 18 , 2008 , and was sent to Majorca on July 19 . He had some relatives affected by the July 29 bombing in Burgos , where he was buried . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On July 31 , a funeral was held at the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma . The service was attended by Primer Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Prince and Princess of Asturias , Felipe and Letizia . Other people attending the mass were leader of the opposition Mariano Rajoy , Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and <unk> López , among others . At least 2 @,@ 000 gathered outside of the cathedral and a minute of silence was held across Spain in memory of the dead . 
 = = = Operation Cage = = = 
 Right after the attack , and suspecting that the bombers were still on the island , the Civil Guard and the National Police Corps launched a lockdown , an operation named Operation Cage ( Spanish : Operación Jaula ) , the biggest manhunt in the history of the island . Similar operations had been done around Spain in other attacks , such as in the 2004 Madrid train bombings . Checkpoints were set up across the island , while the Palma de Mallorca Airport and all ports were temporarily closed . The airport was closed at 4 : 00 pm and was re @-@ opened at 5 : 55 pm , with several flights being delayed . During the rest of the afternoon , the ports were re @-@ opened as well . 
 The day after the attack , Spanish police released the picture of six members of ETA who could have possibly taken part in the bombing . Police named the suspects as <unk> Martínez Moreno , Iratxe Yáñez Ortiz de <unk> , Alberto <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , Joanes <unk> <unk> and Iván Sáez de <unk> <unk> , although no direct evidence linked them to the attack . Meanwhile , at least 1600 police officers were deployed to keep checking around the island , including on fisherman . The intense search was still active in mid August . 
 = = = Reactions = = = 
 During a press conference at the <unk> Palace , Rodríguez Zapatero blamed both bombings " on the terrorist group ETA " and vowed to bring all of its members to justice : " They have no chance to hide , they can 't flee , they can 't escape justice , they will be arrested , they will be sentenced , they will spend their lives in jail " . When arriving on Majorca on August 1 for his yearly summer holidays King Juan Carlos I condemned the attack and vowed to " go on and on hitting them in the head and we must fight to stop them " . Condemnation also came from governments worldwide following the bombing : 
 The European Commission condemned the bombing and gave its " total solidarity to the Spanish people and institutions " . 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack , and gave Rodriguez Zapatero her support in " the fight against terrorism " . 
 The Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs condemned the killing . 
 Then Foreign Minister of Argentina Jorge <unk> condemned the Majorca and Burgos attacks . 
 = = August bombings = = 
 On August 9 , the same day ETA claimed responsibility for the July 30 attack , four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma . The bombs , which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries , went off after three warning calls from ETA . At 11 : 16 am local time , a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of <unk> , warning that three bombs would go off in Palma . Half an hour later , another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa , giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode . Finally , another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba . Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call , leading to confusion on the location of the bombs . 
 The first bomb exploded at 12 : 00 pm in the bar " <unk> " , located in the avenue Comte de <unk> . The explosion was at first not reported , with authorities believing it was a gas explosion . The second bomb exploded at around 2 : 25 pm in the " La <unk> " restaurant , in front of one of Palma 's main beaches . The third bomb went off at around 4 : 00 pm in another restaurant , named " <unk> " . The fourth device exploded around 6 : 00 pm in a shopping mall located next to the main square of Palma . As a result of the few details given by the warning calls , police failed to evacuate the attacked restaurants . Nonetheless , no one was injured . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 Authorities rapidly ruled out the possibility that ETA had a cell in the island , with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out . Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control . Once the second bomb was spotted , police announced that it had a timer device , which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island . Earlier , Government delegate for Majorca , Ramon <unk> , had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca , and were hiding on the island , waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave . 
 Regarding the August 8 bombings , Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba did not rule out any possibility , although he confirmed that the hypothesis of the bombers leaving the island before the attack was " reasonable " , due to the timer devices . All of the bombs had been planted in women 's toilets , which led authorities to believe that they had been set by one of the two female suspects , <unk> Martínez Moreno and Iratxe Yáñez Ortiz . 
 = = = Arrests = = = 
 On August 19 , Alberto <unk> <unk> was arrested in the French town of Le Corbier in Savoy , next to the French Alps . He was held along with fellow ETA members <unk> <unk> and Andoni <unk> . They were responsible for ETA ’ s logistics operation , and had the job of supplying weapons and explosives to the ETA cells operating in Spanish soil . The arrest led to the discovery of almost a tone of explosives , hidden by ETA in 12 small caches around France . On October 11 , Joanes <unk> was arrested in Rivières , Gard along with top ETA member <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Iratxe <unk> Ortiz was arrested on January 10 , 2010 in Portugal after she was stopped in a routine traffic check @-@ point in the Spanish town of <unk> de <unk> , next to Spain @-@ Portugal border . <unk> Ortiz was arrested along another member of ETA , <unk> García Arrieta , who was driving a van containing 10 kilograms ( 22 lb ) of explosives , two pistols , a rifle and bomb @-@ making material . She was extradited to Spain on October 28 , 2010 . 
 = William Hillcourt = 
 William Hillcourt ( August 6 , 1900 – November 9 , 1992 ) , known within the Scouting movement as " Green Bar Bill " , was an influential leader in the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) organization from 1927 to 1992 . Hillcourt was a prolific writer and teacher in the areas of woodcraft , troop and patrol structure , and training ; his written works include three editions of the BSA 's official Boy Scout Handbook , with over 12 @.@ 6 million copies printed , other Scouting @-@ related books and numerous magazine articles . Hillcourt developed and promoted the American adaptation of the Wood Badge adult Scout leader training program . 
 Hillcourt was Danish , but moved to the United States as a young adult . From his start in Danish Scouting in 1910 until his death in 1992 , he was continuously active in Scouting . He traveled all over the world teaching and training both Scouts and Scouters , earning many of Scouting 's highest honors . His legacy and influence can still be seen today in the BSA program and in Scouting training manuals and methods for both youth and adults . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Hillcourt was born in 1900 in Aarhus , Denmark and was the youngest of three sons of a building contractor . He was given the name Vilhelm Hans <unk> Jensen . Around 1930 , he changed his name by <unk> " Vilhelm " , translating " <unk> " into " Hill @-@ court " and dropping " Jensen " . His first published work was a poem about trolls and elves , printed by an Aarhus newspaper when he was nine years old . For Christmas 1910 , Hillcourt 's brother gave him a Danish translation of Scouting for Boys by Baden @-@ Powell , the founder of the Scout movement . He went on to earn the highest award in Danish Scouting , Knight @-@ Scout in 1918 , at age 17 . He was selected to represent his troop at the 1st World Scout Jamboree in Olympia in 1920 where he first met Baden @-@ Powell , with whom he was later to work . 
 While Hillcourt studied pharmacy in Copenhagen , he became more involved in Scouting . As a Scout leader , he became a Scoutmaster , national instructor , writer and then the editor for the Danish Scouting journal . He wrote his first book , The Island , recounting his early Scouting experiences . 
 After deciding to experience Scouting around the world and to return home with the best ideas , Hillcourt worked his way through Europe and England and then arrived in the United States in February 1926 . He was soon hired by the BSA 's national office and worked for the BSA until he retired as a professional Scouter in 1965 . In 1933 Hillcourt married Grace Brown , the personal secretary of Chief Scout Executive James E. West . 
 = = Scouting career = = 
 Hillcourt worked at a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park , New York , in 1926 where he became an instructor in American Indian dance . He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him . He met James West while working at the national office . West solicited Hillcourt 's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18 @-@ page memo detailing issues with the lack of patrol structure and leadership . He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders , and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a patrol leader and a Scoutmaster . West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929 . 
 From 1932 until his retirement in 1965 , Hillcourt was a major contributor to Boys ' Life , the magazine for Scouting youth . Each monthly issue included a page on advancement and Scoutcraft , outdoor Scouting skills , and included his signature superimposed over the two green bars that are the emblem of the patrol leader , which led to his moniker " Green Bar Bill " and its adoption as the logo of his regular Boys ' Life column . 
 Hillcourt was tasked to write a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good friend and colleague E. Urner Goodman , the national program director of the BSA . He and his wife moved to a house in Mendham Borough , New Jersey , to be near Schiff Scout Reservation , the BSA 's national training center , so he could be in place to put this theories to a practical test . In order to do so , he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA . As the Scoutmaster , he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16 years . 
 The Baden @-@ Powells visited Schiff in 1935 and began a steadfast friendship with the <unk> . Baden @-@ Powell died in 1941 . After World War II , Baden @-@ Powell 's widow , Olave Baden @-@ Powell , allowed Hillcourt to edit Aids to Scoutmastership into the World Brotherhood Editions to help the Scouting movement recover from the war . She then allowed Hillcourt access to Baden @-@ Powell 's letters , diaries and sketchbooks when she and Hillcourt co @-@ authored the narrative biography of Baden @-@ Powell , Baden @-@ Powell : The Two Lives of a Hero . 
 The BSA national office moved from New York City to North Brunswick , New Jersey , in 1954 , and the <unk> moved with it . He completed the sixth edition of the Boy Scout Handbook in time for the BSA 's 50th anniversary in 1960 . 
 = = = Wood Badge = = = 
 To encourage the creation of Rovering in the U.S. , J. S. Wilson travelled from the UK to oversee a Wood Badge course in May 1936 at Schiff . Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later , he was the senior patrol leader for the second course . He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge . After World War II , Wood Badge was revived and Hillcourt was the Scoutmaster for a test course begun on July 31 , 1948 , at Schiff and the first standard course at Philmont Scout Ranch . As the national director of training , Hillcourt wore five Wood Badge beads , a tradition that has been discontinued in the U.K. Scout Association , however other countries still continue the use of the five Wood Badge Beads and are still worn by the National Volunteer Leader of Wood Badge Training of each country as well as by special decree of Gilwell Park today . 
 In the year before his retirement on August 1 , 1965 , the national council began a program to update the Wood Badge program and shift its emphasis from teaching Scoutcraft to leadership skills . After he was officially retired , his opinion was still sought after and respected . Dr. John W. Larson , Director of Boy Scout Leader Training for the National Council , was working with Béla H. Bánáthy and Bob Perin , Assistant National Director , Volunteer Training Service , to adapt the leadership competencies of the White Stag Leadership Development Program into a new Wood Badge syllabus . 
 Hillcourt was among the few on the National Staff who strongly resisted the change to the Wood Badge program . He attended the presentation that Larson made to the national Scout committee on the new Wood Badge curriculum . Larson later reported , " He fought us all the way ... He had a vested interest in what had been and resisted every change . I just told him to settle down , everything was going to be all right . " Hillcourt presented an alternative to Larson 's plan to incorporate leadership into Wood Badge . Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton asked Larson to look at Hillcourt 's plan , and Larson reported back that it was the same stuff , just reordered and rewritten . Larson 's plan for Wood Badge was approved and he moved ahead to begin implementing the proposed changes . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Hillcourt retired from the BSA on August 1 , 1965 . In 1971 , he and Grace finally completed the world tour he had started in 1926 ; along the way they attended the 13th World Scout Jamboree in <unk> , Japan . Grace Hillcourt died in 1973 . Rather than live alone , Bill moved into the home of his good friends Carson and Martha Buck . 
 The BSA had introduced the " Improved Scouting Program " in 1972 , along with a new edition of the Boy Scout Handbook . Many of the changes were intended to expand Scouting to a broader base of youth and to make Scouting more " in tune with the times " . Many Scouters , including Hillcourt , were critical of the new program changes , exclaiming that the de @-@ emphasis on traditional outdoor skills had taken the " outing out of Scouting " . This change proved to be unsuccessful , deterring existing adherents and attracting relatively few new enrolments . To remedy this situation , Hillcourt convinced Chief Scout Executive Harvey L. Price that a new handbook was needed . Hillcourt then came out of retirement and spent a year writing and editing the 1979 edition of The Official Boy Scout Handbook , returning to the focus of Scoutcraft . In addition , he helped to develop the All Out for Scouting program that launched the return to the old standards . Hillcourt was regarded as a prominent figure and guide in BSA 's recovery from its experiment earlier in that decade . 
 Hillcourt was recognized for his service to youth by the BSA with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award on May 19 , 1978 . In 1980 , the BSA presented Hillcourt with their highest national honor , the Silver Buffalo Award and was cited as " The Voice of Scouting " . The World Scout Committee of the World Organization of the Scout Movement recognized him for exceptional services to world Scouting in 1985 with the Bronze Wolf Award . In the same year , an article in the Scouting magazine proclaimed Hillcourt as " the foremost influence on development of the Boy Scouting program . " In 1990 he also became a member of <unk> , an American Scouting service organization . Travel and appearances at Scouting events both local and worldwide were part of his routine until he died , for which he was referred to as Scoutmaster to the World . 
 Hillcourt died at the age of 92 , in Stockholm , Sweden , while traveling on a Scouting tour with Carson Buck in 1992 . He is buried with his wife Grace in St. Joseph 's Cemetery in Mendham , New Jersey , at Row 8 , Block I , near Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation , where he had lived for so many years . His legacy in Scouting and his influence continue in the programs and training of Scouting . Consequently , his writings are still used within the Scouting movement and his material continues to be reprinted in Scouting magazine . The Longhouse Council operates the William Hillcourt Scout Museum and Carson Buck Memorial Library at Camp Woodland in New York to " keep the traditions of Scouting alive " through the preservation of the history that is a foundation for today 's Scouting movement .

 = Black American Sign Language = 
 Black American Sign Language ( BASL ) or Black Sign Variation ( <unk> ) is a dialect of American Sign Language ( ASL ) spoken most commonly by deaf African Americans in the United States . The divergence from ASL was influenced largely by the segregation of schools in the American South . Like other schools at the time , schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race , creating two language communities among deaf signers : White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools . Today , BASL is still used by signers in the South despite schools having been legally desegregated since 1954 . 
 Linguistically , BASL differs from other varieties of ASL in its phonology , syntax , and lexicon . BASL tends to have a larger signing space meaning that some signs are produced further away from the body than in other dialects . Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two @-@ handed variants of signs while signers of ASL tend to prefer one @-@ handed variants . Some signs are different in BASL as well , with some borrowings from African American English . 
 = = History = = 
 Like many educational institutions for hearing children during the 1800s and early 1900s , schools for deaf children were segregated based on race . The first school for the deaf in the United States , The American School for the Deaf ( ASD ) , was founded in 1817 but did not admit any Black students until 1952 . Of the schools for the deaf that began to be created , few admitted students of color . Seeing a lack of educational opportunities for the Black deaf , Platt Skinner founded the Skinner School for the Colored Deaf , Dumb , and Blind in 1856 in Niagara Falls , New York . Skinner described his school as " the first effort of its kind in the country ... We receive and instruct those and only those who are refused admission to all other institutions and are despised on account of their color . " The school moved to Trenton , New Jersey in 1860 . After its closure in 1866 , no Northern state created an institution for the Black deaf . Even after these states outlawed segregation by 1900 , integration was sparse as some institutions allowed Black students and others did not . 
 After the foundation and success of the American School for the Deaf , many other institutions for the deaf were founded throughout the country . Since schools , particularly in the South , were segregated , many Southern states created separate schools or departments for the Black deaf . The first school established for the Black deaf below the Mason – Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857 and remained segregated until 1958 . The last Southern state to create an institution for the Black deaf was Louisiana in 1938 . Black Deaf children thus became a language community isolated from the White Deaf with different means of language socialization , allowing for different dialects to develop . Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children , <unk> — the prominent pedagogical method of the time — was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students . <unk> methods often forbade the use of sign language , so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than their White peers . Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 which declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional , integration was slow to come , and schools for the deaf were no exception : the last desegregated in 1978 , 24 years after the decision . 
 As schools began to integrate , students and teachers noticed differences in the way Black students and White students signed . Carolyn McCaskill , professor of ASL and Deaf Studies at Gallaudet University , recalls the challenge of understanding the dialect of ASL spoken by her White principal and teachers after her segregated school integrated : " When I began attending the school , I did not understand the teacher and she did not understand me because we used different signs . " Carl <unk> was the first to discuss differences between BASL and White ASL in his appendices of the 1965 version of the Dictionary of American Sign Language , and work has continued on BASL since then . 
 As deaf education and sign language research continued to evolve , so did the perception of ASL . With the publication of the Dictionary of American Sign Language , ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language . The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization and the development of a prestige dialect which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University . Despite this standardization , there are still regional accents of ASL similar to spoken languages . Dialects that are different from the standard one , and especially those spoken by marginalized groups , are often stigmatized . As a non @-@ standard dialect , BASL is stigmatized by signers and seen as inferior to prestige dialects of ASL . This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people , despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 When asked , many signers in the South gave anecdotal accounts of differences between the signing of Black and White signers . These differences turned out to be aspects of the differing phonology of BASL . Among these accounts were claims that Black signers had a larger signing space and used more two @-@ handed signs . Investigation into these anecdotes has found correlations . 
 When compared , Black signers were more likely to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two @-@ handed signs than were White signers . Adverbs are most likely to utilize a larger signing space . Less marked forms such as pronouns , determiners , plain verbs , and nouns tend to be less likely to be produced outside the typical signing space . The selection of two @-@ handed signs over one @-@ handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production . When the sign could be produced with one or two hands , Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign ; if the following sign was two @-@ handed , they were more likely to produce a two @-@ handed variant , while if the following sign was one @-@ handed , they were more likely to produce the one @-@ handed variant . The use of innovative one @-@ handed forms though , even in environments which favored them , did not exceed 50 percent . 
 BASL signers further tend to favor lowered variants of side @-@ of @-@ forehead signs resulting in contact at the cheek . The sign KNOW is usually produced by placing the fingers of a flat hand on the temple , but when lowered the fingers make contact at the cheek . Early research showed that BASL signers used these lowered forms at a rate of 53 percent with grammatical category being the strongest constraint . Other conditioning environments for lowered signs depend on preceding location ; for instance , signs produced in front of the body lead to lowered sign variants while signs produced at the head cause signers to favor non @-@ lowered forms . 
 = = Syntax = = 
 Unlike ASL , BASL allows for the frequent use of syntactic repetition . In a study conducted by McCaskill , of 26 signers ( 13 Black and 13 White ) , there were 57 instances of repetition from Black signers compared to 19 from White signers , and of those 19 instances , 18 came from a single signer . The use of repetition by BASL signers is considered to be pragmatic rather than as a way to clarify meaning . 
 A study in 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male signers used constructed action , with or without constructed dialogue , more often than White signers , but never used constructed dialogue by itself . These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill , which found that Black signers not only used constructed dialogue , but did so more frequently than white signers . 
 = = Lexical variation = = 
 Lexical variation between BASL and other dialects of ASL was first noted in the Dictionary of American Sign Language . In a later study of 34 lexical signs , Black signers had 28 signs that White signers did not know . Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers , and most , having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf , refer to everyday life . Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants , but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs . 
 = = = Borrowing from African American English = = = 
 A body of work has arisen looking at the similarities between Black American Sign Language and African American English ( AAE ) since both are language varieties marked by their use in African American communities . In 1998 John Lewis investigated the incorporation of aspects of AAE into BASL . He reported that , during narrative storytelling by a Black signer , there were " <unk> shifts " marked by shifts in posture and rhythmicity and by incorporating side @-@ to @-@ side head movement . He concluded that this " ' <unk> ' quality was related to the style of AAE . This finding was not reproduced by McCaskill , which she attributes to the nature of the speech acts : Lewis analyzed a narrative event while McCaskill utilized natural or elicited data . Lexical borrowing has been seen in BASL signers under age 35 which is likely due to the advances in mass media — younger signers would have more contact with AAE through movies , television , and the Internet . 
 When asked about distinctive features of their signing , Black Deaf signers tended to identify a number of idioms borrowed from AAE . Some were literal translations like I <unk> YOU or <unk> PLEASE which are signed the standard way but have meanings different from their literal interpretation . Other loan words modified existing signs like STOP <unk> which took the bent @-@ v handshape of TRIP and moved it up to the head to indicate a new meaning of " stop imagining things . " 
 = Mina ( singer ) = 
 Anna Maria Quaini or Mina Mazzini <unk> ( born 25 March 1940 ) , known as Mina , is one of the most successful Italian singers of all time . She was a staple of Italian television variety shows and a dominant figure in Italian pop music from the mid @-@ 1960s to mid @-@ 1970s , known for her three @-@ octave vocal range , the agility of her soprano voice , and her image as an emancipated woman . 
 In performance , Mina combined several modern styles with traditional Italian melodies and swing music , which made her the most versatile pop singer in Italian music . Mina dominated the Italian charts for fifteen years and reached an unsurpassed level of popularity . She has scored 79 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts . 
 Mina 's TV appearances in 1959 were the first for a female rock and roll singer in Italy . Her loud syncopated singing earned her the nickname Queen of Screamers . The public also labeled her the Tiger of Cremona for her wild gestures and body shakes . When she turned to light pop tunes , Mina 's chart @-@ toppers in West Germany in 1962 and Japan in 1964 earned her the title of the best international artist in these countries . Mina 's more refined sensual manner was introduced in 1960 with Gino Paoli 's ballad " This World We Love In " , which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961 . 
 Mina was banned from Italian TV and radio in 1963 because her pregnancy and relationship with a married actor did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois morals . After the ban , the Italian broadcasting service RAI tried to continue to prohibit her songs , which were forthright in dealing with subjects such as religion , smoking and sex . Mina 's cool act combined sex appeal with public smoking , dyed blonde hair , and shaved eyebrows to create a " bad girl " image . 
 Mina 's voice has distinctive timbre and great power . Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones . The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of blues , R & B and soul music during the late 1960s , especially when she worked in collaboration with the singer @-@ songwriter Lucio Battisti . Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual chord progressions to showcase her singing skills , particularly " Brava " by Bruno Canfora ( 1965 ) and the pseudo @-@ serial " Se telefonando " by Ennio Morricone ( 1966 ) . The latter song was covered by several performers abroad . Shirley Bassey carried Mina 's ballad " Grande grande grande " to charts in the U.S. , U.K. , and other English @-@ speaking countries in 1973 . Mina 's easy listening duet " Parole parole " was turned into a worldwide hit by <unk> and Alain Delon in 1974 . Mina gave up public appearances in 1978 but has continued to release popular albums on a yearly basis to the present day . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Anna Maria Mazzini was born into a working @-@ class family in Busto <unk> , Lombardy . The family moved to work in Cremona in her childhood . She listened to American rock and roll and jazz records and was a frequent visitor at the Santa <unk> and the Taverna <unk> clubs of Milan , both known for promoting rock and roll . After finishing high school in 1958 , she attended college where she majored in accounting .

 While on summer holiday in <unk> on 8 August 1958 , Mazzini gave an improvised performance of the song " Un <unk> tra le mani " to amuse her family after a concert at the La Bussola night club . During the following nights , Sergio Bernardini , the owner of the club , held her back in her attempts to get back on stage . 
 In September , she started her solo career with the backing of the band Happy Boys . Her concert in September 1958 , before an audience of 2 @,@ 500 people at the Theatre of <unk> del Re , won enthusiastic approval from local critics . She soon signed with Davide <unk> , owner of the small record company <unk> . Her first single , " Non partir " / " <unk> " , was produced under the stage name Mina for the Italian audience . Simultaneously , " Be Bop A Lula " / " When " was issued under the name Baby Gate for the international audience . Baby was chosen as a contrast to her 178 cm height ( 5 ft 10 in ) — exceptionally tall for an Italian woman — and Gate as a tribute to The Golden Gate Quartet . In December , her performance at the Sei <unk> della canzone festival of Milan was described by the La Notte newspaper as the " birth of a star " . It was Mina 's last performance with the Happy Boys , as her family refused to let her skip college for a scheduled tour of Turkey . 
 Less than a month after the breakup with her previous band , Mina co @-@ founded a new group called <unk> , which consisted of a singer , a saxophonist , a pianist , a <unk> , and a guitarist . Her first hit with the band featured Mina performed an extra @-@ loud , syncopated version of the popular song " Nessuno " ( " Nobody " ) , which she performed at the first rock festival in the Milan Ice Palace in February 1959 . Performances of the song on the TV game shows Lascia o <unk> ? and Il <unk> on 1 March and 4 April were hailed by Italian critics . The starlet signed with Elio Gigante , an experienced artist manager . In the following years , he organized her performances in the grand ballrooms of Italy . Her first Italian # 1 hit was the up @-@ tempo " Tintarella di luna " ( " Moon Tan " ) in September 1959 , which was performed in her first <unk> ( musical comedy film ) , Juke box - <unk> d 'amore . In late 1959 , <unk> had her drop the name Baby Gate in favour of Mina . 
 = = = Growing up ( 1960 – 1965 ) = = = 
 In 1960 , Mina made her Festival della canzone italiana in Sanremo debut with two songs . She turned to slow emotional love songs for the first time . The song " È vero " ( " It 's True " ) reached # 8 on the Italian charts . Gino Paoli 's song " Il cielo in una stanza " ( " The Sky in a Room " ) marked the beginning of the young singer 's transformation from a rock and roll <unk> to a feminine inspiration for cantautori . The idea for the song " Love can grow at any moment at any place " had come to Paoli while lying on a bed and looking at the purple ceiling . The single topped the list of annual sales in Italy and reached the Billboard Hot 100 as " This World We Love In " . Video performances of the song were included in the <unk> Io bacio ... tu baci and <unk> a Ischia , and in 1990 , in the soundtrack of the film Goodfellas . 
 At the 1961 Sanremo song festival , Mina performed two songs . " Io amo , tu ami " ( " I Love , You Love " ) finished fourth and " Le mille <unk> blu " ( " A Thousand Blue Bubbles " ) placed fifth . Disappointed with these results , Mina declared her intention of never performing at the Sanremo song festival again . 
 As her songs and movies were already popular abroad , Mina started to tour Spain and Japan , and performed on Venezuelan TV in 1961 . Mina performed on Spanish TV and at the Paris Olympia hall at the beginning of 1962 . The presentation of her German single " <unk> Sand " on 12 March 1962 on Peter Kraus 's TV show caused a boom of 40 @,@ 000 record sales in ten days in Germany . The record went to # 1 and spent over half the year on the German charts in 1962 . Mina had six more singles on the German chart in the next two years . In a listeners ' poll conducted in July 1962 in Germany , Austria , and the German @-@ speaking portion of Switzerland , Mina was voted the most popular singer in the world . In May 1962 , she performed in Buenos Aires . Meanwhile , her version of the mambo rhythm " <unk> Cafe " and the surf pop " Renato " peaked at # 1 and # 4 respectively on the Italian charts . " L <unk> twist " appeared on the flipside of " Renato " , and was used on the soundtrack of Michelangelo Antonioni 's feature film Eclipse . 
 In 1963 Mina 's TV and radio career was interrupted by RAI , the Italian public broadcasting service , as she refused to cover up her relationship ( and resulting pregnancy ) with the married actor Corrado Pani . Mina 's record sales were unaffected and due to public demand , RAI ended the ban . On 10 January 1964 she returned to the TV screen on the program La <unk> dei <unk> , and performed the song " Città <unk> " , a cover of Gene McDaniels ' " It 's a Lonely Town ( Lonely Without You ) " , which was her first release on the <unk> label . Her next single , " È l <unk> per me " , a cover of Jody Miller 's " He Walks Like a Man " , became the biggest selling record of the year in Italy . Her new melodic manner was demonstrated again on 11 December 1964 TV program Il <unk> , where she performed " Io sono quel che sono " ( " I Am What I Am " ) . A reminder of her previous adolescent image , her single " Suna ni <unk> <unk> " ( " Tears Disappear in the Sand " ) , sung in Japanese , peaked at # 1 on the Japanese singles chart and earned Mina the title of Best International Artist in Japan . 
 The first episode of the Studio Uno live Saturday night series showcased Mina 's new blond look with shaved eyebrows . The shows included the brooding songs " Un bacio è troppo poco " ( " One Kiss is Not Enough " ) and " Un anno d 'amore " ( " A Year of Love " ) , a cover of Nino Ferrer 's " C 'est irreparable " . In the same series she performed " Brava " ( " Good " ) , a rhythmic jazz number specially written by Bruno Canfora to demonstrate the Mina 's vocal range and performing skills . Her Studio Uno album topped the Italian chart that year . Her recordings of 1965 included the scatting performance of " <unk> Waltz " , the theme song for the film The 10th Victim .

 Maurizio Costanzo and <unk> De Chiara wrote the lyrics of " Se telefonando " ( " If Over the Phone " ) as the theme for the TV program Aria <unk> in spring 1966 . The lyrics were composed in a dark , Hal David mode . The serialist composer Ennio Morricone was asked to compose the music . Mina and the three songwriters met in a RAI rehearsal room at Via <unk> , Rome . Morricone started to repeat a short musical theme of just three notes ( by his term a micro @-@ cell ) on an upright piano . He had copied the snippet of melody from the siren of a police car in Marseilles . After a few bars Mina grabbed the lyrics sheet and started to sing as if she had known the tune before . Composed in this way , " Se telefonando " is a pop song with eight transitions of tonality that builds tension throughout the chorus . Morricone 's arrangement featured a sophisticated combination of melodic trumpet lines , Hal Blaine @-@ style drumming , a string set , a 1960s Europop female choir , and intense subsonic @-@ sounding trombones . 
 " Se telefonando " was presented in May 1966 in a Studio Uno episode and in August the same year at Aria <unk> . The single peaked at # 7 on the Italian chart and was 53rd in the annual list of sales . The album Studio Uno 66 featured the song as one of the standout tracks along with " Ta @-@ ra @-@ ta @-@ ta " and " Una casa in <unk> al mondo " . It was the fifth biggest selling album of the year in Italy . 
 In 1966 , Mina started working with the Swiss Broadcasting Service and the Orchestra <unk> in Lugano . She founded the independent record label PDU in collaboration with her father . The first record issued under the label was <unk> a mio padre ( Dedicated to My Father ) . Mina 's growing interest in Brazilian music resulted in " La banda " ( " The Band " ) , a Chico Buarque song , which reached # 3 in Italy . Mina continued to perform on Italian TV , and presented " Zum zum zum " on the spring 1967 variety series Sabato sera , accompanied by the NATO naval band . The series also included " La <unk> più bella del mondo " ( " The Most Beautiful Couple in the World " ) , a duet with Adriano Celentano . The title of the song " Sono , come tu mi vuoi " ( " I Am , as You Want Me to Be " ) was taken from Luigi Pirandello 's play Come tu mi vuoi . The lyrics talk about the manic attention of the press on an artist 's private life . Another hit from Sabato sera was " L <unk> " ( " <unk> " ) , which was re @-@ scored by Augusto Martelli and released as " La <unk> " in Spain and Latin American countries . 
 RAI broadcast the third episode of Senza rete ( " Unplugged " ) live on 18 July 1968 from the Auditorio A of the corporation 's regional headquarters in Naples . The program presented Mina 's homage to Luigi Tenco , who had recently died . She turned his song " Se stasera sono qui " ( " If I Stay Here Tonight " ) into a rigorous piece of soul music in the score of Pino Calvi . She celebrated the 10th anniversary of her career with a concert at La Bussola , backed by the Orchestra Augusto Martelli . The concert was recorded and issued as Mina alla Bussola dal vivo . 
 Canzonissima 1968 was a Saturday night prime time variety show that aired on Rai Uno from September 1968 to January 1969 . It was hosted by Mina , Walter Chiari and Paolo <unk> . The orchestrations were scored by the conductors Bruno Canfora and Augusto Martelli . " <unk> <unk> " , Mina 's talking and laughing version of Carlos Imperial 's bossa nova " Nem <unk> Que <unk> Tem " , narrowly escaped a ban by RAI because of its irreverent lyrics . The song was performed as part of a musical fantasy , back to back with " Quelli che <unk> un cuore " , her intense version of " Anyone Who Had a Heart " . Another interpretation of a Dionne Warwick song was " La voce del <unk> " ( " Silent Voices " ) by Paolo <unk> and Elio Isola , presented in a live session during the show . " <unk> di <unk> " ( " Nothing at All " ) was her version of the <unk> ' " Break Your Promise " . The series also included the songs " Fantasia " , " La musica è <unk> " ( " The Music is Over " ) and the elegant " Un colpo al cuore " ( " Heart Attack " ) . " Un colpo al cuore " ended up as # 68 on the best @-@ selling singles chart for that year in Italy . Each show was closed by Mina singing " <unk> che fosse amore " ( " Wish It Was Love " ) , a piece of atmospheric music by Bruno Canfora that was # 50 on the best @-@ selling singles chart for 1968 in Italy . A selection of songs from the series were issued as the album Canzonissima ' 68 .

 After a break of three months , Mina returned and recorded the song " Non credere " ( " <unk> " ) , composed by Luigi <unk> and Pietro <unk> , with lyrics by Mogol , in April . The single became the third biggest @-@ selling record of the year in Italy . Mogol and his fellow composer Lucio Battisti , along with the <unk> <unk> Marconi on back @-@ up instrumentals , worked with Mina on several songs as a result of the success of " Non credere " . The team produced a set of songs including " Io e te da soli " ( " You and Me Alone " ) , " Insieme " ( " Together " ) , " Amor mio " ( " Love of Mine " ) , " Io <unk> senza te " ( " I 'll Live without You " ) , " E penso a te " ( " And I Think of You " ) . One of the first introductions of the new repertoire was the Senza rete live televised concert from the Auditorio A in Naples on 20 January 1970 . The material provided by Mogol @-@ Battisti was the core for five albums . Among them , ... <unk> più che mai ... più <unk> che mai ... was Mina 's first independent album to reach # 1 of the weekly Italian charts and was the biggest selling album of 1969 in Italy . ... quando tu mi <unk> in <unk> a un <unk> ... was seventh on the annual record chart of 1970 . Del mio <unk> ... ( My Best ... ) was second in 1971 . Mina was the biggest seller of 1972 . The latter two albums were recorded during a break from live performances to give birth to her daughter Benedetta . 
 Mina 's comeback took place at RAI 's variety series Teatro 10 in spring 1972 . One of the highlights of the series was a selection of Battisti 's songs performed in duet with the composer . The shows also included " Balada para mi muerte " ( " Ode to My Death " ) , a nuevo tango duet with Ástor Piazzolla at the bandoneón , backed by the Argentinian group <unk> 9 . " Grande grande grande " , arranged by Pino Presti , was the second biggest @-@ selling single of the year in Italy . The successes encouraged Enrico Riccardi to copy Battisti 's style in Riccardi 's composition " Fiume azzurro " , which earned another place in the top 100 of annual record sales in Italy . 
 The final number of the eight Teatro 10 episodes was " Parole parole " ( " Words Words " ) , a duet with Alberto Lupo . The song is an easy listening dialogue between Mina 's singing and Lupo 's declamation . The lyrics ' theme are hollow words . These intertwine the lady 's lamentation of the end of love and the lies she has to hear with the male protagonist 's recitation . In the dialog she scoffs at the compliments he gives her , calling them parole – just words . The single was released in April 1972 and topped the Italian charts . It was covered by numerous Italian and French duets . 
 Mina said she would be retiring from public appearances after an exclusive concert at the La Bussola Club on 16 September . Thousands of people turned up at the nightclub 's doorstep . Gianni <unk> 's Orchestra featured Gianni Basso on tenor saxophone and Oscar <unk> on trumpet . 
 Mina lost her husband Virgilio Crocco in a car accident in 1973 . She continued her career with the top Italian chart hits " E poi ... " ( " And Then ... " ) and " L 'importante è finire " ( " It 's Important to Finish " ) . She recorded the theme song " Fa presto , fa piano " ( " Works Quickly , Works Quietly " ) for the film La <unk> , issued in 1974 .

 Mina 's last live TV appearance was the final episode of the <unk> series on 16 March 1974 . Mina was the hostess of the series alongside Raffaella <unk> . During the series , she explored different musical styles in the songs " I Don 't Know How to Love Him " , " Mack the Knife " , " Night and Day " , and " Someday ( You 'll Want Me to Want You ) " . After " Non gioco più " ( " The Game Is Over " ) , a blues duet with the harmonica player Toots Thielemans , Mina announced her withdrawal from public performances . Her last appearance on TV was her performance of " Ancora ancora ancora " . The video was the final number of the " Mille e una luce " show on 1 July 1978 . Her last concert appearances , a series of thirteen fully booked concerts at La Bussola in 1978 , were cut short due to her illness . Mina gave her last public performance on 23 August 1978 at the <unk> theatre . It was recorded and issued as Mina Live ' 78 . 
 Mina continued to release albums on a yearly basis with her son Massimiliano Pani as the producer . Between 1972 and 1995 , she published a double album each year . From 1973 , her LPs and CDs have been characterized by artistic motifs of the designers Luciano <unk> , Gianni <unk> and the photographer Mauro <unk> . From the mid @-@ 1980s , the design of the album covers was trusted to <unk> alone . All of Mina 's records under the PDU label have reached the Italian Top 100 . A large part of her work has consisted of covering well @-@ known songs ; she has dedicated tribute albums to The Beatles , Frank Sinatra , Renato Zero , Domenico Modugno , the Neapolitan song , and religious music . After leaving the stage , her greatest chart successes have been duets . In 1985 , " Questione di feeling " , a duet with Riccardo Cocciante , was the 13th biggest @-@ selling single of the year in Italy and became an evergreen ( as a hit song is called in Europe ) . The duet album Mina Celentano , recorded with Adriano Celentano , was the biggest @-@ selling album of 1998 in Italy . Starting in 1989 , all of her records included the jazzy piano playing of Danilo Rea . 
 The break in Mina 's TV appearances lasted until 2001 , when she released footage of her recording sessions . The videos were broadcast over the Wind internet site on 30 March . This resulted in millions of visits to the site on that night , and additional millions on following days . The footage was released as the DVD Mina in Studio . After the event , Mina 's singles started to chart in Italy again . The track " <unk> l <unk> " ( 2002 ) , written for her by Zucchero , peaked at # 3 on the chart . Mina 's cover of " Don 't call me baby ( Can 't take my eyes off you ) " ( 2003 ) reached # 4 in Italy . The single " Alibi " ( 2007 ) reached # 6 in Italy . The triple CD The Platinum Collection reached # 1 on the Italian charts . So did Olio ( 1999 ) , Veleno ( 2002 ) , Bula Bula ( 2005 ) and <unk> . Mina 's later releases have included duets with Mick Hucknall , Fabrizio De André , Piero Pelù , Adriano Celentano , Lucio Dalla , Joan Manuel Serrat , Chico Buarque , <unk> Ferro , Giorgia and Seal . In recent years , Mina has been writing a weekly column on the front page of La Stampa and a page in the Italian edition of the magazine Vanity Fair , where she answers fan letters .

 Caught up in the wave of rock and roll sweeping across Italy in 1958 , Mina listened to American records and was a frequent visitor at the Derby Club , the Santa <unk> , and the Taverna <unk> clubs of Milan , which promoted rock and roll music . Mina 's repertoire at the beginning of her career included clumsy imitations of British and American rock and jazz songs , while her extra @-@ loud and syncopated version of the song " Nessuno " showcased her excellent sense of rhythm . Earlier in 1958 , Domenico Modugno had caused astonishment by raising his hands in the air during his performance of Nel blu <unk> di blu ( " <unk> " ) . In Mina 's first TV appearances she further broke with tradition by shaking her head , hands , and hips to the rhythm . The writer Edoardo Sanguineti recalled the Italian public 's first encounter with the enthusiastic singer as : 
 TV host Mario Riva named her one of the <unk> ( screamers ) , for her distinctive timbre and power . Later , the public called Mina the Queen of the Screamers . Her extravagant gestures earned her another nickname – Tiger of Cremona .

 Mina introduced her new sensual manner in her presentation of the ballad " Il cielo in una stanza " in 1960 . Three years later , her love affair with Corrado Pani challenged the moral foundations of Italy , a country where divorce was illegal and single motherhood was considered shameful . Thus , her non @-@ conformist choices represented the emancipation of women in Italy , which did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois virtues prevalent at the time . The subsequent ban from performing on Italian TV and radio channels further developed Mina 's image as an independent " bad girl " , which she emphasized with her choice of song themes . An example was her performance of " <unk> <unk> " on air after RAI had expressed their displeasure with the song 's lyrics about a girl 's encounter with the Devil . Other songs that RAI initially banned as immoral were " Ta @-@ ra @-@ ta @-@ ta " ( dealing forthrightly with smoking ) , " La canzone di Marinella " , and " L 'importante è finire " ( alluding to sex without love ) . Mina 's cool act featured sex appeal , public smoking , dyed blonde hair , shaved eyebrows , and heavy use of eye make @-@ up . 
 The main themes of Mina 's songs were distressing love stories . Her style was to interpret them in a highly dramatic way by using gestures and body language to bring the story alive . Mina 's performance was typically characterised by expressive intensity , subtle variations , and original phrasing . The music critic Gherardo Gentili has noted her interpretive skills as : 
 To demonstrate Mina 's vocal range , the composer Bruno Canfora penned the song " Brava " , and Ennio Morricone wrote " Se telefonando " with numerous transitions of tonality . More songs were composed exclusively for Mina and arranged for RAI 's all @-@ star orchestras for performance on the TV variety series Studio uno , Sabato sera , Canzonissima and Teatro 10 . Mina ( alongside Carmen Villani ) pioneered by combining classic Italian pop and swing music with features of blues , R & B and soul music , particularly in the songs " Se stasera sono qui " and " Deborah " . She helped to incorporate new styles into Italian pop music , including nuevo tango , as seen in her duet " Balada para mi muerte " with Ástor Piazzolla .

 When she altered her musical style in 1969 , Mina changed her hairdo from short and straight to long blonde curls , and started to wear a black minidress . Mogol 's and Lucio Battisti 's first songs , particularly " Insieme " and " Io e te da soli " , showcased Mina 's blues and soul skills . Around the time of their collaboration , Mina turned towards middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road pop . Battisti 's melodies were sophisticated and had a complex chord sequence . The songs were characterized by frequent changes of rhythm , pauses , and dialogues between the voice and the orchestra . Another characterizing feature was an instrumental introduction without a rhythmic base .

 In her early teens , Mina was a competitive swimmer for the <unk> <unk> sports club in Cremona , attended by the elite of the Cremonese bourgeoisie at the time . She met her first boyfriend , a fullback for the U.S. Cremonese football club , at the swimming pool at her age of 16 . 
 Mina fell in love with actor Corrado Pani in 1962 . Their relationship shocked Italian audiences as he was already married although separated from his wife . Their son , Massimiliano Pani , was born on 18 April 1963 . Due to Mina 's refusal to hide the relationship , the singer was banned from performing on public Italian television or radio channels . As her record sales were unaffected and audiences demanded to see Mina on the air , RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964 . Within a year , her affair with Corrado ended . 
 Mina 's brother Alfredo Mazzini died in a car accident in 1965 . A year later she and her father moved to Lugano , Switzerland . Mina 's intimate relationships , however , remained in Italy , as she had a brief affair with the actor Walter Chiari . A later relationship with actor Gian Maria Volontè ended after she found out about Volontè 's affair with an actress . Mina 's great love of the late 1960s , with whom she had a relationship that lasted three years and almost led to marriage , was the composer Augusto Martelli . Her second spouse was Virgilio Crocco , a journalist for Il <unk> , in 1970 . As a result of their marriage , her legal name was changed to Anna Maria Mazzini Crocco . Their daughter Benedetta Mazzini was born on 11 November 1971 . Crocco died in a car accident in 1973 . 
 Mina became engaged to her current husband , cardiologist Eugenio Quaini , in 1981 . They were married on 10 January 2006 in Lugano . She obtained Swiss citizenship in 1989 . As required in that country , she took on her husband 's last name and her legal name became Anna Maria Quaini . To her public , however , she still addresses herself as Mina Mazzini , also seen in her website 's domain name .

 = Bill Quackenbush = 
 Hubert George " Bill " Quackenbush ( March 2 , 1922 – September 12 , 1999 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played for the Boston Bruins and Detroit Red Wings in the National Hockey League . During his 14 @-@ year career , he was the first defenceman to win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy . He won the award after playing the entire 1948 – 49 season without recording a penalty . The penalty @-@ less season was part of a total of 131 consecutive games he played without being assessed a penalty . Quackenbush , considered to be an elite offensive defenceman during his career , was named to the NHL All @-@ Star Team five times , played in eight NHL All @-@ Star games and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976 . 
 Following his retirement from professional ice hockey , he spent 18 years as head coach of various teams at Princeton University . Quackenbush coached men 's golf , and both the men 's and women 's ice hockey teams , at various times . He won eight Ivy League Championships with the men 's golf team and three with the women 's ice hockey team . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Quackenbush was born on March 2 , 1922 , in Toronto , Ontario . He was born Hubert George Quackenbush but was given the nickname Bill by his aunt who disliked his given name . He played hockey on outdoor rinks around Toronto during the Great Depression as a youth , and was one of the top high school athletes in Canada as a teenager . In addition to hockey , he was a renowned football and soccer player . During the War Years , he played for the famous Canadian soccer club Toronto Scottish . Quackenbush had an opportunity to play football professionally , but he decided to pursue a career in hockey . 
 Quackenbush began his junior career playing for the Toronto Native Sons of the Ontario Hockey Association . He scored 13 points in 13 games during the 1940 – 41 season . The following season , he played for the Brantford Lions , scoring 34 points in 23 games , and caught the attention of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Quackenbush signed as a free @-@ agent with the Red Wings on October 19 , 1942 , and played 10 games during the 1942 – 43 season before breaking his wrist . After recovering from the injury , Detroit assigned him to the American Hockey League where he joined the Indianapolis Capitals . He earned a regular position with the Red Wings during the 1943 – 44 season , scoring 4 goals and 18 points . In the next two seasons he averaged 21 points while only being assessed an average of 8 penalty minutes and scored a career high 11 goals in 1945 – 46 . The following season he earned his first post @-@ season honour , when he was named a Second Team NHL All @-@ Star . He was also named the Red Wings team MVP . He registered a career high 17 penalty minutes in 1947 – 48 and was named a First Team All @-@ Star . The season also saw the start of a streak of 131 consecutive games where Quackenbush was not assessed a penalty . It began with the final 5 regular season and 10 playoff games that year , continued through the entire 60 regular season and 11 playoff games during the 1948 – 49 season , and ended after 45 games of the 1949 – 50 season . At the conclusion of the 1948 – 49 season , he was awarded the Lady Byng Trophy , the NHL 's annual award for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct . He was the first defenceman to win the award , and remains one of only three in NHL history to capture the trophy . Detroit General Manager Jack Adams detested the award and felt that any player who won it did not belong on his team , so he promptly traded Quackenbush . He was sent to the Boston Bruins with Pete <unk> for Pete <unk> , Lloyd Durham , Clare Martin and Jimmy Peters , Sr. 
 Quackenbush became a fan favorite upon his arrival in Boston , where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin ( and fellow Hall of Famer ) Eddie Shore . In his first season in Boston , Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points . He continued to stay out of the penalty box , registering only 4 penalty minutes . However , it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All @-@ Star Team . The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950 – 51 , forcing the team to use several first year players . While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes , including a game where he played 55 minutes , it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max . It was the only time the two played professionally together . He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All @-@ Star . Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year . 
 Quackenbush retired following the 1955 – 56 season , having accumulated only 95 penalty minutes over 774 games . This averaged out to seven seconds a game , one of the lowest in NHL history for a player at any position . He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976 . 
 = = Personal = = 
 Following his NHL career , Quackenbush worked as a manufacturer 's agent while attending night school at Northeastern University in Boston , Massachusetts . At Northeastern , he earned an Associate 's degree in engineering . Quackenbush also became an assistant coach at Northeastern . 
 In 1967 , he became the head coach for Princeton University 's men 's ice hockey team , a position he would hold for six seasons . His best season was his first in 1967 – 68 , when the Tigers posted a 13 – 10 – 0 record . It was the highest win total for Princeton since 1935 – 36 . However , his success with the men 's ice hockey team would not last ; Princeton won no more than five games for their next five seasons . His worst campaign was in 1970 – 71 , when Princeton had two 11 game losing streaks and a 1 – 22 – 0 overall record . Because of this , Quackenbush stepped down as the head coach in 1973 . In 1969 he began coaching the Princeton men 's golf team . He enjoyed much greater success with the golf team , leading them to eight Ivy League championships . In 1978 Princeton started a women 's ice hockey team , and Quackenbush was asked to coach them . He was still coaching the golf team but decided to accept the additional position and led them to three consecutive Ivy League championships between 1982 and 1984 . Quackenbush retired from coaching in 1985 , after which he moved to Orlando , Florida , where he lived for several years before moving to New Jersey in 1997 . 
 He married Joan <unk> and the couple had three sons , Bruce , Scott and Todd . At the time of his death , Quackenbush also had seven grandchildren . He died of pneumonia and complications from Alzheimer 's disease on September 12 , 1999 , at Chandler Hall Hospice in Newtown , Pennsylvania , at the age of 77 . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Quackenbush was an offensive defenceman who carried the puck up the ice , making use of his stick handling , passing skills and ability to read the play . Over the course of his career , he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL . He was a solid checker , but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play . This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes and the fact that he was assessed only one major penalty throughout his NHL career . 
 Defensively he made use of poke checks to take the puck from his opponents and excelled at getting to loose pucks and clearing them out of the defensive zone . He was adept at keeping opposing forwards from creating offense from behind the net .

 = Joint custody ( United States ) = 
 Joint custody is a court order whereby custody of a child is awarded to both parties . In joint custody both parents are custodial parents and neither parent is a non @-@ custodial parent , or , in other words , the child has two custodial parents . In the United States , many states recognize two forms of joint custody , which include joint physical custody ( called also " shared custody " or " shared placement " ) and joint legal custody . In joint physical custody , the actual lodging and care of the child is shared according to a court @-@ ordered custody schedule . In joint legal custody , both parents share the ability to have access to their children 's records , such as educational records , health records , and other records . 
 = = History of joint custody = = 
 In England , prior to the nineteenth century , common law considered children to be the property of their father . However , the economic and social changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family . Industrialization separated the home and the workplace , keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family . Conversely , mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children . Important social changes such as women 's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care . 
 There has been a major shift which is favoring joint custody in the United States court system , which began in the mid @-@ 1980s . This change has shifted the emphasis from having the need for the child to have an attachment to one " psychological " parent to the need to have an ongoing relationship between both parents . 
 Originally , joint legal custody meant joint custody . In this joint legal custody arrangement , the child 's parents shared responsibility over discussing issues related to the child @-@ rearing . In these arrangements with joint legal custody , one of the parents was awarded physical custody , which designated them as the primary parent , or one of the parents was allowed to determine the primary residence of the children . Though this implied that both parents had a " significant period " of time with the children , it did nothing to ensure this factor , which meant that the parent without primary custody of the child could end up having little opportunity to see his or her children . 
 Increasingly , however , joint physical custody , in many U.S. states , is used with the presumption of equal shared parenting , however , in most states , it is still viewed as creating a necessity to provide each of the parents with " significant periods " of physical custody to ensure the children " frequent and continuing contact " with both parents . 
 = = Concept of joint custody = = 
 Many U.S. states recognize two forms of joint custody , which include joint physical custody , and joint legal custody . Joint custody , as a theory , has many different meanings across the United States , which involves different presumptions . One possibility of this meaning is that there is sole legal custody of the children with one of the parents , but there is a division of time in which the child spends time with both parents with a shared residence situation for the children . Alternatively , the children could primarily reside with only one of the parents , but have the authority over decision making be shared between the parents , which allows the parent who does not have the child residing with him or her to have authority over the children , but little chance for a strong relationship . 
 Joint physical custody and joint legal custody are different aspects of the joint custody arrangement , and determination is often made separately in many U.S. states ' divorce courts . Therefore , it is possible for one parent to have physical custody while sharing legal custody , or inversely , it is possible for one parent to have legal custody while sharing physical custody . In some states this is referred to as custodial parent and <unk> parent . 
 Also , where there is joint physical custody , terms of art such as " primary custodial parent " and " primary residence " have no legal meaning other than for determining tax status , and both parents are still custodial parents . 
 = = = Joint legal custody = = = 
 Upon getting a divorce , a judge will decide the next few steps for any children involved when dealing with joint legal custody . It ’ s typical , with two parents , for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent to have some sort of visitation rights . Joint legal custody can be awarded to either both of the parents or just one of the parents , depending on the situation and the judgments . Joint legal custody involves having the parents make difficult decisions for their children . The parents decide how to raise their children in matters of schooling , spirituality , social events , sports religion , medical concerns , and other commonplace decisions . In joint legal custody , both parents share the ability to have access to their children 's records , such as educational records , health records , and other records . Both parents have equal decision @-@ making status where the welfare and safety of the children is concerned . This generally entails that both parents must be involved for major legal matters concerning the children , but the " day @-@ to @-@ day " matters and issues are left to the parent who has physical custody of the children . 
 = = = = Benefits and criticisms of joint legal custody = = = = 
 There are some inherent benefits to this form of custody arrangement . One main benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents are legal equals , which means that both parents influence important decisions in the child 's upbringing , which leads to less animosity and negativity between the parents , along with encouraging both parents to be proactive in the child 's upbringing . A second benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents exhibit a feeling of well being knowing they are working together in making decisions based on what their child 's / children 's needs are . This form of joint custody enables parents to focus solely on the children , with the emphasis on the health and well @-@ being of the child / children . By doing so , this has the potential to reverse some of the emotional effects on the children in the long @-@ run . Another benefit of joint legal custody is that it fosters an environment in which the parents of the child have some form of a means of communication in which open dialogue can lead to ensuring a safe , nurturing environment for the child . 
 When parents divorce and the children are in the picture , many problems will arise during the difficult process of determining custody . For instance , if there is an argument regarding joint legal custody , the process to earn legal custody will take longer than anticipated and will ultimately impact the relationship of the parents and the children . It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds , which , in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody . Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement is that it is a frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child 's life ( regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states ) , which generally leads to conflict . Additionally , in a joint legal custody arrangement , if the parents of the children do not get along , this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made about their children , which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved , but also for the parents . 
 = = = Joint physical custody = = = 
 In joint physical custody , which is also known as joint physical care , actual lodging and care of the child is shared according to a court @-@ ordered custody schedule ( also known as a " parenting plan " or " parenting schedule " ) . In many cases , the term visitation is no longer used in these circumstances , but rather is reserved to sole custody orders . In some states joint physical custody creates a presumption of equal shared parenting , however in most states , joint physical custody creates an obligation to provide each of the parents with " significant periods " of physical custody so as to assure the child of " frequent and continuing contact " with both parents . For example , states such as Alabama , California , and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time , whereas states such as Arizona , Georgia , and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible . Courts generally have not clearly defined what " significant periods " and " frequent and continuous contact " mean , which requires parents to litigate to find out . In some states , however , courts have provided a clear definition , for instance , in Nevada , the Supreme Court has defined joint physical custody as an arrangement where each parent has at least 40 % of the custodial time on a yearly basis . 
 = = = = Benefits and criticisms of joint physical custody = = = = 
 According to Gayle Smith , a family lawyer , there are some inherent benefits to a joint physical custody arrangement . One benefit of joint physical custody is that the burden of sole custody is not placed on the parent as the time involved in raising the children is divided among the two parties involved , allowing each of the parties more time to spend on their careers , for instance . A second benefit of joint physical custody is that the children will still have a " significant period " of time with each of the parents , which closely resembles the relationship before the marriage . A third benefit of joint physical custody is that it helps ensure that the children will grow up with both a male and a female role model , which may not be ensured through sole physical custody , for instance . 
 There are some inherent criticisms to joint physical custody . A criticism of the joint physical custody arrangement is that due to the nature of the arrangement , the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations , leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved , including the children . Research does not support this concern . Numerous studies found that parents with joint physical custody had lower levels of conflict . There are numerous opinions that the constant moving back and forth between two homes will have a negative impact on children emotionally . The feeling that there is " Mom 's House " and " Dad 's House " doesn 't leave anywhere for the children to feel is " my home " . 
 = = = = Three main statutes relating to joint custody = = = = 
 States tend to have one of three main statutes in relation to joint physical custody . One of the statutes states that joint physical custody is chosen over other arrangements unless it is not in the best interest for the children , or in other words it is the preferred arrangement . A second statute states that it is simply an option in which parents may request it or the judge can order it , but it is not necessarily the preferred arrangement . The last statute states that it may be ordered by a judge even against the wishes of the parents . 
 = = = Frequent joint custody arrangements = = = 
 Some more frequent parenting schedules include :

 = = Bird 's nest custody = = 
 Bird 's nest custody is a specific form of joint custody . Birds ' nest custody arrangements are arrangements in which , rather than having the children go from one parent 's house to the other parent 's house , the parents move in and out of the house that the children constantly reside in . The general reason for using this arrangement rather than a more commonly used arrangement is so that the burden of upheaval and moving is placed on the parents rather than the child / children . 
 = = Impact on families = = 
 Divorce is difficult on all parties involved in the process , including the children . Due to the stressful nature of divorce , along with inherent issues on the amount of time the children can spend with each parent , the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children . Unless the children 's parents are often involved in intense conflict , or one of the parents is abusive and / or mentally ill , the children tend to fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement . Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements , the children tend to exhibit better relationships with their families , better performance in their schools , higher levels of self @-@ esteem , and fewer conduct and emotional issues . Further , it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children ( or rather children who do not have divorced parents ) , where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children . However , joint physical custody with an even division of time is not always necessary . These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents . According to Robert Emery , a divorce mediation expert , " In many ways , joint physical custody is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents very much involved in their lives . " This statement has been supported by psychological data , however this effect is not seen in situations involving high @-@ conflict parental relationships . 
 The most important factor influencing a child 's well @-@ being and adjustment after divorce is exposure to positive parenting and relationships , followed closely by family economic stability . Children that come from families with low or contained parental conflict , effective and cooperative parenting , positive relationships , and economic stability are more likely to benefit psychologically following divorce , when compared to average children . A study that specifically supports this theory has found that adolescents assigned to a joint custody arrangement scored higher in behavioral , emotional , and academic functioning when compared to children who have been placed in sole custody arrangements . Furthermore , children in joint custody report higher self @-@ esteem and lower levels of behavioral issues and greater overall post @-@ divorce adjustment as opposed to children in sole custody arrangements . However , a child 's temperament and age have also been shown to have a strong impact on the child 's development . Children that have easygoing , adaptable temperaments are much more likely to benefit from the transitions that they will inevitably experience from a joint custody arrangement . Furthermore , some commentators believe that infants and preschoolers are not likely to benefit from joint custody arrangements due to the importance of a consistent routine and the security of a primary attachment figure at that age . This belief is not the accepted and settled view of mainstream scholars according to the <unk> consensus report published in an American Psychological Association journal with the endorsement of 110 researchers and practitioners , many of whom are prominent international authorities on attachment , early child development , and divorce . 
 The benefits for children to maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research . Children in joint custody arrangements often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also are less likely to feel torn between their parents when compared with children who are in sole custody arrangements . In addition , children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements . Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents . Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another , when compared to those in sole custody arrangements , but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships , effective parenting , and lower inter @-@ parental conflict ; key factors that ensure a child ’ s well @-@ being following divorce . However , it is important to point out that children are far less likely to do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents ' frequent , intense , and ongoing conflict . 
 No matter which side of the debate the experts are on , they all agree on one thing : All forms of custody work best with good communication and a willingness for the parents to work and to shield children from being involved in their parents ' disputes . 
 = = Other forms of custody = = 
 Alternating custody is an arrangement whereby the children live for an extended period of time with one parent , and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent . While the children are with the parent , that parent retains sole authority over the children . 
 Sole custody is an arrangement whereby only one parent has physical and legal custody of a child . 
 Split custody is an arrangement whereby one parent has full @-@ time custody over some children , and the other parent has full custody over the other children . 
 Third @-@ party custody is an arrangement in whereby the children do not remain with either biological parent , and are placed under the custody of a third person .

 The Brazilian monitor Santa Catharina ( in modern spelling , Santa Catarina ) was the sixth , and last , ship of the Pará @-@ class river monitors built for the Brazilian Navy during the Paraguayan War in the late 1860s . By the time she was completed the war was winding down and she only had one significant engagement against Paraguayan forces in 1869 .

 Santa Catharina was laid down at the Arsenal de Marinha da Côrte in Rio de Janeiro on 8 December 1866 , during the Paraguayan War , which saw Argentina and Brazil allied against Paraguay . She was launched on 5 May 1868 and commissioned the next month . She reached Paraguay in mid @-@ 1868 , when the war was winding down . Santa Catharina , together with her sister ships Ceará and Piauí , broke through the Paraguayan defenses at Guaraio on 29 April 1869 and drove off the defenders . The monitor provided fire support to the army for the rest of the war . After the war she was assigned to the Mato Grosso Flotilla . While docked for repairs in 1882 , Santa Catharina sank at her moorings due to the poor condition of her hull . Her ultimate fate is unknown . 
 = Mary , Queen of Hungary = 
 Mary , also known as Maria ( 1371 – 17 May 1395 ) , was Queen regnant of Hungary and Croatia between 1382 and 1385 , and from 1386 until her death . She was the daughter of Louis the Great , King of Hungary and Poland , and his wife , Elizabeth of Bosnia . Mary 's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg , a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty , was already decided before her first birthday . A delegation of Polish prelates and lords confirmed her right to succeed her father in Poland in 1379 . 
 Mary was crowned " king " of Hungary on 17 September 1382 , seven days after Louis the Great 's death . Her mother , who assumed regency , absolved the Polish noblemen from their oath of loyalty to Mary in favor of Mary 's younger sister , Hedwig , in early 1383 . The idea of a female monarch remained unpopular among the Hungarian noblemen , the majority of whom regarded Mary 's distant cousin , Charles III of Naples , as the lawful king . To strengthen Mary 's position , the queen mother wanted her to marry Louis , the younger brother of Charles VI of France . Their engagement was announced in May 1385 . 
 Charles III of Naples landed in Dalmatia in September 1385 . Sigismund of Luxemburg invaded Upper Hungary ( now Slovakia ) , forcing the queen mother to give Mary in marriage to him in October . However , they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda . After Mary renounced the throne , Charles was crowned king on 31 December 1385 , but he was murdered at the instigation of Mary 's mother in February 1386 . Mary was restored , but the murdered king 's supporters captured her and her mother on 25 July . Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387 , but Mary was released on 4 June 1387 . Mary officially remained the co @-@ ruler with Sigismund , who had meanwhile been crowned king , but her influence on the government was minimal . She and her premature son died after her horse threw her during a hunting trip . 
 = = Childhood ( 1371 – 1382 ) = = 
 Mary was born in the latter half of 1371 to Louis the Great , King of Hungary and Poland , and his second wife , Elizabeth of Bosnia . She was the second daughter of her parents . They had been childless for over a decade before Mary 's older sister , Catherine , was born in 1370 . Mary and Catherine gained another sibling , Hedwig , in 1374 . 
 Since Louis had fathered no sons , the expectation that he would bequeath Hungary , Poland , and his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence to his daughters made them desirable spouses for members of the European royal families . Before Mary 's first birthday , her father made a promise to Charles IV , Holy Roman Emperor , that Mary would marry the emperor 's second son , Sigismund of Luxembourg . Louis confirmed his promise in a deed in June 1373 . Mary and Sigismund were closely related , because her paternal grandmother , Elizabeth of Poland , was the sister of his great @-@ grandfather , Casimir III of Poland . Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6 December 1374 . The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis 's promise of Mary 's and Sigismund 's marriage on 14 April 1375 . 
 Mary 's older sister , Catherine , who had been betrothed to Louis of France , died in late 1378 . Louis the Great confirmed his earlier promise of Mary 's and Sigismund 's marriage to Sigismund 's brother , Wenceslaus , King of the Romans , in Zólyom ( now Zvolen in Slovakia ) in 1379 . Louis and Wenceslaus also agreed that they would acknowledge Urban VI as the lawful pope against Clement VII . Mary was formally engaged to Sigismund in Nagyszombat ( now Trnava in Slovakia ) in the same year . Sigismund , who had meanwhile become Margrave of Brandenburg , came to Hungary . 
 Louis summoned the Polish prelates and lords to Kassa ( now Košice in Slovakia ) in September 1379 , persuading them to acknowledge Mary 's right to succeed him in Poland . The contemporaneous Jan of Czarnków , who was biased against Louis , recorded that the Poles yielded to the monarch 's demand only after he had prevented them from leaving the town by shutting its gates . At a meeting with Leopold III , Duke of Austria in early 1380 , Louis strongly hinted that he would bequeath Hungary to his younger daughter , Hedwig , who had been engaged to Leopold III 's son , William . Upon Louis 's demand , a delegation of the Polish noblemen again paid homage to Sigismund and Mary on 25 July 1382 . According to the historian Oscar Halecki , Louis wished to divide his kingdoms between his two surviving daughters , but Pál Engel and Claude Michaud write that the ailing king wanted to bequeath both Hungary and Poland on Mary and Sigismund .

 Louis the Great died on 10 September 1382 . Cardinal Demetrius , Archbishop of Esztergom , crowned Mary " king " with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 17 September , a day after her father 's burial . Mary 's title and her rapid coronation in the absence of her fiancé , Sigismund , show that her mother and her mother 's supporters wanted to emphasize Mary 's role as monarch and to postpone or even hinder Sigismund 's coronation . 
 The queen mother , Elizabeth , assumed regency . Palatine Nicholas Garai and Cardinal Demetrius became her main advisors . Most of Louis 's barons preserved their offices ; the queen mother only dismissed the master of the cupbearers , George Czudar , and his brother Peter , voivode of Ruthenia . According to the 15th @-@ century historian Jan Długosz , the Czudar brothers surrendered forts to the Lithuanians , who had " [ h ] <unk> bribed " them . Queen Elizabeth had Peter Czudar imprisoned before 1 November ; her charters only stated that he " had obviously been disloyal " without specifying the reasons for his arrest . 
 All royal charters issued during the first six months of Mary 's reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father 's crown . However , most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch . They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great 's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou . Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary , because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples , Louis I , Duke of Anjou – who was Charles VI of France 's uncle – had invaded Southern Italy in the previous year . 
 Noblemen from Greater Poland offered to pay homage to either Mary or Hedwig at a meeting in <unk> on 25 November , but they stipulated that the queen and her husband should live in Poland . The assembly of the nobility of Lesser Poland passed a similar resolution in Wiślica on 12 December . On the latter occasion , in response to Queen Elizabeth 's demand , the noblemen also promised that they would not pay homage to anyone else than either Mary or Hedwig . Mary 's fiancé , Sigismund , who had stayed in Poland , returned to Hungary . <unk> , Archbishop of Gniezno , the <unk> family , and their allies in Greater Poland favored a native prince , Siemowit IV of Masovia . To avoid a civil war , Queen Elizabeth sent envoys to the Polish noblemen 's next assembly which met in Sieradz in late February 1383 . Her envoys absolved the Poles from their 1382 oath of loyalty to Mary on 28 March , announcing that the queen mother would send her younger daughter , Hedwig , to Poland . 
 John of Palisna , Prior of Vrana , rose up in open rebellion against the rule of Mary and her mother in the spring of 1383 . The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia . The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana , forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia . The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary , who had been present during the siege along with her mother , on 4 November . To strengthen Mary 's position against Charles of Naples , Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of Charles VI of France , Louis , who had once been engaged to Mary 's sister , Catherine . Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year . Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi , who used draconian measures to put an end to a conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384 . 
 Although the last Diet was held in the early 1350s , the queens convoked a Diet to deal with the grievances of the noblemen . Mary confirmed her father 's decrees of 1351 summarizing the noblemen 's privileges on 22 June 1384 . The negotiations of Mary 's marriage in France caused a new rift within the Hungarian nobility , because the Lackfis , Nicholas Zámbó and Nicholas Szécsi and other high officers , who had been appointed during Louis the Great 's reign , continued to support Mary 's fiancé , Sigismund , in accordance with Louis the Great 's will . The queen mother replaced them with Nicholas Garai 's supporters in August 1384 . The prelates were also opposed to the French marriage , because the French supported Clement VII whom the Hungarian clergy considered an antipope . Mary 's sister , Hedwig , went to Poland where she was crowned on 16 October 1384 . Cardinal Demetrius , who had accompanied Hedwig to Poland , remained absent from the queens ' court after his return to Hungary . The royal government could not properly function during his absence because he was the keeper of the royal seal .

 Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384 , enabling his rival , Charles III of Naples , to stabilize his rule in Southern Italy during the next months . The consolidation of Charles III 's position in Naples also contributed to the formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary . John Horvat , Ban of Macsó ( now Mačva in Serbia ) , and his brother , Paul , Bishop of Zagreb , were the leading figures of their movement . Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary , but she refused him . He left Hungary in early 1385 . 
 The queens and their supporters initiated negotiations with the representatives of the opposition , but no reconciliation was reached at their meeting in Požega in the spring of 1385 . After a French delegation came to Hungary in May 1385 , Mary was engaged to Louis of France . Louis of France thereafter signed his letters " Louis of France , King of Hungary " , according to Jean Froissart . In the same month , the queen mother dismissed Stephen Lackfi , accusing him of high treason . She also sent letters to Zagreb and other places in the kingdom , forbidding the local inhabitants to support Lackfi , Nicholas Szécsi , Bishop Paul Horvat and their relatives . John and Paul Horvat and their allies formally offered the crown to Charles III of Naples and invited him to Hungary in August . In the same month , Mary confirmed Tvrtko I of Bosnia 's acquisition of Kotor in Dalmatia . Sigismund stormed into Upper Hungary , accompanied by his cousins , Jobst and Prokop of Moravia , and occupied Pozsony County . The queen mother replaced Nicholas Garai with Nicholas Szécsi , and made Stephen Lackfi voivode of Transylvania and Nicholas Zámbó master of the treasury . 
 Charles III of Naples landed at Senj in Dalmatia in September 1385 and marched to Zagreb . Sigismund of Luxembourg came to Buda and persuaded the queen mother to give her consent to his marriage to Mary . The marriage took place in Buda in October , but Sigismund was not crowned king and received no governmental function . The queen mother convoked a new Diet and Mary again confirmed the noblemen 's liberties , but the queens ' rule remained unpopular . Sigismund left Buda and mortgaged the territories west of the River Vág to his Moravian cousins . Charles of Naples had meanwhile left Zagreb , stating that he wanted to restore peace and public order in Hungary . 
 = = = Charles 's reign ( 1385 – 1386 ) = = = 
 Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda . Mary and her mother received him ceremoniously before he reached Buda , and he entered the capital in the two queens ' company in early December 1385 . Mary renounced the crown without resistance in the middle of December out of fear that Charles would kill her . Charles first adopted the title governor , but the Diet elected him king . Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31 December . According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de <unk> , Mary and her mother , who attended Charles 's coronation , visited Louis the Great 's tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate . 
 Charles did not detain Mary and her mother who continued to live in the royal palace in Buda . Queen Elizabeth and Nicholas Garai decided to get rid of Charles . They persuaded Blaise Forgách , the master of the cupbearers , to join them , promising him the domain of Gimes ( now <unk> in Slovakia ) if he murdered the king . Upon Queen Elizabeth 's request , Charles visited her and her daughter on 7 February 1386 . During the meeting , Blaise Forgách attacked the king , seriously injuring him on the head . The wounded King Charles was carried to Visegrád where he died on 24 February .

 Mary was restored to the throne , with her mother ruling in her name . The queen mother informed the citizens of Kőszeg already on 14 February that " Queen Mary had regained the Holy Crown " . However , the Horvat brothers rose up in open rebellion on behalf of the murdered king 's son , Ladislaus of Naples . Mary 's husband , Sigismund , and his brother , Wenceslaus , invaded Upper Hungary in April . After weeks of negotiations , the queens acknowledged Sigismund 's position as consort in a treaty which was signed in Győr in early May . They also confirmed Sigismund 's mortgage of the lands west of the Vág to Jobst and Prokop of Moravia . After the treaty was signed , the queens returned to Buda and Sigismund went to Bohemia , suggesting that he was dissatisfied with the treaty . 
 Queen Elizabeth , who according to the 15th @-@ century historian Johannes de Thurocz was " driven by folly " , decided to visit the southern counties of the kingdom that were controlled by supporters of Ladislaus of Naples . The queen mother and Mary set out for Đakovo , accompanied by Nicholas Garai and a modest following around 15 July . However , John <unk> , John of Palisna and their retainers ambushed and attacked the queens and their retinue at Gorjani on 25 July . The queens ' small entourage fought the attackers , but all were killed or captured . Blaise Forgách and Nicholas Garai were beheaded and their heads were thrown into the queens ' carriage . Elizabeth took all blame for the rebellion and begged the attackers to spare her daughter 's life , according to Johannes de Thurocz 's account . 
 Mary and her mother were imprisoned . They were held in captivity in <unk> Castle , which was a fortress of the Bishopric of Zagreb . In the queens ' absence , the barons of the realm convoked a Diet under the newly carved " seal of the <unk> " . On Queen Mary 's behalf , they promised a general pardon , but the <unk> refused to submit . The two queens were dragged to Krupa , and from there to Novigrad Castle on the coast of the Adriatic Sea . The barons or the Diet elected Stephen Lackfi palatine and made Sigismund of Luxembourg regent . John Horvat 's henchmen strangled Queen Elizabeth in Mary 's presence in early January . In the same month , Sigismund invaded Slavonia , but could not defeat the rebels . 
 Taking advantage of the anarchy in Hungary , Polish troops invaded Lodomeria and Halych in February . Only Vladislaus II of Opole , who claimed the two realms for himself , protested against their action . Sigismund was crowned king on 31 March as it was decided that the kingdom could no longer be without an effective ruler . One of his supporters , Ivan of Krk , laid siege to Novigrad Castle with the assistance of a Venetian fleet , which was under the command of Giovanni Barbarigo . They captured the castle and liberated Mary on 4 June 1387 . She was especially grateful to Barbarigo ; she knighted him and granted an annuity of 600 golden florins to him .

 Mary met her husband in Zagreb on 4 July . She officially remained Sigismund 's co @-@ ruler until the end of her life , but her influence on government was minimal . Sigismund 's land grants were always confirmed with Mary 's own great seal during the first year of their common rule , but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation . Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension , but from her husband 's coronation . Nevertheless , Mary persuaded her husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life . 
 Mary was pregnant when she decided to venture out alone on a hunt in a Buda forest on 17 May 1395 . Her horse tripped , threw her and landed on top of her . The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son . The queen succumbed to the fatal injuries ; being far from any kind of assistance , her son died as well . She was buried in the cathedral of Várad ( now Oradea in Romania ) . Mary 's sister , Hedwig , claimed the crown , but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty .

 " Shine " is a song recorded by American singer Gwen Stefani and featuring vocals by American singer Pharrell Williams . Originally intended for the band No Doubt , it was written and produced by Williams , with additional songwriting from Stefani , as the theme song for the 2014 animated film Paddington . " Shine " is a pop song that incorporates elements of reggae pop and ska , and features lyrics that revolve around the lead character Paddington Bear 's journey to London and his identity crisis . Stefani initially disagreed with Williams ' choice to use literal references to Paddington , like " bear " and " station " , in the lyrics . She later praised the lyrics after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animation for the Paddington Bear character . She reported that her involvement with the recording was inspired by her then husband Gavin Rossdale and her children 's connection to England . 
 The track was released on January 13 , 2015 , through a lyric video on The Weinstein Company 's YouTube channel . The song was also promoted in the American trailer for the film . While a low @-@ quality version leaked on December 31 , 2014 , a full version of the record remains unreleased digitally . It was omitted from the film 's soundtrack , and was not included on Stefani 's third studio album This Is What the Truth Feels Like ( 2016 ) . The lyric video is included on the DVD and Blu @-@ ray releases of the film . Critical response to " Shine " was mixed . Some critics praised Stefani and Williams ' chemistry as a team , while others compared it negatively to their previous collaborations and singles . It was frequently compared to <unk> ' 2013 single " Happy " , and Stefani and Williams ' 2014 song " Spark the Fire " .

 " Shine " was written and produced by Pharrell Williams , with additional songwriting from Gwen Stefani . In November 2014 , Stefani and Williams announced that they were collaborating on a song for the animated film Paddington . The pair had collaborated previously on the singles : " Hella Good " , " Can I Have It Like That " , " Hollaback Girl " , and " Spark the Fire " . They also served as judges on the American reality television singing competition The Voice in 2014 . Williams initially pitched " Shine " to Stefani as a song for No Doubt , a band in which Stefani is the lead vocalist . Stefani later commented that she immediately noticed similarities between the demo and her music with No Doubt and played it for the rest of the band to get their reaction . No Doubt recorded their version in late 2014 , with Patrick Doyle from Rolling Stone reporting that Stefani was working with the band on a song for the Paddington soundtrack . Despite the announcement , Doyle wrote that : " the song may now be released as a Pharrell / Stefani track " . 
 In an official statement , film executive Bob Weinstein called Stefani and Williams " the perfect artistic duo " , saying their work " brought to life the charm that Paddington represents " . Stefani said her involvement was motivated by her personal connection to the film 's English setting through her marriage to English musician Gavin Rossdale . She said the film and the track allowed her children to " recognize where they come from " . Williams considered the song to be : " a wonderful opportunity , as a parent , to contribute to something as classic , authentic and generational to all of our lives , as Paddington Bear " ; Stefani said that she was : " honored to join forces with Pharrell and be part of bringing this beloved classic to life for Paddington 's next big adventure " . Williams called the song " a trailer into a wonderful family experience " and developed its concept from his children 's connection with Paddington Bear .

 " Shine " is a reggae pop and ska song that lasts three minutes and twenty @-@ four seconds . It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute . Instrumentation is provided by strings , horns , a guitar , and a piano to create a " crawling beat " . March <unk> of Thought Catalog described the song as having " that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful " . Digital Spy 's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a : " ska @-@ flecked romp of pumped @-@ up foghorns and plodding brass " . A writer from Capital <unk> described the song as having a " mellow beat " while Rolling Stone 's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a " party @-@ vibe production " . 
 During the track , Stefani 's vocal range spans two octaves , from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4 . Williams equated Stefani 's tone to that of a " child <unk> " due to her ability to make music that appeals to children . The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels . Rolling Stone called it : " a pop @-@ reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis " . The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus , with lyrics including " When you 're trying to get home / When you don 't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That 's your way home . " The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing " Shine ! " while Williams screams " Hey ! " . Andy Morris from Gigwise described the lyrics , " So we 're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation " and " that bear with the red hat " , as obvious references to Paddington . According to Daniel Sannwald of Rolling Stone , the lyrics include " Pharrell 's ' Happy " <unk> ' Everybody is the same inside ' bridge " that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents " without sounding overly patronizing " . The song ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register . 
 In an interview with MTV News , Stefani said that she disagreed initially with Williams ' approach to the lyrics ; while he " was very specific about the lyrics " and wanted to include words directly connected to the film and its character like " bear " , " Paddington " , " station " , Stefani said that she " wanted it to be a little more abstract " . She later reversed this view , saying that she agreed with Williams ' interpretation of the lyrics after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animations of the Paddington Bear character . In an interview with American Top 40 's Kathleen Perricone , Stefani credited Williams as being central to the song 's development , saying that he was : " the one who really got in there and was able to channel the film lyrically and make it really happen " . MTV 's John Walker questioned whether it could repeat the success of Williams ' previous single " Happy " from the 2013 animated film Despicable Me 2 .

 While a low @-@ quality version leaked on December 31 , 2014 , a full version of the record remains unreleased for consumer consumption . A minute and thirty @-@ five second video displaying clips from the film was uploaded to The Weinstein Company 's YouTube channel on January 13 , 2015 ; it received over two million views in 24 hours . The video featured scenes from the film in which : " the iconic Peruvian bear finds himself in all manner of mishaps while trying to find a home and ultimately working his way into our hearts " . It is included on the DVD and Blu @-@ ray releases along with a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes feature on the making of the song . Matthew Jacobson of The Spectrum , a newspaper which is part of the USA Today Network , criticized the video for being " just clips of the movie set to a song " rather than a proper music video . Alternatively , Cinemablend.com 's Jessica <unk> found the video to be " <unk> " and a reviewer from <unk> enjoyed being able to sing along with the lyrics . 
 " Shine " is featured in the American trailer and the closing credits for Paddington , but was not included in the British version of the film . Idolator 's Christina Lee wrote that the track was : " a U.S. and Canada exclusive for Paddington " . The song was excluded from the film 's soundtrack and Stefani 's third studio album This Is What the Truth Feels Like ( 2016 ) . During an interview with Stefani and Williams on January 21 , 2015 , radio host Ryan Seacrest erroneously announced the song was available for purchase on the ITunes Store .

 " Shine " received mixed reviews from music critics . E ! News ' Bruna Nessif gave the song a positive review , stating : " When it comes to feel @-@ good music , leave it up to Gwen Stefani and Pharrell to get the job done " . A reviewer from Vibe praised it as " the perfect theme song " . Abe Dewing , a member of the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra , described it as a " sharp , hip tune " in the Boston Herald . He compared its opening trumpet riff to music by British composer Herbert Chappell , who created the theme for the 1975 television series Paddington . Chappell also composed music for the 1986 concerto " Paddington Bear 's First Concert " , which premiered as a part of the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra Family Concerts . Dewing praised Stefani and <unk> ' ability : " to compose new music for existing source material intended for children " . A reviewer from the website <unk> described the recording as " even more feel good " than the pair 's collaboration on " Spark the Fire " . After listening to the leaked version of the song , Aaron Butterfield of the BreatheHeavy website called it : " a catchy tune which feels much more like vintage Stefani than anything we 've seen so far this era " . Rolling Stone 's Daniel Sannwald gave it three and a half stars out of five , praising its " party @-@ vibe production " , and favorably comparing its melody to the chorus of Irish rock band The Cranberries 's 1994 single " Zombie " . Sannwald felt that it would appeal to both children and their parents . 
 Negative reviews criticized " Shine " for lacking the energy of Williams ' and Stefani 's previous releases . Kevin Apaza of Direct Lyrics described it as " just average " and said it was worse than " Spark the Fire " . In response to the leaked version , Music Times ' Carolyn Menyes wrote that it was too slow in comparison to the " crazy , happy beats and <unk> hand claps " of " Happy " and the " inane catchiness " of Stefani 's previous singles " Spark the Fire " and " Baby Don 't Lie " . Menyes was critical of Stefani 's vocals , saying she used " an oddly harsh tone " throughout the song . Steven Pond of TheWrap wrote that Stefani 's vocal delivery " never quite crosses the line to catchy " . 
 " Shine " was included in the list of 79 contenders for the Academy Award for Best Original Song , but it did not receive a nomination .

 = USS Illinois ( BB @-@ 65 ) = 
 Illinois ( BB @-@ 65 ) was to have been the fifth Iowa @-@ class battleship constructed for the United States Navy and was the fourth ship to be named in honor of the 21st US state . 
 Hull BB @-@ 65 was originally to be the first ship of the Montana @-@ class battleships , but changes during World War II resulted in her being reordered as an Iowa @-@ class battleship . Adherence to the Iowa @-@ class layout rather than the Montana @-@ class layout allowed BB @-@ 65 to gain eight knots in speed , carry more 20 mm and 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns , and transit the locks of the Panama Canal ; however , the move away from the Montana @-@ class layout left BB @-@ 65 with a reduction in the heavier armaments and without the additional armor that were to have been added to BB @-@ 65 during her time on the drawing board as USS Montana . 
 Like her sister ship Kentucky , Illinois was still under construction at the end of World War II . Her construction was canceled in August 1945 , but her hull remained until 1958 when it was broken up . 
 = = Design = = 
 The passage of the Second Vinson Act in 1938 had cleared the way for construction of the four South Dakota @-@ class battleships and the first two Iowa @-@ class fast battleships ( those with the hull numbers BB @-@ 61 and BB @-@ 62 ) . The latter four battleships of the class , those designated with the hull numbers BB @-@ 63 , BB @-@ 64 , BB @-@ 65 , and BB @-@ 66 were not cleared for construction until 1940 , and at the time BB @-@ 65 and BB @-@ 66 were intended to be the first ships of the Montana class . 
 Originally , BB @-@ 65 was to be the United States Navy 's counter to the Empire of Japan 's Yamato @-@ class battleships , whose construction at the time was known to the highest @-@ ranking members of the United States Navy , along with the rumors that the Yamato @-@ class ships would carry guns of up to 18 in ( 460 mm ) . To combat this , the United States Navy began designing a 58 @,@ 000 ton ship with an intended armament of twelve 16 in ( 410 mm ) guns . This battleship took shape in the mid @-@ 1930s as USS Montana , the lead ship of her class of battleships . She would have fielded three more 16 in ( 410 mm ) guns than those mounted aboard the Iowa class , a more powerful secondary battery of 5 in ( 130 mm ) / 54 caliber Mark 16 dual purpose mounts , and an increase in armor designed to enable Montana to withstand the effects of enemy guns comparable to her own . 
 The increase in Montana 's firepower and armor came at the expense of her speed and her Panamax capabilities , but the latter issue was to be resolved through the construction of a third , much wider set of locks at the Panama Canal . As the situation in Europe deteriorated in the late @-@ 1930s , the USA began to be concerned once more about its ability to move warships between the oceans . The largest US battleships were already so large as to have problems with the canal locks ; and there were concerns about the locks being put out of action by enemy bombing . In 1939 , to address these concerns , construction began on a new set of locks for the canal that could carry the larger warships which the US had either under construction or planned for future construction . These locks which would have enabled Montana to transit between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans without the need to sail around the tip of South America . As USS Montana , BB @-@ 65 would have been the only battleship class commissioned by the US to approach the Imperial Japanese Navy 's Yamato class on the basis of armor , armament , and tonnage . 
 By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to aircraft carriers after the successes of carrier combat in both the Battle of the Coral Sea , and to a greater extent , the Battle of Midway . As a result , the construction of the US fleet of Essex @-@ class aircraft carriers had been given the highest priority for completion in the US shipyards by the US Navy . The Essex @-@ class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by enabling the Allies to gain and maintain air supremacy in the Pacific War , and were rapidly becoming the principal striking arm of the United States Navy in the ongoing effort to defeat the Empire of Japan . Accordingly , the United States accepted shortcomings in the armor for their North Carolina @-@ class battleships , South Dakota @-@ class , and Iowa @-@ class battleships in favor of additional speed , which enabled these battleship classes to steam at a comparable speed with the Essex @-@ class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti @-@ aircraft protection . 
 = = Development = = 
 When BB @-@ 65 was redesignated an Iowa @-@ class battleship , she was assigned the name Illinois and reconfigured to adhere to the " fast battleship " designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair . Her funding was authorized via the passage of the Two @-@ Ocean Navy Act by the US Congress on 19 July 1940 , and she would now be the fifth Iowa @-@ class battleship built for the United States Navy . Her contract was assigned on 9 September 1940 , the same date as Kentucky . Illinois 's keel was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard , on 6 December 1942 ; her projected completion date was 1 May 1945 . This amounted to a construction time of about 30 months . She would be tasked primarily with the defense of the US fleet of Essex @-@ class aircraft carriers . In adherence with the Iowa @-@ class design , Illinois would have a maximum beam of 108 ft ( 33 m ) and a waterline length of 860 ft ( 260 m ) , permitting a maximum speed of 32 @.@ 5 knots ( 60 @.@ 2 km / h ) . 
 Like Kentucky , Illinois differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all @-@ welded construction , which would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted / welded hull used on the four completed Iowa @-@ class ships . Engineers considered retaining the original Montana @-@ class armor for added torpedo and naval mine protection because the newer scheme would have improved Illinois 's armor protection by as much as 20 % . This was rejected due to time constraints and Illinois was built with an Iowa @-@ class hull design . Funding for the battleship was provided in part by " King Neptune " , a Hereford swine auctioned across the state of Illinois as a fundraiser , ultimately helping to raise $ 19 million in war bonds . 
 = = Fate = = 
 Illinois 's construction was put on hold in 1942 after the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway , while the Bureau of Ships considered an aircraft carrier conversion proposal for Illinois and Kentucky . As proposed , the converted Illinois would have had an 864 @-@ foot ( 263 m ) long by 108 @-@ foot ( 33 m ) wide flight deck , with an armament identical to the carriers of the Essex class : four twin 5 @-@ inch gun mounts and four more 5 @-@ inch guns in single mounts , along with six 40 mm quadruple mounts . It was abandoned after the design team decided that the converted carriers would carry fewer aircraft than the Essex class , that more Essex @-@ class carriers could be built in the same amount of time to convert the battleships , and that the conversion project would be significantly more expensive than new Essexes . Instead , Illinois and Kentucky were to be completed as battleships , but their construction was given very low priority . 
 Ultimately , the ship was canceled on 11 August 1945 , when she was about 22 % complete . She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945 . Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the belief that it could be used as a target in nuclear weapons tests . The cost to complete the ship enough to be able to launch her — some $ 30 million — was too great , however , and the plan was abandoned . She remained in the dockyard until September 1958 , when she was broken up on the builder 's ways . 
 The ship 's bell was cast , and is now at the Memorial Stadium at the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign . It reads USS Illinois 1946 . The bell is on loan from the Naval Historical Center ( Accession # 70 @-@ 399 @-@ A ) , Washington Navy Yard , Washington DC , to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps ( NROTC ) at the university . The bell is traditionally rung by NROTC members when the football team scores a touchdown or goal . 
 = Boughton Monchelsea Place = 
 Boughton Monchelsea Place , previously Boughton Court , is a 16th @-@ century country house in Boughton Monchelsea , Kent , England . The first part of the house was built by Robert Rudston circa 1567 – 75 on the site of an earlier manor house . It has been modified a number of times during its history achieving its present form in 1819 . It has been a home to a number of members of parliament for Maidstone or for Kent , including Sir Francis Barnham ( owner 1613 – 46 ) , Sir Robert Barnham ( 1646 – 85 ) Sir Barnham Rider ( 1698 – 1728 ) and Thomas Rider ( 1805 – 47 ) . 
 The house sits on a south facing slope giving views across the extensive deer park and the Weald beyond . Kitchen gardens to the north of the house remain as remnants of 16th @-@ century formal garden planting . The house is a Grade I listed building and its barn is listed Grade II . The parks and gardens are listed Grade II . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the sixteenth century , the manor of Boughton Monchelsea passed by marriage or sale through the ownership of several families of minor gentry . From 1214 , the manor was in the possession of the <unk> family . On the death of Robert de <unk> in 1317 , it passed to his daughter Benedicta , wife of John de <unk> . On her death in 1349 without a male heir , the manor was divided between her daughters Helen and Joan . 
 The portion of the manor of which the Boughton Monchelsea Place estate was part passed to Joan de <unk> 's husband John Brampton . The estate then passed to his daughter Benedicta , wife of Thomas Towne , and to her daughter Benedicta , wife of William Watton . Around 1460 , Watton sold the estate to Reginald Peckham who recombined the two parts of the manor . On the death of Peckham 's grandson Thomas Peckham in 1521 , the manor was left to his daughter . Her husband quickly sold the estate to Sir Thomas Wyatt . 
 His son , Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger , sold the estate to Robert Rudston in 1551 . Following Rudston 's involvement in Wyatt 's rebellion against Mary I , he was fortunate to be reprieved from a death sentence , though his estate was confiscated by the Crown . It was restored to him when Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558 . Rudston had the first parts of the current house built circa 1567 – 75 as an extension to an earlier house to the west . 
 Rudston 's son Isaac next owned the house . On his death without a son , he left the house to his brother Belknap Rudston , who , on his death in 1613 , left it to Sir Francis Barnham , several times member of parliament for Maidstone . Sir Francis 's son Sir Robert Barnham next occupied the house , taking the manor 's name as his territorial designation when created a baronet in 1663 . Sir Robert served as MP for Maidstone in the Convention Parliament of 1660 and in the Cavalier Parliament from 1661 to 1679 . His son Francis predeceased him and , on his death around 1685 , the estate was inherited by his daughter Philadelphia Barnham , wife of Thomas Rider . 
 Thomas Rider was MP for Maidstone in 1690 and from 1696 to 1698 . He carried out a number of alterations to the house and its grounds between 1685 and 1690 . Following his death in 1698 , the estate was inherited by his son Sir Barnham Rider , MP for Maidstone from 1722 to 1727 , and then his son , Thomas Rider . The second Thomas Rider left the house to his cousin Ingram Rider in 1786 . In 1805 , Ingram Rider left it to his son Thomas Rider , MP for Kent and West Kent from 1831 to 1835 . The third Thomas Rider rebuilt parts of the house and extended and re @-@ landscaped the park . On his death in 1847 , he left the house to his nephew , also Thomas Rider , who let the house to a series of tenants . From 1903 to 1998 , the house was occupied by the Winch family , firstly as leaseholders then , from 1960 , as freeholders . The <unk> sold the house in 1998 ; it remains in private ownership and belongs to the Kendrick family .

 The two @-@ storey L @-@ shaped main house forms the east and south sides of a courtyard with single @-@ storey stables forming the north and west sides . To the south @-@ west of the house , is a second , larger courtyard flanked on its west side by a large barn and on its north and south by single storey return wings . 
 The house is the remainder of a former courtyard house built for Robert Rudston circa 1567 – 75 as an extension to an earlier , pre @-@ 16th @-@ century house . It is built of Kentish ragstone , roughly coursed on the north half of the east range and more regularly coursed on the south half of the east range and on the south range . The centre of the east range features a two @-@ storey porch with <unk> stonework on the upper level . The roof is of plain clay tiles , stone gabled at the north end of the east range but otherwise hipped , with four stone gabled dormers on the east façade and five smaller ones on the south façade . A frieze band with cornice and moulded stone base runs above the first floor windows on the east façade but is not repeated on the south , where only a moulded string course appears . Battlements were added to the eaves on both façades in 1819 as part of the third Thomas Rider 's works . 
 Windows on the east façade are rectangular with eight windows at ground floor and five at first floor , all with gothic frames . On the south façade , the ground floor windows are taller with a number being two- and three @-@ lighted and stone framed . A chamfered two @-@ storey bay is located slightly to the right of centre . Windows on the first floor are simpler and less tall . The 1819 works also included the demolition and replacement of the north and west ranges and substantial rebuilding of the south range . The north range is built up in red and grey brick from the stone walls of the demolished range . The west range is surmounted by a 17th @-@ century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt . The bell is dated 1647 . 
 Internally , the south range includes three 16th- or early @-@ 17th @-@ century stone fireplaces that have probably been reused from the earlier house . The north room of the attic floor and principal room on the first floor include 16th- or early @-@ 17th @-@ century timber panelling . The room over the entrance hall features late @-@ 17th @-@ century panelling . Two period staircases feature ; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries . The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567 , 1567 and 1575 . The stairwell includes windows with 17th @-@ century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other , undated stained glass . 
 The timber @-@ framed western barn was constructed in the 15th or early 16th century with an extension or alternations made at the north end in the late 18th or early 19th century . The walls are constructed in a combination of methods – stone walling , weatherboarding or brick infill between timber studs . The steeply pitched plain tiled roof contains six dormers on the west side and one on the east side and is hipped with a <unk> to the south end and half @-@ hipped to the north end . A carriage entry passes through the centre of the barn . A single @-@ storey extension runs at a right angle to the south end of the east side , probably built in the 16th century . The two @-@ storey extension to the east side of the north end is lower than the main barn with a half @-@ hipped roof . 
 The house and courtyard buildings are Grade I listed buildings . The barn is listed Grade II . Within the grounds are a sundial , a mounting block and a stone arch , each Grade II listed .

 The house sits in grounds of approximately 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) on a south @-@ facing escarpment giving views south and east across the Weald . The formal entrance is north @-@ west of the house , which is approached through woodland along a drive of approximately 850 metres ( 930 yd ) . Immediately to the east and south of the house are open lawns . To the north of the house are three enclosed gardens , two of which are arranged as kitchen gardens . These are remnants of a 16th @-@ century formal garden scheme which was removed and replaced by informal landscaping during the third Thomas Rider 's tenure . The steeply sloping ground to the south and south @-@ east of the house is maintained as a deer park with a lake about 400 metres ( 440 yd ) south @-@ east of the house . 
 The estate is private property and is not usually open to the public , but the Greensand Way long distance walk crosses the parkland east @-@ west to the north of the house .

 The Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran , located in the West Azerbaijan and East Azerbaijan provinces in Iran , is an ensemble of three Armenian churches that were established during the period between the 7th and 14th centuries A.D. The edifices — the St. Thaddeus Monastery , the Saint Stepanos Monastery , and the Chapel of Dzordzor — have undergone many renovations . These sites were inscribed as cultural heritages in the 32nd session of the World Heritage Committee on 8 July 2008 under the UNESCO ’ s World Heritage List . The three churches lie in a total area of 129 hectares ( 320 acres ) and were inscribed under UNESCO criteria ( ii ) , ( iii ) , and ( vi ) for their outstanding value in showcasing Armenian architectural and decorative traditions , for being a major centre for diffusion of Armenian culture in the region , and for being a place of pilgrimage of the apostle St. Thaddeus , a key figure in Armenian religious traditions . They represent the last vestiges of old Armenian culture in its southeastern periphery . The ensemble is in a good state of preservation .

 The Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran are located in the West Azerbaijan and East Azerbaijan provinces in Iran . The ensemble consists of three Armenian churches that were established during the period between the 7th and 14th centuries A.D. The edifices — the St. Thaddeus Monastery , the Saint Stepanos Monastery , and the Chapel of Dzordzor — have undergone many renovations . The three churches lie in a total area of 129 hectares ( 320 acres ) . The St. Thaddeus Monastery also known as " Kara <unk> " or " Black Church " in West Azerbaijan province is about 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) from Maku . The Saint Stepanos Monastery is 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) to the west of <unk> city , East <unk> Province in northwest Iran . 
 = = History = = 
 The Armenian people arrived in northwestern Iran — known as Iranian Azerbaijan — in the 6th century B.C. , and converted to Christianity in the early 4th century A.D. A portion of the region forms part of historical Armenia . Some of the oldest Armenian chapels , monasteries and churches in the world are located within this region of Iran , and the Iranian Azerbaijan region in general is home to the oldest churches in Iran . 
 According to unverified reports it is believed that St. Thaddeus was buried at the site of the St. Thaddeus Monastery in the 1st century A.D. , and that St. Gregory was responsible for establishing a monastery here in the 4th century . However , there is recorded proof that St. Thaddeus Monastery dates to the 7th century . It was the second Armenian church to be built , following the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and was the seat of the diocese in the 10th century . It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1319 and was rebuilt due to the efforts of Bishop Zachariah in the 1320s . 
 During the reign of the Safavid dynasty in the 15th century , the monasteries were preserved . The monasteries were then deserted during the 16th and 17th centuries following a period of attacks by the Ottomans that prompted many Armenians to emigrate to central Iran . Once the Safavids reestablished themselves in the area , the monasteries were reoccupied and renovated . However , during the 18th century the area became a cauldron of conflicts for domination among the Russian , Ottoman , and Persian empires . When the Persians finally gained control , the monasteries were damaged . During the Qajar era , Armenians regained control over the monasteries and they were rebuilt . The existing St. Thaddeus Monastery was rebuilt in 1814 and refurbished in the 1970s . 
 Similarly , it is recorded that Saint Stepanos Monastery was first established in 649 A.D. and a new building constructed at the same location in the 10th century . It was a major Christian church during the history of Armenian independence and development . After it suffered damages due to earthquake , it was rebuilt by Bishop Zachariah in the 1320s . During the entire 14th century , it was the centre of influence in the region for Christian missionary work . This period marked the creation of literary manuscripts and paintings on religious themes . The monastery was rebuilt during the period from 1819 to 1825 and again became a center of religious activity . It was refurbished in the 1970s , and again during the period from 1983 to 2001 . 
 The Dzordzor Chapel was built on the bank of the <unk> River at Dzordzor by Bishop Zachariah in 1314 on very modest lines , making use of the vestiges of an earlier religious monument dated between the 10th and 12th centuries . During the period of Ottoman rule , some parts of the building were destroyed . Later , the chapel came under threat of submergence from a proposed dam and had to be shifted to a new location upstream .

What is present now is a remnant of the large monastery that once existed there , as the entire chapel has been shifted to a new location 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) away due to submergence resulting from a dam that was built on the river . Before the building was dismantled , detailed plans were made and the dismantled elements numbered so that they could be reassembled to the same design at the new site . Of 1500 stones used at the new site to rebuild the chapel with the dome , only 250 were new stones as all the numbered stones from the old site were able to be reassembled according plan . This reconstruction was carried out during the period 1987 – 88 .
