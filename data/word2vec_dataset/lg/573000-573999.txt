 The title of the episode itself is a reference of Ernest Hemingway 's book " The old man and the sea " . A scene in the episode shows Grandpa wearing a zoot suit , a suit popular in the 1940s . When Grandpa and Zelda take off on one of their dates , three old men with long beards imitate ZZ Top as a short part of " Sharp Dressed Man " is played . Grandpa 's interaction with the " Souvenir Jackitos " in Apu 's store mirrors a scene in the 1961 musical film West Side Story , with Grandpa and his friends taking the role of the Jets in the film , the " Souvenir Jackitos " as the Sharks , and Apu as Doc . The " Death race " on the other hand , is a reference to the 1955 drama film Rebel Without a Cause . The abandoned aqueduct , in which the death race takes place , is based on the Los Angeles River . Yakov Smirnoff 's appearance at a theatre in Branson , Missouri in the episode may be a reference to the fact that he owns and performs at a theatre in the city in reality . During the ending credits , the Simpsons wave goodbye while The Beverly Hillbillies theme song is playing . In fact , before the Gracie Films jingle , Lisa says in a southern accent , " This has been a Gracie Films presentation ! " , which parodies the line " This has been a Filmways presentation ! " The beginning of the episode shows Homer excitedly preparing for the new XFL season , only to be disappointed when Marge informs him that the league folded after one year . 
 The name " Zelda " is a reference to Zelda Fitzgerald the wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald . Like Grampa , F Scott 's courtship of Zelda was difficult . The Fitzgeralds are closely tied to the Roaring 20s , so this is also a joke about Grampa 's age .

 In its original American broadcast on March 10 , 2002 , " The Old Man and the Key " received a 7 @.@ 9 rating , according to Nielsen Media Research , translating to approximately 7 @.@ 9 million viewers . The episode ranked 19 in the top 25 most watched television programs the week it aired . Later in 2002 , " Ode to Branson " was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music And Lyrics , which it ultimately lost to a score from BBC 's nature documentary The Blue Planet . In 2007 , the song was included on the soundtrack album The Simpsons : Testify . 
 Following the thirteenth season 's release on DVD and Blu @-@ ray , " The Old Man and the Key " received mixed to negative reviews from critics . Writing for Project : Blu , Nate Boss stated that Grampa " just isn 't all that funny when cornered , and that 's what we get here , " and that " the jokes are a bit too few and far between " . Giving the episode a negative review , Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote that it was " borderline painful " and one of the season 's " duds " . Casey Broadwater of Blu @-@ ray.com wrote that the episode " moves at a geriatric pace " , and R. L. Shaffer of IGN stated that it " represent [ s ] some of the worst of The Simpsons . " On the other hand , giving the episode a positive review , Ron Martin of 411Mania enjoyed the " poke towards Branson , Missouri , a mecca for old people everywhere , " and Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating . Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that , even though Grampa is " essentially a one @-@ joke personality , " " those gags tend to be pretty fun . " He concluded his review by writing that the episode was " a likable program . " 
 Despite the mixed responses , the episode features one of the " most used little clips " of the series . The scene shows Grampa getting his driver 's license . Instead of taking a photo for the license on the spot , Grampa suggests that Patty , who works in the facility , use a photo of him from a newspaper headline that reads " Old man yells at cloud . " Patty agrees , and Grampa , holding his newly acquired license , goes up to a window and yells " Who 's laughing now ? " at a cloud . A still from the scene has been used several times on The Daily Show . Both Malkowski of DVD Verdict and Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide considered it to be the best part of the episode . After Clint Eastwood 's speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention , which featured Eastwood talking to an empty chair representing President Barack Obama , a modified version of the image with the caption , " Old man yells at chair " , was used in an internet meme . 
 = Noemvriana = 
 The Noemvriana ( Greek : <unk> , " November Events " ) of November – December 1916 , or the Greek Vespers , was a political dispute , which led to an armed confrontation in Athens between the royalist government of Greece and the forces of the Allies over the issue of Greece 's neutrality during World War I. 
 Friction existed between the two sides from the beginning of World War I. The unconditional surrender of the border fortress of Rupel , in May 1916 , to the Central Powers ' forces , mainly composed of Bulgarian troops , was the first event that led to Noemvriana . The Allies feared the possibility of a secret pact between the Greek royalist government and the Central Powers . Such an alliance would endanger the Allied army in Macedonia bivouacking around Thessalonica since the end of 1915 . Intensive diplomatic negotiations between King Constantine and Allied diplomats took place throughout the summer . The king wanted Greece to maintain her neutrality , a position that would favor the Central Powers plans in the Balkans . While the Allies wanted demobilization of the Greek army and the surrender of war materiel equivalent to what was lost at Fort Rupel as a guarantee of Greece 's neutrality . By the end of the summer of 1916 , the failure of negotiations , along with Bulgarian army 's advance in eastern Macedonia and the Greek government 's orders for the Greek army not to offer resistance , led to a military coup by Venizelist military officers in Thessaloniki with the support of the Allies . The former Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos , who from the very beginning supported the Allies , established a provisional government in northern Greece . He began forming an army to liberate areas lost to Bulgaria , but this effectively split Greece into two entities . 
 The inclusion of the Greek army along with Allied forces , as well as the division of Greece , sparked several anti @-@ Allied demonstrations in Athens . In late October , a secret agreement was reached between the king and the Allied diplomats . The pressure from the military advisers forced the king to abandon this agreement . In an attempt to enforce their demands , the Allies landed a small contingent in Athens on 1 December [ O.S. 18 November ] 1916 . However , it met organized resistance and an armed confrontation took place until a compromise was reached at the end of the day . The day after the Allied contingent evacuated from Athens , a royalist mob began rioting throughout the city , targeting supporters of Venizelos . The rioting continued for three days , and the incident became known as the Noemvriana in Greece , which in the Old Style calendar occurred during the month of November . The incident drove a deep wedge between the Venizelists and the royalists , bringing closer what would become known as the National Schism . 
 Following Noemvriana , the Allies , determined to remove King Constantine , established a naval blockade to isolate areas which supported the king . After the resignation of the king on 15 June 1917 , Greece unified under a new king Alexander Constantine 's son and the leadership of Eleftherios Venizelos , joined World War I on the side of the Allies . By 1918 , the mobilized Greek army provided the numerical superiority the Allies needed on the Macedonian front . The Allied army shortly thereafter defeated the Central Powers forces in the Balkans followed by the liberation of Serbia and the conclusion of the First World War . 
 = = Background : Greece 1914 @-@ 1916 = = 
 Greece emerged victorious after the 1912 @-@ 1913 Balkan Wars , with her territory almost doubled . The unstable international political climate of the early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position . The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own . In the north , Bulgaria , defeated in the Second Balkan War , was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia . The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Serbia precipitated Austria @-@ Hungary 's declaration of war against Serbia . This caused Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary , and countries allied with Serbia ( the Triple Entente Powers ) to declare war on each other , starting World War I. 
 Greece , like Bulgaria , initially maintained neutrality during the conflict . The Greek leadership was divided between the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos , who supported Great Britain on the side of the Allies and King Constantine who was educated in Germany and married to the Kaiser 's sister . The king admired Prussian militarism and was anticipating a quick German victory . The king wanted Greece to remain neutral in the conflict , a strategy favorable to Germany and the Central Powers . 
 In early 1915 , Britain offered Greece " territorial concessions in Asia Minor " if it would participate in the upcoming Gallipoli Campaign . Venizelos supported this idea , while the king and his military advisers opposed it . Dismayed at the king 's opposition , the prime minister resigned on 21 February 1915 . A few months later , Venizelos ' Liberal Party won the May elections , and formed a new government . When Bulgaria mobilized against Serbia in September 1915 , Venizelos ordered a Greek counter @-@ mobilization and asked the Anglo @-@ French army to defend Thessaloniki and aid Serbia . The Allies , led by General Maurice Sarrail , began landing on 22 September 1915 and entrenched around the city . The Greek parliament gave Venizelos a vote of confidence to help Serbia , yet the king unconstitutionally dismissed the prime minister along with the parliament . This unlawful order escalated the animosity between the king and Venizelos as well as their loyal followers . The Liberals boycotted the December elections .

 = = = Surrender of Fort Rupel = = = 
 On 9 May 1916 , the Chief of the General Staff of the Central Powers , Erich von Falkenhayn informed Athens of the imminent advance of German @-@ Bulgarian forces . In reply , Athens minimized the importance of General Sarrail 's movements and requested Falkenhayn to change his strategy . On 23 May , Falkenhayn guaranteed that the territorial integrity of Greece and the rights of its citizens would be respected . On 26 May , despite an official protest by the Greek government , 25 @,@ 000 Bulgarian soldiers led by German cavalry invaded Greece . The Greek forces at Fort Rupel surrendered . The German Supreme Command was concerned about Allied General Sarrail 's movements and Falkenhayn was ordered to occupy strategic positions inside Greek territory , specifically Fort Rupel . Despite the assurances of Falkenhayn , Bulgarian soldiers immediately began to forcibly centralize the Greek population into large cities , namely Serres , Drama and Kavala . German attempts to restrain Bulgarian territorial ambitions were partially successful , yet on 4 September , Kavala was occupied by the Bulgarian army . 
 = = = Reactions of Venizelos and the Allies = = = 
 The surrender of Fort Rupel caused the Allies to believe that the German @-@ Bulgarian advance was a result of a secret agreement between Athens and the Central Powers , as they were assured that no Bulgarian force would invade Greek territory . The Allies saw this as a violation of Greek neutrality and a disturbance in the balance of power in the Balkans . The Allied press , especially in France , demanded swift military action against Greece to protect the Allied forces in Macedonia . For Venizelos and his supporters , the surrender of Fort Rupel signaled the loss of Greek Macedonia . On 29 May , Venizelos proposed to Sir Francis Elliot ( senior British diplomat in Athens ) and Jean Guillemin ( senior French diplomat in Athens ) that he and General Panagiotis <unk> should establish a provisional government in Thessaloniki to mobilize the Greek army to repel the Bulgarians . Venizelos pledged that the army would not move against the king and the royal family . According to Elliot 's report , Venizelos hoped that the " success of his action and pressure of the public opinion might at the last moment convert His Majesty " . The proposal had French support . However it met with strong opposition from Britain , forcing Venizelos to abandon the plan . 
 On 9 June the Allies held a conference in London to examine the reasons behind the quick surrender of Fort Rupel and favored a complete demobilization of the Greek army and navy . King Constantine anticipated the results of the conference and ordered a partial demobilization on 8 June . The tension between the royal government and the Allies continued since ' anti @-@ Allied activities ' in Athens were ignored by the Greek Government . On 12 – 13 June , a mob destroyed Venizelist newspapers : Nea <unk> , Patris , Ethnos , and Estia . The mob proceeded to the British Embassy as police idly stood by without interfering . This incident gave France the political ammunition to persuade Britain that more extreme measures were needed . On 17 June , the London conference decided " that it was absolutely necessary to do something to bring the king of Greece and his Government to their senses " . 
 = = = Military coup of Thessaloniki = = = 
 On 27 August 1916 , during a demonstration in Athens , Venizelos explained his disagreements with the king 's policies . Venizelos said that the king became a victim of his advisers , whose aims were to destroy the goals of the <unk> revolution . Additionally , Venizelos appealed to the king to pursue a policy of benevolence and true neutrality . Venizelos ended his speech by stating that " if this proposal does not lead to success then there are other means to protect the country from complete catastrophe " . The king refused to accept any compromise including meeting with a committee sent by Venizelos . 
 Two days later , army officers loyal to Venizelos organized a military coup in Thessaloniki and proclaimed the " Provisional Government of National Defence " . Despite the support of the army , the provisional government was not officially recognized by Venizelos nor the Allied powers . Venizelos criticized this course of action , noting that without the support of the Allied army , the movement would fail immediately . This further polarized the population between the royalists ( also known as anti @-@ Venizelists ) , and Venizelists . The newly founded separate " provisional state " included Northern Greece , Crete and the Aegean Islands . The " New Lands " , won during the Balkan Wars , broadly supported Venizelos , while the " Old Greece " was mostly pro @-@ royalist . Venizelos , Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis and General Panagiotis <unk> formed a triumvirate provisional government and on 9 October moved to Thessaloniki to assume command of the National Defense . They directed Greek participation in the Allied war effort in direct conflict with the royal wishes in Athens . According to a British diplomat : 
 From the very beginnings , Venizelos continued his appeals to the king to join forces to jointly liberate Macedonia . Venizelos wrote : 
 Venizelos ' moderation did not convince many citizens , even among his own followers . It was only after the end of 1916 and the " Noemvriana " that he pushed for a radical solution to end the stalemate . 
 = = Constantine – Bénazet agreement = = 
 After the creation of the provisional government in Thessaloniki , negotiations between the Allies and king intensified . The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia . The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos ' provisional government and guarantees that Greece 's integrity and neutrality would be respected . After several unproductive negotiations , on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly . The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them . In exchange , the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers . 
 On 3 November , Vice @-@ admiral du Fournet , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the allied <unk> fleet , used the sinking of two Greek merchant ships by a German submarine , as well as the secret agreement , to demand the surrender of the docked Greek war ships and took command of the Salamis naval arsenal . The Greek government yielded , and on 7 November , the partial disarmament of Greek warships began . The Allies towed away 30 lighter craft . Three weeks later the French took over the Salamis naval base completely , and began using Greek ships operated by French crews . 
 The Constantine – Bénazet agreement was short @-@ lived due to Venizelos ' military plans as well as pressure exerted by the military in Athens , led by the king , regarding the forced Greek disarmament . Venizelos ' action at Katerini met with some disapproval among the Allied circles and among his own associates in Athens . Answering these criticisms Venizelos wrote to A. <unk> : 
 The Venizelist advance was not an attempt to undermine the king 's pact with Bénazet , since it had been planned long before that . The failure of the secret agreement was caused by subversive activities within segments of the royalist government in Athens to paralyze and disrupt the Thessaloniki provisional government . 
 = = Last diplomatic efforts before the events = = 
 The seizure of Greek ships by the Allies , the Katerini incident and the Franco @-@ British violations of Greece 's territorial integrity offended the national honor of a segment of " Old Greece " and increased the king 's popularity . The king refused to honor his secret agreement with Bénazet and soldiers who requested to fight against the Bulgarian occupation were charged with " desertion to the rebels " . A growing movement amongst the low rank officers within the army , led by Ioannis Metaxas and <unk> <unk> , were determined to oppose disarmament and any assistance to the Allies . 
 Diplomacy failed despite continuing pressure applied by the Allies against Athens . On 24 November , du Fournet presented a 7 @-@ day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender of at least ten Greek mountain artillery batteries . Du Fournet was instructed not to use force to take possession of the batteries . The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France 's demands . He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent , and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece . The king said that the citizens of Greece , as well as the army , were against disarmament , and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies . 
 Despite the gravity of the situation , both the royalist government and the Allies made no serious effort to reach a diplomatic solution . On 29 November , the royalist government rejected the proposal of the Allies and armed resistance was organized . By 30 November military units and royalist militia ( the <unk> , " reservists " ) from surrounding areas had been recalled and gathered in and around Athens ( in total over 20 @,@ 000 men ) and occupied strategic positions , with orders not to fire unless fired upon . The Allied commanders failed in their assessment of the situation , disregarding Greek national pride and determination , causing them to conclude that the Greeks were bluffing . The Allies thought that in the face of a superior force , Greeks would " bring the cannons on a <unk> " ( surrender ) ; a viewpoint that Du Fournet also shared . 
 = = = The battle of Athens : 1916 = = = 
 On early morning of 1 December [ O.S. 18 November ] 1916 the Allies landed a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong marine force in Piraeus , and headed towards Athens . When the Allied troops reached their designated positions , they found them already occupied by Greek troops . For more than two hours both sides stood facing each other . Some time in the morning , an unknown origin rifle shot was fired and the battle of Athens began . Each side blamed the other for firing first . Once the battle spread throughout the city , the king requested a ceasefire proposing a solution and reach a compromise . Du Fournet , with a small contingent of troops was unprepared to encounter organized Greek resistance , and was already short of supplies , so readily accepted the king 's compromise . However , before an agreement was finalized , the battle resumed . The Greek battery from <unk> Hill fired a number of rounds at the entrance of <unk> where the French admiral had established his headquarters . The Allied squadron from <unk> responded by bombarding sections of the city , mostly around the Stadium and near the Palace . Discussions soon were resumed and a final compromise was reached . The king compromised to surrender just six artillery batteries camouflaged in the mountains instead of the ten that the Allied Admiral demanded . By late afternoon the battle was finished . The Allies had suffered 194 casualties , dead and wounded , and the Greeks lost 82 , not counting civilians . By early morning of 2 December , all Allied forces had been evacuated . 
 The role of the Venizelists during the battle has been intensely contested by witnesses and historians . Vice admiral Louis <unk> du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units . Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive , that lead Admiral du <unk> wrote in his report that he had been involved in a civil war . The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day , when they capitulated . The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers . Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens . Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces : Pavlos <unk> , a contemporary royalist historian , argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists ' houses were knives . 
 = = = The following days = = = 
 The authorities , with the pretext of the events , claimed that the <unk> had staged an insurrection with the support of Allied troops and proceeded with the help of the Reservists to extensive arrests and reprisals against the city 's Venizelists . The entire operation was led by two generals of the army ; troops of the military district of Athens took orders from General K. <unk> and the soldiers of the active defense were commanded by General A. <unk> ( later commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Asia Minor expedition ) . The terror and destruction that followed soon went out of hand , making even the respectable conservative newspaper <unk> <unk> ( Greek : <unk> <unk> , Political Review ) that at the beginning urged Greek " justice " to " smite mercifully the atrocious conspiracy " and to purge all followers of the " <unk> of Salonika [ Venizelos ] " , in the end to urge " prudence " . During the following three days houses and shops of Venizelists were ransacked and 35 people were murdered . Chester says that most of those who were murdered were refugees from Asia Minor . Many hundreds were imprisoned and kept in solitary confinement . <unk> characterizes the imprisonment of certain prominent Venizelists , such as Emmanuel <unk> ( mayor of Athens ) , as a disgrace . Some authors argue that <unk> was not only arrested and imprisoned but also disrespected and ill @-@ treated . Seligman describes that they were only released 45 days later after a strong demand contained within the Entente ultimatum , which was accepted on 16 January . Opposing reports also exist , e.g. Abbot asserts that during the evacuation of the Allied forces , many " criminals " and " collaborators " on the payrolls of different Allied spy agencies slipped out of Athens at night after allegedly " terrorizing the city for nearly a year " . Due to his failure Vice @-@ admiral <unk> du Fournet was relieved of his command .

 In Greece , this incident became known as Noemvriana ( November events ) , using the Old Style calendar , and marked the culmination of the National Schism . 
 = = = Political situation in Greece and Europe = = = 
 On 2 December [ O.S. 19 November ] 1916 , Britain and France officially recognized Venizelos government as the only lawful government of Greece , effectively splitting the country . On 7 December [ O.S. 24 November ] 1916 , Venizelos ' government officially declared war on the Central Powers . A royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was immediately issued and the Archbishop of Athens , pressured by the royal house , <unk> the prime minister . 
 In France , the presidency of Aristide Briand , a leading proponent of engaging with Constantine to bring about a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations , was threatened by the events in Athens , leading to the reorganization of the French government . In Britain , Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour . The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece , since Lloyd George was a known <unk> , an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question . 
 The fall of the Romanovs in Russia ( who refused the French proposals for Constantine 's removal from the throne ) , caused France and Great Britain to take more drastic measures against King Constantine . In June they decided to invoke their obligation as " protecting powers " to guarantee a constitutional democracy in Greece and demanded the king 's resignation . Constantine accepted and on 15 June 1917 went into exile . His son Alexander , who was considered to have Allies sympathies , became the new King of Greece instead of Constantine 's elder son and crown prince , George . The king 's exile was followed by the deportation of many prominent royalists , especially army officers such as Ioannis Metaxas , to France and Italy . 
 The course of events paved the way for Venizelos to return to Athens on 29 May 1917 . Greece , now unified , officially joined the war on the side of the Allies . The entire Greek army was mobilized ( though tensions remained inside the army between supporters of the Constantine and supporters of Venizelos ) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front . 
 = = = The Macedonian front = = = 
 By the fall of 1918 , the Greeks , with over 300 @,@ 000 soldiers , were the single largest component of the Allied army on the Macedonian front . The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance between the two sides on the Macedonian front . On 14 September 1918 , under the command of French General Franchet d 'Esperey , a combined Greek , Serbian , French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army . After the first serious battle ( see battle of Skra ) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country . On 29 September , the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command . The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces . By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary . The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918 , marking the dissolution of the Austro @-@ Hungarian empire . This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south . The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war , earning Greece a seat at the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos .

 The Black Parade is a rock opera centering around the character of " The Patient " . It is about his passage out of life and the memories he has of his life . " The Patient " dies and death comes for him in the form of a parade . This is based upon Gerard Way 's notion of death appearing to a person in the form of their fondest memory , in this case seeing a parade as a child . 
 The album also saw the creation of the alter @-@ ego band , The Black Parade . My Chemical Romance would perform the album live in costume as the Black Parade up until October 7 , 2007 Mexico City performance . On stage , the band would don black marching uniforms similar to those worn by The Beatles for the album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) . The live performance was theatrical , with Gerard Way assuming the character of a member of The Black Parade . Way 's mannerisms were compared to Bob Geldof in his performance of the lead character in the movie adaption of Pink Floyd 's The Wall ( 1979 ) . His performance was also compared to David Bowie 's performance of Ziggy Stardust and Freddie Mercury 's stage presence . There are also similarities to Alice Cooper in his " Welcome to My Nightmare " period . The video for " Welcome to the Black Parade " , directed by Sam Bayer , portrays the events of the entire story , starring all its characters , including Mother War , who is primarily involved in the song " Mama " . Gerard Way has described this video as " The definitive video for the record " and one that " summed up the album . " 
 The album also has strong influences from 1970s classic rock , glam rock , pop music , punk rock and gothic rock . The album 's style is considered pop punk , and alternative rock . 
 Lead singer Gerard Way has cited the bands Queen and Pink Floyd as major influences on the album . Similarities have been noted between the guitar orchestration in " Welcome to the Black Parade " , and the arrangements of Queen . Additionally , Pink Floyd 's The Wall and David Bowie 's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars ( 1972 ) are noted as major influences for the album , which is especially evident when comparing the album 's opening track , " The End . " , to the first tracks on The Wall , " In the Flesh ? " , and on Ziggy Stardust , " Five Years " . Gerard Way has also stated that one of their biggest influences were The Smashing Pumpkins , often giving them credit for their thematic videos . 
 “ The intention was to make something that was classic , something timeless , ” explained guitarist Ray Toro . “ Something that 20 or 30 years from now , parents could play for their kids and say , “ This is what I was listening to when I was your age . Check it out , it ’ s still fucking cool . ’ We wanted to make a record you could pass down . There ’ s a lot of music out now that doesn ’ t feel like that . ” 
 Looking back at the creation of the album , guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about criticism the band received for this decidedly “ non @-@ scene ” record . " When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge , we didn 't fit in , " he said . “ There was a little less screaming and a little more melody , but it was still us . Never was it a case of , ' Don 't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck , who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall , is really going to be bummed at me . ' I don ’ t give a shit : If I had to work at McDonald 's for the rest of my life to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour ? I 've done it . I 'll do it again . "

" The Black Parade was ranked the third best record of the year , being surpassed only by Gnarls Barkley and TV on the Radio .

At that point some speculated that the next iPad released would be of a smaller size . Further speculations emerged in July 2012 when <unk> , with the help of unspecified sources , claimed that Apple made small revisions to the then upcoming iPad and scheduled its release for late 2012 . On October 16 , 2012 , Apple announced a media event scheduled for October 23 at the California Theatre in San Jose , California .

It also features a 5 @-@ megapixel , rear @-@ facing camera capable of 1080p video recording ; and a 720p HD front @-@ facing videophone camera designed for FaceTime . The device features a 9 @.@ 7 " ( diagonal ) display with a resolution of 2 @,@ 048 by 1 @,@ 536 ( <unk> ) resulting in 3 @.@ 1 million pixels , this gives the display a pixel density of 264 ppi . The total number of pixels used in the display of the fourth @-@ generation iPad is four times that of the iPad 2 – providing even scaling from the prior model . 
 As with all previous generations of iPhone and iPad hardware , there are four buttons and one switch on the fourth @-@ generation iPad . With the device in its portrait orientation , these are : a " home " button on the face of the device under the display that returns the user to the home screen , a wake / sleep button on the top edge of the device , and two buttons on the upper right side of the device performing volume up / down functions , under which is a switch whose function varies according to device settings , generally functioning either to switch the device into or out of silent mode or to lock / unlock the orientation of the screen .

Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch 's built @-@ in applications , which work in three orientations ( portrait , landscape @-@ left and landscape @-@ right ) , the iPad 's built @-@ in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations , including upside @-@ down . Consequently , the device has no intrinsic " native " orientation ; only the relative position of the home button changes . 
 The tablet is manufactured either with or without the capability to communicate over a cellular network . All models can connect to a wireless LAN via Wi @-@ Fi . The fourth @-@ generation iPad is available with 16 , 32 , 64 or 128 GB of internal flash memory , with no expansion option .

After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder , Chamberlin left the band in early 2009 . Later that year , Corgan began a new recording series entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope featuring a rotating lineup of musicians , that has resulted in the albums Oceania ( 2012 ) , Monuments to an Elegy ( 2014 ) , and a forthcoming album . Chamberlin rejoined , originally temporarily , in 2015 for The End Times Tour , but remained a member of the band afterwards . As of 2016 , Corgan , Chamberlin & Schroeder are the sole permanent band members .

 After the breakup of his gothic rock band The Marked , singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg , Florida , to return to his native city of Chicago , where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called " The Smashing Pumpkins " . While working there , he met guitarist James Iha . <unk> themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings , the two began writing songs together ( with the aid of a drum machine ) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order . The duo performed live for the first time on July 9 , 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21 . This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine . Shortly thereafter , Corgan met D 'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band . After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar , Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now @-@ trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub . After this show , Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer . 
 Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan 's . Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band . As Corgan recalled of the period , " We were completely into the sad @-@ rock , Cure kind of thing . It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined . " On October 5 , 1988 , the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro . 
 In 1989 , The Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark , which featured several Chicago alternative bands . The group released its first single , " I Am One " , in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential . The single sold out and they released a follow @-@ up , " Tristessa " , on Sub Pop , after which they signed to Caroline Records . The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison , Wisconsin for $ 20 @,@ 000 . In order to gain the consistency he desired , Corgan often played all instruments save drums , which created tension in the band . The music fused heavy metal guitars , psychedelia , and dream pop , garnering them comparisons to Jane 's Addiction . Gish became a minor success , with the single " Rhinoceros " receiving some airplay on modern rock radio . After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records , the band formally signed with Virgin Records , which was affiliated with Caroline . The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Jane 's Addiction , and Guns N ' Roses . During the tour , Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup , Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol , and Corgan entered a deep depression , writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time . 
 = = = Mainstream breakout : 1992 – 1994 = = = 
 With the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam , The Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success . At this time , the Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement , with Corgan protesting , " We 've graduated now from ' the next Jane 's Addiction ' to ' the next Nirvana , ' now we 're ' the next Pearl Jam . ' " 
 Amid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity , the band relocated to Marietta , Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album , with Butch Vig returning as producer . The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band 's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording , but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections . The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band . As was the case with Gish , Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album , contributing to an air of resentment . The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant . Corgan 's depression , meanwhile , had deepened to the point where he contemplated suicide , and he compensated by practically living in the studio . Meanwhile , Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time . In all , it took over four months to complete the record , with the budget exceeding $ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 Despite all the problems in its recording , Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart , and sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone . Alongside the band 's mounting mainstream recognition , the band 's reputation as <unk> among their former peers in the independent music community was worsened . Indie rock band Pavement 's 1994 song " Range Life " directly mocks the band in its lyrics , although Stephen Malkmus , lead singer of Pavement , has stated , " I never dissed their music . I just dissed their status . " Former Hüsker Dü frontman Bob Mould called them " the grunge Monkees " , and fellow Chicago musician / producer Steve Albini wrote a scathing letter in response to an article praising the band , derisively comparing them to REO Speedwagon ( " by , of and for the mainstream " ) and concluding their ultimate insignificance . The opening track and lead single of Siamese Dream , " Cherub Rock " , directly addresses Corgan 's feud with the " indie @-@ world " . 
 In 1994 , Virgin released the B @-@ sides / rarities compilation Pisces Iscariot which charted higher than Siamese Dream by reaching number four on the Billboard 200 . Also released was a VHS cassette titled Vieuphoria featuring a mix of live performances and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage . Following relentless touring to support the recordings , including headline slots on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour and at Reading Festival in 1995 , the band took time off to write the follow @-@ up album . 
 = = = Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness : 1995 – 1997 = = = 
 Corgan worked non @-@ stop over the next year and wrote about fifty @-@ six songs for the next album . Following this spell of concentrated creativity , the Pumpkins went back into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as " The Wall for Generation X " , a comparison with the 1979 Pink Floyd two @-@ LP concept album . 
 The result was Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness , a double album featuring twenty @-@ eight songs and lasting over two hours ( the vinyl version of the album contained three records , two extra songs , and an alternate track listing ) . The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death . Praised by Time as " the group 's most ambitious and accomplished work yet " , Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995 . Even more successful than Siamese Dream , it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best @-@ selling double album of the decade to date . It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations , including Album of the Year . The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award , for the album 's lead single " Bullet with Butterfly Wings " . The album spawned five singles — " Bullet with Butterfly Wings " , " 1979 " , " Zero " , " Tonight , Tonight " , and " Thirty @-@ Three " — of which the first three were certified gold and all but " Zero " entered the Top 40 . Many of the remaining songs that did not make it onto Mellon Collie were released as B @-@ sides to the singles , and were eventually compiled in The Aeroplane Flies High box set . As a testament to the band 's popularity , Virgin Records originally intended to limit the set to 200 @,@ 000 copies , but produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming demand . 
 In 1996 , the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of Mellon Collie . Corgan 's look during this period — a shaved head , a <unk> black shirt with the word " Zero " printed on it , and silver pants — became iconic . That year , the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons , " Homerpalooza " . With considerable video rotation on MTV , major industry awards , and " Zero " shirts selling in many malls , the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time . But the year was far from entirely positive for the band . In May , the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at The Point Theatre in Dublin , Ireland . Despite the band 's repeated requests for moshing to stop , a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old fan named Bernadette O 'Brien was crushed to death . The concert ended early and the following night 's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her . However , while Corgan maintained that moshing 's " time [ had ] come and gone " , the band would continue to request open @-@ floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour . 
 The band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11 , 1996 , when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City . Melvoin died , and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession . A few days later , the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident . The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour , and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion . Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made , damaging both their music and their reputation . Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he 'd " gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe . " But in recent years , he had reportedly been clean . On July 17 , the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said , " For nine years we have battled with Jimmy 's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction . It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for . … We wish [ him ] the best we have to offer , " Meanwhile , the band had given interviews since the release of Mellon Collie stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record , and that rock was becoming stale . James Iha said at the end of 1996 , " The future is in electronic music . It really seems boring just to play rock music . "

 After the release of Mellon Collie , the Pumpkins contributed a number of songs to various compilations . Released in early 1997 , the song " Eye " , which appeared on the soundtrack to David Lynch 's Lost Highway , relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins ' previous musical styles . At the time , Corgan stated his " idea [ was ] to reconfigure the focus and get away from the classic guitars @-@ bass @-@ drum rock format . " Later that year , the group contributed " The End Is the Beginning Is the End " to the soundtrack for the film Batman & Robin . With Matt Walker on drums , the song featured a heavy sound similar to " Bullet With Butterfly Wings " while still having strong electronic influences . The song later won the 1998 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance . Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future , the band 's next album would feature few guitar driven songs . 
 Recorded following the death of Corgan 's mother and his divorce , 1998 's Adore represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins ' previous guitar @-@ based rock , veering into electronica . The record , cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker , was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band 's earlier work . The group also modified its public image , shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance . Although Adore received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards , the album had only sold about 830 @,@ 000 copies in the United States by the end of the year , which led the music industry to consider it a failure . The album nonetheless sold three times as many copies overseas . The band began a seventeen @-@ date , fifteen @-@ city charity North American tour in support of Adore . At each stop on the tour , the band donated 100 percent of tickets sales to a local charity organization . The tour 's expenses were entirely funded out of the band 's own pockets . All told , the band donated over $ 2 @.@ 8 million to charity as a result of the tour . 
 In 1999 , the band surprised fans by reuniting with a rehabilitated Jimmy Chamberlin for a brief tour dubbed " The Arising " , which showcased both new and classic material . The lineup was short @-@ lived , however , as the band announced the departure of Wretzky in September during work on the album Machina / The Machines of God . Former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited for the " Sacred and Profane " tour in support of the album and appeared in the videos accompanying its release . Released in 2000 , Machina was initially promoted as the Pumpkins ' return to a more traditional rock sound , after the more gothic , electronic @-@ sounding Adore . The album debuted at number three on the Billboard charts , but quickly disappeared and as of 2007 had only been certified gold . Music journalist Jim DeRogatis , who described the album as " one of the strongest of their career " , noted that the stalled sales for Machina in comparison to teen pop ascendant at the time " seems like concrete proof that a new wave of young pop fans has turned a deaf ear toward alternative rock . " 
 On May 23 , 2000 , in a live radio interview on KROQ @-@ FM ( Los Angeles ) , Billy Corgan announced the band 's decision to break up at the end of that year following additional touring and recording . The group 's final album before the break @-@ up , Machina II / The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music , was released in September 2000 in a limited pressing on vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans . Only twenty @-@ five copies were cut , each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves . The album , released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan , consisted of one double LP and three ten @-@ inch EPs . Originally , the band asked Virgin to offer Machina II as a free download to anyone who bought Machina . When the record label declined , Corgan opted to release the material independently . 
 On December 2 , 2000 , Smashing Pumpkins played a farewell concert at The Metro , the same Chicago club where their career had effectively started twelve years earlier . The four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour @-@ long show featured 35 songs spanning the group 's career , and attendees were given a recording of the band 's first concert at The Metro , Live at Cabaret Metro 10 @-@ 5 @-@ 88 . The single " Untitled " was released commercially to coincide with the farewell show . 
 = = = Post @-@ breakup : 2001 – 2004 = = = 
 In 2001 , the compilation Rotten Apples was released . The double @-@ disc version of the album , released as a limited edition , included a collection of B @-@ sides and rarities called Judas O. The Greatest Hits Video Collection DVD was also released at the same time . This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from Gish to Machina along with unreleased material . Vieuphoria was released on DVD in 2002 , as was the soundtrack album <unk> , previously released solely to radio stations in 1994 . 
 Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan 's next project , the short @-@ lived supergroup Zwan . The group 's only album , Mary Star of the Sea , was released in 2003 . After cancelling a few festival appearances , Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003 . During 2001 , Corgan also toured as part of New Order and provided vocals on their comeback album Get Ready . In October 2004 , Corgan released his first book , <unk> with Fists , a collection of poetry . In June 2005 , he released a solo album , TheFutureEmbrace , which he described as " ( picking ) up the thread of the as @-@ of @-@ yet @-@ unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins " . Despite this , it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales . Only one single , " Walking Shade " , was released in support of the album . 
 In addition to drumming with Zwan , Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock / jazz fusion project band called The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex . The group released an album in 2005 titled Life Begins Again . Corgan provided guest vocals on the track " <unk> " . James Iha served as a guitarist in A Perfect Circle , appearing on their Thirteenth Step club tour and 2004 album , eMOTIVe . He has also been involved with other acts such as Chino Moreno 's Team Sleep and Vanessa and the O 's . He continues to work with his own record label as well , <unk> Records . D 'arcy Wretzky has , aside from one radio interview in 2009 , not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999 . On January 25 , 2000 , she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of crack cocaine , but after successfully completing a court @-@ ordered drug education program , the charges were dropped . 
 Corgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform , although when Zwan broke up he announced , " I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [ … ] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me . " Corgan said in 2005 , " I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins . That was never the plan . " On February 17 , 2004 , Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a " mean @-@ spirited drug addict " and blaming Iha for the breakup of The Smashing Pumpkins . On June 3 , 2004 , he added that " the depth of my hurt [ from Iha ] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude " . Iha responded to Corgan 's claims in 2005 , saying , " No , I didn 't break up the band . The only person who could have done that is Billy . " 
 = = = Reformation and Zeitgeist : 2005 – 2008 = = = 
 On June 21 , 2005 , the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace , Corgan took out full @-@ page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun @-@ Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band . " For a year now " , Corgan wrote , " I have walked around with a secret , a secret I chose to keep . But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins . I want my band back , and my songs , and my dreams " . Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion , but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate . 
 In April 2007 , Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion . Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky " didn 't want to be a part of " the reunion . The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22 , 2007 , in Paris , France . There , the band unveiled new touring members : guitarist Jeff Schroeder , bassist Ginger Reyes , and keyboardist Lisa <unk> . That same month , " Tarantula " was released as the first single from the band 's forthcoming album . On July 7 , the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey . 
 The band 's new album , Zeitgeist , was released that same month on Reprise Records , entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . Zeitgeist received mixed reviews , with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup . The album divided the Pumpkins ' fanbase . Corgan would later admit , " I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist . I think they wanted this massive , grandiose work , but you don 't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that " . 
 Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo , releasing the four @-@ song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles " <unk> " and " <unk> " later that year . That November , the group released the DVD If All Goes Wrong , which chronicled the group 's 2007 concert residences in Asheville , North Carolina and San Francisco , California . In late 2008 , the band commenced on a controversy @-@ riddled 20th Anniversary Tour . Around this time , Corgan said the group will make no more full @-@ length records in order to focus exclusively on singles , explaining , " The listening patterns have changed , so why are we killing ourselves to do albums , to create balance , and do the arty track to set up the single ? It 's done . " 
 = = = Teargarden and Oceania : 2009 – 2013 = = = 
 In March 2009 , Corgan announced on the band 's website that Chamberlin had left the group and would be replaced . Chamberlin subsequently stated that his departure from the band is " a positive move forward for me . I can no longer commit all of my energy into something that I don 't fully possess . " Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable , commenting , " I am glad [ Corgan ] has chosen to continue under the name . It is his right . " Chamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw , which has released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear . In July 2009 , Billy Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky , initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of The Seeds , who had recently died . The following month Corgan confirmed on the band 's website that 19 @-@ year @-@ old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair was working on new Pumpkins recordings . 
 The group announced plans to release a 44 @-@ track concept album , Teargarden by Kaleidyscope , for free over the Internet one track at a time . The first track , " A Song for a Son " , was released in December 2009 to moderate press acclaim . In March 2010 , Ginger Reyes officially left the band , prompting an open call for auditions for a new bassist . In May , Nicole Fiorentino announced she had joined the band as bass player , and would be working on Teargarden by Kaleidyscope . The new lineup went on a world tour through to the end of 2010 . One of the first shows with the new lineup was a concert to benefit Matthew Leone , bassist for the rock band Madina Lake , at the Metro on July 27 , 2010 . In late 2010 , all four members contributed to the sessions for the third volume of Teargarden . 
 On April 26 , 2011 , Corgan announced that the Smashing Pumpkins would be releasing a new album titled Oceania , which he labeled as " an album within an album " in regards to the Teargarden by Kaleidyscope project , in the fall . As with the previous recording sessions , all four band members contributed to the project . Also , the entire album catalog was to be remastered and reissued with bonus tracks , starting with Gish and Siamese Dream in November 2011 . The pre @-@ Gish demos , Pisces Iscariot , and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness were released in 2012 , with The Aeroplane Flies High released the following year . Adore was released in 2014 , and Machina / The Machines of God and the yet commercially unreleased Machina II / Friends and Enemies of Modern Music are expected to be combined , remixed , and released in the same year . The band did a thirteen @-@ city US tour in October 2011 followed by a European tour in November and December . 
 Oceania was released on June 19 , 2012 and received generally positive reviews . The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the Billboard Independent . The album spawned two singles , " The <unk> " and " Panopticon " . The band proceeded to tour in support of the album , including a US tour involving playing the album in its entirety . By September 2012 , Corgan stated that the band had already begun work on their next album . However , despite this , the band concentrated on touring , playing at Glastonbury Festival , Dour Festival and the Barclays Center , where they recorded Oceania : Live in NYC , which was released on September 24 , 2013 , without much comment on new material . 
 = = = Monuments to an Elegy : 2014 – present = = = 
 On March 25 , 2014 , Corgan announced he had signed a new record deal with BMG , for two new albums , titled Monuments to an Elegy and Day for Night , respectively . In June , it was revealed that Mike Byrne was no longer in the band , to be replaced by Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe on the new album , and Fiorentino would not be recording on the album either . Monuments to an Elegy was released on December 5 , 2014 , to generally positive reviews . The band toured in support of the album starting on November 26 , with Rage Against the Machine 's Brad Wilk filling in on drums and The Killers ' Mark Stoermer filling in on bass . The follow @-@ up album , which will no longer be titled Day For Night , was pushed back to a late 2015 or early 2016 release as the band continued to tour . 
 Later in 2015 , Corgan announced that the band would undertake a co @-@ headlining tour of North America with Marilyn Manson . The End Times Tour was set to begin in Concord , California , at the Concord Pavilion on July 7 , and was scheduled to end with a concert in Cincinnati , Ohio , at the Riverbend Music Center on August 8 . Prior to the co @-@ headlining dates , the band performed a series of acoustic shows with drum machines and tapes for percussion . When the time came for the co @-@ headlining tour , plans for a drummer fell through and Corgan recruited Chamberlin to reunite for the shows . On February 1 , 2016 , it was announced that the band would continue their In Plainsong acoustic tour with Jimmy Chamberlin on drums and were planning to head " straight to the studio after the dates to record a brand new album inspired by the sounds explored in the new acoustic setting " . On February 25 , 2016 , Corgan posted a video from a Los Angeles studio on the band 's Facebook account , giving an update on the writing process for the new songs for the upcoming album to be released after the In Plainsong tour . The tour began in Portland , Oregon , on March 22 , 2016 . 
 On his birthday on March 26 , 2016 , original guitarist James Iha joined Billy Corgan , Jimmy Chamberlin , and Jeff Schroeder on stage unannounced at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles . He performed a few songs , including " <unk> " , " Soma " and " <unk> " marking his first appearance with the Smashing Pumpkins in 16 years . Iha also played at the second of the two Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel the following day , which was Easter Sunday . Iha joined the Pumpkins for a third time at their April 14 concert at the Civic Opera House in Chicago . 
 = = Musical style , influences , and legacy = = 
 The direction of the band is dominated by chief guitarist , lead vocalist , and principal songwriter Billy Corgan . Journalist Greg Kot wrote , " The music [ of The Smashing Pumpkins ] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision , and his famously fractured relationships with his family , friends , and bandmembers . " Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group 's reunion , " Everyone knows Billy doesn 't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record , other than Jimmy [ Chamberlin ] — who he has on board . " In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band " as sort of an open source collective " noting that " It 's whoever feels right at the time . " . Many of Corgan 's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion , full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him . Music critics were not often fans of Corgan 's angst @-@ filled lyrics . Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun @-@ Times article that Corgan 's lyrics " too often sound like sophomoric poetry , " although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement . Corgan responded to DeRogatis ' words with " fuck the Sun @-@ Times " , at the band 's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago . 
 The Smashing Pumpkins ' distinctive sound up until Adore involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process , a tactic that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness coproducer Flood called the " Pumpkin guitar overdub army . " Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on Gish , Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with Siamese Dream ; Corgan has stated that " Soma " alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts . While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert ( in fact , some songs were drastically altered for live performance ) , he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question " When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song , why not endow it with the grandest possible vision ? " This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan 's love of 1970s arena rock bands Queen , Boston , and the Electric Light Orchestra , as well as shoegaze , a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect . Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine , Ride , and Slowdive . 
 Like many contemporary alternative bands , The Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics , going from quiet to loud and vice versa . Hüsker Dü 's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare , and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions . Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener , " Welcome to Pumpkin Land , this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin . " This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore ( described as " arcane night music " in prerelease promotion ) and the Machina albums ( concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band ) . 
 The Pumpkins drew inspiration from a variety of other genres , some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics . Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal , citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist . When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that " Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that <unk> heavy metal " and that they " were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt , " Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath 's Master of Reality and Judas Priest 's Unleashed in the East . The song " Zero , " which reminded Iha of Judas Priest , is an example of what the band dubbed " <unk> . " Post @-@ punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division / New Order , Bauhaus , The Cure , and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band , which covered such artists in concert and on record . Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them . Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band 's early recordings ; according to Corgan , " In typical Pumpkins fashion , no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so , of course , that 's exactly what we had to do . " Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as " the Pumpkin chord " ( a G # octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it ) , used as the basis for " Cherub Rock " , " Drown " , and other songs , was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix . Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream , The Stooges , and Blue Cheer . 
 Regarding the band 's influence upon other groups , Greg Kot wrote in 2001 , " Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini @-@ <unk> , the Pumpkins remain an island unto themselves . " Still , some artists and bands have been influenced by the Pumpkins , such as Nelly Furtado , Marilyn Manson , Tegan and Sara , Panic ! at the Disco , and members of My Chemical Romance . My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way has said that they pattern their career upon the Pumpkins ' , including music videos . The members of fellow Chicago band Kill Hannah are friends with Corgan , and lead singer Mat Devine has compared his group to the Pumpkins .

 The Smashing Pumpkins have been praised as " responsible for some of the most striking and memorable video clips " and for having " approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums " . MTV 's 2001 anniversary special Testimony : 20 Years of Rock on MTV credited the Pumpkins , along with Nine Inch Nails , with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s . Corgan has said , " We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video , which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff . " The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake ( " Cherub Rock " ) , Samuel Bayer ( " Bullet with Butterfly Wings " ) , and , most frequently , the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ( " Rocket " , " 1979 " , " Tonight , Tonight " , " The End Is the Beginning Is the End " , and " Perfect " ) . Corgan , who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos , said of Dayton and Faris , " I know my [ initial ] versions are always darker , and they 're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler . " Videos like " Today " , " Rocket " , and " 1979 " dealt with images taken from middle American culture , albeit exaggerated . The group 's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for " Thirty @-@ Three " , with images closely related to the words of the song , was created as an intentional stylistic departure . 
 The band was nominated for several MTV Video Music Awards during the 1990s . In 1996 , the group won seven VMAs total for the " 1979 " and " Tonight , Tonight " videos , including the top award , Video of the Year , for " Tonight , Tonight " . The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony . Of the " Tonight , Tonight " video , Corgan remarked , " I don 't think we 've ever had people react [ like this ] ... it just seemed to touch a nerve . " 
 Shortly after the band 's 2000 breakup , the Greatest Hits Video Collection was released , collecting the band 's music videos from 1991 to 2000 and including commentary from Corgan , Iha , Chamberlin , Wretzky , and various music video directors with outtakes , live performances , and the extended " Try , Try , Try " short film . The band has also released several music videos to YouTube and other online sources since reuniting .

 = Jamaica at the 1988 Winter Olympics = 
 Jamaica competed in the Winter Olympic Games for the first time at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary , Canada . They competed in one sport , <unk> , in both the two @-@ man and four @-@ man events and finished outside the medal places in both competitions . Athletes were recruited from the Jamaica Defence Force , which saw Dudley Stokes , Devon Harris and Michael White become the first members of the team . Caswell Allen was the fourth man , but was injured prior to the start of the Olympics and was replaced by Chris Stokes , who was only in Canada to support his brother and new team @-@ mate Dudley . 
 The two man event took place first , with Dudley Stokes and White finishing in 30th position overall . American television stations aired footage of the four @-@ man Jamaican team , and despite crashing during the third run and finishing last overall , went on to inspire the 1993 film Cool Runnings . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Jamaica Olympic Association was formed in 1936 , but due to the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics due to the Second World War , the first Games they competed in was the 1948 Summer Olympics in London . They have appeared at every Summer Games since , including at the 1960 Games in which they appeared as part of the combined team of the British West Indies . They have won medals at every Summer Games they have competed at , with the exception of the 1956 and 1964 Summer Olympics . 
 = = Bobsleigh = = 
 Businessmen George B. Fitch and William Maloney proposed the idea of a Jamaican bobsleigh team after seeing a local pushcart derby in Jamaica . The President of the Jamaica Olympic Association at the time supported the idea , and so preparations were made to hire athletes . Advertisements were placed describing " dangerous and rigorous " trials which would form the basis of the country 's first bobsleigh team . However , recruitment proved to be problematic and so the Jamaica Defence Force was asked for volunteers . This resulted in the first team of Dudley Stokes , Devon Harris and Michael White . These three were selected as part of the team in October 1987 , with team @-@ mate Casewell Allen added later . 
 With funding provided by the Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board , training was conducted in Canada and Austria in preparation for the 1988 Winter Olympics . Sepp <unk> was recruited as a coach , and the team began to be featured in North American media with a comical angle . An agreement was reached with the Fédération International de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing in order to allow for entrance in both the four @-@ man and the two @-@ man events at the Games . Once in Calgary , the team conducted test runs on a frozen lake in order to get used to the conditions , but Allen fell and was injured . Chris Stokes , who was only in Canada in order to support his brother Dudley , was added to the four @-@ man team three days before the first run having never been in a bobsleigh before . 
 The first event which Jamaica competed in was the two @-@ man bobsleigh , where Dudley Stokes and Michael White became Jamaica 's first Winter Olympians . In their first run , they finished in 34th position , ahead of the second New Zealand team , both of the pairs from Portugal , U.S. Virgin Islands and Mexico . They improved in the second run , moving up to 22nd place , but were in 31st place on the third run and finished only one place higher in 30th place during the fourth and final run . Overall the duo finished in 30th place out of the 41 teams competing . 
 Following the elimination of the United States ice hockey team , American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four @-@ man event . The first run ended poorly , as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh , the push @-@ bar in the sleigh broke , resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place . On their second attempt , the team ranked second to last , due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat , remaining almost upright through the first corner . 
 It was the events of the third run for which the team became best known . Stokes injured his shoulder prior to the race , but decided to continue with the run . The team set the seventh fastest start for all competitors . At the turn called the " Kreisel " , Stokes lost control of the bobsleigh and it careened into the wall of the track , and flipped over on top of the four athletes . The four team members climbed out and pushed the bobsleigh to the end of the track , before they carried it off . The team did not compete in the fourth run of the event , and subsequently were listed as not finishing the event and therefore were placed in the last place overall . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The story of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics was turned into the 1993 movie Cool Runnings . However , the film was only loosely based on actual events , with real life coach Pat Brown later saying that the team had never experienced any of the animosity from the other teams as depicted in the movie . 
 All of the team members returned for the 1992 Winter Olympics , however Harris only competed in the two @-@ man event , with his place in the four @-@ man team taken by newcomer Ricky McIntosh . Harris and the Stokes brothers would continue to compete at the Winter Games in the bobsleigh events until the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano . 
 = My Bloody Valentine ( band ) = 
 My Bloody Valentine are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1983 . Since 1987 , the band 's lineup has consisted of founding members Kevin Shields ( vocals , guitar ) and Colm Ó Cíosóig ( drums ) , with Bilinda Butcher ( vocals , guitar ) and Debbie Googe ( bass ) . The group are known for their integration of noise , melody , and unorthodox guitar and production techniques . Their work in the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in their pioneering a musical style known as shoegaze . 
 Following several membership changes and unsuccessful releases , My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988 . The band released a number of successful EPs , including You Made Me Realise ( 1988 ) , Glider ( 1990 ) and Tremolo ( 1991 ) , and two studio albums , Isn 't Anything ( 1988 ) and Loveless ( 1991 ) on the label . Loveless , which has been described as the band 's magnum opus and one of the best albums of the 1990s , was a major critical success . However , the band were dropped by Creation Records after its release due to the album 's extensive production costs . In 1992 , My Bloody Valentine signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material , remaining largely inactive . Following the departure of Googe and Ó Cíosóig in 1995 , My Bloody Valentine later disbanded in 1997 . 
 In 2007 , Shields announced My Bloody Valentine had reformed and the band subsequently toured across Europe , Asia and North America . Following reissues of both Isn 't Anything and Loveless , and the release of the compilation album EP 's 1988 – 1991 ( 2012 ) , My Bloody Valentine 's long @-@ delayed third studio album , m b v , was released on 2 February 2013 , 22 years after the release of their last full @-@ length album .

 In 1978 , Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig were introduced to each other at a karate tournament in South Dublin . The duo became friends in what has been described as " an almost overnight friendship " and later formed The Complex , a punk rock band , with Liam Ó <unk> , Ó Cíosóig 's friend from Coláiste Eoin . The band , who performed " a handful of gigs " consisting of Sex Pistols and Ramones songs , disbanded when Ó <unk> left to form Hothouse Flowers . Shields and Ó Cíosóig later formed a Life in the Day , a post @-@ punk trio , but failed to secure performances with more than a hundred people present . Following A Life in the Day 's dissolution , Shields and Ó Cíosóig formed My Bloody Valentine in early 1983 with lead vocalist David Conway . Conway , who performed under the pseudonym Dave <unk> , suggested a number of potential band names , including the Burning Peacocks , before the trio settled on My Bloody Valentine . Shields has since claimed he was unaware that My Bloody Valentine was the title of a 1981 Canadian slasher film when the name was suggested . 
 My Bloody Valentine experienced a number of line @-@ up changes during their initial months . Lead guitarist Stephen Ivers and bassist Mark Ross were recruited in April 1983 and the band would often rehearse near Smithfield and Temple Bar in rehearsal spaces owned by Aidan Walsh . Walsh , who booked some of the band 's early performances , said the rehearsals were " too noisy " and " crazy " that " next door were giving out hell " . Ross left the band in December 1983 and was replaced by Paul Murtagh , who left the band in early 1984 . In March 1984 , Shields , Ivers and Conway recorded the band 's first demo on a four @-@ track recorder in Shields ' parents ' home in Killiney . Shields and Ó Cíosóig overdubbed bass and drum tracks at Litton Lane Studios , and the tape was later used to secure a contract with Tycoon Records . 
 Soon after recording the demo , Ivers left My Bloody Valentine and Conway 's girlfriend , Tina Durkin , joined as a keyboard player . Around this time , Conway , on the suggestion of Shields , contacted Gavin Friday , the lead vocalist of the post @-@ punk band Virgin Prunes . According to Shields , Conway approached Friday in <unk> , asked him for advice and was told to " get out of Dublin . " Friday provided the band with contacts that secured them a show in Tilburg , Netherlands . The band relocated to the Netherlands after the show and lived there for a further nine months , opening for R.E.M. on one occasion on 8 April 1984 . Due to a lack of opportunities and a lack of correct documentation , the band relocated to West Berlin , Germany in late 1984 and recorded their debut mini album , This Is Your Bloody Valentine ( 1985 ) . The album failed to receive much attention and the band returned temporarily to the Netherlands , before settling in London , United Kingdom in the middle of 1985 . 
 = = = Independent releases : 1985 – 1986 = = = 
 Following their relocation to London in 1985 , members of My Bloody Valentine lost contact with each other while looking for accommodation and Tina Durkin , not confident in her abilities as a keyboard player , left the band . When the remaining four members regained contact with one another , the band decided to audition bassists , as they lacked a regular bassist since their formation . Shields acquired Debbie Googe 's telephone number from a contact in London , invited her to audition and subsequently recruited her as a bassist . Googe managed to attend rehearsals , which were centred around her day job . Rehearsal sessions were regularly held at Salem Studios , which was connected to the independent record label Fever Records . The label 's management were impressed with the band and agreed to release an extended play , provided the band would finance the recording sessions themselves . Released in December 1985 , Geek ! failed to reach the band 's expectations ; however , soon after its release , My Bloody Valentine were performing on the London gig circuit , alongside bands such as Eight Living Lags , Kill Ugly Pop and The Stingrays . 
 Due to the band 's slow progress , Shields contemplated relocating to New York , where members of his family were living at the time . However , Creation Records co @-@ founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label , Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP . The New Record by My Bloody Valentine , produced by Foster , was released in October 1986 and was a minor success , peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release . On the strength of the release , the band began performing more frequent shows , later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances , supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes . 
 = = = Lazy Records and Butcher 's recruitment : 1987 = = = 
 In early 1987 , My Bloody Valentine signed to Lazy Records , another independent record label , which was founded by the indie pop band The Primitives and their manager , Wayne Morris . My Bloody Valentine 's first release on the label was the single " Sunny Sundae Smile " , released in February 1987 . It peaked at number 6 on the UK Indie Singles Chart and the band toured following its release . After a number of performances throughout the United Kingdom , the band managed to secure a support slot with The Soup Dragons . In March 1987 , during the tour with The Soup Dragons , David Conway announced his decision to leave the band , due to a gastric illness , disillusionment with music and ambitions to become a writer . 
 Conway 's departure left My Bloody Valentine without a lead vocalist — a situation Shields , Ó Cíosóig and Googe decided to amend by placing advertisements in the local music press . The audition process , which Shields described as " disastrous and excruciating " , was unsuccessful due to Shields " mentioning The Smiths , because [ he ] liked their melodies " , which attracted a number of vocalists he referred to as " <unk> " . Although considering forming another group , the band were recommended a number of vocalists from peers and experimented with two lead vocalists , Bilinda Butcher and Joe Byfield . Byfield was deemed unsuited as a vocalist and the band recruited Butcher . Butcher , whose prior musical experience was playing classical guitar as a child and singing and playing tambourine " with some girlfriends for fun " , had learned that My Bloody Valentine needed a backing vocalist from her partner , who had met Colm Ó Cíosóig on a ferry from the Netherlands . At her audition for the band , she sang " The Bargain Store " , a song from Dolly Parton 's 1975 album of the same name . 
 In light of Butcher 's recruitment , Shields became a co @-@ lead vocalist , splitting and often sharing duties alongside Butcher . Commenting on the transition , Shields noted that Butcher " sounded all right and she could sing one of our songs , we just had to show her how to play guitar . " Shields was initially reluctant to take on a vocal role within the band , but said that he had " always sung in the rehearsal room [ ... ] and made up the melodies . " With the new line up in place , the band intended to drop the My Bloody Valentine moniker , but according to Ó Cíosóig and Shields , the band was unable to decide on a name and kept the moniker " for better or for worse " . 
 Under pressure from Lazy Records to release a full @-@ length album , My Bloody Valentine compromised and agreed to release a single and subsequent mini album , citing the need for time to stabilize their new line @-@ up . " Strawberry Wine " , a three @-@ track single , was released in November 1987 and Ecstasy was released a month later . Both received moderate critical acclaim , and peaked at number 13 and 12 on the independent singles and albums chart , respectively . " Strawberry Wine " , however , was described as " certainly the better of the two releases " , as Ecstasy was plagued by production difficulties , including errors in the mastering process . Ecstasy was criticised as showing " a group who appeared to have run out of money halfway through recording " , which was later confirmed , as the band were funding the studio sessions themselves . My Bloody Valentine 's contract with Lazy stated that the label would handle promotion of releases , whereas the band would finance the recording sessions . Following their departure from Lazy , who later rereleased " Strawberry Wine " and Ecstasy on the compilation album Ecstasy and Wine ( 1989 ) without the band 's consent , Rough Trade Records offered a deal to finance the recording and release of a full @-@ length album , however , the band turned it down . 
 = = = Creation Records and Loveless : 1988 – 1991 = = = 
 In January 1988 , My Bloody Valentine performed in Canterbury , opening for Biff Bang Pow ! , a band that featured Creation Records founder Alan McGee . After " blowing [ Biff Bang Pow ! ] off the stage " , My Bloody Valentine were described as " the Irish equivalent to Hüsker Dü " by McGee , who approached the band after the show and offered them an opportunity to record and release a single on Creation . The band recorded five songs at a studio in Walthamstow , East London in less than a week and in August 1988 , released You Made Me Realise . The EP was well received by the independent music press and according to AllMusic 's Nitsuh Abebe , the release that " made critics stand up and take notice of the brilliant things My Bloody Valentine were up to " , adding " it developed some of the stunning guitar sounds that would become the band 's trademark " . It debuted at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart . Following the success of You Made Me Realise , My Bloody Valentine released their debut full @-@ length studio album , Isn 't Anything , in November 1988 . Recorded in rural Wales , the album was a major success , receiving widespread critical acclaim , peaking at number 1 on the UK Indie Chart and influencing a number of shoegazing bands , who " worked off the template My Bloody Valentine established with [ the album ] " . 
 In February 1989 , My Bloody Valentine began recording their second studio album at Blackwing Studios in Southwark , London . Creation Records believed that the album could be recorded " in five days " . However , it soon " became clear that wasn 't going to happen " . Following several unproductive months , during which Shields assumed main duties on the musical and technical aspects of the sessions , the band relocated to a total of nineteen other studios and hired a number of engineers , including Alan Moulder , Anjali Dutt and Guy <unk> . Due to the extensive recording time , Shields and Alan McGee agreed to release another EP and subsequently the band released Glider in April 1990 . Containing the lead single " Soon " , which featured the first recorded use of Shields ' " glide guitar " technique , the EP peaked at number 2 on the UK Indie Chart and the band toured in summer 1990 to support its release . In February 1991 , while still recording their second album , My Bloody Valentine released Tremolo , which was another critical success and topped the UK Indie Chart . 
 Released in November 1991 , Loveless was rumoured to have cost over £ 250 @,@ 000 and bankrupt Creation Records , claims which Shields has denied . Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise although the album was not a commercial success . It peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart elsewhere internationally . McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon after the release of Loveless , due to the album 's extensive recording period and interpersonal problems with Shields . 
 = = = Island Records and breakup : 1992 – 1997 = = = 
 My Bloody Valentine signed with Island Records in October 1992 for a reported £ 250 @,@ 000 contract . The band 's advance went towards the construction of a home studio in Streatham , South London , which was completed in April 1993 . Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into " semi @-@ meltdown " , according to Shields , who was rumoured to have been suffering from writer 's block . The band remained largely inactive , however , they recorded and released two cover songs from 1993 to 1996 — a rendering of " We Have All the Time in the World " by Louis Armstrong for Peace Together and a cover of " Map Ref . 41 ° N 93 ° W " by Wire for the tribute album Whore : Tribute to Wire . 
 In 1995 , Debbie Googe and Colm Ó Cíosóig left My Bloody Valentine . Googe , who briefly worked as a taxi driver following her departure , formed the indie rock supergroup Snowpony with Katharine Gifford of <unk> and Ó Cíosóig relocated to the United States , forming Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions with Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star . Shields and Butcher attempted to record a third studio album , which Shields claimed would be released in 1998 , however Butcher departed the band in 1997 . Unable to finalise a third album , Shields isolated himself , and in his own words " went crazy " , drawing comparisons in the music press to the eccentric behavior of other musicians , including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd . Shields later became a touring member of Primal Scream , collaborated with a number of artists including Yo La Tengo , Dinosaur Jr . , and Le Volume <unk> and recorded songs for the soundtrack to the 2003 film Lost in Translation . 
 Rumours had spread amongst fans that albums worth of material had been recorded and shelved prior to the band 's break up . In 1999 , it was reported that Shields had delivered 60 hours of material to Island Records , and Butcher confirmed that there existed " probably enough songs to fill two albums . " Shields later admitted that at least one full album of " half @-@ finished " material was abandoned , stating " it was dead . It hadn 't got that spirit , that life in it . "

 In August 2007 , reports emerged suggesting My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio , California , United States . Similar reports had circulated in 2003 , stating that Shields , Butcher and Ó Cíosóig were together in Berlin , Germany , re @-@ recording five songs recorded for Glider , which were due for release on an upcoming box set ; and in 2007 , reports suggested My Bloody Valentine were due to perform at a series of Pod @-@ organised concerts at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham , Dublin . Shields later confirmed the reunion and said that the band 's third studio album , which he had begun recording in 1996 , was near completion . Three live shows in the United Kingdom were announced in November 2007 and on 13 June 2008 , My Bloody Valentine performed in public for the first time in 16 years during two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London . 
 My Bloody Valentine began an extensive worldwide tour throughout summer and autumn 2008 . The band began performing at European music festivals , including the Roskilde Festival in Roskilde , Denmark , Øyafestivalen in Oslo , Norway , and Electric Picnic in <unk> , Ireland , as well as the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata , Japan . From 19 to 21 September , the band curated and performed at the 2008 All Tomorrow 's Parties festival in New York , United States and later performed throughout North America , including dates in Chicago , Toronto , Denver , San Francisco , Los Angeles and Austin . The band spent £ 200 @,@ 000 on equipment for their world tour , which was their first since 1992 in support of Loveless . 
 Following additional touring in 2009 , My Bloody Valentine dedicated their time to completing their third album . Rumours of a My Bloody Valentine box set , which had circulated amongst the public in April 2008 following a listing on HMV Japan 's web site , began recirculating . In March 2012 , after a number of reported delays , Sony Music Ireland announced the release of the compilation album EP 's 1988 – 1991 — a collection of the band 's Creation Records extended plays , singles and unreleased tracks . The compilation album was released on 4 May 2012 , alongside remastered versions of Isn 't Anything and Loveless . 
 In November 2012 , Kevin Shields announced plans to release My Bloody Valentine 's third album online before the end of the year . In December , the band announced on Facebook that the album was completed and mastered , and on 27 January 2013 , during a warm @-@ up show at Electric Brixton in London , Shields told the audience that the album " might be out in two or three days . " The album , titled m b v , was released through the band 's official website on 2 February 2013 , although the site crashed on its launch due to high traffic . Upon its release , m b v received " universal acclaim " , according to Metacritic , and the band began a worldwide tour . Shields has since announced intentions to release a My Bloody Valentine EP " of all @-@ new material " , which will be followed by a fourth studio album .

 My Bloody Valentine 's musical style progressed throughout their career . The band were originally influenced by post @-@ punk , in particular The Birthday Party , The Cramps and Joy Division , and as author Mike <unk> noted , " brought together the least interesting elements " of their influences . Their debut mini album , This is Your Bloody Valentine ( 1985 ) , incorporated a further gothic rock sound which AllMusic referred to as " unfocused and derivative " . However , when the band began experimenting with indie pop melodies on The New Record by My Bloody Valentine ( 1986 ) , it marked " a vital point in the development of their sound " , which was influenced primarily by The Jesus and Mary Chain . The band later took a " rarified , effete and poppy approach to <unk> rock " with their two successive releases , " Strawberry Wine " and Ecstasy ( 1987 ) . Isn 't Anything , and its preceding release You Made Me Realise ( 1988 ) , were influenced by American indie rock bands , most notably Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth , as well as hip hop music . Loveless ( 1991 ) was influenced by a wide range of genres , including dream pop , noise rock and house music . In the mid @-@ 1990s , during the recording of m b v ( 2013 ) , Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig began experimenting with drum and bass music , which was an underground trend in London at the time . Elements of jungle music were incorporated into m b v , particularly the final three tracks — " In Another Way " , " Nothing Is " and " Wonder 2 " — which marked a further shift in My Bloody Valentine 's sound that Pitchfork Media referred to as " so surprising and ultimately powerful . " 
 One of the most recognisable aspects of My Bloody Valentine 's music is Shields ' guitar sound , which " use [ s ] texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes . " During the late 1980s , Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters ; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably , to allow him to manipulate the arm while strumming chords , which resulted in excessive pitch bending . Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved " a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus " , according to Rolling Stone . Shields ' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb , sourced from a Yamaha <unk> effects unit . Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion , he created a technique known as " glide guitar " . Shields effects rig , which is composed largely of distortion , graphic equalizers and tone controls , consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers , which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain . During live performances , and in particular the closing song " You Made Me Realise " , My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback , known as " the holocaust " , which would last for half an hour and often reached <unk> . Shields later remarked " it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation . We just liked the fact that we could see a change in the audience at a certain point . " 
 Bilinda Butcher 's vocals have been referred to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine 's sound , alongside Shields ' guitar techniques . On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn 't Anything and Loveless , Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals , which she said " influenced [ her ] sound " by making them " more dreamy and sleepy " . The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine 's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument . Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band 's vocals . My Bloody Valentine 's lyrics are mostly written by Shields . However , Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn 't Anything and Loveless , but has referred to a lot of the lyrics as " plain nonsense . " According to Butcher , she " didn 't have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them . I just used whatever was in my head for the moment . " Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded . Butcher has said : " He [ Shields ] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words . " Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics , even though few changes actually resulted , as Shields believed " there 's nothing worse than bad lyrics . " Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band 's lyrics often contain sexual themes , which are " a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness " .

 My Bloody Valentine are regarded as the pioneers of the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing , a term coined by Sounds journalists in the late 1980s to describe certain bands " motionless performing style , where they stood on stage and stared at the floor " . The band 's releases on Creation Records influenced other shoegazing acts , including Slowdive , Ride and Lush , and are regarded as providing a platform to allow the bands to become recognised . Following the release of Loveless ( 1991 ) , My Bloody Valentine were " poised for a popular breakthrough " , although never achieved mainstream success . However , the band are noted to have been " profoundly influential in the direction of ' 90s alternative rock " , according to AllMusic . 
 Several mainstream rock bands have cited My Bloody Valentine as an influence . The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan was influenced by Isn 't Anything upon its release and attempted to recreate its sound on the band 's debut album Gish ( 1991 ) , particularly the closing track " Daydream " which Corgan described as " a complete rip @-@ off of the My Bloody Valentine sound . " The Smashing Pumpkins two successive studio albums , Siamese Dream ( 1993 ) and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness ( 1995 ) , were also influenced by the band . Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails praised Loveless ' musical diversity and production , Courtney Love cited the band as an influence on Hole 's third album Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) and the album has also been said to have made a considerable influence on Radiohead , particularly influencing the band 's textured guitar sound . The Edge , guitarist of U2 , cited Loveless as a major influence on the guitar sound on Achtung Baby ( 1991 ) and referred to My Bloody Valentine as " head and shoulders above a lot of what was going on at the time . " 
 Isn 't Anything and Loveless have been regarded as among the greatest albums of all time . Isn 't Anything was included in The Guardian 's list of " 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die " and listed at number 22 on Pitchfork Media 's " Top 100 Albums of the 1980s . " Loveless was named the best album of the 1990s by Pitchfork Media in 1999 and in 2003 , the album was listed as number 219 on Rolling Stone 's list of " The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . " In 2008 , both albums were featured on The Irish Times ' " Top 40 Irish Albums of All Time " list , where Isn 't Anything ranked at number 27 and Loveless at number 1 . In 2013 , Loveless placed third in the Irish Independent 's " Top 30 Irish Albums of All Time " list .

 = Dolphinarium = 
 A dolphinarium is an aquarium for dolphins . The dolphins are usually kept in a large pool , though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea , either for research or for public performances . Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public , others are part of larger parks , such as marine mammal parks , zoos or theme parks , with other animals and attractions as well . 
 While cetaceans have been held in captivity since the 1860s , the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in 1938 . Their popularity increased rapidly until the 1960s . Since the 1970s , increasing concern for animal welfare led to stricter regulation , which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums . Despite this trend , dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe , Japan and North America . 
 The most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the bottlenose dolphin , as it is relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity . While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated , other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity , such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools , vary among countries . Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades , many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse . 
 = = History = = 
 Though cetaceans have been held in captivity in both North America and Europe since the 1860s , the first being a pair of Beluga Whales in the New York museum , dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine , Florida . It was here that it was discovered that dolphins could be trained to perform tricks . Recognizing the success of Marine Studios , more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment . In the 1960s , keeping dolphins in zoos and aquariums for entertainment purposes increased in popularity after the 1963 Flipper movie and subsequent Flipper television series . In 1966 , the first dolphin was exported to Europe . In these early days , dolphinariums could grow quickly due to a lack of legislation and lack of concern for animal welfare . 
 New legislation , most notably the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States , combined with a more critical view on animal welfare , forced many dolphinariums around the world to close . A prominent example is the United Kingdom ; in the early 1970s there were at least 36 dolphinariums and traveling dolphin shows , however , the last dolphinarium closed its doors in 1993 . The last dolphinarium in Hungary was closed in 1992 . In 2005 both Chile and Costa Rica prohibited keeping cetaceans captive . However , around 60 dolphinariums currently exist across Europe , of which 34 are within the EU . Japan , Mexico and the United States are also home to a relatively large number of dolphinariums . 
 = = Design = = 
 Many varied designs exist , but basic dolphinarium design for public performances often consists of stands for the public around a semi @-@ circular pool , sometimes with glass walls which allow underwater viewing , and a platform in the middle from which the trainers direct and present the show . 
 The water in the pools has to be constantly filtered to keep it clean for the dolphins and the spectators , and the temperature and composition of the water has to be controlled to match the conditions dolphins experience in the wild . In the absence of a common international regulation , guidelines regarding the minimum size of the pools vary between countries . To give an indication of pool sizes , the European Association for Aquatic Mammals recommends that a pool for five dolphins should have a surface area of 275 m2 ( 2 @,@ 960 sq ft ) plus an additional 75 m2 ( 810 sq ft ) for every additional animal , have a depth of 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) and have a water volume of at least 1 @,@ 000 m3 ( 35 @,@ 000 cu ft ) with an additional 200 m3 ( 7 @,@ 100 cu ft ) for every additional animal . If two of these three conditions are met , and the third is not more than 10 % below standard , the <unk> considers the pool size to be acceptable . 
 = = Animals = = 
 = = = Species = = = 
 Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity as well as several other small whale species such as Harbour Porpoises , Finless Porpoises and Belugas , though in those cases the word dolphinarium may not be fitting as these are not true dolphins . Bottlenose Dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train , have a long lifespan in captivity and a friendly appearance . Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world , though exact numbers are hard to determine . Orcas are well known for their performances in shows , but the number of Orcas kept in captivity is very small , especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins , with only 44 captive orcas being held in aquaria as of 2012 . Of all Orcas kept in captivity , the majority are located in the various SeaWorld parks in the United States . Other species kept in captivity are Spotted Dolphins , False Killer Whales , Pilot Whales and Common Dolphins , Commerson 's Dolphins , as well as Rough @-@ toothed Dolphins , but all in much lower numbers than the Bottlenose Dolphin . There are also fewer than ten , Amazon River Dolphins , Risso 's Dolphins , Spinner Dolphins , or <unk> in captivity . Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins known as Wolphins are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii , which are a cross between a Bottlenose Dolphin and a False Killer Whale . Also two Common / Bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity : one at Discovery Cove and the other SeaWorld San Diego . 
 = = = Trade and capture = = = 
 In the early days , many Bottlenose dolphins were wild @-@ caught off the coast of Florida . Though the Marine Mammal Protection Act , established in 1972 , allows an exception for the collection of dolphins for public display and research purposes when a permit is obtained , Bottlenose dolphins have not been captured in American waters since 1989 . In most Western countries , breeding programs have been set up to provide the dolphinariums with new animals . To achieve a sufficient birth rate and to prevent inbreeding , artificial insemination ( AI ) is occasionally used . The use of AI also allows dolphinariums to increase the genetic diversity of their population without having to bring in any dolphins from other facilities . 
 The trade of dolphins is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( also known as the Washington Convention or CITES ) . Endangered dolphin species are included in CITES ’ Appendix I , in which case trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances . Species considered not to be threatened with extinction are included in Appendix II , in which case trade “ must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival ” . Most cetacean species traded for display in captivity to the public or for use in swimming with dolphins and other interaction programs are listed on Appendix II . 
 However , live dolphins trade still continues . A live Bottlenose Dolphin is estimated to be worth between a few thousand to several tens of thousands of US dollars , depending on age , condition and prior training . Captures are reported to be on the rise in the South Pacific and the Caribbean , Cuba has also been an exporter of dolphins in recent years , this being organized by the Acuario Nacional de Cuba . In recent years , the Solomon Islands have also allowed the collection and export of dolphins for public display facilities . A 2005 law banned the export of dolphins , however , this ban was seemingly overturned in 2007 when some 28 dolphins were shipped to Dubai . Some , mainly Japanese , dolphinariums obtain their dolphins from local drive hunts , though several other countries in Asia also import dolphins from Japan . Several American dolphinariums had also done so . This practice was halted in 1993 , when the US National Marine Fisheries Service refused a permit for Marine World Africa USA to import four False Killer Whales caught in a Japanese drive hunt . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 = = = Animal welfare = = = 
 Many animal welfare groups such as the World Animal Protection consider keeping dolphins in captivity to be a form of animal abuse . The main arguments are that dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement in pools , regardless of pool size , ( in the wild , dolphins swim hundreds of miles every day ) and do not get enough stimulation . Dolphins often show repetitive behavior in captivity and sometimes become aggressive towards other animals or people . In some cases , the behavior of dolphins in captivity also results in their own death . 
 The lifespan of dolphins in captivity is another subject of debate . Research has shown that Orcas indeed have a much lower survival rate in captivity ; however , there is no significant difference between wild and captive survival rates for Bottlenose dolphins . This does not , however , reflect a global state of affairs : for example , Bottlenose dolphins in captive facilities in Jamaica suffer from extremely high mortality rates . 
 Some scientists suggest that the " unusually high " intelligence of dolphins means that they should be recognized as " non @-@ human persons " . In 2013 , the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests prohibited the captivity of dolphins on these grounds , finding it " morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose " . 
 = Hadong Ambush = 
 The Hadong Ambush was an engagement between United States and North Korean forces , occurring on July 27 , 1950 , in the village of Hadong in southern South Korea , early in the Korean War . The fight ended in a North Korean victory following a successful ambush of US forces which resulted in heavy American casualties . 
 The US Army 's 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment , a newly formed unit consisting mostly of inexperienced new arrivals , was ordered to move to the South Korean village of Hadong to hold the pass there from advancing forces of the North Korean People 's Army . Unprepared for combat , the American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion 's command staff was killed in the pass , leaving lower @-@ ranking soldiers to mount a disorganized defence against North Korean troops occupying prepared positions on higher ground . 
 For three hours the battalion fought , pinned in a crossfire by North Korean soldiers on higher ground . North Korean forces were able to divide the American force and kill most of its commanders , further disorganizing the men . Following the failed operation , the wounded US commander ordered a withdrawal , which quickly became disorganized , resulting in hundreds of casualties . Destroyed after its first engagement , the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment was disbanded and merged with other units as the North Korean forces advanced through the pass and attacked US positions to the east . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War as a result , the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea . The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945 , and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , which was headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow follow @-@ on forces to arrive . The division was consequently outnumbered and outgunned for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans , making time for the 7th Infantry Division , 25th Infantry Division , 1st Cavalry Division , and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position . South Korean forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea 's east coast , with entire divisions being overrun by the North Koreans ' superior firepower and equipment . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , during the first battle between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith , 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force 's superior numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , being almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region at around 70 @,@ 000 for each side , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = Replacements arrive = = = 
 On July 20 , 400 hastily assembled US Army recruits arrived in Okinawa aboard the USS Walker . The inexperienced soldiers were assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment , 2nd Infantry Division , a command that was preparing other battalions to move into Korea and to relieve the other units of the 24th Infantry Division . The new formations , now consisting mostly of soldiers who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions , were immediately sent into Pusan . The headquarters of the regiment remained behind to form a new regiment . This regiment would originally be in charge of the defense of Okinawa but would later be rushed into Korea . The two battalions landed in Pusan on July 21 and were assigned to the 19th Infantry Regiment , 24th Infantry Division , but they retained their designations as the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 29th Infantry Regiment . Instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter the front lines , the battalions were immediately sent to the regiment 's sector at Chinju . By July 22 the units were on the front lines with new equipment . The equipment , fresh from production lines , was not prepared for combat , despite promises from several commanders that the unit would be given time to do so .

 American planners believed that the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division , having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon . However , the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division under the command of General Pang Ho San . The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN 's left flank and were extremely spread out . Therefore , only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region , some with small numbers of tanks . 
 = = = Arrival = = = 
 Immediately after arrival , the commanding officer of the 19th Infantry Regiment , Colonel Ned D. Moore , ordered the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment to move out and seize the Hadong pass , a road junction 35 miles ( 56 km ) southwest of Chinju , where about 500 North Korean soldiers were reported to be moving . Eighth Army had also received reports that the North Koreans had been fighting South Korean police who were resisting in the village of Hadong , one mile west of the pass . The battalion commander , Lieutenant Colonel Harold W. Mott , alerted his troops , and at 0030 on July 26 , the battalion departed alone on its mission . It had a strength of 925 men . The battalion was to hold the pass , a southern route into Pusan , from any advancing North Korean forces . Hadong was seen as a significant path into Chinju , despite its lack of defenses . 
 The North Koreans , in the meantime , advanced to Hadong and captured the village which was lightly defended by a group of South Korean police , as no military was available due to manpower shortages . The Koreans , members of the NK 6th Division , set up in roads east of the village and began sending probes and scout parties to the east . The move was part of a larger coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju , and then Masan , in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit . Thinking the UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale , NK 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively advance to Chinju as quickly as possible . 
 Accompanying the 3rd Battalion was South Korean Major General Chae <unk> Duk , South Korea 's Army Chief of Staff who had been relieved after the fall of Seoul . Having fallen out of favor with the South Korean command , Chae was to be an interpreter and guide for 3rd Battalion on its mission . He accompanied the battalion with only a few of his aides . The battalion was forced to take several detours through <unk> because of impassable roads , and it was delayed in its arrival to Hadong . Shortly before dawn , the troops encountered a truck of 15 South Korean militia who claimed they were the remains of a 400 @-@ man unit that had been wiped out by North Korean forces in the area . Mott sent his executive officer back to the command post to ask Moore for further instructions , and Moore ordered them to proceed with the mission . Because the battalion had no radio equipment it was forced to send a runner to relay this information , and he returned by nightfall , forcing the battalion to encamp in the village of <unk> , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of Hadong , for the night . 
 = = = Ambush = = = 
 At 0845 on July 27 the battalion moved out towards the Hadong pass , arriving within an hour . When it was within 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) of the pass , L Company at the head of the formation spotted a North Korean patrol . The company 's heavy weapons were fired at the patrol , forcing it to withdraw but causing no casualties . L Company then rushed the pass and dug in at 0930 , waiting for a scheduled airstrike on the village of Hadong 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the west at <unk> . Behind L Company was the battalion command group , followed by K and M Companies , with I Company covering the rear . The battalion 's command group , including Mott , Chae and most of the senior officers , approached the pass as L Company took cover on the left side of the road . As they approached the pass , a company of North Korean soldiers was spotted up the road , part of a scouting party looking to probe further east . L Company was preparing to ambush the North Koreans when they got closer , but before this could happen , Chae called out to the Koreans demanding they identify themselves . The North Koreans immediately ducked for cover in the ditches on the side of the road , and L Company opened fire on them . 
 Immediately the American forces were hit with machine gun and mortar fire from the north ridge , where North Korean troops had been dug in . The first burst of machine gun fire killed Chae and wounded most of the other commanders , including Mott . Mott managed to make it to the ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole , but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion . North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground , both from the pass and from the ridge . Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles , including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air @-@ control party which was to direct airstrikes . During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party , and when unable to do so , left the area without making any strikes . 
 The 3rd Battalion had walked into a prepared North Korean ambush , suffering a bombardment of mortar and machine gun fire from prepared and hidden North Korean positions , and almost its entire command group was eliminated within a minute of the first shot being fired . L Company , at the pass , was heavily engaged with the North Korean forces higher on the hill . The company 's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes , with two members of the company killed by bayonets . L Company was separated from the rest of the battalion by North Korean forces advancing on its position further up the ridge . K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so . However , the company held in place . Meanwhile , I Company began moving up the hill to provide support . North Korean forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups , with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them . By noon , the North Korean forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces . 
 = = = American withdrawal = = = 
 At 1200 , Mott was brought to the position of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra . Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat . Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw . A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions . Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass , being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process . They also had to cross a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) -wide stream in the retreat , and some drowned in the process . Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons , equipment and clothing in the retreat . Many of the men of L Company , as well as some of the wounded , were able to evacuate by truck . 
 Survivors from 3rd Battalion disengaged from the battle in groups . The largest group of 97 survivors moved 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) south to the small port of <unk> where a fishing vessel carried them out to a South Korean patrol boat . Other groups of soldiers escaped into the hills while some had to fight their way back to Chinju . Most of the battalion 's officers were casualties in the fight , and the scattered and disorganized retreat destroyed the battalion . Stragglers continued to wander into the 19th Infantry 's lines throughout the rest of the day . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 More than half of the American battalion was lost during its first engagement . Only 354 members of the battalion , including some walking wounded , were able to report for duty the next day . A captured North Korean soldier reported that around 100 men had been captured at Hadong . A later search uncovered 313 American bodies , most along the river and in the rice paddies south of the pass . Official casualties for the Americans in the battle were 242 killed , 135 wounded , 51 captured , and 67 missing , for a total of 495 casualties . However , two of the prisoners died in captivity and all but four of the missing were found dead , leaving the total number killed during the battle at 307 . Over 30 vehicles and practically all of the soldiers ' weapons used by 3rd Battalion were lost . Casualties of North Korean forces could not be estimated by the American units . 
 The shattered 3rd Battalion traveled back to Chinju to join the 19th Infantry Regiment . There it was disbanded and its remaining men were assigned to the 19th Infantry Regiment , which itself had suffered heavy losses . Meanwhile , the 1st Battalion , 29th Infantry was sent to <unk> to the north , where it was attacked and pushed back repeatedly by the North Korean 4th Infantry Division . On July 31 , the North Korean 6th Infantry Division struck Chinju , pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry , forcing them to withdraw east . This left the southern entries to Pusan open , but the North Korean 6th Division was unable to exploit it due to its extended supply line . The 6th Division eventually advanced further east , attempting to capture the city of Masan , but newly reorganized troops of the US Army repulsed them and inflicted heavy casualties on them less than a week later during the Battle of the Notch .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Oxford by seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in the previous year 's race . They led overall with nine wins to Oxford 's six . 
 For the 1859 race , Oxford instigated a new method of crew selection : trial eights . Prior to this , the selection of crew was made on the recommendations of the College boat club captains . Oxford boat club president John Arkell remarked " it will not do to trust too much the <unk> ( sic ) of the College captains . " Following a race between the two trial eights , the final crew was selected eight weeks prior to the race . Cambridge would not introduce this selection method until the 1868 race . Oxford began training on 14 March with an outing almost every day between then and 13 April . Cambridge , on the other hand , arrived in London six days before the race and made just three outings on the Thames . The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race .

 Oxford saw the return of three former Blues in Lane , Risley and Arkell , all of whom rowed in the 1858 race . Cambridge welcomed back five former rowers , including Archibald Levin Smith who had rowed in both the 1857 and 1858 races . Oxford 's crew weighed an average of 11 st 8 @.@ 75 lb ( 73 @.@ 6 kg ) , approximately 3 @.@ 25 pounds ( 1 @.@ 47 kg ) per man more than their opponents .

 The weather was inclement , with the sky overcast by heavy clouds and gale @-@ force winds ; according to a report in The Times , " it would not have been easy to pitch on a more unfavourable day for an eight @-@ oared race " . Although Cambridge were pre @-@ race favourites , they requested a postponement because of the conditions . Oxford refused the request ; Cambridge lost the toss and were handed the Surrey station for the start . The Middlesex station provided Oxford considerable relief from the rough water and wind . 
 Oxford 's boat was heavily criticised : " it was everything but what was right " , but it became quickly apparent that the Cambridge boat was too light for the conditions , and began taking on water from the moment it left the shore . Oxford made a good start and after the first mile , were two @-@ to @-@ three lengths ahead of Cambridge . Conditions soon worsened : some of the steamboats in the flotilla following the crews looked " bound to capsize " . By Hammersmith Bridge the Cambridge boat was " ankle deep in water " and was sinking under the rough water . Oxford took the opportunity to extend their lead and pulled away from their opponents and the boats following . As Cambridge 's vessel sank opposite The White Hart pub at Mortlake , some crew were picked up by boats , others swam to the shore . 
 Oxford recorded a winning time of 24 minutes and 4 seconds and took the overall record to 9 – 7 in favour of Cambridge . It was the first time in the event 's history that a boat sank .

 " Number 1 " is an electronic – dance song performed by British group Goldfrapp . The song was written and produced by Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory for the duo 's third album Supernature ( 2005 ) . The song features a synthesizer and bass arrangement and was written about the importance and meaningfulness that somebody shares with another , despite that it might not necessarily last . 
 The song was released as the album 's second single in October 2005 to positive reviews from music critics . It was a commercial success , reaching the top forty on the majority of the charts it entered , and topped the U.S. dance chart . The song has been remixed a number of times and was featured in advertising campaigns for the U.S. retail company Target .

 " Number 1 " is a mid @-@ tempo electronic love song about the importance and meaningfulness that somebody shares with another , despite that it might not necessarily last . The song was composed as a collaborative effort between Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory in late 2004 in the countryside of Bath , England . The song was written and recorded while Goldfrapp and Gregory were jamming in the recording studio , bouncing song ideas off each other . According to Goldfrapp , the song 's lyrics are " a little bit more reflective and sensual " than those she had composed on Felt Mountain ( 2000 ) and Black Cherry ( 2003 ) . 
 " Number 1 " is written in the common verse @-@ chorus form and features instrumentation from synthesizers and a bass guitar . It contains a synth and bass arrangement that the duo would use frequently on the rest of Supernature . Most of the song was composed on an old Roland String synth keyboard because Goldfrapp enjoyed the sounds that it exudes .

 The music video for " Number 1 " was directed by Dawn Shadforth and filmed in London , England in 2005 . The video is set in a plastic surgery clinic where the staff and the patients , except Alison Goldfrapp , have a dog 's head and a human body . The video 's theme is a reference to the song 's lyrics in which Goldfrapp sings " I 'm like a dog to get you " . The video depicts the story of a white poodle who is being operated on by Great Dane and Yorkshire Terrier surgeons ( the receptionist and attendant nurses are <unk> ) . Scenes of Alison Goldfrapp acting like a dog and dancing with the clinic 's staff are intercut throughout the video . 
 The video premiered in the UK in early October 2005 . The complete version of " Number 1 " featured in the music video has been released commercially through CD singles and digital downloads , and some include remixes by Alan Braxe and Fred Falke .

 In October 2005 , Goldfrapp performed " Number 1 " on British television shows and toured Europe , playing the single and other new songs . The duo performed only one concert in North America at the Nokia Theatre in New York City on 5 December 2005 . The U.S. concert sold out rapidly , which overwhelmed Goldfrapp who did not expect the large turnout . In late 2006 , " Number 1 " was featured in Christmas advertising campaigns for the U.S. retail company Target . The song , along with " Fly Me Away " , was featured in six winter @-@ themed television commercials . 
 " Number 1 " was released as a various formats throughout the world .

 = Barryville – Shohola Bridge = 
 The Barryville – Shohola Bridge is the fifth generation of bridges constructed over the Delaware River at the communities of Shohola Township , Pennsylvania and Barryville , New York . The bridge serves both communities , with two major state legislative highways , Pennsylvania Traffic Route 434 and New York State Touring Route 55 ( along with the co @-@ designation of Sullivan County Route 11 ) . The bridge itself is 812 feet ( 247 m ) long and is 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) wide , using four total spans across the river . It is maintained by the NY – PA Joint Interstate Bridge Commission , which is jointly owned by the states of New York and Pennsylvania . 
 The area of the bridge itself dates as a ford for Native Americans , mostly the Lenni <unk> , traveling between from the Wyoming valley and Delaware Valley and present @-@ day Connecticut in the early 18th century ; archaeologists date human habitation and use of the area to 10 @,@ 900 BCE . The river at Shohola , which means " place of peace , " widens perceptibly above the falls , allowing for a natural , shallow crossing . By the early 19th century , a ferry facilitated crossing the river . Due to the construction of the nearby Delaware and Hudson Canal in 1827 , commerce and business boomed in the area . In 1856 , a bridge company , under the leadership of Chauncey Thomas , constructed a span between the two communities , but it was poorly designed and collapsed during a windstorm in 1859 . Thomas then constructed a suspension bridge , but its cables snapped in 1865 . 
 In 1866 , the bridge was reconstructed as a two @-@ lane , single span wooden suspension structure and remained in use for over seventy years . Ownership changed several times , eventually ending with the bridge in the control of the Joint Delaware River Bridge Commission . The bridge was replaced again in 1941 for $ 174 @,@ 300 ( 1941 USD ( $ 2 @,@ 804 @,@ 200 in 2016 ) ) , with a steel truss span . This structure lasted another sixty @-@ five years , finally deteriorating until the demolition of the structure in 2007 , upon completion of the new bridge . 
 = = Early history = = 
 Originally the site of a ford , the area was used by the Lenni Lenape and Delawares on their way to and from the shores of present @-@ day Long Island Sound . The original trail followed the Shohola Creek , where it enters the Delaware , to a location along the eastern bank of the river near Shohola . By the end of the 18th century , European settlers operated a ferry near the current span , crossing between Shohola to a settlement on the opposite bank , that later became Barryville . The 1827 construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal and the subsequent construction of the Erie Railroad in 1849 ) accentuated the need for a bridge to accommodate the increase in population and business in the area . 
 = = First two spans ( 1856 – 1865 ) = = 
 As the need for a bridge from Shohola to Barryville grew , the Shohola and Barryville Bridge Company , formed in 1854 , planned the construction of the first bridge . The company 's president , Chauncey Thomas , attempted to hire John Augustus <unk> , a bridge expert , who was building a bridge in the Niagara region of New York and Canada ( which came to be known as the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge ) , which was to be built as an 821 feet ( 250 m ) two @-@ deck span over the Niagara River , and who had completed successful spans over the rivers in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . 
 Roebling declined the offer but gave Thomas verbal and written instructions on its construction during a visit to the Niagara construction site . Thomas returned to Shohola and supervised the construction himself , using some inexperienced local men he hired . A respected historian , John Willard Johnston , who knew Chauncey Thomas personally , visited the bridge and told the owner at the time that Thomas was very inexperienced in bridge construction . The result of the construction was a 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide , double @-@ span bridge that was 495 feet ( 151 m ) long but which had no underlying span support . The bridge stood 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) above the waters of the Delaware to avoid flooding , and cost a total of $ 9 @,@ 000 ( 1856 USD ( $ 237 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . The rapid growth of the area due to the construction of the Canal and the Erie Railroad meant the bridge was immediately in heavy use . 
 Thomas ' wire @-@ rope span bridge was damaged by a severe wind storm on July 2 , 1859 , exactly three years after it opened . The storm , which destroyed almost the entire bridge , was not a singular experience . Wind storms often build in the river valley , bring strong winds down the valley against weaker pressure systems to the south and east . A man and a woman who were crossing the bridge were injured when it collapsed . The local ferry , which had been out of commission for only three years , was still in good condition and re @-@ fitted for use in 1859 , to operate along the remaining abutments and piers that survived the storm . 
 The bridge was rebuilt quickly , again under the supervision of Thomas , who was still company president . Thomas was able to complete the bridge , and ended up raising a total cost for construction of $ 4 @,@ 000 ( 1859 USD ( $ 105 @,@ 300 in 2016 ) ) ) , an expedient necessitated by the lack of funds in the company treasury . Shortly after the new construction , Thomas was replaced by James E. Gardner as company president ; Gardner died soon after his election , and was succeeded by Napoleon B. Johnson . Johnson ran the bridge company well , and remained as president of the corporation for several years . However , on January 1 , 1865 , the cables snapped under the weight of mules and wagons , and the entire bridge fell into the river , injuring the wagoners , and drowning three of the mules . Once again , ferries filled the needs that were previously fulfilled by the suspension bridge . 
 = = Third span ( 1866 – 1939 ) = = 
 With the second span of the Barryville – Shohola Suspension Bridge having fallen into the Delaware River in 1865 , the bridge company that maintained the span fell into a financial depression . After the destruction of the second span , company president Johnson had borrowed money for the company itself that he was unable to pay back . In 1865 , company had no funds to repair the partially collapsed bridge , nor credit to borrow any . The former president Chauncey Thomas bought the bankrupt company in a sheriff 's sale for $ 1 @,@ 979 ( 1865 USD ( $ 30 @,@ 600 in 2016 ) ) . Thomas was now the sole owner of the wrecked bridge . 
 To repair the bridge , Thomas would need to receive and pay more money , and he did . Along with the complete repair in 1866 , another pier was added to increase the stability of the weak structure . The 1866 construction was considerably stronger , compared to the two previous spans , due to major renovations . The old cables that snapped had been replaced by newer , stronger ones . Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor , a bridge railing and new stringers . The bridge was much better cared for this time around , as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an <unk> in the early months of spring 1904 . 
 Chauncey Thomas died at his home in Shohola on October 5 , 1882 , sixteen years after the new bridge was repaired . Since Thomas had never written a will , estate and property were divided between his children and his grandchildren . A friend to the Thomas family , Stephen St. John Gardiner , became the administrator of the estate . With the job , Gardiner was able to buy the bridge . He became controller and majority of the bridge 's stock . 
 By the start of the 20th century , regional economic conditions changed . The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company had closed , as had local logging and mining companies . Shohola and Barryville had become summer resorts and the now @-@ aging antique bridge had become a local picturesque attraction for out @-@ of @-@ town visitors . On June 26 , 1920 , the suspension bridge was bought by the Joint Bridge Commission of Pennsylvania and New York for $ 22 @,@ 600 @.@ 00 ( 1923 USD ( $ 267 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) ) . Half of the $ 22 @,@ 600 @.@ 00 was to be paid for by the state of New York , the other by Pennsylvania . The toll that was used on the span was removed . The single @-@ lane , aging structure , now owned by the commission , served the local residents well into the new century . However , the old age of the bridge showed on the bridge itself . In 1939 , the commission closed off the structurally deficient bridge to traffic , and began looking into ways to build a new bridge in the area . In 1940 , the bridge was reopened for light , local car <unk> but demolished in 1941 , when the fourth and then @-@ newest span of the bridge was opened . 
 = = Fourth span ( 1941 – 2007 ) = = 
 The Joint Bridge Commission of Pennsylvania and New York hired the Whittaker and Diehl Company in early of 1941 to construct a $ 174 @,@ 300 ( 1941 USD ( $ 2 @,@ 804 @,@ 200 in 2016 ) ) steel , two @-@ lane truss bridge to replace the aging structure . 
 With the construction , there was a tunnel built on the Pennsylvania side for the Erie Railroad line that went nearby . This helped end the constant traffic jams and accidents caused by the railroad crossing . This bridge was slightly downriver from the former spans . The bridge itself was 742 @.@ 12 feet ( 226 @.@ 20 m ) long , consisted of three spans , and was 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) wide . It had an average daily traffic rate of 1 @,@ 635 people in 2004 . Replacing the fourth bridge , according to the United States Department of Transportation , would cost about $ 5 @,@ 628 @,@ 000 ( 2006 USD , $ 6 @,@ 183 @,@ 700 in 2016 ) ) . 
 The fourth span went into commission just days before Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 . After the United States entered World War II , construction and reconstruction in the area had ended , while the nation transformed into a war <unk> and the residents had received their new bridge span just in time . The bridge structure lasted through World War II and several river floods . The bridge lasted for several decades , until the start of the 21st century , when plans were made to replace the deteriorating truss structure . 
 = = Fifth span ( 2007 – present ) = = 
 With the deterioration of the fourth span , the bridge commission and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation started construction on a $ 9 @.@ 38 million ( 2007 USD ( $ 10 @,@ 704 @,@ 700 in 2016 ) ) concrete bridge with steel beams connecting Traffic Route 434 on the Pennsylvania side ( assigned in 1967 ) and Touring Route 55 / Sullivan County Route 11 ( assigned in 1930 ) . The construction began on February 2004 , and since there was no place to perform a groundbreaking ceremony , the construction company hired , Fahs Construction Group of Binghamton , New York performed a " bridge @-@ breaking " ceremony on March 25 , 2004 , taking sledgehammers to the bridge . The bridge was expected to have resemble the Roebling Aqueduct , which lay to the north in Minisink Ford , New York . The bridge was proposed to be 812 feet ( 247 m ) with twin 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) travel lanes and an 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) shoulder . It was to also have three balconies facing upstream of the Delaware River , to offer travelers scenic views . 
 A number of difficulties and unforeseen circumstances delayed construction . First , the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had been conducting archaeological digs in the area since 1996 , and had found a variety of artifacts dating from the Clovis period , with radio carbon age dating around 10 @,@ 900 BCE , making them one of the oldest sites in the eastern United States ; the sites also includes evidence of food , making it one of the rarer paleolithic finds . The next circumstance was that there was worry that the construction of the bridge might affect the river ecosystem , particularly some of the river water organisms . After some regulations were added and problems were sorted out , the construction continued . The third issue was that the bridge may run into problems with boaters , and therefore , the bridge was given the same regulations as bridges upstream . Finally , the Delaware 's low water level meant that barges could not be used in the construction . When Hurricane Ivan struck in 2004 , the water level rose , allowing for the use of the barges , but destroying several construction items used for the bridge in the process . 
 The bridge , which had an estimated completion in the autumn of 2006 according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation , was opened on @-@ time in October 26 , 2006 . This closed the old 1940 structure from use , <unk> off from Route 434 and Route 55 . Once abutment work was finished , the now Fahs @-@ <unk> Construction Company began demolishing the old structure . However , unfinished paving work was completed in October 2007 . The total cost for the replacement project came out in 2009 at $ 11 @.@ 62 million ( 2007 USD ( $ 12 @,@ 816 @,@ 800 in 2016 ) ) . 
 The bridge had temporary fencing and new walkways along a six @-@ lane span , with locals saying that the stone structure fitting into the looks of the scenic Delaware River Valley . The old bridge was demolished after construction completed .

 Ahmed Zayat ( born August 31 , 1962 ) is an Egyptian American entrepreneur and owner of Thoroughbred race horses . He currently serves as the CEO of Zayat Stables , LLC , a Thoroughbred horse racing business which bred and owns the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah . Joe Drape of The New York Times described Zayat as " controversial " and " one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing . " 
 Zayat was born in Cairo , Egypt to a wealthy family , and grew up in an ethnically @-@ diverse neighborhood where he learned to ride horses . At age 18 , he moved to the United States where he attended college and ultimately obtained a master 's degree in business and public health from Boston University . After a brief career in commercial real estate in New York City , he returned to Egypt , and for about a decade ran the Al @-@ Ahram Beverages Company , which he owned as part of an investment group . After the company was purchased by Heineken in 2002 , Zayat stayed on a few more years but also began investing in racehorses and established Zayat Stables in 2005 . Upon returning to the United States for good in 2007 , he made his racing stables his full @-@ time occupation , working with his son , Justin , to build the business . 
 While generally successful with his race horses , his goal of winning the Kentucky Derby eluded him several times , including three second @-@ place finishes , until his win with American Pharoah . He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses . Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization , but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing .

 Ahmed Zayat ( / <unk> <unk> / ; Arabic : أحمد <unk> ) , also known as Ephraim David Zayat ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , was born in Egypt in 1962 to an affluent Egyptian Jewish family and grew up an ethnically diverse neighborhood in the Cairo suburb of Maadi . His father , Alaa al @-@ Zayat , was a prominent doctor and professor of medicine , a personal physician to Anwar Sadat . His grandfather , Ahmed Hasan al @-@ Zayyat , was a leading intellectual who established the Egyptian literary magazine al @-@ Risala , described as " the most important intellectual weekly in 1930s Egypt and the Arab world . " Born into what was then a peasant family , the earlier al @-@ Zayyat studied at Al @-@ Azhar University before taking up legal studies in Cairo and Paris ; he taught Arabic literature at American University in Cairo , and for three years in Baghdad , before founding al @-@ Risala in 1933 . 
 As a young man , Ahmed Zayat learned to ride horses at the local country club . Zayat competed in show jumping during his early teens , winning national titles as a child in the under @-@ 12 and under @-@ 14 age divisions . He moved to the United States at the age of 18 , and earned an undergraduate degree from Yeshiva University . He obtained a master 's degree in public health administration from Boston University . Though the Zayat Stables , LLC website once stated that Zayat attended Harvard University , he did not . After graduation , he worked for <unk> Wolfson , a New York City commercial real estate developer and investor . Zayat described Wolfson as " the toughest guy I ever worked for ... such a perfectionist . A great negotiator . " 
 Zayat returned to Egypt in 1995 and formed an investment group , which purchased the Al @-@ Ahram Beverages Company in 1997 , outbidding Anheuser @-@ Busch and Heineken International . Al @-@ Ahram had been owned by the Egyptian government and Zayat had helped find American investors to take over government @-@ owned businesses that had been nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser back in the 1950s . The original beer product was of poor quality , mocked as being able to " power heavy machinery if there was no diesel fuel available . " Under Zayat 's leadership , additional brands of beer were introduced , and he developed a non @-@ alcoholic beer , <unk> , designed specifically for the Muslim market . The company was modernized from a run @-@ down operation to a publicly traded business that sold in 2002 to Heineken International for $ 280 million , more than three times its pre @-@ acquisition valuation , in what was then the largest corporate buyout in Egyptian history . 
 Zayat continued to run Al @-@ Ahram until 2007 , but periodically returned to the United States , where he started buying racehorses and formed Zayat Stables in 2005 . His motivation to return to the US was , in part , to commute less and be more involved with his family and children . Upon leaving Al @-@ Ahram , he declared that he was " retiring " , but as his wife explained , " he can 't be retired for more than 15 seconds , " and he soon expanded his horse operation to include both breeding and racing stock . He still owns other business interests in Egypt , including being the majority shareholder of Misr Glass Manufacturing , which is Egypt 's largest maker of glass containers . 
 Zayat lives in Teaneck , New Jersey , with his wife , Joanne . The couple have four children : Ashley , Justin , Benjamin and Emma . Justin , a 2015 graduate of New York University , works closely with his father in the Zayat Stables business . While residing primarily in New Jersey , the <unk> also have residences in New York , Egypt and London . The family are Orthodox Jews ; Zayat 's Hebrew name is Ephraim ( <unk> ) , used by family and community . Zayat donates to Jewish schools and charities , including those that help special @-@ needs children . Although The New York Times has stated that Zayat has publicly identified as both Jewish and Muslim at times , his family attends Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck , keeps the Jewish Sabbath , and observes kosher laws regarding food . When questioned about his religious affiliation , Zayat stated , " Why is it relevant , and why does it matter ? It 's personal . " 
 = = Zayat Stables = = 
 Zayat first began buying Thoroughbred race horses in 2005 . Zayat Stables owns approximately 200 horses at any one time . Zayat made a number of big @-@ ticket sales purchases early on including a horse he named Maimonides , purchased at Keeneland as a yearling in 2006 for $ 4 @.@ 6 million . In addition , Zayat paid $ 1 @.@ 6 million for the highest @-@ priced horse at the 2006 Fasig @-@ Tipton Saratoga select yearling sale , a filly by Empire Maker named Mushka , whom he resold in 2008 for $ 2 @.@ 4 million . 
 Maimonides was named in honor of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides , who is respected by both Jews and Muslims . At the time , Zayat explained , " If this horse was going to be a superstar , I wanted an appropriate name ... I wanted it to be pro @-@ peace , and about loving your neighbor . " Zayat also had difficulty obtaining the name from the Jockey Club , as it had been reserved by Earle I. Mack , who owned race horses and also happened to be the chairman of the board of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law , at Zayat 's alma mater , Yeshiva University . After Zayat donated $ 100 @,@ 000 to the school to " promote peace , " Mack released his reservation of the name . But , in the first of Zayat 's many racing disappointments , the colt 's promising racing career was cut short by injury after two races . 
 The horses of Zayat Stables began to earn race purses in 2006 . In 2008 , Zayat was North America 's leading owner by earnings . Zayat Stables ranked second in the nation for earnings in 2007 , third in 2009 , fourth in 2010 and fifth nationally in 2011 . Between 2006 and 2014 , Zayat Stables ranked in the top ten leading owners by purse money won in six of those years and always in the top 20 . Zayat has horses at all stages of the racing process , stallions , broodmares , young horses in training and active racing stock . His daughters were the inspiration for the names of two race horses , stakes @-@ winner Point Ashley , who in turn inspired daughter Ashley 's costume jewelry business name ; and Littleprincessemma , dam of American Pharoah . Race horse Justin Phillip was named for Justin . 
 The business base for the horse racing operation is Hackensack , New Jersey , but Zayat 's horses live in different locations across the US . His horse breeding stock live mostly in Kentucky , young horses are started in Florida . The racing stock have been in training with multiple trainers including Bob Baffert , Mark Casse , D. Wayne Lukas , Todd Pletcher , Dale Romans and others . Zayat Stables keeps about 30 broodmares and their foals in Kentucky along with roughly 20 yearlings . In 2015 the operation stood 13 breeding stallions at stud . Zayat typically retains a 25 % interest in the stallions he sends to stud , though in the case of Pioneerof the Nile , he kept a 75 % interest . 
 As of 2015 , Zayat 's horses include American Pharoah and 13 other Grade I winners . These include : 2013 Breeders ' Cup runner and 2012 Haskell Invitational winner Paynter ; 2013 Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap winner Justin Phillip ; 2012 Arkansas Derby winner Bodemeister ; Pioneerof the Nile who won the 2008 CashCall Futurity and 2009 Santa Anita Derby ; three @-@ time Grade I winner <unk> . He has entered horses in the Breeders ' Cup races 16 times , with his best result a fourth @-@ place finish in 2007 . 
 Zayat has experienced significant highs and lows in his quest for Triple Crown classic wins . Three times Zayat 's horses placed second in the Kentucky Derby . In 2009 , Zayat 's <unk> Pioneerof the Nile started a streak of Zayat horses finishing second in the Kentucky Derby and other classic races when he was defeated by Mine That Bird . In 2010 , Zayat campaigned Eskendereya , winner of the Wood Memorial and considered the favorite for the Kentucky Derby . On the Sunday prior to the Derby , Eskendereya was withdrawn from the race and subsequently retired to stud due to a soft tissue injury that would have taken at least a year to heal . In 2011 , Zayat entered Nehro , who finished second to Animal Kingdom . 
 In 2012 , Zayat Stables ' horses Bodemeister and then Paynter ran second in each of the three legs of the Triple Crown . Bodemeister finished a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I 'll Have Another . Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes , Zayat 's colt Paynter also finished second . Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near @-@ fatal complications from colitis and laminitis . Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse , and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation , Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013 . After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag # <unk> , the horse developed a significant fan base , and received hundreds of get well cards , many from children . For his struggle to return to health , Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award . 
 Zayat 's Triple Crown race losing @-@ streak was finally broken by American Pharoah , who won the 2015 Kentucky Derby , the 2015 Preakness Stakes , and the 2015 Belmont Stakes , becoming the first horse to win the Triple Crown since 1978 .

 Zayat has been described as " controversial , " and " one of the most successful and flamboyant owners in thoroughbred racing " by Joe Drape of the New York Times ; his success accompanied by a number of legal controversies . His racing stable survived Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings , and he faced a number of legal issues associated with his penchant for betting large sums of money on horse racing . 
 = = = Bankruptcy = = = 
 In December 2009 , Zayat was sued by Fifth Third Bank for an alleged $ 34 million in unpaid loans . He had taken out multiple loans from the bank totaling over $ 38 million between 2007 and 2009 . Fifth Third alleged that Zayat was in default because he failed to make two payments in 2009 . As part of the loan package , the bank had a security interest in Zayat Stables ' horses , prize money , stallion shares and stallion income . Further , the bank added an amended provision to its later loans stating , " if Zayat Stables defaulted on any of the Notes , such default would be considered a default under all of the notes thereby entitling Fifth Third to accelerate the principal balance and all accrued interest due and owing under all of the Notes . " While Zayat paid off some of the money owed , the bank contended that he remained in default on one loan . The bank alleged that Zayat had lost $ 52 million between 2006 and 2008 , that he had not reported a previous Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy he had filed under the name Ephraim David Zayat , and the bank attempted to foreclose on his horses . 
 Zayat filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in February 2010 . He stated that the problem was that the Lexington branch of the bank worked with the Thoroughbred industry and was willing to restructure his loans , while the bank 's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati wanted to get out of the equine lending business altogether . Stating that Fifth Third was " reneging on its promises , " Zayat filed a countersuit in April 2010 , alleging the bank engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices . When he thought the bank was willing to restructure its loans , Zayat withdrew 67 horses he intended to sell at Keeneland 's 2009 September and November sales and instead purchased 24 more yearlings . He had also paid Fifth Third $ 4 @.@ 3 million from the proceeds of the sale of breeding rights to <unk> , all of which left him low on cash when the bank called in its loans . Zayat said the bank was using " scorched earth " tactics and accused it of trying to put him out of business , explaining that had he known the bank would not extend his loans , he would have sold enough horses to make his payments . 
 All cases were resolved with a settlement agreement in July 2010 , seven months after the initial suit was filed . Zayat agreed to pay off his unsecured creditors over two years , without interest , and pay off Fifth Third by 2014 . Zayat Stables ' creditors unanimously approved the repayment plan . Zayat owed about $ 2 @.@ 4 million to the Keeneland Association , and $ 1 @.@ 2 million to other creditors including clinics , horse transport companies , boarding farms , and trainers — among them Bob Baffert . He also owed several horse breeders for stud fees . To settle his debts with Fifth Third , he agreed to annual payments based on a percentage of horse sales and proceeds from claiming races . As part of his reorganization plan , he was to sell a number of horses , including 100 % of his Grade I @-@ winning horse Eskendereya . Ultimately , consistent with Zayat 's tendency to retain a financial interest in his stallions , he sold an undisclosed share in the stallion to Jess Jackson and retained some breeding rights . While the selling percentage and price were confidential , Zayat Stables ' reported income to the bankruptcy court for the month the deal closed was $ 7 @.@ 5 million . Zayat stated , " While Chapter 11 was a necessary step to take ... I look forward to carrying out our reorganization plan , and continuing to develop some of the best horses in the country . " Zayat Stables successfully completed the bankruptcy reorganization plan , in the process his stable went from a high of 285 horses to a census of 118 in 2012 .

 Zayat 's bankruptcy revealed other problems . His bankruptcy documents listed four loans he had made to members of the Jelinsky family . Two members of that family , Michael and Jeffrey Jelinsky , had pleaded guilty in 2009 to illegal bookmaking . As a result , the racing commissions in California and Kentucky opened investigations on Zayat ; racing licensees are not to associate with bookmakers or convicted felons . Zayat claimed that he had no knowledge of the <unk> ' illegal acts . He stated that he thought the brothers were professional gamblers and that they had financial need . Further , he said he loaned them money because he knew their father and that the money they owed him was unrelated to gambling ; he stated that some of the money he loaned was to assist one of the brothers with a divorce . He was cleared in both states . Although New York also stated that they were investigating , there were no news reports of any adverse action . Zayat stated that he had been visited by federal agents who played tapes where the Jelinsky brothers discussed how they had cheated Zayat out of money by giving him bad betting advice . 
 In an unrelated case , Zayat was mentioned in a 2013 lawsuit between Freehold Raceway and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority . The plaintiffs alleged that Zayat was allowed to bet on credit , which was a violation of state law . Zayat had been betting $ 200 @,@ 000 a week through New Jersey 's online betting system , and the agency allowed him to " float " $ 286 @,@ 000 in credit , " as a courtesy . " Zayat was not a party to the lawsuit and he paid off all debts owed to the Sports Authority . The records containing Zayat 's name were later redacted , but an internal email indicated that Zayat had wagered a total of at least $ 8 @.@ 3 million . 
 On March 10 , 2014 , a lawsuit against Zayat was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey . The plaintiff , Howard Rubinsky , was an associate of the <unk> who had also pleaded guilty in the illegal betting operation . His suit alleged breach of contract , claiming that Zayat failed to pay off a $ 1 @.@ 65 million line of credit in 2004 . Rubinsky said he extended credit to Zayat with Tradewinds <unk> so Zayat could bet on horse races via a gambling website set up in Costa Rica . Zayat 's lawyer described the suit as " a meritless claim " , filed a motion to dismiss in 2015 alleging lack of evidence , and argued that the statute of limitations of six years had run . Zayat stated in court documents that he had met and loaned money to Rubinsky , but said , " I can say unequivocally that I did not give Mr. Rubinsky any money as payment on any debt ... I agreed to give him money because he told me he was ill and broke . " On June 4 , 2015 , a federal judge in Newark , New Jersey , dismissed Rubinsky 's lawsuit , citing both Rubinsky 's difficulty in proving his case and the expired statute of limitations . In a related matter , June 1 , 2015 , days before American Pharoah was to run in the 2015 Belmont Stakes , the New York Times reported that Rubinsky 's lawyer , Joseph Bainton , filed a $ 10 @-@ million libel suit against Zayat for comments to the press , including the characterization of Rubinsky 's other lawsuit as " extortion , a fraud and blackmail . " That suit was dismissed on August 5 , 2015 . 
 In a post @-@ race press conference after winning the 2015 Belmont Stakes , Zayat stated that he was so anxious about American Pharoah 's upcoming race that he neglected to bet on anything . 
 = Edward Puttick = 
 Lieutenant General Sir Edward Puttick KCB , DSO & Bar ( 26 June 1890 – 25 July 1976 ) was an officer who served with the New Zealand Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars . The first New Zealand @-@ born soldier to reach the rank of lieutenant general , he was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1941 to 1945 . 
 Born in 1890 in Timaru , Puttick served in the Territorial Force prior to the First World War . In August 1914 he was part of the Expeditionary Force that occupied German Samoa . He later served with the New Zealand Rifle Brigade during the Senussi Campaign and on the Western Front . He was commanding the 3rd Battalion of the brigade in March 1918 when he was wounded and later repatriated to New Zealand . 
 Puttick joined the New Zealand Staff Corps in 1919 and held a number of command and staff positions for the next 20 years . During the Second World War , he commanded the 4th Infantry Brigade in the Battle of Greece , for which he was awarded a bar to the Distinguished Service Order he had won in the previous war . Following the Allied evacuation from Greece he commanded the 2nd New Zealand Division during the subsequent Battle of Crete . In September he returned to New Zealand as Chief of General Staff , New Zealand Military Forces , and served in this capacity until late 1945 . He retired from the military the following year and died in 1976 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 The son of a railway worker from London , Edward Puttick was born in Timaru , in South Canterbury . He was educated at <unk> Boys ' High School , after which he joined the Roads Department , as it was then known , as a draughtsman . He joined the newly formed Territorial Force in 1911 , serving as a second lieutenant in the 15th ( North Auckland ) Regiment . The following year he moved to Wellington and was transferred to the 5th ( Wellington ) Regiment . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Following the outbreak of the First World War , Puttick 's territorial regiment was designated part of the Samoa Expeditionary Force , which was raised for the Occupation of German Samoa in early August 1914 . Now with the rank of captain , he landed at Apia on 29 August . The occupation was achieved without loss of life and he spent the next several months on garrison duty before returning to New Zealand in April 1915 . On his return , he volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) which was then in the Middle East , preparing for the Gallipoli Campaign . 
 On arrival in Egypt , Puttick was posted to the 1st Battalion , New Zealand Rifle Brigade . He commanded ' B ' Company of the battalion during the Senussi Campaign from January to February 1916 , before being transferred to the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the newly formed New Zealand Division . He was promoted to major and appointed Staff Captain of the brigade , under the command of Brigadier General William Braithwaite . He went with the division to the Western Front in April and remained with the brigade during its settling in period in the Armentieres sector of the front . In July , prior to the start of the Somme Offensive , he was transferred back to the Rifle Brigade , and appointed second @-@ in @-@ command of its 4th Battalion . 
 Puttick fought in the Battle of Flers @-@ Courcelette in mid @-@ September 1916 and was mentioned in despatches for his leadership and support of his battalion commander , Colonel Charles Melvill , immediately following the battle . In December he temporarily commanded the 4th Battalion while Melvill was briefly commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade . In June 1917 he had an extended period as temporary commander of the battalion when , during the Battle of Messines , Melvill was promoted to command of the 1st Infantry Brigade following the death of its previous commander , Brigadier General Charles Henry Brown . Puttick led the battalion through the Battle of Passchendaele until November 1917 at which time he was given command of the 3rd Battalion , New Zealand Rifle Brigade . Late in the year he was again mentioned in dispatches and on 1 January 1918 , in recognition of his service in the previous six months , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . 
 On 21 March 1918 , the Germans began their Spring Offensive and the New Zealand Division was rushed to plug a gap in the front near <unk> . On 27 March , Puttick was wounded in the chest while leading his battalion in an action designed to link up with an Australian brigade in the nearby village of <unk> . He was evacuated to England for treatment and after recuperating , commanded the New Zealand Rifle Brigade 's training camp in Brocton , Staffordshire . However , his wounds were such that he was eventually repatriated to New Zealand at the end of the war . 
 = = Interwar period = = 
 Shortly after Puttick 's return to New Zealand , he married Irene Lillian Dignan in Auckland . The couple would have three daughters . After being discharged from the NZEF in March 1919 , he rejoined the Roads Department . Later that year he applied to join New Zealand 's permanent military forces but was declined . He returned to the Roads Department but was seconded to the military in August 1919 . A few months later he received a commission in the New Zealand Staff Corps as a major . 
 In 1920 , Puttick was appointed commander of the Fiji Expeditionary Force , which had been raised following a request from the Fijian government for military forces to support local police dealing with striking labourers and farmers . The force , numbering about 55 men , was based in Fiji for two months before returning home . He then served in a number of staff positions . He was sent to England for attachment to the War Office and the same year attended the Imperial Defence College in 1937 , with the rank of colonel . He was also one of New Zealand 's representatives at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey . In 1938 he was appointed as Adjutant General of the New Zealand Military Forces as well as a second term as Quartermaster General , having previously served in this capacity from 1934 to 1936 . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 Puttick was commanding the Central Military District when the Second World War broke out and , as a skilled administrator , played a key role in the raising of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) for service overseas . The 4th Infantry Brigade with Puttick , promoted to temporary brigadier , as its commander was to be the first brigade of the newly formed 2nd New Zealand Division , under the overall command of Major General Bernard Freyberg . The brigade duly departed for the Middle East in January 1940 . 
 Puttick oversaw the training of the brigade once it settled in its base in Egypt . In June 1940 , Freyberg travelled to England to where the second infantry brigade of the division had been shipped . In his absence , Puttick was temporary commander of the New Zealand forces in Egypt . Anticipating a German invasion of Greece , the division was one of the Allied units transferred to that country . Arriving in April 1941 , he led the brigade competently during the Battle of Greece as it retreated from the Aliakmon Line in northern Greece to the Servia Pass and onto the beaches at Porto Rafti from where it was evacuated on 27 April to Crete . He was later awarded a Bar to his DSO for his " gallantry and devotion to duty " during this period . 
 On Crete , Puttick was promoted to temporary major general and , following Freyberg 's appointment as the commander of Creforce , took over responsibility for the 2nd New Zealand Division . During the Battle of Crete his failure to pressure James Hargest , one of his brigade commanders , to make a counterattack to support the defenders of Maleme airfield resulted in its eventual loss to the Germans . With reinforcements and supplies landed at the airfield the Germans were able to consolidate the tenuous gains made in the opening days of the invasion . Any meaningful chance of the Allies successfully preventing the capture of the island was lost and the survivors of Creforce were eventually evacuated to Egypt . 
 On his return to Egypt , Puttick was offered the opportunity to become Chief of the General Staff , effectively the commander of the New Zealand Military Forces , by the visiting New Zealand prime minister , Peter Fraser . He accepted the role and returned to New Zealand in September 1941 . Puttick 's focus was on ensuring the manpower of the 2NZEF in North Africa was adequately maintained by reinforcements . In the face of the increasing threat of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific , he also put considerable effort into improving New Zealand 's defences . After the Japanese entered the war , he considered the actual threat of invasion to be minimal but continued to encourage improvements in home defence as a means of boosting morale . 
 In April 1942 Puttick was promoted to lieutenant general , the first New Zealand @-@ born soldier to reach this rank . In the 1942 Birthday Honours , he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) . As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre . Later in the war , he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy to deal with what he considered to be the greater priority , the defeat of Germany , rather than have it be used against the Japanese . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Puttick was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by Major General Norman Weir in late 1945 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1946 New Year Honours . In June 1946 , he led the New Zealand contingent at the Victory Parade in London . He retired from the military three months later . 
 In his retirement , Puttick authored one of the volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939 – 45 , a unit history of the 25th Battalion , which was published in 1960 . His wife died in 1964 and in his later years , he lived in Raglan , a small seaside town on the west coast of the North Island . He died on 25 July 1976 in Hamilton , survived by his three daughters , and was buried at Karori Cemetery in Wellington with military honours .

 Eric Lynn Wright ( September 7 , 1964 – March 26 , 1995 ) , better known by his stage name Eazy @-@ E , was a U.S. American rapper who performed solo and in the hip hop group N.W.A. Wright is affectionately called " The Godfather of Gangsta Rap " . He was born to Richard and Kathie Wright in Compton , California . After dropping out of high school in the tenth grade , he supported himself primarily by selling drugs before founding Ruthless Records and becoming a rapper . Arabian Prince , Eazy @-@ E , Dr. Dre and Ice Cube formed N.W.A. After DJ Yella and MC Ren joined the group , N.W.A released their debut single Panic Zone . In 1988 , they released their most controversial album , Straight Outta Compton . The group released two more albums and then disbanded after Eazy released Dr. Dre from his contract . 
 Eazy 's main influences included 1970s funk groups , contemporary rappers , and comedians . When reviewing Eazy 's albums , many critics noted his unique overall style , with Steve Huey of the All Music Guide remarking : " While his technical skills as a rapper were never the greatest , his distinctive delivery ... over @-@ the @-@ top lyrics , and undeniable charisma made him a star . " 
 = = Early life and Ruthless Records investment = = 
 Eric Wright was born to Richard and Kathie Wright on September 7 , 1964 , in Compton , California , a Los Angeles suburb notorious for gang activity and crime . His father was a postal worker and his mother was a grade school administrator . Wright dropped out of high school in the tenth grade , but later received a high @-@ school general equivalency diploma ( GED ) . 
 Wright supported himself primarily by selling drugs , introduced to the occupation by his cousin . Wright 's friend Jerry Heller admits that he witnessed Wright selling marijuana , but says that he never saw him sell cocaine . As Heller noted in his book Ruthless : A Memoir , Wright 's " dope dealer " label was part of his " self @-@ forged armor " . Wright was also labeled as a " thug " . Heller explains : " The hood where he grew up was a dangerous place . He was a small guy . ' Thug ' was a role that was widely understood on the street ; it gave you a certain level of protection in the sense that people hesitated to fuck with you . Likewise , ' dope dealer ' was a role that accorded you certain privileges and respect . " 
 In 1986 , at the age of 22 , Wright had allegedly earned as much as US $ 250 @,@ 000 from dealing drugs . However , after his cousin was shot and killed , he decided that he could make a better living in the Los Angeles hip hop scene , which was growing rapidly in popularity . He started recording songs during the mid @-@ 1980s in his parents ' garage . 
 The original idea for Ruthless Records came when Wright asked Heller to go into business with him . Wright suggested a half @-@ ownership company , but it was later decided that Wright would get eighty percent of the company 's income , and Heller would only get twenty percent . According to Heller , he told Wright , " Every dollar comes into Ruthless , I take twenty cents . That 's industry standard for a manager of my caliber . I take twenty , you take eighty percent . I am responsible for my expenses , and you 're responsible for yours . You own the company . I work for you . " Along with Heller , Wright invested much of his money into Ruthless Records . Heller claims that he invested the first $ 250 @,@ 000 , and would eventually put up to $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 into the company .

The compilation album N.W.A. and the Posse was released on November 6 , 1987 , and would go on to be certified Gold in the United States . The album featured material previously released as singles on the <unk> Records label , which was responsible for distributing the releases by N.W.A and other artists like the Fila Fresh Crew , a West Coast rap group originally based in Dallas , Texas . 
 Eazy @-@ E 's debut album , Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It , was released on September 16 , 1988 , and featured twelve tracks . It was labeled as West Coast hip hop , Gangsta rap , and Golden age hip hop . It has sold over 2 @.@ 5 million copies in the United States and reached number forty @-@ one on the Billboard 200 . The album was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella and largely written by MC Ren , Ice Cube , and The D.O.C .. Both Glen Boyd from the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer and MTV 's Jon Wiederhorn claimed that Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It " paved the way " for N.W.A 's most controversial album , Straight Outta Compton . Wright 's only solo in the album was a remix of the song " 8 Ball " , which originally appeared on N.W.A. and the Posse . The album featured Wright 's writing and performing ; he performed on seven songs and helped write four songs . 
 After the release of Straight Outta Compton , Ice Cube left because of internal disputes , and the group continued as a four @-@ piece ensemble . N.W.A released 100 Miles and Runnin ' and Niggaz4Life in 1991 . A diss war started between N.W.A and Ice Cube when " 100 Miles and Runnin ' " and " Real Niggaz " were released . Ice Cube responded with " No Vaseline " on Death Certificate . Wright performed on seven of the eighteen songs on Niggaz4Life . 
 In March 1991 Wright accepted an invitation to a lunch benefiting the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle , hosted by then @-@ U.S. President George H. W. Bush . A spokesman for the rapper said that Eazy @-@ E supported Bush because of his performance in the Persian Gulf War .

 N.W.A began to split up after Jerry Heller became the band 's manager . Dr. Dre recalls : " The split came when Jerry Heller got involved . He played the divide and conquer game . Instead of taking care of everybody , he picked one nigga to take care of and that was Eazy . And Eazy was like , ' I 'm taken care of , so fuck it ' . " Dre sent Suge Knight to look into Eazy 's financial situation because he was beginning to grow suspicious of Eazy and Heller . Dre asked Eazy to release him from the Ruthless Records contract , but Eazy refused . The impasse led to what reportedly transpired between Knight and Eazy at the recording studio where <unk> was recorded . After he refused to release Dre , Knight declared to Eazy that he had kidnapped Heller and was holding him prisoner in a van . The rumor did not convince Eazy to release Dre from his contract , and Knight threatened Eazy 's family : Knight gave Eazy a piece of paper that contained Eazy 's mother 's address , telling him , " I know where your mama stays . " Eazy finally signed Dre 's release , officially ending N.W.A. 
 The feud with Dr. Dre continued after a track on Dre 's The Chronic , " Dre Day " , contained lyrics that insulted Eazy @-@ E. Eazy responded with the EP , It 's On ( Dr. Dre ) 187um Killa , featuring the tracks " Real Muthaphuckkin G 's " and " It 's On " . The album , which was released on October 25 , 1993 , contains pictures of Dre wearing " lacy outfits and makeup " when he was a member of the Electro @-@ hop World Class Wreckin ' Cru .

 Wright had a son , Eric Wright Jr . , in 1984 . He also had a daughter named Erin who has legally changed her name to <unk> . Wright also knew that he had at least five other children by five separate women during his lifetime .

He had two children with Tomica Woods , and found out he was dying of AIDS while she was pregnant with their second baby . This brings his total children to at least twelve . 
 Wright met Tomica Woods at a Los Angeles nightclub in 1991 , and they married in 1995 , twelve days before his death . They had a son named Dominick and a daughter named <unk> ( born six months after Wright 's death ) . After Wright 's death , Ruthless Records was taken over by his wife . 
 = = Legal issues = = 
 After Dr. Dre left Ruthless Records , executives Mike Klein and Jerry Heller sought assistance from the Jewish Defense League ( JDL ) . Klein , a former Ruthless Records director of business affairs , said this provided Ruthless Records with leverage to enter into negotiations with Death Row Records over Dr. Dre 's departure . While Knight had sought an outright release from Ruthless Records for Dr. Dre , the JDL and Ruthless Records management negotiated a release in which the record label would continue to receive money and publishing rights from future Dr. Dre projects with Death Row Records , founded by Dr. Dre with Suge Knight . The FBI launched a money @-@ laundering investigation under the assumption that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records to fight their causes .

Wright allegedly lost his virginity at the age of twelve , and his promiscuous behavior resulted in not only the fatal disease , but also in nine children by seven different women . During the week of March 20 , having already made amends with Ice Cube , Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre , he drafted a final message to his fans .

 When reviewing Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton , Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted " ... Eazy @-@ E sounds revitalized , but the music simply isn 't imaginative .

 " Poison " was written by Johntá Austin , Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen of the production team Stargate and Beyoncé for her third studio album I Am … Sasha Fierce ( 2008 ) . It was produced by Stargate and Beyoncé while the audio mixing was done by Carlos <unk> and Damien Lewis at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta . The instrumentation of the song was provided by Stargate at the Roc the Mic studio in New York and the recording was done by Mikkel S. Eriksen . Jim Caruana also worked on the recording of the song . 
 Prior to the official premiere of the song on I Am ... Sasha Fierce , " Poison " was included on a mixtape by DJ Haze which was called Big R & B Ego . This version was leaked on the Internet in August 2009 . " Poison " was not included on the track @-@ listing of the standard version of I Am ...

 = = Composition and critical reception = = 
 According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing on the website Musicnotes.com , " Poison " is a slow @-@ tempo song with hundred beats per minute . It was composed using common time in the key of G major . Beyoncé 's vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5 . In the song , Beyoncé sings about a relationship that she knows is not good for her , but still one that she cannot give up . " Poison " is complete with stuttering beats coupled with the singer 's " <unk> " voice as stated by Sonya Eskridge of Sister 2 Sister magazine . 
 A writer of Rap @-@ Up magazine noted that the remix of the song which was featured on the mixtape Big R & B Ego was " potent , but not quite fatal " . Eskridge of Sister 2 Sister wrote in her review of the song that " we can 't help but wonder why it would have been cut " . Matthew Richardson of Prefix Magazine noted , " As far as songs that got left in the studio , ' Poison ' actually isn 't that bad . The song 's production isn 't loud enough for this to be a single , but Beyonce sounds fine here . " Nia Beckwith of the website AllHipHop gave a positive review about the song , saying that it was " the most noteworthy " track she heard during the week of its premiere . She wrote , 
 The overall theme of the song puts me in the mind of a hit from R & B group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison , but doesn 't fair the potential to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago . Even though the song doesn 't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy . It 's something most can relate to if you 've ever been in a relationship . Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that 's no good , but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison . 
 Recording artist Nicki Minaj discussed the song during an interview with Rap @-@ Up magazine , saying " When I tell you it gives me life , like , it gives me life . Her voice is effortless . It 's badass , like , ' I know I 'm the best . ' I love the melody , I love the cadence . It 's playful , but it 's just so in @-@ your @-@ face . It 's dope and it 's creative . "

 = 2009 – 10 Calgary Flames season = 
 The 2009 – 10 Calgary Flames season was the 30th season for the Calgary Flames , and the 38th for the Flames franchise in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The Flames entered the season with a new head coach as Brent Sutter replaced Mike Keenan . The year opened with the 2009 NHL Entry Draft on June 26 – 27 , as the Flames selected defenceman Tim Erixon with their first selection . 2009 also marked the debut of the Flames ' new American Hockey League affiliate , the Abbotsford Heat , as the franchise has relocated from the Quad Cities to the British Columbia city . 
 While the Flames led the Northwest Division early in the season , an extended slump left them in the eighth and final playoff position by the Olympic break . As a result , General Manager Darryl Sutter completed several trades in a bid to improve the team 's fortunes . Dion Phaneuf was one of seven roster players sent to other teams between January 31 and the March 3 trade deadline . The 2010 Winter Olympic tournament interrupted the season during February . Jarome Iginla won his second Olympic gold medal with Team Canada , while Miikka Kiprusoff and Niklas Hagman won bronze medals with the Finnish team . Iginla and Daymond Langkow each played their 1,000th games in February . 
 The Flames continued to struggle after the Olympic break ; they finished the season in tenth place in the West and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2003 . The result was disappointing for the organization , and led to media and fan speculation regarding the futures of Sutter and Iginla in Calgary . 
 = = Pre @-@ season = = 
 The Flames entered the 2009 – 10 campaign with a new head coach after Brent Sutter was named the 18th coach in franchise history . His assistants were promoted from within the organization : former Quad City Flames coach Ryan McGill and Calgary Hitmen coach Dave Lowry joined Sutter 's staff along with former player Jamie McLennan , who became the team 's new goaltender coach . Sutter had spent the previous two seasons as the coach of the New Jersey Devils , but resigned the position over a desire to return closer to his home in Red Deer , Alberta . He joined his brother Darryl , who remained the Flames ' general manager . 
 Preceding the release of the season schedule , rampant speculation that the Flames were in negotiations to host a second outdoor game for the 2010 NHL Winter Classic were confirmed . The additional game , suggested by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , would have taken place at McMahon Stadium , though negotiations were not successful and the league scheduled only one outdoor game for New Year 's Day . 
 Training camp had been dominated by the comeback attempt of Theoren Fleury at the age of 41 . Fleury had last played in the NHL in 2003 as a member of the Chicago Blackhawks before his career was halted by drug and alcohol addictions . Fleury , who had been under NHL suspension over his addictions since he last played , was reinstated by the league prior to the opening of camp and subsequently signed a tryout offer . He appeared in the Flames ' second pre @-@ season game , against the New York Islanders , drawing a loud ovation from the fans . He scored the only shootout goal to lead the Flames to a 5 – 4 victory before acknowledging the Saddledome crowd as it chanted " Theo ! Theo ! Theo ! " 
 Fleury played four exhibition games , scoring four points , before being released by the Flames . General Manager Darryl Sutter expressed his pride in Fleury 's attempt and commended his effort , but decided he was not one of the top six wingers in camp , which Sutter and Fleury had agreed was a condition of the tryout continuing . On September 28 , 2009 , Fleury announced his retirement . He thanked the Flames for allowing him to attempt the comeback , and expressed satisfaction at how his career ended . 
 The game against the Islanders also featured a devastating open @-@ ice hit by Dion Phaneuf on New York 's Kyle <unk> that saw the young forward taken off on a stretcher and sent to hospital with a concussion . The hit led Pascal <unk> to leave his team 's bench to engage Phaneuf as a melee broke out in the aftermath of the check . The league reviewed the incident and suspended <unk> ten games for leaving the bench .

 The Flames were expected to battle the Vancouver Canucks for top spot in the Northwest Division . The two teams met to open the season , a 5 – 3 victory for Calgary . It was the first time Calgary won a season opening game in seven years , and only the second since 1993 . The Flames won their next three , including two against their arch @-@ rivals , the Edmonton Oilers to open the season at 4 – 0 for the first time since 1993 – 94 . Following a loss to the Dallas Stars , the Flames faced the Chicago Blackhawks , and after scoring five goals in just five minutes , 29 seconds in the first period , went on to give up six consecutive goals to lose the game 6 – 5 in overtime . The six @-@ goal outburst by Chicago tied an NHL record for the largest comeback in league history . Despite a 4 – 1 – 1 start to the season , the loss prompted coach Sutter to question the players ' mental toughness . Although they felt they were not playing up to their expectations , the Flames tied a franchise record for the best start to the season , going 7 – 2 – 1 after ten games . 
 The Flames were embroiled in a national controversy in early November after it was revealed the team had secured a private clinic from Alberta Health Services ( AHS ) to have all players and their families inoculated against the H1N1 flu pandemic at the same time as many Albertans were growing increasingly frustrated with how the province was running public clinics . The controversy polarized the public and the media , even within individual newspapers . The Calgary Sun 's Michael Platt accused the " millionaire hockey players " of taking vaccinations from " shivering children " , while Eric Francis defended the club by pointing to the millions of dollars and hundreds of hours of volunteer time the team gives to the medical community . The Flames defended their actions , stating they completed an agreement with AHS prior to the Alberta government 's controversial clinics opening and arguing that they did so at a time when the government was encouraging all Albertans to get the vaccinations . AHS responded to the controversy by firing two people , including the most senior staff member involved in permitting the private clinic to go ahead . 
 Coincidentally , goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff was sidelined by what was suspected to be the flu on the same night the controversy broke . Backup Curtis McElhinney was a surprise starter against the Dallas Stars , and responded with a 38 save performance in a 3 – 2 overtime victory . The victory ended a two @-@ game losing streak that again led Sutter to criticize the efforts of his team , especially captain Jarome Iginla , and prompted the coach to put the players through an intense practice session prior to the game in Dallas . Kiprusoff surrendered only two goals in the Flames next three games as Calgary opened November with four consecutive wins , including a 1 – 0 shutout in Montreal against the Canadiens that was his 200th win as a Flame . 
 In spite of losing Curtis Glencross to a three @-@ game suspension in early November , and suffering an embarrassing 7 – 1 loss at home to the Blackhawks in which leading scorer Rene Bourque suffered an undisclosed injury , the Flames continued their torrid pace through November . Calgary moved past the Colorado Avalanche , into the division lead late in the month following a 3 – 0 shutout victory over the Detroit Red Wings . Victories over the Columbus Blue Jackets and Nashville Predators saw the Flames finish the month of November with a 10 – 2 – 2 record and tie a franchise record for points in consecutive road games at ten . Jarome Iginla led the Flames offensively in the month , recording 13 goals and 20 points in 12 games and was named the first star of the month of November . 
 The Flames struggled in December , losing six of seven games during one stretch in the middle of the month that was punctuated with a 5 – 1 loss on home ice to the Canucks that the players described as embarrassing and which briefly dropped the Flames to eighth place in the Western Conference . The loss to Vancouver also began the busiest part of the schedule for the Flames , who ended 2009 in the middle of a five game in seven night stretch and nine games in two weeks . The Flames entered the new year on a three @-@ game winning streak that included two more victories over the Oilers , and were looking forward to putting their disappointing month of December behind them . 
 Rosters for the 2010 Winter Olympics were announced in December . Olli Jokinen joined Kiprusoff in being named to the Finnish team , while Jarome Iginla was named an alternate captain for Team Canada . Dion Phaneuf , Jay Bouwmeester and Robyn Regehr , whom all attended the summer Olympic camp , were left off the Canadian roster . Jokinen felt that the teams poor December played a role in their being left off , and expressed that the team felt they let the three defencemen down as a result . At the Olympic tournament , Iginla led the tournament with five goals , and assisted on Sidney Crosby 's overtime winning goal in the gold medal final against the United States . Kiprusoff , along with Niklas Hagman , who was acquired from Toronto before the Games , both won bronze medals . 
 Two wins to begin January extended the Flames ' winning streak to five games . An extended scoring slump led the team to struggle for the rest of the month , culminating in a nine @-@ game losing streak ; the longest the team has endured since an 11 @-@ game losing streak in 1985 – 86 . The Flames finally ended the skid with a 6 – 1 victory , led by Iginla 's four points and Gordie Howe hat trick , over the Oilers , who had their own losing streak extended to 13 games . In doing so , the Flames won all six games against Edmonton , the first time either team has swept the other in the 30 @-@ year history of the rivalry . The following day , on January 31 , Darryl Sutter completed a seven player trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs that saw Dion Phaneuf sent to Toronto . Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust were then sent to the New York Rangers for Ales Kotalik and Christopher Higgins a day later in a trade that was first rumoured the evening before but was delayed so that Jokinen and Prust could play with the Flames against the Philadelphia Flyers . 
 Three losses in four games , capped by a 5 – 0 defeat against the Boston Bruins on March 27 left the Flames six points out of the eighth and final playoff spot with seven games remaining . The team also lost second @-@ line centre Daymond Langkow after he was taken off the ice on a stretcher in Minnesota after being struck in the back of the neck by a slapshot . However , a 5 – 3 road victory against the Eastern Conference leading Washington Capitals and a 2 – 1 home win against the Phoenix Coyotes , coupled with the Colorado Avalanche losing six of their final seven games to end the month of March , left the Flames two points behind the Avalanche heading into April . 
 The Flames struggled on the power play , finishing 30th overall in power @-@ play goals , with 43 . They did , however , tie the Detroit Red Wings for the fewest shorthanded goals allowed , with just 1 . 
 = = Playoffs = = 
 Consecutive losses to Chicago and San Jose , coupled with two victories by Colorado eliminated the Flames from playoff contention in the final week of the season . The Flames failed to qualify for the post season for the first time since 2003 . Flames players lamented their inability to score goals at key times as a primary reason for the team 's failure . The dismal result for the Flames led fans and media to question whether the team needed to make significant changes in the off @-@ season . The future of General Manager Darryl Sutter with the team was called into question , while many wondered if it was time to part ways with captain Jarome Iginla , who had been with the team since 1996 . For his part , Iginla accepted responsibility for the failed season , and said he did not wish to leave Calgary , wanting instead to lead the Flames into a rebound season in 2010 – 11 . When pressed by the media , he stated he would be willing to waive his no movement clause if the team asked him to , though Flames management dismissed speculation that they would consider dealing the team 's captain . 
 With the Flames out of the playoffs , several players were invited to represent their national teams at the 2010 IIHF World Championship in Germany . Rene Bourque and Mark Giordano played for Team Canada , while Eric Nystrom and David Moss joined Team USA . Mikael Backlund joined the Swedish team after the Abbotsford Heat were eliminated from the American Hockey League playoffs and won a bronze medal .

During the season , Iginla and Langkow reached significant career milestones on consecutive nights as they played their 1,000th career games in the NHL . Both players made their debut in the 1995 – 96 season and were both opponents during their Western Hockey League careers and teammates at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . The Flames presented the pair with silver sticks at a joint ceremony to honour them for their achievement .

 The Flames completed several trades during the 2009 NHL Entry Draft . They first gained an additional third round selection from the New Jersey Devils for agreeing to swap first round picks . The Flames moved down to the 23rd overall pick and gave the Devils the 20th overall selection . Calgary followed that up by dealing a third round pick to the Florida Panthers , along with the negotiating rights of Free agent defenceman Jordan Leopold in exchange for the negotiating rights of defenceman Jay Bouwmeester . The move proved successful , as Bouwmeester agreed to a five @-@ year contract less than a day before he would have become an unrestricted free agent . 
 Having already signed Bouwmeester , the Flames were relatively quiet in the first days of the free agent signing period . The team signed a quartet of players in Fredrik <unk> , Garth Murray , Riley Armstrong and <unk> Kronwall . They lost team leading scorer Michael Cammalleri after he signed a five @-@ year , $ 30 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens . Adrian Aucoin also moved on , signing with the Phoenix Coyotes . The team was able to retain defenceman Adam Pardy , as he signed a two @-@ year deal to remain in Calgary . 
 Darryl Sutter engineered a seven player trade at the end of January that sent Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik <unk> to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan , Ian White and Niklas Hagman . The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman 's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied . One day later , the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Christopher Higgins . The deals resulted in the change of over one third of the roster in the period of a day , moves that were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames hovered around the final playoff spot . While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence in the locker room , Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman 's departure . Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary , while in Kotalik , the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York . 
 The Flames completed three trades at the March 3 deadline . They first sent backup goaltender Curtis McElhinney to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Vesa Toskala , who became Kiprusoff 's backup . They then sent forward Dustin Boyd to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a draft pick . Despite showing potential at times , the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Boyd had failed to live up to the expectations placed on him in Calgary . The day ended with a minor , but historic , trade that saw Aaron Johnson sent to the Edmonton Oilers along with a draft pick , for fellow defenceman Steve Staios . The deal marked the first time in the 30 @-@ year history of the Battle of Alberta that the two organizations completed a trade with each other .

 The Flames opened the 2009 NHL Entry Draft in Montreal with the 20th overall selection but moved down three spots following a trade with New Jersey . With the 23rd overall pick , Calgary drafted Tim Erixon , a defenceman from Sweden . Erixon , whose father Jan also played in the NHL , considers himself a two @-@ way defenceman , and hopes to contribute both offensively and defensively for the Flames .

 After two seasons in Illinois , the Flames ' relocated their American Hockey League franchise , the Quad City Flames to the Fraser Valley of British Columbia . Called as the Abbotsford Heat , the team named former Calgary head coach Jim Playfair their coach . After six seasons , the Flames and the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL ended their affiliation agreement . Replacing the Wranglers , the Flames signed an agreement to place up to four players with the Utah Grizzlies . 
 Playfair gained notoriety late in the season after video of his wild tantrum against referee Jamie Koharski that involved the coach smashing two sticks went viral . Playfair was upset at what he felt was an excessive penalty given to one of his players , and came as the Heat were struggling to clinch a playoff spot . The Heat finished with a record of 39 – 29 – 5 – 7 , good enough for third place in the North Division , despite losing over 400 man @-@ games to injury . The Heat faced the Rochester Americans in the first round of the playoffs , and overcame a 3 – 1 series deficit to defeat the Americans in seven games . In doing so , they became the first team in AHL history to win games six and seven on the road to win a series . Abbotsford was defeated in six games by the Hamilton Bulldogs in the North Division final to end their season . 
 = 1997 Qayen earthquake = 
 The Qayen earthquake , also known as the Ardekul or <unk> earthquake , struck Northern Iran 's Khorasan Province on May 10 , 1997 at 07 : 57 UTC ( 12 : 57 local time ) . The largest in the area since 1990 , the earthquake measured 7 @.@ 3 on the moment magnitude scale and was centered approximately 270 kilometers ( 170 mi ) south of Mashhad on the village of Ardekul . The third earthquake that year to cause severe damage , it devastated the Birjand – Qayen region , killing 1 @,@ 567 and injuring more than 2 @,@ 300 . The earthquake — which left 50 @,@ 000 homeless and damaged or destroyed over 15 @,@ 000 homes — was described as the deadliest of 1997 by the United States Geological Survey . Some 155 aftershocks caused further destruction and drove away survivors . The earthquake was later discovered to have been caused by a rupture along a fault that runs underneath the Iran – Afghanistan border . 
 Damage was eventually estimated at $ 100 million , and many countries responded to the emergency with donations of blankets , tents , clothing , and food . Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris . The destruction around the earthquake 's epicenter was , in places , almost total ; this has been attributed to poor construction practices in rural areas , and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes . With 1 in 3 @,@ 000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes , a US geophysicist has suggested that a country @-@ wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns . 
 = = Background and geology = = 
 Iran experiences regular earthquakes , with 200 reported in 1996 alone . Like dozens that had preceded it , the 1997 Qayen event was of significant magnitude . It occurred on Saturday , May 10 , 1997 , at 12 : 57 IRST in the Sistan region , one of the most seismically active areas of the country . The first major earthquake in that region since 1979 , it registered 7 @.@ 3 on the moment magnitude scale ( Mw ) , 7 @.@ 2 on the surface wave magnitude scale ( Ms ) , 7 @.@ 7 on the energy magnitude scale ( Me ) , and had a maximum perceived intensity of X , or Extreme on the Mercalli intensity scale . 
 The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the Abiz Fault , part of the Sistan suture zone of eastern Iran . Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates , the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block . Most of Iran is contained on one microplate , causing seismic activity mainly along its borders . Both the 1968 <unk> @-@ e @-@ <unk> earthquake ( magnitude 7 @.@ 3 , resulting in 12 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 deaths ) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike @-@ slip faults , meaning that the crustal blocks on either side of the faults shifted against each other horizontally . The Qayen earthquake was caused by right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault . In addition to the dominant strike @-@ slip displacement , there was also local evidence of reverse faulting . The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop , more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event . The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6 @.@ 9 meters per second — nearly three @-@ quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall — and occurred near the earthquake 's epicenter . The crustal layer involved in the rupture was 20 – 25 kilometers ( 12 – 16 mi ) thick . The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for 110 kilometers ( 68 mi ) , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake 's magnitude . There were at least 155 aftershocks , reaching a magnitude of up to 5 @.@ 5 on the Richter magnitude scale . Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) below the surface . 
 The earthquake 's epicenter was within the village of Ardekul in South Khorasan Province , which borders Afghanistan . The village is isolated between mountains and hills . Although the Iranian government had distributed more than 800 seismographs throughout the country , few had been placed in the Qayen region due to its desert climate and the remoteness of the area . 
 As a result of the dry climate , timber — a main component in building earthquake @-@ resistant homes — is scarce in Qayen ; homes are instead constructed of adobe . The inhabitants of the poverty @-@ stricken region rely on subsistence farming , raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron . When the earthquake struck , much of the population was already working in the fields ; for the most part , these people survived . Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished . 
 = = Damage and casualties = = 
 The earthquake was felt over an area of 500 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 193 @,@ 051 sq mi ) , including in the cities of Mashhad , Kerman and Yazd . Destruction was most severe within a 100 @-@ kilometer ( 60 mi ) strip between the epicenter and Birjand . The tremors triggered landslides across the region and proved highly destructive to the region 's mud @-@ hut buildings . Entire streets were reduced to rubble , and in one village , 110 young girls were killed when their elementary school collapsed . 
 An initial report in The New York Times claimed that more than 2 @,@ 000 people had died in the worst @-@ affected area , with a further 394 in Birjand and two in the small town of <unk> . The earthquake was also said to have caused five fatalities in Afghanistan . As rescue efforts proceeded these figures were revised ; the United States Geological Survey states that 1 @,@ 572 people were killed and as many as 2 @,@ 300 injured . As bodies were retrieved , they were buried in mass graves . Officials worried that a temperature fluctuation — from 5 to 29 ° C ( 41 to 84 ° F ) on the day of the earthquake — would cause the corpses to rot more quickly , spreading infection . 
 Many villages lost both power and water , leaving survivors unable to fend for themselves . The injured were often up to 140 kilometers ( 90 mi ) away from the nearest hospital . One doctor , highlighting the desperate need for physicians to treat the injured , said " I don 't know how many casts I have done today , but it seems like hundreds . " The extensive aftershocks prompted survivors to leave the vicinity of their homes and take to tents . Several days later , another earthquake of magnitude 4 @.@ 8 struck . In the wake of the earthquake and its aftershocks , every one of the 700 houses in the tiny village of Abiz , 90 kilometers ( 56 mi ) east of Qayen , was destroyed , and 400 of its 1200 residents killed . 
 According to an Iranian radio station report , 200 villages sustained severe damage or were totally destroyed . The United States Geological Survey estimated that 10 @,@ 533 houses were destroyed ; an additional 5 @,@ 474 homes sustained varying degrees of damage . Fifty thousand people were left homeless . Local officials initially estimated the cost of the damage at $ 67 million 1997 US $ ( roughly 89 @.@ 5 million 2008 USD ) . The estimate was later raised to 100 million 1997 USD ( roughly 133 @.@ 6 million 2008 USD ) . One hundred schools and many health centers in the stricken areas were discovered to be in need of repair work . 
 Many of the more seriously damaged homes were of simple construction , with walls made of mud , adobe , or brick packed 40 – 50 cm ( 16 – 20 in ) thick . These materials are generally more vulnerable to the force of the earthquake . However , some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage . This was due to a range of factors , possibly including the height @-@ to @-@ width ratio , the lack of windows , and the quality of the materials used . In general , reinforced concrete @-@ framed homes , built after the 1979 earthquake , were better able to withstand the earthquake . Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings . 
 = = Relief efforts = = 
 Several thousand volunteers were brought in to join the search for survivors buried under mounds of brick and cement debris . Many volunteers worked with nothing but their hands . Local organizations , including the Iranian Red Crescent , sent 9 @,@ 000 tents , more than 18 @,@ 000 blankets , canned food , rice , and dates . An additional 80 tons of supplies were sent by the Iranian government to Mashhad , from where the relief efforts were being coordinated . 
 The United Nations Secretary General , Kofi Annan , pleaded that the international community " respond promptly and with generosity " . France dispatched a cargo plane filled with blankets , tents , clothing , and food , while Swiss authorities sent a rescue team with dogs trained in search @-@ and @-@ rescue . Several aircraft carrying tents , blankets , and kerosene stoves from European and Arab countries arrived in Mashad on May 14 . Representatives from the United States , calling the disaster a " humanitarian issue " , said that despite their strong differences with Iran they would donate supplies and other aid if requested . The Mennonite Central Committee , an American relief agency stationed in Akron , Pennsylvania , redirected to the relief effort 400 metric tons of lentils and cooking oils intended for immigrant refugees . A specialist British disaster rescue organisation , the International Rescue Corps , offered to send a team but were refused visas ( with the reasoning that " enough rescue crews had already arrived at the disaster site " ) and a Swiss offer of additional assistance was also turned down . Several countries within the Persian Gulf political region sent condolences to the families of victims and the government in the area . 
 Because the affected area is extremely remote , distributing the relief supplies was difficult . Reaching some villages would require a five @-@ hour drive over unpaved roads , some of which had collapsed or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake . Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise inaccessible areas . 
 Although aid operations continued for some time , the Iranian government ceased rescue work on May 14 . No more survivors were expected to be found in the rubble . 
 = = Future threats = = 
 Iran was listed as " the worst offender " in a 2004 report on countries with poor earthquake engineering . Professor Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder , a geophysicist who specializes in earthquake @-@ related deformation and hazards , blames construction practices for the fact that since the start of the 20th century , 1 in 3 @,@ 000 Iranians has died in an earthquake @-@ related incident . Bilham argues that " Most of Iran needs rebuilding . " The United Nations have prepared a Common Country Assessment for Iran , which likewise states that , " While adequate building regulations exist for large cities , it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to ... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages . Earthquake @-@ proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place " . An analysis of the performance of traditional buildings during the earthquake concluded that several factors , including high construction costs , poor materials , a shortage of skills in rural areas , and a lack of building regulations governing traditional construction techniques , have led to a deterioration in the quality of such buildings . The study recommended regulations to govern the construction of traditional arches and domes . 
 The earthquakes of Iran are a large concern to the populace and are an impediment to economic development . Twelve earthquakes with a Richter magnitude of over seven have occurred within the last century . Three @-@ quarters of the major cities of Iran are in areas prone to major earthquakes . The 1990 Manjil – Rudbar earthquake , with at least 42 @,@ 000 fatalities , cost Iran roughly 7 @.@ 2 percent of its Gross National Product ( GNP ) for that year and wiped out two years of economic growth . 
 In 2007 , the Asian Centre on Seismic Risk Reduction was formed in response to the regular earthquakes experienced by the southern , southwestern , and central Asian areas . This organization exists to " encourage regional and inter @-@ regional networking and partnerships to reduce seismic damage " . Earthquakes account for 73 percent of natural disaster deaths in the area . 
 = Ontario Highway 402 = 
 King 's Highway 402 , commonly referred to as Highway 402 and historically as the Blue Water Bridge Approach , is a 400 @-@ series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects the Blue Water Bridge international crossing near Sarnia to Highway 401 in London . It is one of two vital trade links between Ontario and the Midwestern United States . The controlled access freeway is four @-@ laned for nearly its entire length , except on the approach to the Blue Water Bridge , where it widens . 
 Although Highway 402 was one of the original 400 @-@ series highways when it was designated in 1953 , it was not completed until 1982 , when the final link between Highway 81 and Highway 2 opened to traffic . The freeway originally did not exit the Sarnia city limits , and merged into Highway 7 near the present Highway 40 interchange . In 1972 , construction began to extend Highway 402 between Sarnia and London ; this work was carried out over a decade . The removal of an intersection at Front Street in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled @-@ access highway . 
 Motorists crossing into Michigan at the western end have direct access to Interstate 69 ( I @-@ 69 ) and Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) into Port Huron ; motorists crossing onto the Canadian side from the east end of I @-@ 69 and I @-@ 94 have access to Toronto via Highway 401 , and onwards to Montreal via A @-@ 20 in Quebec . The only town along Highway 402 between Sarnia and London is Strathroy .

 The Blue Water Bridge crossing has six lanes of bridge traffic and non @-@ stop freeway access , therefore providing a quicker route than the busier Ambassador Bridge crossing in Windsor , which features over ten traffic lights leading to the bridge , although that situation will be rectified after the planned Gordie Howe International Bridge is constructed . Across the Blue Water Bridge , Highway 402 continues in Michigan as I @-@ 69 and I @-@ 94 . With the exception of the Front Street interchange in Sarnia , which is a hybrid of a diamond and Parclo B @-@ 2 interchange , the freeway uses the Parclo A @-@ 4 design throughout its length . Although the freeway passes through Sarnia , it is not intended to operate as a commuter highway . 
 The freeway begins on the Canadian side of the Blue Water Bridge , descending over the village of Point Edward . After passing through a customs plaza , it enters Sarnia and travels parallel to and north of Exmouth Street through the city . Near the eastern limits , the freeway curves to the northeast to bypass its original alignment . It crosses the Howard Watson Nature Trail , a mixed @-@ use recreational trail that was converted from a Canadian National Railway ( CNR ) line in 1988 . The highway curves back to its east – west orientation at an interchange with Highway 40 . It exits the city as it passes south of Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport . 
 Now parallel and north of London Line , the former route of Highway 7 ( the predecessor route between Sarnia and London ) , the freeway jogs north to travel along the back lot line of farmland fronting London Line and the concession road north of Highway 402 . In this manner , the freeway did not divide any farms when it was constructed , instead running between them . It meets Lambton County Road 21 ( Oil Heritage Road ) , the northern terminus of the Oil Heritage Route , north of the town of Wyoming . The county road is also a former southern extension of Highway 21 , which itself begins as Forest Line 9 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 8 mi ) to the east . Highway 21 is also known as the Bluewater Route , as most of its length is parallel to the shore of Lake Huron . 
 After passing an interchange with Forest Line , the freeway is crossed by London Line and momentarily diverges from its straight alignment to dip south of Warwick . It continues 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) east through large patches of farmland , then meets with Middlesex County Road 81 ( Victoria Street ) at an interchange as it passes north of Strathroy . Shortly thereafter it curves to the southeast and zig @-@ zags towards London , bisecting farms and dividing woodlands . The freeway passes to the west of the town of Delaware and curves east . It enters London and meets interchanges with Highway 4 south of Lambeth , as well as with Wonderland Road before merging into Highway 401 . Access to westbound and from eastbound Highway 401 is provided via Highway 4 .

 Planning for the route that would become Highway 402 began following the completion of the Blue Water Bridge in 1938 . A divided highway was constructed through Sarnia following World War II ; it was completed and designated in 1953 . The Department of Highways announced its intent to extend the route to Highway 401 in 1957 . However , while some preliminary work began in the early 1960s , it would take until 1968 for a preferred route to be announced , and until 1972 for construction to begin . Work was carried out through the remainder of the 1970s , and the freeway was completed and ceremonially opened in late 1982 . Since completion as a four @-@ lane route , expansion work has been concentrated on the portion of the freeway in Sarnia approaching the border crossing .

 Highway 402 is one of the original 400 @-@ series highways . It was numbered in 1953 , a year after Highway 400 and Highway 401 . The short 6 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 8 mi ) dual highway was built as an approach to the Blue Water Bridge , which itself opened to traffic October 10 , 1938 . As such , the highway was named the Blue Water Bridge Approach . Construction began in 1939 . However , like many other road projects , World War II halted construction . In 1947 , a new survey was undertaken ; construction resumed by 1952 . The approach road was opened in 1953 , at which point the route was designated Highway 402 . It featured an interchange with Christina Street and at @-@ grade intersections with Front Street , Indian Road and <unk> Road ( the Highway 40 Sarnia bypass ) . 
 Ultimately , Highway 402 was designated with the intent of extending it to Highway 401 . This was formally announced by the Department of Highways in late 1957 . Construction on a new grade @-@ separated intersection with <unk> Road began in 1963 . On February 28 , 1968 , a 98 @-@ kilometre ( 61 mi ) extension towards London was officially announced by Minister of Highways George Gomme . It was decided to construct the extension on a new right @-@ of @-@ way , as had been done with most freeways constructed after Highway 400 . East of the Murphy Road overpass , Highway 402 was re @-@ aligned to bypass the interchange with Highway 40 constructed in 1964 ; Exmouth Street was redirected to connect with Highway 7 ( London Line ) at that junction , and Quinn Street now follows the former route of the highway . For the new Highway 402 , an overpass crossing was required with the then @-@ CNR line ( now the Howard Watson Nature Trail ) and an interchange with the newly twinned Highway 40 just north of the 1964 interchange . Construction east of Highway 40 began in 1972 . 
 Under two construction contracts , construction of 23 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 14 @.@ 4 mi ) of Highway 402 began near Highway 7 in 1974 . A third contract to bridge the gap between that project and Sarnia was awarded in 1975 . On October 13 , 1978 , Highway 402 was opened to traffic between Highway 40 and Highway 21 . By the end of that year , construction was progressing on the section between Highway 21 and Highway 81 near Strathroy , as well as on the section connecting Highway 2 with Highway 401 . The section between Highway 21 and Highway 81 north of Strathroy was the next to be completed ; it was opened to traffic on November 26 , 1979 . On November 17 , 1981 , the section between London and Delaware was completed , including the interchange at Highway 401 . It forced eastbound drivers to exit at Longwoods Road ( Highway 2 ) . Construction was already underway on the final section between Strathroy and Delaware at this point . 
 The opening of the section between Highways 2 and 81 completed Highway 402 from London to the Blue Water Bridge . In addition , the removal of the Front Street intersection in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled @-@ access highway . Both were completed in time for the official opening in Sarnia on November 10 , 1982 .

 On Monday , December 13 , 2010 , a whiteout caused by lake @-@ effect snow squalls left an 80 @-@ kilometre ( 50 mi ) stretch of Highway 402 closed for several days . Lambton County officials declared a state of emergency . Although the entire distance between Sarnia and London is subject to occasional snow squalls and whiteout conditions , they usually dissipate or move in less than a day . The exceptional conditions at that time were caused by a snow squall which remained stationary over several days , dropping up to two metres ( 6 ft ) of snow in some parts of the area . Defence Minister Peter MacKay sent two Canadian Forces Griffon helicopters and a C @-@ 130 Hercules to Sarnia to aid in the search @-@ and @-@ rescue efforts . The hospitality of locals in providing shelter for stranded motorists was the primary focus of local media coverage . The highway was reopened to traffic on the morning of December 16 . A single death was reported ; a man succumbed to hypothermia on a nearby county road . 
 Highway 402 was widened in the Sarnia area from four to six lanes due to extensive traffic backups from the bridge crossing towards the USA ; the westbound lanes were widened by two lanes , while eastbound capacity remains unchanged . The new four @-@ lane roadway is divided into specific lanes for cars , trucks , local traffic , and <unk> card holders . The new lanes begin just before the Murphy Road overpass with a local lane breaking away for interchange access ; all travelers wishing to exit the highway from this point must be travelling in this lane . Construction began August 4 , 2009 , between the Blue Water Bridge and Lambton County Road 26 ( <unk> Road ) and included the reconstruction of several bridges , as well as completely rebuilding the Christina Street exit to accommodate southbound access . Work was completed by the end of 2012 . Between 2004 and 2013 , the speed limit along the westbound lanes from Airport Road westward were reduced from the standard 100 kilometres per hour ( 60 mph ) . However , following the reconstruction , the speed limit was raised between Indian Road and Airport Road on June 20 , 2013 . 
 On January 5 , 2013 , a temporary vehicular blockade was created at the Blue Water Bridge as part of the " Idle No More " protests by First Nations groups . The blockade was known in advance and was planned to occur during the noon hour . Lambton OPP monitored the protest by walking alongside the protestors . Traffic resumed flowing normally by 1 : 30 p.m. While Highway 402 itself was not closed , the protest did back up traffic onto the highway causing congestion in the areas of Front Street and Christina Street . Later that year , another protest was held west of Strathroy on October 19 , advocating against wind turbine construction due to the health effects experienced by those living near them . The rolling protest of about 150 vehicles , including farm equipment , was monitored by the OPP and required intermittent ramp closures to the westbound lanes .
