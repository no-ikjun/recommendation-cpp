 Critics , such as Cho Ramaswamy , have commented that Rajinikanth has the potential to be successful in Indian politics due to his popularity and fan base alone . In 1995 , Rajinikanth began supporting the Indian National Congress after meeting Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao . An opinion poll conducted by the magazine Kumudam predicted that Congress with Rajinikanth 's support might win up to 130 seats in Tamil Nadu Assembly . In 1996 , when the Congress Party decided to align with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( AIADMK ) for the assembly election in Tamil Nadu , Rajinikanth changed loyalties and supported Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) <unk> Maanila Congress ( TMC ) alliance . The TMC used a bicycle as their election symbol and used an image of Rajinikanth riding a bicycle from the film Annamalai in their posters . Rajinikanth said , " Even God cannot save Tamil Nadu if AIADMK returns to power . " Rajinikanth wholeheartedly supported the DMK and TMC alliance and asked the people of Tamil Nadu and his fans to vote for that alliance . This alliance had a complete victory in 1996 . Rajinikanth also supported the DMK @-@ TMC alliance in the parliamentary election held the same year . Later in 2004 , Rajinikanth said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) but would not extend his support to any front during the upcoming Indian general election . The party however failed to win any seats in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha . 
 Fans of Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu have continuously speculated his entry in politics , particularly to run for Chief Minister of the state . In 2008 , a few fans in Coimbatore launched a political party for Rajinikanth , in an attempt to pressure his entry . The party was named the " <unk> <unk> Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam " , with a dedicated party flag and symbol . After learning about this , Rajinikanth submitted an open letter to the media , declaring that he had no connection with these events and requested fans not to indulge in such activities , warning that he would take legal action if they failed to adhere . He also mentioned that he was not interested in politics and thus was only committed to working in films . He added that nobody can force him to enter politics , just as no one can stop him from entering it .

 Rajinikanth married Latha <unk> , a student of <unk> College for Women , who interviewed him for her college magazine . The marriage took place on 26 February 1981 , in Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh . The couple have two daughters named Aishwarya Rajinikanth and Soundarya Rajinikanth . Latha runs a school named " The Ashram " . 
 Aishwarya married actor Dhanush on 18 November 2004 and they have two sons , Yathra and Linga . His younger daughter , Soundarya , works in the Tamil film industry as a director , producer and graphic designer . She married industrialist Ashwin Ramkumar on 3 September 2010 and have a son Ved Krishna .

 Rajinikanth is a follower of Hinduism , spiritualism , and a strong believer of spirituality . He is also a practitioner of yoga and meditation . Rajinikanth has religiously visited major Hindu temples prior to the release of each of his films ; for instance he visited the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple before the release of Sivaji in 2007 and visited Sathya Sai Baba at <unk> Nilayam in Andhra Pradesh before the release of Kuselan the following year . He also occasionally leaves for pilgrimage to the Himalayas . He has often referred to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa , Swami Satchidananda , <unk> Swami , Mahavatar Babaji , and Ramana Maharishi as his favourite spiritual leaders .. 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 In 2002 , Rajinikanth undertook a daylong fast to protest the Government of Karnataka 's decision to not release Kaveri River water into Tamil Nadu and announced that he would contribute ₹ 10 million ( US $ 150 @,@ 000 ) toward a plan to interlink Indian rivers . He met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and many experts to canvass support for the project . His hunger strike was independent of the Nadigar Sangam , who organised their own solidarity protest for the same cause . Film director Bharathi Raja lashed out against Rajinikanth , alleging him of dividing the film industry and saying that he was a " traitor who had a tacit understanding with the Karnataka government " . 
 In 2008 , Rajinikanth took part in a hunger strike organised by the Nadigar Sangam against Karnataka 's stance on the <unk> Falls water dispute . In his speech , which was well received in Tamil Nadu , he warned leaders not to inflame the water project issue for political gains and requested that the issue should be resolved soon . He reprimanded politicians in Karnataka and urged them " to speak the truth " to the public . " They cannot be fooled and will not remain silent if you continue to act in such manner , " he stated . The speech led to <unk> Nagaraj , leader of the Kannada nationalist group Kannada <unk> <unk> Paksha , demanding an apology from Rajinikanth and threatening that he and his films would be boycotted from the state of Karnataka . The threats were echoed by other pro @-@ Kannada organisations , such as the Karnataka <unk> Vedike . In a move to save the market of Tamil cinema in Karnataka and ensure welfare of Tamil Nadu @-@ based filmmakers , Rajinikanth apologised for his statements in a brief media appearance on TV9 Kannada . He later thanked the Kannada film industry for allowing the release of Kuselan and lifting the ban the industry had briefly imposed on it . This led to strong reactions from Nadigar Sangam members R. Sarathkumar , Sathyaraj and Radha Ravi , who called the apology a disgrace to Tamils and opined that his speech never provoked the sentiments of the Kannada people . 
 Rajinikanth 's support toward fellow actor Ajith Kumar , who in 2010 condemned the forceful inclusion of Tamil cinema personae in political affairs , broke into a controversy . 
 = = = Philanthropy = = = 
 According to Naman Ramachandran , the author of Rajinikanth : The Definitive Biography , most of Rajinikanth 's philanthropic activities went unpublicised because he did not want them to be so . Rajinikanth has given away half of his income to charities . In the 1980s , when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes , Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches . In 2011 , Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti @-@ corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall , the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam , in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast . Rajinikanth 's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday .

 = USS West Gate ( ID @-@ 3216 ) = 
 USS West Gate ( ID @-@ 3216 ) was a cargo ship for the United States Navy during World War I. The ship was laid down as SS War Agate , but she was launched in January 1918 as SS West Gate instead . 
 SS West Gate was one of the steam @-@ powered West boats that were built for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) . They were steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort . She was the 3rd ship built by the Columbia River Shipbuilding Company in Portland , Oregon . She was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) of the United States Navy in April 1918 . 
 After experiencing engine trouble on her first attempt at a transatlantic crossing , West Gate was unsuccessfully attacked by two German submarines in early July 1918 while returning to port for repairs . After successfully completing her trip to France , she began her second transatlantic trip in early October . In the early morning hours of 7 October , West Gate 's steering gear jammed and American , another Navy cargo ship , collided with the West Gate , sinking her . Seven men lost their lives in the accident . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The ship was laid down at the Columbia River Shipbuilding Company of Portland , Oregon under the name War Agate as part of an order for the British Admiralty . Had she been sold to them , the War Agate would have been operated by the Cunard Line . However , the USSB commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress in mid @-@ 1917 , which included the still @-@ incomplete War Agate . The ship was renamed West Gate by the time of her launching on 27 January 1918 . She was one of the West ships , which were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the USSB for emergency use during the First World War . All of the West ships were given names that began with the word West , and West Gate was the 3rd of some 30 West ships built at Columbia River Shipbuilding . 
 West Gate was 5 @,@ 799 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 410 feet 1 inch ( 124 @.@ 99 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet ( 16 @.@ 5 m ) abeam . She had a steel hull that displaced 12 @,@ 185 t with a mean draft of 24 feet 1 inch ( 7 @.@ 34 m ) . Her hold was 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 07 m ) deep . West Gate 's power plant consisted of a single steam turbine driving a single screw propeller which moved the ship at up to 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ) . 
 = = Career = = 
 After her April 1918 completion , West Gate was handed over to the United States Navy for use in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) . She was commissioned at Norfolk , Virginia , as USS West Gate ( ID @-@ 3216 ) the same day with Lieutenant Commander Alexander Watson , USNRF , in command . 
 After making her way to New York , West Gate took on 6 @,@ 700 tons of cargo that included locomotives , steel rails , and other materiel for the United States Army and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June . The ship soon developed engine trouble and dropped out of the convoy to head to St. John 's , Newfoundland , for repairs . While headed to St. John 's in moderate seas under a cloudy sky , West Gate was attacked by two German submarines at 19 : 15 on 3 July . One U @-@ boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship , crossing to starboard . As West Gate quickly turned to port to evade the U @-@ boat , a second U @-@ boat surfaced one point to starboard . While West Gate 's radio operator sent out a preemptive SOS , her gunners opened fire on the two submarines . Though her gunners made hits on neither boat , both were bracketed with fire , quickly submerged , and apparently departed the scene . West Gate arrived at St. John 's at 18 : 00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels . 
 After four days of repairs , West Gate departed St. John 's for France and arrived at the Gironde estuary on 22 July . She shifted to Saint @-@ Nazaire three days later where she unloaded her cargo . West Gate departed on 21 August for Newport News , Virginia , where she arrived on 10 September . Later in the month , she headed to New York for major engine repairs . 
 = = Final voyage = = 
 After taking on 7 @,@ 187 long tons ( 7 @,@ 302 t ) of Army materiel , she departed for Bordeaux on 4 October in a convoy escorted by cruiser Denver . On the night of 6 / 7 October — noted in the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships as " particularly dark and rainy " — the ships were having trouble maintaining their stations in the convoy . West Gate was sailing in the first column to the starboard of the guide ship , Sagua . 
 At 02 : 28 on 7 October , while about 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ) south of Halifax , West Gate 's steering gear engine jammed , sending the ship veering sharply to the port . The crew put the ship 's engines at half speed to try to drop out of the convoy . Lieutenant Spencer , the chief engineer , and his assistant , Lieutenant ( <unk> ) Hillery , headed to the machinery spaces to see about effecting repairs . At 02 : 30 , men on the bridge sighted the red light from the oncoming American , which had been steaming behind and to the port of West Gate . Though the bridge ordered the engines raised to " full speed ahead " to avoid the collision , there was no time for the engines to respond before American 's bow cut into the starboard side of West Gate , near the poop deck . 
 West Gate 's engines were shut down while American backed out of the tangle . West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued . The chief engineer and his assistant , Spencer and Hillery , remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent the explosion of the boilers . They finished the task just before the aft bulkhead gave way to the <unk> seawater . Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2 , which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship . 
 Chief Gunner 's Mate Michael B. Wallrath , who had assisted in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board , jumped overboard after seeing to it that all the boats were away . Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants . Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort , USNRF , West Gate 's commanding officer , remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship . When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship , he discovered six men huddled on deck . Vandervoort was able to get the six on the life raft , but the suction caused by West Gate 's final plunge pulled him away and below the surface . After he managed to get back to the surface , he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier . Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of American 's lifeboats at 06 : 00 , after some 3 ½ hours in the water . 
 A total of seven men from West Gate , two from lifeboat six and five others probably killed in the initial collision , lost their lives in the accident . The U.S. Navy awarded Chief Gunner 's Mate Wallrath a Letter of Commendation for his actions during the sinking of West Gate . 
 = Lauren Ebsary = 
 Lauren Kaye Ebsary ( born 15 March 1983 ) is an Australian cricketer . Primarily a batsman , she is a former member of the Australia national women 's cricket team . 
 Ebsary made her senior debut for South Australia in the Women 's National Cricket League ( WNCL ) during the 2000 – 01 season at the age of 18 . Although she played in every match in her first season , she was shielded from much of the action and made only six runs . Ebsary was selected in every match in her first three seasons , but in that time , scored only 136 runs at a batting average of 8 @.@ 50 and took 13 wickets from 24 matches . The following year , Ebsary raised her career average above 10 for the first time and was selected in the Australian Under @-@ 23 team . In 2004 – 05 she made more than 100 runs in a season for the first time , and the following year she made 149 runs at 29 @.@ 80 . In 2006 – 07 , she struggled and totalled only 101 runs at 14 @.@ 42 and took three wickets , and after the season she transferred to Western Australia . The change of state yielded dividends in the 2007 – 08 season , as she made 236 runs and took eight wickets , her highest aggregate of runs and wickets in one tournament . 
 At the start of the 2008 – 09 season , Ebsary gained selection to the Australian national team and made her One Day International ( ODI ) debut in the home series against India . She made 37 runs at 18 @.@ 50 , and after scoring 207 runs in the WNCL season , was retained in the national team . After making her ODI top @-@ score of 86 in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand , she was selected for the 2009 World Cup , but was in and out of the team , making 106 runs at 35 @.@ 33 . In June 2009 , she played in all of Australia 's matches at the 2009 World Twenty20 and made her Test debut against England in a bilateral series after the World Twenty20 . Ebsary scored 211 runs during the 2009 – 10 WNCL season to retain her position in the national squad for the Rose Bowl series , but after a series of poor performances , she spent the latter half of the campaign watching from the sidelines .

 Born in Snowtown , South Australia , Lauren Ebsary was one of four children — two boys and two girls — of Peter and Kaye Ebsary . While pursuing her secondary education at Snowtown Area School , attended a cricket coaching clinic organised by her school in 1996 . It was there that her talent was noticed by Australian Test player and development officer for the South Australian Cricket Association ( SACA ) Joanne Broadbent , who said that Ebsary " had a lot of potential from the start " . After Ebsary made her debut for Australia , Broadbent said " I ’ ve always believed Lauren had the capacity to represent her country . " Ebsary was initially a tall and gangly pace bowler who mixed testing deliveries with erratic ones , including many wides . 
 During her teenage years before she acquired a driver 's licence , Ebsary 's mother drove her to the state capital , Adelaide — more than 100 km away — to play for the Flinders University Cricket Club in SACA 's district women 's competition on weekends . Back in Snowtown , she practised against her father and one of her brothers .

 = = = Junior selection = = = 
 In 1997 – 98 she attended the state under @-@ 17s trials and was successful in gaining selection at the age of 14 . Due to the lack of opportunities to females to play cricket at local youth level , she played her first competitive game at the national championships in Brisbane . In January 2000 , at the age of 16 , Ebsary was chosen for the South Australian team for the Under @-@ 19 interstate championships . Playing as a specialist batsman — she bowled a solitary wicketless over in six matches — she did not failed to pass five in her first five matches , before scoring an unbeaten 34 in the final match against Tasmania . Nevertheless , it was not a successful tournament , yielding 45 runs at a batting average of 9 @.@ 00 . 
 = = = Senior debut = = = 
 Despite the lack of success at youth interstate level , Ebsary was promoted into the senior South Australian team in the 2000 – 01 season at the age of 17 , playing in all of her state 's eight matches in the Women 's National Cricket League ( WNCL ) . She made her debut against reigning champions New South Wales , and after not batting , took one wicket for the loss of six runs ( 1 / 6 ) from two overs as South Australia lost by seven wickets . In the next match of the double @-@ header the next day , she took 0 / 15 from two overs and was run out for a duck in her maiden senior innings in a 22 @-@ run loss . During the season , Ebsary often batted at the bottom of the order in a specialist bowler 's position and thus rarely batted , but she hardly bowled , delivering only six overs in total in her first seven matches . In effect , she was shielded from taking on a meaningful workload and not trusted to contribute with either bat or ball . In the last match of the season , she was finally given a substantial opportunity against Queensland , taking 3 / 21 from seven overs , as South Australia proceeded to a six @-@ wicket victory . Nevertheless , in eight matches she scored only six runs at 2 @.@ 00 in three innings , and took five wickets at a bowling average of 9 @.@ 40 and an economy rate of 3 @.@ 61 . South Australia won only three matches and did not make the finals . 
 During the 2001 – 02 WNCL , Ebsary played in all eight matches , and was given more responsibility . This season , she batted in seven innings and bowled 51 of a maximum possible 80 overs . In the first match of the season , she took 3 / 29 from 10 overs against the titleholders New South Wales , and she scored 51 in the fifth match against Victoria . Ebsary did not have a significant impact in the other matches , never taking more than one wicket per match or reaching double figures with the bat . She ended the season with 67 runs at 9 @.@ 57 and six wickets at 30 @.@ 83 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 62 . South Australia won four of their eight matches and did not make the final . 
 Ebsary was 18 during the season and still eligible for the Under @-@ 19s and she represented her state during the tournament , which was held in the middle of a break in the WNCL . She scored 119 runs at 19 @.@ 83 and took nine wickets at 15 @.@ 55 with a best of 4 / 27 against the Australian Capital Territory . At the end of the season , Ebsary was chosen in the Australia Youth team to play New Zealand A and New Zealand . In four matches she took two wickets at 32 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 2 @.@ 66 but had no impact with the bat , scoring five runs at 1 @.@ 66 . 
 In the 2002 – 03 WNCL , Ebsary played in all eight matches , but was given less responsibility with the ball and had little success . She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34 @.@ 00 . She also had little effect with the bat , scoring 63 runs at 11 @.@ 50 with a best score of 18 . South Australia won five of their matches , narrowly missing the finals . Up to this point her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8 @.@ 37 . 
 At the start of the 2003 – 04 season , Ebsary was chosen in an Australian Under @-@ 23 team that played a two @-@ innings match against the touring England team . Ebsary scored nine not out and took 4 / 35 and 0 / 4 from a total of 20 overs . She was somewhat more successful in the WNCL than in previous years , bowling 28 overs and taking five wickets at 17 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 03 with a best of 2 / 19 in the last match of the season with Victoria . She scored 91 runs at 15 @.@ 16 , her highest season aggregate and average to date , with a best of 26 . This brought Ebsary 's career average above 10 for the first time . South Australia won four of their matches and another was washed out , failing to make the final . She played in three matches for Australia Youth against New Zealand A at the end of the season , scoring 29 runs at 29 @.@ 00 and taking three wickets at 16 @.@ 66 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 54 . 
 In 2004 – 05 , Ebsary scored more than 100 runs in a WNCL season for the first time . She scored 125 runs at 20 @.@ 83 , averaging more than 20 for the first time in a season . Her best score of 36 not out came in a ten @-@ wicket win over Western Australia , and in the other match against the state the preceding day , she scored 28 and took 2 / 26 in a 29 @-@ run win . Her best bowling performance came in the first match of the season as she took 3 / 32 and scored 25 in a six @-@ wicket win over Queensland . Ebsary ended the season with six wickets at 26 @.@ 83 . She bowled 37 overs and conceded 4 @.@ 35 runs per over . 
 In the 2005 – 06 WNCL season , Ebsary struggled to make an impact with the ball , taking four wickets at 43 @.@ 00 at the relatively high economy rate of 4 @.@ 91 . Her figures were flattered by a haul of 3 / 32 in the final match of the season against Western Australia , in which she also made 26 to help seal a three @-@ wicket win . Her batting continued to progress ; she scored 149 runs at 29 @.@ 80 , including a best of 43 against Victoria . South Australia won five of their eight matches , again missing the finals . 
 Ebsary had more difficult times in the 2006 – 07 WNCL season . She took only three wickets at 60 @.@ 33 and an economy rate of 5 @.@ 14 , the worst average and economy rate she had recorded for a WNCL season . She never took more than one wicket in any match . Her batting also regressed , making 101 runs at 14 @.@ 42 , more than half coming in a 51 against New South Wales in the last match of the season . This was Ebsary 's last season for her native state as she moved to Western Australia for the 2007 – 08 season . 
 = = = Move to Western Australia = = = 
 The transfer , in 2007 , coincided with an upturn in Ebsary 's career . After a slow start in the new WNCL season — Western Australia lost their first five matches — Ebsary became more productive . She scored 30 of 141 and took 1 / 16 in a low @-@ scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match . In the last double @-@ header of the season , against Queensland , she made consecutive half @-@ centuries for the first time in her career . In the first match she made 72 before taking 4 / 46 to help secure a 104 @-@ run win , before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five @-@ wicket win . Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29 @.@ 50 ; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149 . However , she did have trouble in running between the wickets ; three of her eight dismissals were run outs . She took eight wickets at 33 @.@ 87 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 43 and had a workload more than 50 % heavier than in previous seasons . Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format ; in two matches for the season , her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket , she scored 33 runs at 16 @.@ 50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7 @.@ 46 without taking a wicket . Ebsary later said " Looking back , the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket ... After settling our line @-@ up , it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease ... Under the leadership of Avril Fahey , the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order . "

 Ebsary was rewarded with international selection for the five @-@ match One Day International ODI series against India at the start of the 2008 – 09 Australian season . Nerve damage in her toe ruled Ebsary out of contention for the first match at Hurstville Oval , which the hosts won by eight wickets with more than 12 overs to spare . The next day , she was given her debut in the second match of the series , at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Ebsary made five not out as the hosts made 6 / 215 batting first . Ebsary came in at 6 / 194 with 14 balls remaining in the Australia innings . She took a single off each of the five balls she faced , rotating the strike as her partner Lisa Sthalekar completed an unbeaten century . In the seventh over of India 's reply , Ebsary 's throw from the boundary ran out Jaya Sharma as the opener attempted to take a third run , leaving the tourists at 2 / 9 . 
 Bowling in the middle of the innings , she then took 1 / 17 from five overs , her maiden wicket being <unk> Kamini caught behind by wicket @-@ keeper Jodie Fields for one run , leaving India at 5 / 71 in the 26th over . She then claimed two catches to complete the eighth and ninth wickets — those of tail @-@ enders Amita Sharma and <unk> Al <unk> — as Australia won by 86 runs . Ebsary went on to play in the last four matches of the series . She was promoted to the No. 4 position in the next match , but failed to capitalise on her opportunity , making a duck . She bowled five overs without taking a wicket in a 54 @-@ run win . She then made 32 from 43 balls as an opener , hitting six boundaries in the fourth ODI at Manuka Oval in Canberra , helping to set up a 118 @-@ run win . In the final match , she took 1 / 13 from four overs , taking the wicket of leading Indian batsman <unk> Raj and was not required to bat in a seven @-@ wicket win . She ended her debut series with 37 runs at 18 @.@ 50 and two wickets at 34 @.@ 50 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 83 . Australia took the series 5 – 0 in a dominant display ; all their wins were by at least seven wickets or 54 runs . 
 In the WNCL , Ebsary went wicketless for the entire season for the first time , conceding 127 runs at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 70 . She remained productive with the bat , scoring 207 runs at 25 @.@ 87 , making 43 and 57 , her two highest scores of the season , in the double @-@ header against Victoria . Western Australia won three of eight matches and did not make the final . Ebsary made 34 and 25 in her two T20 matches for the season , but had no success with the ball , conceding a total of 36 runs from three overs without taking a wicket . 
 = = = ODI and T20 World Cups in 2009 = = = 
 Despite her inability to take a wicket in the WNCL , Ebsary was retained in the national team and in the next five months of international cricket , she did not bowl a ball . Ahead of the 2009 World Cup , the Australians headed to New Zealand for a Rose Bowl series , Ebsary was left out of the first two ODIs against New Zealand , but was recalled for the next two matches at Seddon Park in Hamilton . She scored 30 from 47 balls in the first match before making her ODI top @-@ score of 86 the next day . Batting at No. 3 , she struck nine boundaries and faced only 76 balls , scoring at faster than a run @-@ a @-@ ball . This helped set up Australia 's 4 / 307 and they went on to win by 44 runs , their second consecutive victory . The teams returned to Australia where Ebsary made her T20 international debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground . She did not bat or bowl in a rain @-@ affected Australian win . 
 In two warm @-@ up matches ahead of the World Cup in Australia , Ebsary made 18 and 8 against England and Sri Lanka respectively . Nevertheless , Ebsary was retained for the match against New Zealand , scoring one at No. 7 as Australia failed in their run @-@ chase . It was the start of a tournament in which Ebsary was moved around in the Australian team structure . Ebsary was dropped for the second match against South Africa , which Australia won , and recalled for the last group match against the West Indies . She made 15 from 28 balls at No. 5 , in a 47 @-@ run win to reach the next round . In the first Super Six match , Ebsary made 39 not out from 36 balls at No. 7 in the closing stages of the game , attempting to hold together the Australian lower @-@ order as they fell 16 runs short of India 's 5 / 234 . She was then promoted to No. 3 in the following match , making 51 from 71 balls against Pakistan after Leah Poulton and Shelley Nitschke had put on a century opening stand , as the Australians completed a 107 @-@ run win . Ebsary was left out of the final Super Six match against England , which Australia won , which was not enough for them to reach the final . She missed the third @-@ place playoff against India , which was lost . She ended with 106 runs at 35 @.@ 33 from her four matches . 
 Ebsary was selected for Australia 's team for the inaugural Women 's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009 . The Australians hosted New Zealand for a three @-@ match series in tropical Darwin at the beginning of June before the World Cup , and Ebsary made 17 @.@ 00 at 8 @.@ 50 in her three innings . She then made 13 in the team 's warm @-@ up match on English soil , against the hosts , but was nevertheless retained for all the matches . She made a duck as Australia lost their opening match against New Zealand , and was not required to bat in the win over the West Indies . Ebsary made 23 run out in the final group match as Australia defeated South Africa to reach the semi @-@ finals . There she scored eight not out before England overhauled Australia 's score to reach the final , which they won . She ended the tournament with 44 runs at 22 @.@ 00 .

 After the World Twenty20 ended in June 2009 , Ebsary stayed in England for a bilateral series against the hosts , who were the reigning world champions in both ODIs and T20s . She scored 24 not out as Australia upset England in the only T20 by 34 runs . She played in all of the five ODIs , and after making 23 , 38 and 40 , her form tapered away in the last two matches , making single @-@ figure scores to end with 112 runs at 22 @.@ 40 . Batting in a variety of positions from No. 5 to 8 , she scored quickly at a strike rate of 88 @.@ 18 . In the fourth match , she took 1 / 16 , the first time she had bowled in 19 international matches , removing Claire Taylor . England won all the matches except the last , which was washed out . 
 Ebsary made her Test debut against England in a one @-@ off match at County Road in Worcestershire . Australia batted first and Ebsary came to the crease at No. 9 with the total on 7 / 271 . She scored 3 from 15 balls before being trapped leg before wicket by Katherine Brunt , as Australia were dismissed for 309 . She then took 2 / 35 . She claimed her maiden Test wicket by having Taylor caught by Poulton for 10 and then had Jenny Gunn caught behind by Jodie Fields for 41 . This ended a 77 @-@ run partnership with Beth Morgan and left the hosts at 6 / 136 but they recovered to reach 268 , still enough for Australia to take a 41 @-@ run lead . Ebsary was then promoted to No. 4 and made 21 as Australia set the hosts a target of 273 before the match was drawn .

 The WNCL was expanded in 2009 – 10 with the addition of the Australian Capital Territory , so ten round @-@ robin matches were scheduled , and Ebsary played in all , scoring 211 runs at 21 @.@ 10 . After being wicketless the previous season , she took seven wickets at 31 @.@ 28 , although opposition batsmen did attack her bowling , scoring 5 @.@ 17 runs per over . Her best batting and bowling performances came in the same match against her native state , taking 3 / 37 from nine overs to help dismiss them for 191 before scoring 48 to help secure a two @-@ wicket win . In the last two matches of the season , she scored 43 and 42 in consecutive wins over Queensland . 
 Ebsary had a successful time in the domestic T20s , now part of a full interstate tournament instead of a series of one @-@ off matches , scoring 137 runs at 22 @.@ 83 and taking four wickets at 26 @.@ 25 at an economy rate of 7 @.@ 50 . Her best score of 41 came in a win over Tasmania on 11 November 2009 . She also scored 29 and took 2 / 14 in a win over the Australian Capital Territory on 11 December 2009 . 
 Ebsary was retained for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand and played in the first four ODIs in Australia in February 2010 . She made 31 runs at 15 @.@ 50 in the first two matches and , after Poulton had made a century in the fourth match , was dropped for the fifth and final match as the hosts took a clean sweep . The ODIs were followed by three T20 matches at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand . Ebsary played in the first four T20 games , scoring 39 runs at 9 @.@ 75 before being left out of the final match as New Zealand took a clean sweep .

 = Agneta Matthes = 
 Agneta Wilhelmina Johanna van Marken @-@ Matthes ( 4 October 1847 – 5 October 1909 ) was a Dutch entrepreneur . She and her husband Jacques van Marken were involved in the manufacture of yeast throughout their lives , and were engaged in the cooperative movement , taking care of their workers . Matthes and Van Marken created living quarters for workers in her hometown , Delft in South Holland , named Agnetapark after her . These are considered a model for the cooperative development and construction of garden cities ( self @-@ contained communities ) for workers . Matthes founded and ran a Delft perfume factory , Maison Neuve , to take advantage of a by @-@ product from the yeast factory .

 Agneta Wilhelmina Johanna Matthes was born on 4 October 1847 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands . Agneta Matthes was the daughter of Jan Willem Frederik Matthes , an insurance agent . She and her sister , Sara Elizabeth Marken @-@ Matthes ( 1849 – 1902 ) , grew up in upper middle @-@ class circumstances . Matthes was taught privately , and spent 1862 to 1864 in Utrecht in a boarding school . When she returned to Amsterdam , she studied piano and dance , and took art classes and religious instruction . Matthes ' sister Sara Elizabeth , who was affectionately known as Nora , married Zionist politician Arnold <unk> ( 1846 – 1907 ) , the founder of the Free @-@ thinking Democratic League , in 1876 . He was a Member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands between 1877 and 1901 . Sara Elizabeth and Arnold lived at the <unk> in Delft and had four children . Agneta maintained a close relationship with them , Nora called her first @-@ born daughter after her sister " Agneta " . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 In 1865 , Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken , known as Jacques , who studied technology and sociology at the <unk> School of Delft , a precursor of the Delft University of Technology . During his studies he took a study tour to Austria @-@ Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast , which fascinated him . Later , when he heard a baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands , he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour , and decided to produce industrial baker 's yeast of consistently high quality . 
 On 7 October 1869 the couple married just before the first yeast factory in the Netherlands , the Nederlandsche Gist & Spiritusfabriek NV , opened . The factory is now part of the multinational chemical company Koninklijke DSM . Jacques von Marten is regarded as one of the Dutch pioneers in the development of industrial food production because of his concept of factory production . 
 Their marriage was registered in the Delft population register on 10 November 1869 . Their first home was a modest apartment on a canal , but they moved frequently after that . As of 2012 , all of their homes are still standing and all are classified as historic buildings . Their last home , to which they moved on 3 June 1885 , was a villa in Agnetapark , Delft . When Matthes learnt that their marriage would be childless , she decided to dedicate her life to her husband 's business and career , and participated in the establishment and management operation . She accompanied her husband to the factory every day , having her own office . She also continued to have private lessons . In addition to administrative activities , their main interests were personnel policy issues . Matthes and van Marken maintained close contact with the employees of the factory and their families , which appealed to the couple 's sense of community ; they wanted to be part " of a larger whole " . Agneta Matthes shared her husband 's belief in progress , and they both promoted the personal development of their employees . 
 = = = Husband 's infidelity and children = = = 
 In 1886 , when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa , Agneta Matthes found a letter from Mary Eringaard requesting the child support that he owed for their children , which led to Matthes discovering that her husband had begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15 , and that he had four children by her . Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly . She did not tell van <unk> that she knew about the affair till three years , but in 1889 , when Eringaard was 36 years old , two of her children died due to tuberculosis . 
 Van Marken and Matthes took care of the three surviving children , Cornelis , Clara , both adolescents , and Anna , a young child . Officially they were foster children , but it was an open secret ( officially secret but widely known ) in Dutch society that van Marken was their father . With the consent of Matthes , van Marken planned to adopt them , but his religious father vetoed the adoption . Jacob Cornelis Eringaard , the eldest illegitimate son of van Marken , later headed the Gist & Spiritusfabriek and pursued the social interests of his father and his wife . The youngest daughter , Anna <unk> Eringaard , was married in 1932 to the diplomat and publisher Daniel Johannes von <unk> ( 1895 – 1976 ) .

 = = = Legal situation and sources of information = = = 
 Because legally , married women were required to have the approval of their husbands to do business , Agneta Matthes acted " for and on behalf " of her husband . Also because of this , extensive records of the business ventures and career of Jacques van Marken exist , while only a few sources mention the activities of Matthes . It is unclear , therefore , to what extent Agneta was responsible for ideas . She undoubtedly had operational control of the perfume factory , Maison Neuve . She undertook an empirical analysis of the housing needs of 48 working families , equipped Agnetapark significantly , and was influential at least during the early years in the management of her husband 's other companies , especially in matters of personnel . 
 = = = Start @-@ ups = = = 
 Matthes and van Marken , who was called a welfare engineer by his contemporaries , developed a premium wage system for his factory workers of the Nederlandsche Gist & Spiritusfabriek NV ( 1869 ) , under which all employees could receive bonuses of two to 20 percent of their salary in addition to their basic salary " for good work and because of zeal " . The company paid up to ten percent of its profits as a dividend to its employees . In 1880 , the engineer , Gerhard <unk> , a grandnephew of van Marken , established a " Concerns van het <unk> " ( human resources management ) , the first such institution in the Netherlands . Due to van Marken 's health problems , François Gerard Waller , his nephew , was entrusted with the management of the factory in 1886 . 
 In 1873 , Agneta Matthes founded her own business , the Delft perfume factory , Maison Neuve , where her husband acted pro forma as owner because of the legal issues . The factory used the ethanol by @-@ product of the yeast production of Gist & Spiritusfabriek . 
 Agneta concentrated on the perfume factory in the following years , and collaborated with the Delft porcelain manufacturer De Koninklijke <unk> <unk> , which created perfume bottles for her products . She participated in international exhibitions , where her perfume brand , PMN ( <unk> Maison Neuve ) , won several prizes and gained recognition for her company . She won the bronze medal of the 1878 on the Paris World 's Fair . In Australia , her perfumes won first prize at the international perfume fair . She sold the company in 1886 with profit . 
 In 1883 , the couple became interested in margarine , a young industry in the Netherlands at the time . With private capital and a legacy from Matthes ' mother , they founded the Nederlandsche <unk> NV , and built a factory next to the yeast factory . In 1885 , they took over <unk> <unk> & <unk> NV . Jacques van Marken officially acted as sole manager . To operate a purchasing cooperative in Agnetapark , they founded the Cooperative <unk> in 1873 . In 1892 they also founded a printing company , which now is owned by the Koninklijke <unk> GJ Thieme . In all these companies , Matthes was instrumental in decision making , planning and organisation . The couple pursued the same personnel policy as in the Gist & Spiritusfabriek . In 1878 , they established the first works council of the Netherlands , called , " de Kern " ( the kernel ) . At the height of their success in 1885 , when they employed approximately 1 @,@ 250 employees , their companies were collectively known as , the <unk> <unk> ( Delft Industry ) . 
 = = Factory journal = = 
 On 24 June 1882 , the first issue of an internal newspaper of the factory , called , <unk> ( " messenger of the factory " ) , was published . It was the first magazine of that kind in the world . Agneta helped her husband with other publications , such as his 1881 book , La question <unk> à la <unk> de <unk> <unk> et d <unk> . Essai de solution pratique ( The Labour Problem in the Dutch Yeast and Alcohol Factory . Attempt at a Practical Solution ) , and another in 1894 , L 'Organisation Sociale dans l 'industrie ( The Social System in the Industry ) , which was printed in two editions and translated into English and German . The full extent of Matthes ' participation is not known , but she was certainly in charge of the translations .

 In 1881 the couple began work on a housing quarter for their workers that followed the principles of the garden city movement . With financial support from Matthes ' mother , they purchased a 4 hectares ( 9 @.@ 9 acres ) plot of land for 16 @,@ 000 <unk> in Hof van Delft , then a rural , sparsely populated village well outside the Delft city limits . From 1882 to 1884 , the area was developed in the style of an English landscape garden , crisscrossed by streams , after the plans of landscape architect , Louis Paul Zocher , son of Jan David Zocher . Eugene Cowl , an architect , designed 48 row houses , other buildings , and a villa for Matthes and van Marken . The facility was named Agnetapark , after its founder . The residential park featured individual multi @-@ story apartments with private entrances , private bathrooms , and private garden areas . Matthes and van Marken established a corporation for the development of the settlement , and gave the park to its workers in 1870 as a cooperative , in order to prevent speculation . 
 To the great astonishment of the founders , the employees were not so happy as expected . The area was remote from urban infrastructure and lacked good transportation facilities . These disadvantages were offset by an improvement of community facilities in three buildings : De <unk> ( the community ) , a large house with a kindergarten and an elementary school , which served as a gathering place and a dining room . Other features included a gymnasium , a billiards club , de Tent ( the tent ) – a music and event pavilion , and a grocery store , which later also sold clothes . The park had a playground , a bowling alley , a shooting range , and a boathouse with rowing boats for hire . A volunteer fire department , a brass band , and clubs for shooting , bowling , and cycling also were founded . 
 The employees , however , did not like living so close to their employers . They complained about the distance to the city and the transportation problems , and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves they had to make . After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken , however , the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area . In 1931 the villa , Rust <unk> , which had long been empty , was converted into a school . It was demolished in 1981 . Since 1989 , the park has been listed as Cultural heritage . 
 = = = Corporate citizenship = = = 
 In 1871 , van Marken was appointed secretary of the Vereeniging van het <unk> <unk> dead ( Association for the Advancement of Public Education ) , after which time Agneta Matthes regularly visited charity schools and was involved in the improvement of their situation . 
 During the winter of 1879 @-@ 1880 , extended periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands . <unk> and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft . In response , Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor <unk> ( Association to care for the poor ) , helping regardless of religious or political beliefs . She prompted her husband to launch a <unk> @-@ Commissie , which was led by him , his brother @-@ in @-@ law Arnold <unk> , and CEO @-@ to @-@ be Gerard <unk> . 
 In 1880 , the couple founded a health insurance scheme for bakers . This insurance was also the first step toward more regulated pensions . Insurance in case of accidents at work was established in 1884 . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 Van Marken was regarded as a " social entrepreneur " and a pioneer of his time regarding social issues , however , he was criticised for acting for his workers instead of letting them participate . Although she was not explicitly mentioned , Matthes also drew criticism . In 1906 , the journalist Frank van der Goes published van Marken 's obituary in Het Volk , the organ of the Social Democratic labour movement . Two critical articles were entitled , " Een <unk> " ( A Delusion of a Life ) and imputed ulterior motives of van Marken 's undoubted social engagements . Van der Goes wrote that by providing care to his workers , van Marken had bribed their loyalty and wanted to exercise social control , while his staff was unduly dependent on him ; for example , they found difficulty changing jobs once they had moved into a house in Agnetapark . 
 Despite the disappointments regarding Agnetapark , it was an important model for the cooperative development and construction of garden cities for workers . The park is considered the first social housing scheme which cared about providing hygienic living conditions in a green environment for a high quality of life . 
 = Myrmecia nigriceps = 
 Myrmecia nigriceps , also known as the black @-@ headed bull ant , is a species of ant endemic to Australia . A member of the genus Myrmecia in the subfamily Myrmeciinae , it was first described by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862 . These ants are large , varying from 19 to 23 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 75 to 0 @.@ 91 in ) in length . However , colonies contain workers that are much smaller , usually half the size of normal workers . The queens are the largest while the males are the smallest , which can be easily identified due to their small mandibles . 
 Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps is found in hot hilly areas and woodland , nesting underground in mounds . The ant 's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey , which are fed to the carnivorous larvae . Spiders are known to eat these ants , and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae . Like other Myrmecia species , M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting , and the venom is capable of inducing allergic reactions in sensitive people . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 First identified by Gustav Mayr in 1862 , Mayr provided the first description of M. nigriceps in his journal <unk> Studien . The species was described under the binomial name Myrmecia nigriceps , based on syntype workers collected from Gayndah and Sydney . In 1907 , Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel treated M. nigriceps as a variant of M. vindex , but he eventually treated it as a synonym in 1910 . M. nigriceps was revived as a full species in 1933 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler , on the basis that it is distributed throughout Australia and its average size is greater than M. vindex . Scottish born Australian entomologist John S. Clark published one synonym – Myrmecia fasciata , now considered a junior synonym . M. nigriceps is a member of the genus Myrmecia , a part of the primitive subfamily Myrmeciinae ; most ancestors of the genus are only found in fossils , with the exception of the dinosaur ant ( Nothomyrmecia macrops ) . 
 M. nigriceps is a member of the M. gulosa species group , which is the largest species group of the nine groups described . The specific name , nigriceps , is a combination of nigri , which derives from the Latin word nigra , meaning " black " , and ceps , which is derived from the Greek word <unk> , meaning " head " . This references the distinctive black head of the ant . With this said , M. nigriceps is commonly known as the black @-@ headed bull ant . 
 = = Description = = 
 The size of worker ants varies from 19 to 23 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 75 to 0 @.@ 91 in ) . However , colonies contain very small workers , usually less than half the size of normal sized workers . Despite this , it is not known if M. nigriceps is polymorphic , due to little differences in morphology between the workers in comparison to Formicinae ants and <unk> , with soldiers having enormous heads . The queens are the largest , measuring around 24 to 26 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 94 to 1 @.@ 02 in ) , and males being around similar sizes to worker ants at 18 to 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 71 to 0 @.@ 79 in ) . The head and gaster are black , and the thorax , node , and postpetiole are either red or yellowish red , while the antennae and legs are either yellow or <unk> . The mandibles and clypeus are also yellow . The hair is short and yellow in colour , erect on the body and suberect on the legs . The pubescence ( short , fine , soft hair ) is white and abundant all over the postpetiole and gaster . The head is almost as broad as its total length , and the mandibles are longer than the head with 13 teeth present . 
 The queen is similar in appearance to the worker , but they are the largest members of the colony . The hair is more abundant , and the head is broader . The mandibles are shorter and broader , although they are still as long as the head . The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance . Males are the smallest members of the colony and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles . The hairs on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes , with a long and broad head . 
 M. nigriceps is similar in appearance to M. vindex , but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other . For example , M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex , and its head is either black or dark brown ; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers . The thorax and pedicel are noticeably darker and brownish red . The nests and behaviour , however , of both ants are similar to each other . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 M. nigriceps is distributed throughout Australia , but the ant is absent from areas in central Australia and the northern Australian coast . The range of M. nigriceps extends from Queensland and down into New South Wales , the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria . It is also found in South Australia and Western Australia . Colonies are found in deserts , coastal areas , plateaus , woodland , native vegetation , hot hilly areas covered with scrubby vegetation and in rehabilitated sites , at elevations ranging from 300 to 460 metres ( 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 ft ) . 
 M. nigriceps is a mound constructing species , although colonies can be found under logs . Workers decorate the nest with a variety of items , including lateritic pebbles and soil crumbs , in a similar fashion of meat ant ( Iridomyrmex purpureus ) nests . Other items used for nest decorating include small stones and plant material . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 M. nigriceps ants are crepuscular and nocturnal foragers , searching for food during the night . Workers are found foraging on Eucalyptus trees and is sympatric with many species . Adults are nectarivores , feeding on sweet liquids from plants and the larvae are carnivorous , feeding on captured invertebrates and other ants such as Camponotus workers and males . Cockroaches , such as <unk> castanea and <unk> ruficeps , can repel attacks by M. nigriceps by discharging a secretion that <unk> the attacking workers . Workers begin to forage one hour before sunset , with peak activity occurring during the twilight hours . These ants have excellent vision , having the largest eye lenses and photoreceptors than any other Myrmecia ant . These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away , sensitive to motion and will rapidly charge towards any moving objects to attack it . 
 These ants are preyed on by the short @-@ beaked echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) , and by spiders in the genus <unk> , particularly <unk> <unk> . Blindsnakes are known to consume the larvae and pupae of these ants . Colonies are also a host for M. inquilina , a social parasite that lays its eggs inside the colony . 
 M. nigriceps is an extremely aggressive ant , and larger colonies may rival other colonies of a different Myrmecia species ( such as M. gulosa ) in terms of fierceness and pugnacity . While the mandibles cause little to no pain in humans , the ant is equipped with a painful and powerful sting that is found at the end of the gaster . Like other ants , the sting is not barbed , and workers are able to sting multiple times without injuring themselves . With a median lethal dose ( LD50 ) of <unk> / kg , the venom is relatively weak in comparison to other Myrmecia ants , whose LD50 is much lower . However , in a 2011 study , at least one patient had an allergic reaction to M. nigriceps venom . This study also concluded that many other Myrmecia species can cause anaphylaxis , as well as the Green @-@ head ant ( Rhytidoponera metallica ) . In the Starr sting pain scale , a scale which compares the overall pain of hymenopteran stings on a four @-@ point scale , the sting of M. nigriceps was ranked as two in pain , described as " painful " . M. nigriceps ants are able to enter colonies they do not reside in without being attacked ; this may be due to these ants failing to recognise foreigners , or the consequences of ignoring workers from other colonies is low . 
 Nuptial flight occurs after rain for several days , taking place between summer and mid @-@ autumn ( December to March ) . The males and virgin queens emerge from their nest , and unlike other species who mate on the ground or climb onto nearby trees or branches to fly off from , the reproductive alates will fly from the nest . Recorded nuptial flights usually took place on hilltops . M. nigriceps queens are not known to seal up their entrance during colony foundation , unlike other Myrmecia species such as M. regularis . Workers can live exceptionally long , with an average lifespan of 2 @.@ 2 years ; maximum longevity in workers varied from 2 @.@ 1 to 2 @.@ 4 years .

 SS John Burke ( MC hull number 609 ) was an American Liberty Ship built during World War II , one of the 2 @,@ 710 type ' <unk> @-@ S @-@ C1 ' ships that carried all kinds and types of dry cargo during the war . The ship was named for John Burke ( February 25 , 1859 – May 14 , 1937 ) , the 10th Governor of North Dakota . Burke was built at Kaiser Shipbuilding Company 's Oregon Shipbuilding yard in Portland , Oregon . Burke 's keel was laid November 20 , 1942 and the hull was launched on December 13 . After fitting @-@ out , Burke was delivered to the US Navy December 23 , just 33 days after construction began . The Navy placed Burke under charter to Northland Transportation Company in early 1944 . 
 On December 28 , 1944 , while transporting ammunition to Mindoro , Philippines , Burke was hit by a Japanese kamikaze aircraft , and disintegrated in a tremendous explosion . John Burke was one of three Liberty Ships and one of forty @-@ seven ships sunk by kamikaze attack during World War II . 
 = = Construction and design = = 
 John Burke was powered by two oil @-@ fired boilers and a single 2 @,@ 500 hp ( 1 @,@ 864 kW ) vertical type , triple @-@ expansion reciprocating steam engine . The machinery space ( dark blue in the picture ) was located at the middle of the ship ( see the color @-@ coded image ) . The single propeller was driven through a long propeller shaft that ran through a tunnel ( lower green area in the picture ) under the aft cargo holds . The propeller rotated at 76 rpm , giving a speed of about 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . There were two decks running the full length of the ship , with seven watertight bulkheads dividing the machinery space and five cargo holds ( light blue in the picture ) , three ahead of the machinery space and two aft . Crew accommodations were provided in a large three @-@ deck structure located in the middle of the ship ( medium blue in the picture ) directly above the machinery space , and in a small structure ( medium blue in the picture ) located at the stern . The bridge , radio room and Captain 's quarters were located on the top deck ( yellow in the picture ) of the three @-@ deck structure . The fuel for the boiler was carried in several tanks ( red in the picture ) located throughout the ship . Ship 's storage ( light green in the picture ) was located at the bow and above the machinery space . Gun crew quarters and the ship 's hospital were located in the stern structure . When the ship was armed , the gun ' tubs ' ( white in the picture ) were located at the bow , stern and above the bridge . These could be any mixture of 5 inches ( 130 mm ) , 4 inches ( 101 @.@ 60 mm ) , 3 inches ( 76 mm ) , 40 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 57 in ) , 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) and / or .5 inches ( 12 @.@ 70 mm ) caliber guns . 
 The ship 's steering was by a <unk> rudder ( black , at left in the picture ) , with its associated steering gear located in a compartment ( green in the picture ) above the rudder and below the aft structure . Steam @-@ powered generators provided electric power for radios , navigation equipment , refrigeration compressors , pumps , lighting , and degaussing . An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew . Large hatches above the cargo holds allowed steam winches and booms rigged to three centerline masts to quickly load or unload cargo . 
 = = History = = 
 Liberty ships were an expedient solution to a pressing problem , and it was never intended that they last more than five years . It is remarkable that two ( SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O 'Brien ) have not only survived seventy plus years of service , but that they are in ' like @-@ new ' condition , and are open to the public as museums . The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U @-@ boats , but did not have the resources to build them . In 1939 they asked the United States to help solve the problem , bringing a ship design that they wanted built . The design was modified to fit American production methods , and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity . These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship 's name starting with Ocean . 
 The United States needed more ships as war approached . The ' Ocean ' design was revised and simplified to allow mass production . This new design was the basis for the Liberty ship . On December 7 , 1941 Japan attacked the military bases at Hawaii , Guam , and a few days later , the Philippines . Liberty ships carried weapons , ammunition , food , tools , hardware , vehicles , and other things for the war effort . They could also be equipped to carry a large number of troops by rigging bunks in the holds similar to those used by the armed guard . Liberty ships began taking troops and materials wherever they were needed , crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . Like other Liberty Ships , John Burke transported war materials between the United States and the rear areas of the Pacific War , often calling at Pearl Harbor , Australia , Guadalcanal , Hollandia and Manaus . 
 On what would be her final trip , Burke departed Seattle , Washington for Guam , where she spent several days loading munitions for the invasion force on the island of Mindoro . Burke then departed with the 100 @-@ ship " Uncle Plus 13 " convoy , bound for Leyte in the Philippines . The convoy arrived at Leyte the night of December 27 . 
 Japanese forces were alerted to the convoy 's arrival shortly before daybreak on December 28 . A flight of six Japanese kamikaze fighter / bombers was sent up from Cebu Island shortly after dawn . If the convoy was destroyed , the U.S. forces on Mindoro would be cut off from their supply line . 
 That morning Burke and the other ships in the Mindoro @-@ bound TG 77 @.@ 11 ( under the command of Captain George F. Mentz ) were at general quarters shortly after receiving the dawn weather report that reported that air cover would not launch until the poor weather cleared . The crews began their wait for the inevitable arrival of Japanese aircraft . 
 = = The attack = = 
 At about 0815 hrs , the first kamikaze appeared on the American ship 's radar , and orders were immediately given for the convoy to begin evasive maneuvering . Through holes in the clouds , the Japanese pilots sighted the large American force as it steamed through calm seas South of Cebu and Bohol Islands . Finding the convoy without air cover , a group of six Japanese planes began their attack . One of the pilots , flying an Aichi D3A " Val " , chose John Burke as his target . Diving through heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire , the Japanese pilot had no intention of pulling out of his steep dive . At 1020 , despite the damage to his aircraft , he crashed between Burke 's # 2 and # 3 cargo holds . 
 A brief flash of fire was visible to most of the ships in the convoy , and for several seconds , only smoke could be seen billowing from her hold . A few seconds later , a huge pillar of fire shot out of Burke 's cargo hold , followed by an immense cloud of white smoke . Within seconds all eyes were drawn to Burke where an enormous fireball erupted as her entire cargo of munitions detonated , instantly destroying the ship and killing her crew of 40 merchant marine sailors and 28 or 29 armed guards . For several seconds , Burke was not visible under an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke , fire and explosions . Several ships nearby were damaged by the force of the blast and flying fragments . The shock wave rocked the entire convoy , and several ships reported that they had been torpedoed . A US Army " FS " type ship just aft of Burke was severely damaged by the blast , sinking before it could be identified . As the cloud of smoke cleared , nearby ships closed on Burke 's former position to search for survivors . It was soon clear that Burke , and all 68 men aboard her , were gone . 
 The Combat Air Patrol arrived at 1213 after the weather cleared , providing air cover for the next three hours . 
 The Japanese attack that morning was just the beginning of a two @-@ day series of attacks on the convoy , costing several more ships and hundreds of lives . In spite of the near @-@ constant attacks , the force reached its destination at <unk> December 30 with much @-@ needed material for the Mindoro invasion .

 " Still Into You " is a song by the American rock band Paramore . It was released on March 14 , 2013 , as the second single from their self @-@ titled fourth studio album , Paramore . Recorded in 2012 in Los Angeles , California , " Still Into You " is a departure from the sound of their previous single , " Now " , and incorporates a lighter pop rock sound , while being described as " sweet " and " sugary " . 
 The song received acclaim from music critics , who have praised the song and Hayley Williams ' vocals as " catchy " and " strong and effective " , as well as deeming it as one of the songs of the summer of 2013 . It is among their most commercially successful singles in the United States , becoming a top @-@ ten hit on the Mainstream Top 40 , ranking at number eight on Billboard 's Hot Rock Songs , and receiving double @-@ platinum certification in the United States .

 Paramore first performed " Still Into You " in Austin , Texas , as part of the South by Southwest festival . The song was then released as a single on March 14 , 2013 , and was uploaded to Fueled by Ramen 's YouTube channel , through a lyric video . The lyrical content finds Williams singing about her relationship with Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory fame and how her feelings seemingly have stayed the same since their first meeting . 
 In an interview with Spin , Williams stated " ' Still Into You ' is definitely a love song . It 's definitely happy . But to me anyway — and obviously I wrote it so maybe I 'm biased , but — it 's not a sappy love song . ... We 've never done that before , and honestly I don 't have a whole lot of experience writing love songs , or anyways lyrics that are like this . "

 " Still Into You " has been described as a power pop , pop rock and new wave song with skeletal guitar lines similar to that of the artist Gotye , alternative dance glockenspiel and synths . It lacks a heavy guitar riff , which Paramore is typically known for , and is replaced by a back beat on the drums . James Montgomery at MTV compared the song to the new wave band The Cars , saying it could pass for one of their B @-@ sides .

 " Still Into You " was acclaimed by music critics , who commended the song as fun and catchy , and praised Williams ' vocals . Marc Zanotti at Music Feeds called the song " a poppy , upbeat , sugary sweet number " . Scott Heisel of Alternative Press referred to it one of the best songs on Paramore , saying " There 's no question that this is still Paramore , only it 's better . The chorus hook will stay in your brain for days at a time , ... and when you throw in the band 's newfound embracing of electronics , you find yourself with what will ideally be one of the biggest hits of 2013 . " Maura Johnston from Popdust gave the song a 5 out of 5 , declaring " If there ’ s any justice in the world this ’ ll be a song of the summer , or at least of the late spring " . Joseph R. Atilano at <unk> noted that " “ Still Into You ” is really directed to their youngest fans with its happy @-@ go @-@ lucky lyrics that are as cheerful as they can get and somewhat disarming in their simplicity " , considering it better than the previous single " Now " . 
 The song placed at number 95 on Rolling Stone magazine 's 100 Best Songs of 2013 list and number 19 on Billboard magazine 's 20 Best Songs of 2013 . Ed Masley at The Arizona Republic ranked it as the 10th best Paramore song , stating " " Still Into You " is a retro @-@ tastic hook explosion that somehow peaked at No. 83 on Billboard 's Hot 100 .

 The video was directed by Isaac <unk> .

" Taylor York adds " A lot of people would hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still being in love , but what was so appealing about Isaac 's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ... He had so many ideas , and it definitely jumped out at us . " 
 The official music video for " Still Into You " premiered on April 8 , 2013 on Fueled by Ramen 's YouTube channel .

 = Peter Jones ( missionary ) = 
 Peter Jones ( January 1 , 1802 – June 29 , 1856 ) was an Ojibwa Methodist minister , translator , chief and author from Burlington Heights , Upper Canada . His Ojibwa name was Kahkewāquonāby ( <unk> in the Fiero spelling ) , which means " [ Sacred ] Waving Feathers " . In Mohawk , he was called <unk> , meaning " he stands people on their feet " . In his youth his band of Mississaugas had been on the verge of destruction . As a preacher and a chieftain , as a role model and as a liaison to governments , his leadership helped his people survive contact with Europeans . 
 Jones was raised by his mother Tuhbenahneequay in the traditional culture and religion of the Mississauga Ojibwas until the age of 14 . After that , he went to live with his father Augustus Jones , a Welsh @-@ born United Empire Loyalist . There he learnt the customs and language of the white Christian settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm . Jones converted to Methodism at age 21 after attending a camp @-@ meeting with his half sister . Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher . As a bilingual and bicultural preacher , he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada , both by translating hymns and biblical texts in Ojibwe and Mohawk and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English . Beyond his preaching to the Indians of Upper Canada , he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists , and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches . Jones drew audiences of thousands , filling many of the buildings he spoke in , but came to resent the role , believing the audiences came to see Kahkewāquonāby , the exotic Indian , not Peter Jones , the good Christian he had worked so hard to become . 
 Jones was also a political leader . In 1825 , he wrote to the Indian Department ; his letter was the first the department had ever received from an Indian . This brought him into contact with Superintendent of the Indian Department James Givins and influential Bishop John Strachan , with whom he arranged the funding and support of the Credit Mission . There he lived and worked as a preacher and community leader , leading the conversion of Mississaugas to a European lifestyle of agriculture and Christianity , which enabled them to compete with the white settlers of Upper Canada . He was elected a chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission in 1829 and acted as a spokesman for the band when petitioning the colonial government and its departments . During his British tours , he had audiences with King William IV and Queen Victoria , directly petitioning the latter on the issue of title deeds for the Mississaugas of Upper Canada . During his life , Jones did manage to obtain some concessions from various provincial governments , such as having control over the trust funds for the Mississaugas of Credit turned over to their chiefs , but he was never able to secure title deeds for the Credit settlement . In 1847 , Jones led the band to relocate to New Credit on land donated by the Six Nations , who were able to furnish the Mississaugas with title deeds . The Mississaugas of New Credit have since been able to retain title to the land , where they remain . Jones ' health had been declining for several years before the move to New Credit , and he was unable to accompany them to an unconstructed settlement , retiring to a nearby estate outside of Brantford , Canada West , where he died in the summer of 1856 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Raised by his mother = = = 
 Jones was born on January 1 , 1802 in Burlington Heights , Upper Canada . His father was Augustus Jones , an American born surveyor of Welsh descent . His mother was Tuhbenahneequay , a Mississauga woman whose band inhabited the area . His father worked as a surveyor in the land the British planned to settle on ; as was common among the European men who worked far from European settlements , he adopted the Indian custom of polygamy . While at his Stoney Creek farm he lived with his legal wife , a Mohawk woman named Sarah <unk> , and while away surveying he lived with Tuhbenahneequay . While both the Mississaugas and Mohawks approved of polygamy , the white Christian settlers did not , and Augustus Jones ended his relationship with Tuhbenahneequay in 1802 . Peter and his elder brother John were raised by Tuhbenahneequay in the Midewiwin religion , customs and lifestyle of their Mississauga ancestors , and learned to hunt and fish to support themselves . 
 He was named Kahkewāquonāby by his maternal grandfather , Chief Wahbanosay , during a dedicated feast . A son of Wahbanosay 's who had died at age seven had been given the same name . The name translates into English as " [ sacred ] waving feathers " and denotes feathers plucked from the eagle , which was sacred to the Mississaugas . This put him under the guardianship of the Mississauga 's <unk> ( thunderbird ) <unk> , as the eagle represented this <unk> . His mother was of the Eagle totem and the name belonged to that totem . At the feast Kahkewāquonāby was given a club to denote the power of the thunder spirit , and a bunch of eagle feathers to denote its flight . 
 Around 1811 , Jones was adopted by Captain Jim , a Mississauga chief . Captain Jim 's own son , also named Kahkewāquonāby , had died , and he petitioned Tuhbenahneequay to adopt Jones . Tuhbenahneequay approved the adoption , and Jones was sent to the Credit River to live with Captain Jim as one of his own children . During a long episode of drunken frolicking by all the adult Indians in Captain Jim 's band , hunger and exposure to the cold crippled Jones , making him unable to stand . After two or three months of this , his mother received news of Jones ' condition , and travelled to the Credit River with her relative <unk> ( <unk> , " <unk> " ) . The two women carried Jones back to Stoney Creek , where he resumed living with his mother . His lameness subsided with time . 
 During the War of 1812 , Jones ' band of Mississaugas experienced a share of the War 's hardship . Jones ' grandmother <unk> , old and crippled , had been left behind by the band when it was forced to flee the soldiers advancing on York . She was never seen again . The band lost the warrior White John to the fighting , and several more were injured . Although Jones was too young to act as a warrior , he and his brother John visited the site of the Battle of Stoney Creek the day after the fighting , viewing the effects of battle firsthand . The land the band hunted and fished upon was beset with an influx of Indian refugees exceeding in number the population of the band . Jones went on his first vision quest about this time ; his lack of visions caused him to question his faith in the Mississauga 's religion . His faith was also troubled by the death of chief <unk> ( <unk> @-@ bine , " Golden Eagle [ -like Partridge ] " ) . Golden Eagle was a respected elder of the band , who experienced a vision promising spirits would make him invincible to arrows and bullet . To renew the declining faith of his people , some of whom had begun to adopt the lifestyle of the white settlers , Golden Eagle arranged a demonstration of his spirit @-@ granted invulnerability . He was killed attempting to catch a bullet with a tin pot . Jones witnessed the event . 
 = = = Raised by his father = = = 
 In 1816 , known as the Year Without a Summer , severe climate abnormalities caused an abysmal harvest , and the Mississauga band at the head of Lake Ontario was disintegrating . In the preceding twenty years community leaders Head Chief Wabakinine , band spokesman Golden Eagle and Jones ' grandfather Wahbanosay had died , and no new leaders had effectively assumed their roles . Alcoholism among the band members was rising . Many members had abandoned the band , travelling west to the Thames River valley or Grand River valley which were more isolated from white settlers . 
 Augustus Jones had learned of the band 's troubles and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John to live with him at his farm in Saltfleet Township , with their stepmother and <unk> . As he knew only a few words of English , Peter was enrolled in a one @-@ room school in Stoney Creek . With the help of the local teacher , George Hughes , Peter learned English . The next year , the family moved to Brantford , where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming . Sarah <unk> 's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford . Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name " <unk> " , meaning " he stands people on their feet " . Jones was baptised Anglican by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820 , but internally he did not accept Christianity . Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father , his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion , the conduct of the white Christian settlers " drunk , quarreling , fighting and cheating the poor Indians , and acting as if there was no God " convinced him there could be no truth in their religion . He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada , with all the privileges it entailed . Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised , Jones expected it to have no effect upon him . Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822 , when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother @-@ in @-@ law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling . He attended school in Fairchild 's Creek during the winter of 1822 – 3 studying arithmetic and writing , hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the fur trade . In spring 1823 , Jones left the school , returning to his father 's farm that May . 
 = = Ministry = = 
 = = = Conversion = = = 
 Jones had been attracted to the Methodist faith because it advocated teetotalism and that the Indians must convert to the white settler lifestyle . In June 1823 , he attended a camp @-@ meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ancaster Township , along with his half @-@ sister Mary . The camp @-@ meeting touched Jones , who converted there to Christianity . At this time Reverend William Case saw the potential to convert the Mississauga Indians through Jones . Case soon assumed the role of a mentor to Jones as a missionary . As Jones was bilingual and bicultural , he could speak to and relate to the Mississaugas and the white Christian settlers in Upper Canada . Later that year , Reverend Alvin Torry set up a congregation centered around Jones and Chief Thomas Davis ( <unk> ) composed entirely of Indian members . The pair encouraged converted Indians to settle around Davis ' home , which acquired the name " Davis ' Hamlet " or " Davisville " . Jones and Seth Crawford taught Sunday school for the growing community , which began building a chapel in the spring of 1824 . Many of Jones ' relatives were quickly converted and moved to Davis ' Hamlet , including his mother Tuhbenahneequay , her daughter <unk> and Chief <unk> ( <unk> , " Who <unk> the Day " ) , <unk> 's husband and Jones ' uncle Joseph Sawyer ( <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> , " He who Rests Sitting upon the Sky " ) ) . Jones received his first official position in the church – <unk> – on March 1 , 1825 . In this role , he spoke at services after local preachers and assisted travelling preachers during their circuit rides . Church officials including Torry and Case recognised the need for a member fluent in Ojibwe who could translate hymns and bible passages , and present the Christian religion to the Indians in terms they could understand . Jones was put to work as a teacher at the Grand River mission . Around this time he began speaking to groups about Methodism . In 1824 , a few of his relatives came to see him speak and stayed at the Grand River mission so they could enroll their children in Jones ' day school . The Methodists of Upper Canada commissioned Jones , along with his brother John , to begin translating religious and instructive works in Ojibwe for use in the Methodists ' schools . In 1825 , over half his band had converted to Christianity , and Jones decided to devote his life to missionary work . 
 = = = Credit mission = = = 
 In 1825 , Jones wrote a letter to Indian Agent James Givins regarding the year 's delivery of gifts ( due from various land purchases ) to the Mississaugas . The letter was the first Givins had received that had been written by an Indian . Givins arranged a meeting with Jones during the second week of July . Jones arrived at the Humber River at the prescribed time , leading the approximately 50 Christian Indians , and his former adoptive father Captain Jim arrived leading the approximately 150 non @-@ Christian Indians . At this meeting , a further 50 of the approximately 200 Indians of Jones ' band were converted . Givins was accompanied by several members of Upper Canada 's aristocracy , including Bishop John Strachan . The Christian dress and style of Jones ' band of converts , including their singing of hymns , which had been translated into Ojibwe by Jones , created a favourable impression of the group with Strachan and the other political leaders present . Although Strachan , an Anglican , had strongly denounced the Methodists , he saw in Jones the opportunity to Christianize the Indians of Upper Canada . He hoped to convert Jones ( and thereby his followers ) to Anglicanism later . The Crown had previously agreed to build a village on the Credit River for the Mississaugas in 1820 , but nothing had been done . Strachan told Jones he would make good on this agreement , and after a short meeting , all of the Christian Indians agreed to accept it . Construction of the settlement , called the Credit Mission , was soon underway and Jones moved there in 1826 . By the summer of 1826 , with construction of the settlement well under way , the rest of the band had joined the Methodist church and settled at the Credit Mission . Among the last holdouts was Jones ' former adoptive father , Captain Jim , and his family . At about this time Methodist Reverend Egerton Ryerson was assigned to the Credit Mission , and Jones quickly struck up a friendship with him . Ryerson 's work at the camp freed Jones to begin taking lengthy missionary expeditions to other parts of Upper Canada . During the period 1825 – 27 , Jones undertook missionary missions to Quinte , <unk> , Rice Lake and Lake Simcoe . He preached in the native language , a key factor to helping the Indians understand and accept Christianity ; small groups of Indians in these areas soon converted to Christianity . 
 Jones ' knowledge of English and ties to prominent settlers allowed him act as a spokesperson for the band . In 1825 , he and his brother John had travelled to York to petition the government to end salmon fishing on the Credit river by European settlers ; the petition would be granted in 1829 . In 1826 , they were back when the Indian Department failed to pay the full annuity due the band from an 1818 land concession , as the band had received only £ 472 of the £ 522 the treaty specified . In the settlement , Jones also worked to teach the residents farming practices , which few knew . Jones believed that the acceptance of Christianity by his people , and their conversion to an agricultural lifestyle , would be critical to their survival . By 1827 , each family had a 0 @.@ 25 @-@ acre ( 1 @,@ 000 m2 ) plot of their own , and a 30 @-@ acre ( 120 @,@ 000 m2 ) communal plot was farmed . The success of the settlement , and his success converting Indians to Christianity , gave Jones a good reputation in Upper Canada . His sermons while travelling were well attended , and various groups donated money and goods , such as a heating stove for the schoolhouse and a plough for the band . In 1827 , Jones was granted a trial preaching license as an itinerant preacher . By 1828 , the Methodists ' practice of <unk> had made significant inroads with the Mississaugas ; at the annual distribution of presents from the King in 1828 , Jones reported seeing a single Indian drunk , while drunkenness had been widespread at the annual distribution as recently as 1826 . 
 In January 1828 , Bishop Strachan approached Jones and his brother John , offering to pay them more as Anglican missionaries than the Methodists could afford to , but both brothers declined the offer . At the same time , Strachan and various government officers applied pressure to the Indian communities to abandon Methodism for Anglicanism , refusing to assist the Rice Lake Indians with the construction of a settlement as they had done with the Credit and Bay of Quinte missions , even though the Rice Lake Indians offered to fund the construction from their land surrender annuities . Tension remained between the Upper Canada government and the province 's Indians , including the Jones brothers in particular , over their religious affiliation until Lieutenant Governor Peregrine was replaced in late 1828 with Sir John Colborne . Colborne looked far more favourably on the Methodists , but still hoped to replace the influence of American Methodists with British Wesleyans . 
 = = = Election as Chief = = = 
 In 1829 , the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission elected Jones one of their three chiefs , replacing the recently deceased John Cameron . His election was influenced by his mastery of English ; he was one of the few members of the band who could deal with missionaries and the provincial government . Jones continued his missionary work to other Indian bands of Upper Canada , converting many of the Mississaugas at Rice Lake and at the Muncey Mission , as well as Ojibwas around Lake Simcoe and the eastern shore of Lake Huron . Along with his brother John , Jones began translating the Bible into Ojibwa . 
 = = = First British tour = = = 
 Also in 1829 , Jones embarked on a tour of the northern United States with Reverend William Case and several Indian converts to raise money for the Methodist missions in Upper Canada . The tour raised £ 600 , thirty percent of the Methodist Church 's annual expenditures across British North America . After his return to Upper Canada , the year 's annual Methodist conference named Jones " A Missionary to the Indian Tribes " on Case 's urging . The 1830 conference gave him the same appointment . He was also ordained as a deacon then . Upper Canada 's Methodists were in desperate need of money by 1831 ; that spring the church had been unable to pay all the salaries owed . To raise money for the church , Jones travelled with George Ryerson to the United Kingdom that spring where he gave more than sixty sermons and one hundred speeches which raised more than £ 1000 . These sermons were also held with Jones in Indian attire , which combined with his Indian name created curiosity and filled the halls , with four or five thousand attendees at his sermon for the London Missionary Society 's anniversary . Jones met with a number of prominent Englishmen , including James Cowles Prichard , who treated him when he fell ill in June 1831 , as well as Methodist leaders such as Adam Clarke , Hannah More and Richard Watson . This tour created significant public interest , and Jones met with King William IV on April 5 , 1832 , shortly before his return to Upper Canada . 
 During this tour , he met Eliza Field , to whom he proposed . She accepted , and Jones returned to Upper Canada in the spring of 1832 . Field came to North America in 1833 , arriving in New York City , where the pair married on September 8 , 1833 . Field had spent the intervening time learning domestic skills such as cooking and knitting to prepare for her new life . She came from a wealthy family and had previously been attended by servants . Field came to Upper Canada and worked along Jones in his ministry work and as a teacher in the Credit River settlement , instructing the Indian girls in sewing and other domestic skills . The Mississaugas of the Credit Mission dubbed Eliza " <unk> " ( Gichi @-@ <unk> , " the lady from beyond the [ blue ] waters " / " woman from across the great shore " ) . 
 = = = Wesleyan politics = = = 
 Jones ' translation of the Gospel of Matthew was published in 1832 , and around the same time he served as an editor for his brother John 's translation of the Gospel of John . Jones was ordained a minister on October 6 , 1833 by Reverend George Marsden in York , Upper Canada . He was the first Ojibwa to be ordained as a Methodist preacher . The same year , the Canadian Methodists had unified their church with the British Wesleyans . The combined church was now run by the British , and Jones was passed over for positions within the church in favour of less qualified individuals , and his influence lessened . When the position of head of the Canadian Indian missionaries came open , it was filled by a British Wesleyan with no experience with Indians , Reverend Joseph Stinson . William Case was given the second in command position , with special attention towards translating scriptures into Ojibwe . Case spoke no Ojibwe . Case , whom Jones had seen as a mentor , made his headquarters at the Credit Mission . Jones began to chaff in the church , as he was being given little responsibilities and the church showed no confidence in his abilities . Case told Methodist minister James Evans to begin translating hymns and books of the Bible into Ojibwe , including those Jones had already translated . After the death of Augustus Jones in November 1836 , Peter invited his stepmother and two youngest brothers to live at the Credit mission . 
 = = = Second British tour = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1830s , Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head devised a plan to relocate the Ojibwa of the Credit River , along with other Indian bands of southern Upper Canada , to Manitoulin Island . Bond Head believed that the Indians needed to be removed completely from the influence of the white settlers of Upper Canada . Jones , allied with Sir Augustus Frederick D ’ Este and Dr Thomas Hodgkin of the Aborigines ' Protection Society in Britain , opposed the move . They knew the poor soil of Manitoulin Island would force the Indian Bands to abandon farming and return to a hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle . After the surrender of the Saugeen tract , protected by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , Jones became convinced the only way to end the perpetual threat of relocation of the Mississaugas was to obtain title deeds to their lands . Jones travelled to England in 1837 to petition the Colonial Office directly on the issue . He was accompanied by his wife and their niece Catherine <unk> . The Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg postponed meeting with Jones until the spring of 1838 , as he was occupied with the Rebellions of 1837 . In the meantime , Glenelg refused to approve Bond Head 's proposal . Jones spent the intervening time touring England , preaching , giving speeches and fundraising for the Canadian Methodists . Although Bond Head had sent a letter to Glenelg to discredit Jones , the Minister met with Jones in the spring of 1838 . The meeting went very well for Jones , as Glenelg promised to help secure title deeds for the Mississaugas . Glenelg also arranged an audience with Queen Victoria for Jones . Jones met with her in September of that year , and presented a petition to Queen Victoria from the chiefs of the Mississauga Ojibwa community asking for title deeds to their lands , to ensure the Credit Mississaugas would never lose the title to their lands . The petition was written in the Latin script , signed by the chiefs in pictographs and accompanied by wampum supplementing the information of the petition . Jones , dressed in his Ojibwa costume , presented the petition and interpreted it for Victoria , to ensure accurate and favourable reception . Victoria approved her minister 's recommendation that the Mississaugas be given title deeds . He returned to Upper Canada shortly thereafter . 
 = = = Fractured community = = = 
 In Upper Canada , he returned to a community that had begun to question his leadership . William and Lawrence <unk> led a group within the community that opposed Jones ' influence , claiming it was turning the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission into " Brown Englishmen " . The brothers , while Christians , objected to the harsh discipline imposed on the young , the use of voting rather than consensus to govern and the loss of Indian lifestyle and culture . By 1840 , the settlement was very strained ; pressure from white settlers , scarcity of wood and the uncertainty of whether the band had claims to the land they occupied forced the band council to begin considering relocation . 1840 also saw the Methodist church split into two factions , Canadian Methodists and British Wesleyans . Various Indian bands aligned with either church , and competition hampered missionary work . Of Jones ' friends within the church , only Egerton Ryerson remained in the Canadian conference . With the background of these conflicts in the Credit Settlement , it became increasingly difficult for Jones to travel . Jones influence with the provincial government remained small . Although the Mississaugas of the Credit had been promised title deeds , Jones ' meeting with Lieutenant Governor George Arthur failed to produce them . Indian Agent Samuel Jarvis , appointed in 1837 , ignored the Mississaugas , failing to issue them the annual reports on their trust funds and failing to respond to letters . The strain of these community splits , combined with Jones ' responsibilities as a father after the birth of his first son , Charles Augustus ( <unk> ( <unk> , " The Round World " ) ) in April 1839 , prevented Jones from undertaking many proselytizing tours . As Eliza had previously had two miscarriages and two stillbirths , the couple took great care in raising Charles . 
 Jones was assigned to the Muncey Mission in 1841 . Located south @-@ west of London , the mission proselytized to Indians of three different tribes ; Ojibwa , Munsee Delaware , and Oneida . Jones had hoped to relocate the Mississaugas of Credit here if they failed to obtain title deeds for New Credit , but this plan was opposed by Indian Agent Samuel Jarvis . At the Muncey Mission , each tribe spoke a different language , which made the work challenging for Jones , as did the large contingent of non @-@ Christian Indians . Here two more children were born to the couple , John Frederick ( <unk> ( <unk> , " Have a [ White <unk> ] Flower " ) ) and Peter Edmund ( Kahkewaquonaby ( <unk> , " [ Sacred ] Waving Feathers " ) ) . John was named for Peter 's brother John and Eliza 's brother Frederick , Peter for Peter himself and Eliza 's brother Edmund . The work at Muncey Mission was stressful on Jones , and his health began to deteriorate . The 1844 Methodist conference found him in such ill health that he was declared a supernumerary . The same year , Jarvis was dismissed as chief superintendent of the Indian Agents . With Jarvis removed from office , Jones was able to secure an audience with lieutenant governor Charles Metcalfe . Metcalfe was favourably impressed with Jones ; he made available funds to build two schools at the Muncey Mission ( a boy 's school and a girl 's school ) and turned over administration of the Credit Mississaugas ' finances to their chiefs , making them the first Indian Band in Canada to have control over their trust funds . 
 = = = Third British tour = = = 
 Jones travelled to Great Britain in 1845 for a third fundraising tour , giving speeches and sermons . Wherever he travelled , Jones drew huge crowds , but inwardly he was depressed . He felt the crowds were only there to see the exotic Indian Kahkewāquonāby and his native costume , and did not appreciate all the work he had put into becoming a good Christian . Despite his misgivings about the trip , he raised £ 1000 , about two thirds of that total in Scotland , and one third in England . On August 4 , 1845 in Edinburgh Jones was photographed by Robert Adamson and David Octavius Hill . These were the first photographs taken of a North American Indian . 
 Jones ' health continued to decline , and he travelled to Paris to meet with Dr. Achille @-@ Louis <unk> . <unk> examined Jones , but did not prescribe any medicine , instead suggesting cold water sponge baths . With this advice but no effective treatment , Jones returned to England to complete his fundraising tour . Jones returned to Canada West in April 1846 . 
 = = = Mississaugas obtain title deeds = = = 
 Returning to the Credit Mission , Jones believed the most pressing issue for the Mississaugas was their lack of a clear title to their land . The settlement had established successful farms , and was almost self @-@ sufficient . It was also developing industry , with a pair of carpenters and a shoemaker . The Credit Mission Mississaugas had also funded the construction of a pair of piers at the mouth of the Credit River , the beginning of Port Credit . Although the settlement was prospering , Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson pressured to band to move off the Credit Mission to a different location , hoping to group Indians into larger settlements where schools could be reasonably established and funded . As an inducement to motivate the Mississaugas to move , he promised them the title deeds which were Jones ' main goal for the band . The Saugeen Ojibwa invited the Credit Mississaugas to move to the Bruce Peninsula , which was the last large piece of <unk> land in southern Ontario . The Credit Mississaugas believed this to be their best chance to obtain deeds to land , and so the band prepared for a move . They turned the Credit lands over to the province in trust , but the first survey of the Bruce returned with terrible news : The soil of the Bruce Peninsula was completely unsuitable for farming . Having already surrendered their land at the Credit Mission , the Mississaugas faced an uncertain situation . The Six Nations , hearing of the Mississaugas ' desperate situation offered a portion of their tract to the Credit Mississaugas , remembering that when the Six Nations had fled to Upper Canada the Mississaugas had donated the land the Six Nations . The Mississaugas relocated to this land along the Grand River that was donated by the Six Nations . Founded in 1847 , the settlement was named New Credit . Jones would continue in his role as a community leader here , petitioning various branches of government for funding to build the settlement . In 1848 , the Wesleyans and Methodists reconciled , and William Ryerson established a mission in New Credit . 
 Through the 1840s , Jones ' health had been in decline . By the time the Mississaugas moved to New Credit , Jones was too ill to move to an unbuilt settlement . Having to abandon the Credit Mission , he returned to <unk> with his family . Jones resigned his position in the Methodist church , but continued to undertake work here and there as his health permitted . By 1850 , his doctor had ordered him to completely stop travelling and performing his clerical duties , but Jones ignored his advice . In 1851 , Jones moved to a new estate near Echo Place , which he dubbed Echo Villa . The estate was close to the established town of Brantford , but also allowed him to be close to New Credit . Although he continued to work , his failing health kept him at home often , and he began pursuing more domestic activities . Taking up woodcarving , he won £ 15 for his bowl and ladle at the annual provincial exhibition . He began writing for the Aborigines Protection Society , acting as their Canadian correspondent for their publication The Colonial Intelligencer ; or , Aborigines ' Friend . In the 1850s , Peter began to devote his time and efforts more to his wife and children . His son Charles attended Genesee College in Lima , New York , then studied law . Jones continued travelling when his health permitted . In 1851 , to Lake of Two Mountains in Canada East ; in 1852 , through Northern Ontario ; in 1853 , he travelled to New York City for a missionary meeting ; and in 1854 , he travelled to Syracuse , New York for a Methodist convention . 
 The New Credit settlement met with early difficulties , but soon began to prosper . An early sawmill was destroyed by arson in 1851 , but a new one was soon in operation . White squatters were driven off the land by about 1855 , although theft of logs remained a problem for several years afterwards . 
 Jones was struck by illness in December 1855 during a wagon ride home from New Credit to Echo Villa . Unable to shake the illness , Jones died in his home on June 29 , 1856 . He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Brantford . His wife Eliza supervised the publication of his books after his death . Life and Journals was published in 1860 and History of the Ojebway Indians in 1861 . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 In 1857 , a monument was erected in Jones ' honour at New Credit , inscribed " Erected by the <unk> and other Indian tribes to their revered and beloved Chief Kahkewaquonaby ( the Rev. Peter Jones ) . " 
 At the church in New Credit , built in 1852 , an inscribed marble tablet reads :

 In 1997 , Jones was declared a " Person of National Historic Significance " by the Minister of Canadian Heritage Andy Mitchell . To honour Jones and to underscore his role in helping the Mississaugas survive contact with the Europeans , a celebration of his recognition was held at New Credit . As well , the Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board erected an historic plaque detailing Jones ' life . The location of the plaque is Echo Villa , the estate where Jones lived from 1851 until his death in 1856 .

 = Sacrifice ( video game ) = 
 Sacrifice is a real @-@ time strategy video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform . Developed by Shiny Entertainment the game features elements of action and other genres . Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures . The game was ported to Mac OS 9 @.@ 2 in 2001 . 
 Unlike many of its contemporary real @-@ time strategy games , Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management . There is no system of workers ; the players ' wizards collect souls to summon creatures , and their mana — energy for casting spells — constantly regenerates . Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods . To defeat an opponent , the player 's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard 's altar , thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard . Aside from a single @-@ player campaign , Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode , in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks . 
 Sacrifice was created by a small team of developers ; most of the work was done by four key personnel . The graphic engine of the game uses <unk> : thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed , the number of polygons is reduced . By adjusting the required level of detail , Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics . Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors , such as Tim Curry , and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei . Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content . The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw . Despite winning several awards , Sacrifice was not a commercial success , and no sequels are planned . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Published in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform ( and in the following year for Mac OS 9 @.@ 2 ) , Sacrifice is a real @-@ time strategy video game that incorporates elements of the action genre . Players control wizards , looking over their characters from behind . Each match starts the player with a wizard and an altar . Using the keyboard and mouse , players move their wizards around a virtual world , directing armies and casting spells to eliminate their opponents . A player 's wizard defeats an opponent by desecrating his or her altar through the magical " sacrifice " of a friendly unit . 
 Wizards can cast spells that harm opponents ( combat spells ) , heal damage taken , or summon creatures . More advanced combat spells affect large areas of the battlefield , taking the form of tornadoes and volcanoes . Casting spells requires energy , which the game represents in the form of mana . Recovery of mana is slow , but a wizard accelerates the process by staying close to his or her altar . Close proximity to one of several fountains of mana scattered across the world increases his or her recovery rate as well . A wizard can monopolize a mana fountain by erecting a structure known as a <unk> over it . Because mana can always be regained , it is an infinite resource . Souls are the other type of resource in this game ; they are used , along with mana , to summon creatures , who form the mainstay of the players ' offensive capability . Unlike mana , souls are limited in quantity . Players start with a few souls and increase their resources by locating unclaimed souls , or by converting the souls of unfriendly creatures their wizards have killed . 
 Summoned creatures are mainly classified into three classes : melee , ranged , and air ( flyers ) . In a rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors manner , each class is a counter to another . Melee creatures inflict more damage to their ranged opponents , but cannot retaliate against flyers , which in turn are vulnerable to those who can attack at range . Several creatures also have special abilities , such as creating protective magical barriers , becoming invisible , or immobilizing their opponents . Two units , <unk> and sac doctors , have special purposes . <unk> help to recharge their summoner 's mana by channeling energy from <unk> to him or her . Sac doctors are summoned to extract the souls of fallen opponents and bring them back to the altar for conversion . These units are also summoned to hold the sacrificial rituals required for desecrating enemy altars ; killing a sac doctor disrupts the process . 
 The spells and abilities of the creatures are designed along the ethos of five gods . Persephone , the Great Healer , bestows her followers with powers of regeneration and nature . Her counterpart , <unk> , God of Strife , celebrates death and decay ; his creatures are undead and his spells drains the life of others . The other three gods — James , Stratos , and Pyro — govern natural elements , granting their followers abilities associated with earth , air , and fire , respectively . 
 Unlike other real @-@ time strategy games released in or before 2000 , Sacrifice 's gameplay is not focused on large @-@ scale management of resources and bases . Instead , the game emphasizes micromanagement of the players ' units ; success in the game is linked to meticulous control of individuals or small groups to overcome enemies . Players order their armies to assume formations by pressing an assigned key or navigating through a pop @-@ up menu . The order can also be given by moving the mouse in specific patterns without waiting for the menu to appear . 
 = = = Single @-@ player campaign = = = 
 Sacrifice 's single @-@ player campaign begins with a meeting between the protagonist Eldred and the blind seer Mithras on a war @-@ torn world . Through voiceovers and cut scenes rendered by the game engine , Eldred recounts to Mithras his background and the events that led to the world 's current state . Eldred was a tyrannical emperor who ruled over the world of Jhera . However , his days of rule were numbered : his subjects were rebelling , and his enemies gathered at the borders of his realm . Turning to the mystical arts for a solution , Eldred summoned a demon , Marduk , to eliminate opposition to his rule . Marduk proved uncontrollable and ravaged Jhera . Eldred fled to the world that he and Mithras stand on . The world — having suffered a past cataclysm — was riven into a collection of five floating islands . A god rules over each realm , seeking to impose his or her own agenda . The rivalries among the gods are aggravated by Mithras 's prophecy of a traitor amongst them . Sensing the opportunity for a new lease on life , Eldred offers his service to the gods . 
 The campaign spans ten missions . In each mission , the player chooses a god for Eldred to champion , receiving creatures and spells from that god . The player can build up a selection of units and spells from different gods by changing Eldred 's allegiance between missions ; the selections are used in later missions or multiplayer sessions . As the game progresses , the player 's choices align Eldred with one god . Aside from the stated goals in each mission , there are secret objectives that if accomplished bestow bonuses to Eldred 's attributes ( magical and physical resistance , more mana , etc . ) . 
 Midway through the campaign , Eldred encounters Marduk again . The demon taunts the wizard and announces that this world will suffer the same fate as Jhera . Eldred warns the gods ; they believe one of them supports the demon and fall upon each other to eliminate the traitor . By the last stage of the campaign , Eldred has helped one god to kill the others . After the end of the wizard 's narration , Mithras reveals himself as Marduk . Stratos , the traitor , had planned for the demon to appear on this world and deliver the prophecy to the gods . Marduk berates Eldred for his naivety and starts the final battle . After defeating the demon , the player chooses one of two endings for Eldred : stay and help the last god rule the world , or leave and seek his destiny in other worlds . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Sacrifice features the capability for players to play matches against each other over computer networks ; up to four players ( human- or computer @-@ controlled ) can participate in a multiplayer match . Four modes of play are available : Skirmish , Slaughter , Soul Harvest , and Domination . Skirmish 's gameplay is similar to that of the single @-@ player mode ; a player wins the match by banishing the others ' wizards . The winner of Domination is the wizard who controls a certain number of <unk> . The goal in Slaughter is to amass the most kills , while wizards in Soul Harvest have to collect the most souls . 
 Initially , the multiplayer games could only be played over small @-@ area networks of computers ( local area networks ) , or over the internet through an integrated matchmaking service . Later software patches added online rankings and the capability to connect computers via Internet Protocol Suite ( TCP / IP ) , allowing play over the internet without the matchmaking service . The Macintosh version 's matchmaking , handled by GameRanger , had to be installed through a patch . Multiplayer matches cannot be played between different computer platforms . 
 = = Development = = 
 Sacrifice 's development started in August 1997 . The game 's lead programmer , Martin Brownlow , was inspired by Chaos : The Battle of Wizards , which was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum computer . In the old game , players take turns to control wizards , summoning creatures and casting spells to eliminate each other . The video game industry was mostly ignorant of Sacrifice 's development , partly due to Shiny 's desire to avoid repeating the bad experience of marketing their last product Messiah . Released in March 2000 , the game was extravagantly promoted by Shiny during its development , and the resulting heavy scrutiny from the media greatly stressed the team who worked on the game . Learning from this mistake , Shiny adopted a low profile for Sacrifice ; until the last several months of its development , no one outside the company knew of the game . According to Brownlow , his team was able to concentrate on developing the game without the media or " fan base questioning every decision that gets made along the way " . 
 The bulk of the work was done by a small team . Game designer Eric <unk> , formerly of Blizzard Entertainment , recalls that there were only three other key personnel : two programmers and an animator . As more game features were developed , the team expanded . <unk> was tasked to lead four level designers , and Jon Gwyn joined Joby Otero on the art team . After the basic features of the game had been completed , James Phinney , lead designer and producer of Blizzard 's 1998 real @-@ time strategy game StarCraft , was hired to write the plot for the single @-@ player campaign . His first draft was used as the script for recording placeholder voiceovers , which helped the team to judge the atmosphere in the game . Later , Shiny employed professional actors , such as Tim Curry and Brad Garrett , and various voice artists , such as Jennifer Hale , to record the final voices for the game 's characters . Audio filters altered the voices for the gods , giving them a supernatural edge appropriate to their roles . For background music , Shiny hired Kevin Manthei , who had composed many scores for video games and big- and small @-@ screen entertainment , such as Scream 3 and Buffy the Vampire Slayer . His compositions for Sacrifice were played by an orchestra of 25 instruments . Shiny 's founder , David Perry , was so busy with the game 's development that he passed over the opportunity to create a video game for the science @-@ fiction movie The Matrix . 
 = = = Graphics = = = 
 Sacrifice 's graphics engine was developed from Messiah 's . The older game renders its characters by <unk> , using thousands of polygons to make up character models and decreasing the number of polygons when lesser details are required , such as drawing the object at a distance . A typical object in Sacrifice comprises 200 to 2 @,@ 500 polygons . Shiny expanded the technology 's application to the game 's virtual world . The environment is not decorated with grass , flowers , and rocks by overlaying two @-@ dimensional images of such objects on the terrain model . Instead , many tiny models of these terrain features litter the landscape . Objects in the game are composed of isosceles right triangles , each of which is infinitely divisible into two smaller isosceles right triangles . The array of infinite triangles derived from these divisions is stored in a binary triangle tree data structure , and the simplicity of the division and its data management algorithms frees up the graphic processor for other duties , allowing more resources to be spent on managing the level of detail . Sacrifice 's spell effects are composed of parametric surfaces , which also can be broken down into triangles , facilitating tessellation . 
 In early 2000 , the computer industry released the first video graphics cards capable of processing transform , clipping , and lighting ( T & L ) instructions . With the appropriate software , these new cards took over the burden of T & L processing from the computer 's processor , allowing more detailed graphics and smoother animation . Shiny capitalized on the breakthrough , spending a few weeks to rewrite a portion of Sacrifice 's software . Brownlow and his team refined and improved the game 's graphics , increasing the number of polygons per model and setting the software to scan through scenes a few more times to determine what objects to render and how to display them . Sacrifice was acknowledged as the first game on the market to make full use of the new graphic cards ( the GeForce 2 and Radeon series ) . Because of the adopted technology , animation in the game was smooth , without the jerkiness associated with overstressed graphical engines . 
 For the character models , Otero and his team eschewed conventional designs inspired by The Lord of the Rings and other fantasies . Otero 's ideal was that of " form follows function " , by which a creature 's capabilities or purposes are readily apparent from its appearance . In his opinion , a creature designed to kill enemies by exploding itself would simply be a " cartoon @-@ ish bomb with feet " . Otero 's simple designs were expanded and fleshed out in detail by Gwyn , who was also responsible for creating Eldred 's model . The artists ' incorporation of humor in their work did not escape the video game industry 's notice ; many pointed out the quirky allusion of James , God of Earth , to Earthworm Jim , star of Shiny 's previous games . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 By June , the major features of the game had been implemented , and Shiny proceeded to the next stage of development . It selected a thousand members of the public to participate in a beta test of Sacrifice 's multiplayer modes , receiving feedback on software bugs , performance issues , and possible improvements . The game 's publisher , Interplay Entertainment , assigned its quality assurance department to test the single @-@ player mode . Perry promoted the game by visiting professional game reviewers , such as FiringSquad , and giving copies of the beta version to them . On November 17 , 2000 , Interplay released the game for the Windows platform . Shiny packaged a level editor , <unk> , with the finished product , allowing gamers to create their own levels . The tool displays the user 's changes as they are added to the level . Users have total control over the positioning of models and scripting of events , although the tool does not provide the capability to create new spells or creatures . User @-@ created maps can be shared with other players during the connection phase of multiplayer games . 
 Earlier in the same month , Macintosh software publisher MacPlay announced that it was porting Sacrifice to the Apple computers . It took the company several months to adapt the source code to the Macintosh architecture , and on December 14 , 2001 , the Macintosh version of the game was released . It has almost the same features as the original version ; however , <unk> was excluded from the port . Another feature left out was multiplayer mode , which MacPlay added through a software patch . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Sacrifice was developed and released during a period of growth for the video games market ; the amount United States consumers spent on video games increased from US $ 3 @.@ 2 billion in 1995 to $ 6 @.@ 0 billion in 2000 . " Solid " real @-@ time strategy games could sell more than 100 @,@ 000 copies , and those that sold less than 75 @,@ 000 copies were considered commercial failures by the publishers . Many real @-@ time strategy game developers concentrated on enhancing their game 's visuals without concern for innovations in gameplay . Shiny was recognized by the industry for its unconventional games , which exhibited humorous content and unique artistic designs . When it became known that the company was developing Sacrifice as its first real @-@ time strategy game , several industry observers were keen to see whether it could deliver a quality product . 
 Initial reactions were favorable . Sacrifice 's art was a point of focus for reviewers : the fantasy creatures ' novel designs made deep impressions on the industry . The designs were so unconventional that gaming journalist Michael <unk> remarked , " It is as if Salvador Dalí and H. R. Giger got together and played around with 3D Studio Max for a few weeks with a cooler full of Bass Ale between them . " To fellow journalist Kieron Gillen , Sacrifice resembled a version of the strategy game Command and Conquer as designed by Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch . Aside from being impressed by the details in the graphics , GameSpy 's Lee <unk> found the creatures ' movements fluid and believable , remarking , " flying dragons heave their bodies through the air reminiscent of Draco in the movie Dragonheart . " Journalist Tom Chick summed up the weird experience of seeing his wizard at the head of " a troop of flapping , crawling , loping , whirling , hopping things " as the essence of " what gaming is all about . " 
 The game 's spell effects also elicited positive reactions . Next Generation magazine 's Samuel Bass called them " awe @-@ inspiring " , while it was " positively breathtaking " for Eurogamer 's John Bye to see " flaming missiles raining down on the battlefield , tornados lifting [ his ] men up into the sky , or the ground swelling up beneath [ his wizard 's ] feet " . Although such effects were implemented in other games , as Gillen pointed out , it was a vastly different experience to watch them from the first person perspective . Reviewers of FiringSquad and PC Gamer were equally overwhelmed by the stunning visual effects . Despite filling the screen with " winged , fully animated demons " and " multiple gigantic twisters spiraling gorgeously into the clouds " , Sacrifice performed smoothly on the reviewers ' machines , impressing the staff of Edge magazine . 
 Aside from the visuals , the game 's audio attracted comments . GameSpot 's staff enjoyed listening to the story unfold through the recorded voices . They found that the voice actors did not overact their roles despite the extravagant appearances of the characters . Instead , the actors ' performance conveyed an extra depth to the personalities of these characters . <unk> noted a few flaws in the game 's vocal presentation : the character models ' lip movements did not match their speech , and they had a limited number of gestures to accompany the words . Michael House of Allgame was not altogether impressed , finding the voice acting to be " spotty [ , ] ... ranging from hilarious to obnoxious . " 
 To several reviewers , Sacrifice was flawed in its handling of combat . They found that the game 's interface — which presented a viewpoint that looked over the wizard from behind — hindered them from having a clear picture of their characters ' surroundings . The game 's fast @-@ paced combat ensured that fights tended to be messy affairs , where aside from picking out their units from a chaotic mass to issue commands , players had to see to their wizards ' safety , and cast spells to support their army . Reviewers commented that once a player had lost a number of early battles , his or her army could never recover from its losses to win the match . Sacrifice 's multiplayer games , as GameSpot 's Sam Parker observed , tended to be long @-@ drawn stalemates until the wizards obtained more powerful spells . PC Zone 's Keith Pullin was disappointed that the game was not designed to reward tactics ; in his experience , he achieved victory by continually summoning groups of creatures to attack the enemy . Bass agreed that the game was lacking in tactical play , but other aspects impressed him enough to downplay this failing in his assessment . 
 The intensity and excitement generated by the frenetic gameplay pleased IGN 's Dan Adams , but Bye was so frustrated by his experience that he claimed to have suffered a massive increase in blood pressure . The game 's heavy demand for micromanagement convinced Maximum PC to name Sacrifice the " best argument for gamers [ to grow ] a third hand " , an opinion in line with Chick 's comment that the interface " [ seemed ] to have been designed for one of the game 's 13 @-@ fingered beasts " . Sacrifice 's gameplay had its supporters ; the staff at Edge , impressed with the game 's controls and visual perspective , named it one of the " few titles [ that took ] strategy into the third dimension and convincingly used the extra plane for more than a dazzling 3D makeover " . 
 No sales figures were released for Sacrifice , but several members of the video game industry acknowledged the game did not sell well . James Bell , Infogrames 's Senior Vice President of Creative Development , said that Sacrifice , although an excellent game , suffered poor sales because it was badly marketed and released at the wrong time . Another reason , offered by Gillen , for Sacrifice 's commercial failure was the small size of its development team . Based mostly on the efforts of four people , the game was built around their gaming preferences , failing to take into account the opinions of a wider variety ; hence , the game became a niche product . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 <unk> IGN with its " wonderful land full of character and imagination " , Sacrifice was the gaming site 's choice for the best strategy game of 2000 . It was honored in the same year by European Computer Trade Show as the Best PC Game of the Show . Since its release , Sacrifice has been one of PC Gamer 's Top 100 Games for at least eight consecutive years . Looking back at the history of real @-@ time strategy gaming , Geryk pointed out that Sacrifice 's " depth and originality " was unparalleled in the genre and often overlooked in favor of its graphics . The staff of gaming site UGO shared a similar opinion , naming the game in 2009 as its eighteenth top strategy game of all time . 
 Although Sacrifice was honored as a quality game , industry observers pointed out that its qualities were forgotten by most people ; the staff of GamesRadar said the game was " practically invisible to the gaming public " , and according to Gillen , few remembered Sacrifice as the pioneer of the mouse @-@ gesture control system , which was praised as revolutionary in Peter Molyneux 's later game Black & White . Gillen further lamented that Sacrifice 's release heralded the end of Shiny 's forays into creative game development , as the company switched to producing more mainstream products , such as Enter the Matrix . Despite receiving numerous calls for a sequel , Shiny said in 2002 that it would not produce one . Seven years later , GamesRadar repeated the call for a sequel while proclaiming Sacrifice " one of the most underappreciated games of all time " .

" Expressed more elaborately , it is a book containing the names and descriptions of plants , usually with information on their virtues ( properties ) – and in particular their medicinal , tonic , culinary , toxic , hallucinatory , aromatic , or magical powers , and the legends associated with them . A herbal may also classify the plants it describes , may give recipes for herbal extracts , tinctures , or potions , and sometimes include mineral and animal medicaments in addition to those obtained from plants . Herbals were often illustrated to assist plant identification . 
 Herbals were among the first literature produced in Ancient Egypt , China , India , and Europe as the medical wisdom of the day accumulated by herbalists , apothecaries and physicians . Herbals were also among the first books to be printed in both China and Europe . In Western Europe herbals flourished for two centuries following the introduction of moveable type ( c . 1470 – 1670 ) . 
 In the late 17th century , the rise of modern chemistry , toxicology and pharmacology reduced the medicinal value of the classical herbal . As reference manuals for botanical study and plant identification herbals were supplanted by Floras – systematic accounts of the plants found growing in a particular region , with scientifically accurate botanical descriptions , classification , and illustrations . Herbals have seen a modest revival in the western world since the last decades of the 20th century , as herbalism and related disciplines ( such as homeopathy and aromatherapy ) became popular forms of alternative medicine . 
 = = History = = 
 The word herbal is derived from the mediaeval Latin liber <unk> ( " book of herbs " ) : it is sometimes used in contrast to the word <unk> , which is a treatise on flowers with emphasis on their beauty and enjoyment rather than the herbal emphasis on their utility . Much of the information found in printed herbals arose out of traditional medicine and herbal knowledge that predated the invention of writing . 
 Before the advent of printing , herbals were produced as manuscripts , which could be kept as scrolls or loose sheets , or bound into codices . Early handwritten herbals were often illustrated with paintings and drawings . Like other manuscript books , herbals were " published " through repeated copying by hand , either by professional scribes or by the readers themselves . In the process of making a copy , the copyist would often translate , expand , adapt , or reorder the content . Most of the original herbals have been lost ; many have survived only as later copies ( of copies ... ) , and others are known only through references from other texts . 
 As printing became available , it was promptly used to publish herbals , the first printed matter being known as incunabula . In Europe , the first printed herbal with woodcut ( <unk> ) illustrations , the Puch der Natur of Konrad of <unk> , appeared in 1475 . Metal @-@ engraved plates were first used in about 1580 . As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers : there was therefore a large increase in the number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition . 
 As examples of some of the world 's most important records and first printed matter , researchers will find herbals scattered through the world 's most famous libraries including the Vatican Library in Rome , the Bodleian Library in Oxford , the Royal Library in Windsor , the British Library in London and the major continental libraries .

 = = = Shen Nung Pen Ts ’ ao ching of China = = = 
 China is renowned for its traditional herbal medicines that date back thousands of years . Legend has it that mythical Emperor Shennong , the founder of Chinese herbal medicine , composed the Shennong Bencao Jing or Great Herbal in about 2700 BCE as the forerunner of all later Chinese herbals . It survives as a copy made c . 500 CE and describes about 365 herbs . High quality herbals and monographs on particular plants were produced in the period to 1250 CE including : the <unk> <unk> written by Tang <unk> in 1108 , which passed through twelve editions until 1600 ; a monograph on the lychee by Cai Xiang in 1059 and one on the oranges of <unk> by Han <unk> in 1178 . In 1406 Ming dynasty prince Zhu Xiao ( <unk> ) published the <unk> Bencao illustrated herbal for famine foods . It contained high quality woodcuts and descriptions of 414 species of plants of which 276 were described for the first time , the book pre @-@ dating the first European printed book by 69 years . It was reprinted many times . Other herbals include Bencao <unk> in 1450 by Xu Yong and Bencao Gangmu of Li Shizhen in 1590 . 
 = = = Sushruta Samhita of India = = = 
 Traditional herbal medicine of India , known as Ayurveda , possibly dates back to the second millennium BCE tracing its origins to the holy Hindu Vedas and , in particular , the Atharvaveda . One authentic compilation of teachings is by the surgeon Sushruta , available in a treatise called Sushruta Samhita . This contains 184 chapters and description of 1120 illnesses , 700 medicinal plants , 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources . Other early works of Ayurveda include the Charaka Samhita , attributed to Charaka . This tradition , however is mostly oral . The earliest surviving written material which contains the works of Sushruta is the Bower Manuscript — dated to the 4th century CE . 
 = = = Hernandez – Rerum <unk> and the Aztecs = = = 
 An illustrated herbal published in Mexico in 1552 , Libellus de <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Book of Medicinal Herbs of the Indies " ) , is written in the Aztec <unk> language by a native physician , Martín Cruz . This is probably an extremely early account of the medicine of the Aztecs although the formal illustrations , resembling European ones , suggest that the artists were following the traditions of their Spanish masters rather than an indigenous style of drawing . In 1570 Francisco Hernández ( <unk> – 1580 ) was sent from Spain to study the natural resources of New Spain ( now Mexico ) . Here he drew on indigenous sources , including the extensive botanical gardens that had been established by the Aztecs , to record c . 1200 plants in his Rerum <unk> of 1615 . Nicolás Monardes ’ Dos Libros ( 1569 ) contains the first published illustration of tobacco . 
 = = Egypt , Mesopotamia , Greece and Rome = = 
 By about 2000 BCE , medical papyri in ancient Egypt included medical prescriptions based on plant matter and made reference to the herbalist 's combination of medicines and magic for healing . 
 = = = Papyrus Ebers = = = 
 The ancient Egyptian Papyrus Ebers is one of the earliest known herbals ; it dates to 1550 BCE and is based on sources , now lost , dating back a further 500 to 2000 years . The earliest Sumerian herbal dates from about 2500 BCE as a copied manuscript of the 7th century BCE . Inscribed Assyrian tablets dated 668 – 626 BCE list about 250 vegetable drugs : the tablets include herbal plant names that are still in use today including : saffron , cumin , turmeric and sesame . 
 The ancient Greeks gleaned much of their medicinal knowledge from Egypt and Mesopotamia . Hippocrates ( 460 – 377 BCE ) , the " father of medicine " ( renowned for the eponymous Hippocratic oath ) , used about 400 drugs , most being of plant origin . However , the first Greek herbal of any note was written by Diocles of Carystus in the fourth century BC — although nothing remains of this except its mention in the written record . It was Aristotle ’ s pupil Theophrastus ( 371 – 287 BCE ) in his Historia Plantarum , ( better known as the Enquiry into Plants ) and De <unk> Plantarum ( On the Causes of Plants ) that established the scientific method of careful and critical observation associated with modern botanical science . Based largely on Aristotle ’ s notes , the Ninth Book of his Enquiry deals specifically with medicinal herbs and their uses including the recommendations of herbalists and <unk> of the day , and his plant descriptions often included their natural habitat and geographic distribution . With the formation of the Alexandrian School c . 330 BCE medicine flourished and written herbals of this period included those of the physicians Herophilus , <unk> , Andreas of Karystos , <unk> <unk> , and Nicander . The work of <unk> ( the <unk> were the doctors of the day , berated by Theophrastus for their superstition ) <unk> ( fl . 110 BCE ) is of special note because he initiated the tradition of the illustrated herbal in the first century BCE . 
 = = = Dioscorides – De Materia Medica = = = 
 The De Materia Medica ( c . 40 – 90 CE ; Greek , <unk> <unk> <unk> " Peri <unk> <unk> " , ' On medical materials ' ) of <unk> Dioscorides , a physician in the Roman army , was produced in about 65 CE . It was the single greatest classical authority on the subject and the most influential herbal ever written , serving as a model for herbals and pharmacopoeias , both oriental and occidental , for the next 1000 years up to the Renaissance . It drew together much of the accumulated herbal knowledge of the time , including some 500 medicinal plants . The original has been lost but a lavishly illustrated Byzantine copy known as the Vienna <unk> dating from about 512 CE remains . 
 = = = Pliny – Naturalis Historia = = = 
 Pliny the Elder 's ( 23 – 79 CE ) encyclopaedic Naturalis Historia ( c . 77 – 79 CE ) is a synthesis of the information contained in about 2000 scrolls and it includes myths and folklore ; there are about 200 extant copies of this work . It comprises 37 books of which sixteen ( Books 12 – 27 ) are devoted to trees , plants and medicaments and , of these , seven describe medicinal plants . In medieval herbals , along with De Materia Medica it is Pliny 's work that is the most frequently mentioned of the classical texts , even though the work De <unk> of Galen ( 131 – 201 CE ) is more detailed and notable . Another Latin translation of Greek works that was widely copied in the Middle Ages , probably illustrated in the original , was that attributed to Apuleius and this also contained the alternative names for particular plants given in several languages . It dates to about 400 CE and a surviving copy dates to about 600 CE . 
 = = The Middle Ages and Arab World = = 
 During the 600 years of the European Middle Ages from 600 to 1200 , the tradition of herbal lore fell to the monasteries . Many of the monks were skilled at producing books and manuscripts and tending both medicinal gardens and the sick , but written works of this period simply emulated those of the classical era . 
 Meanwhile , in the Arab world , by 900 the great Greek herbals had been translated and copies lodged in centres of learning in the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium , Damascus , Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient . In the medieval Islamic world , Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to the knowledge of herbal medicines . Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior ( <unk> , 777 – 857 ) who , in his Opera <unk> , synthesised the knowledge of Greeks , Persians , Arabs , Indians and Babylonians , this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna ( Ibn Sina , 980 – 1037 ) . Avicenna ’ s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West . During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived . 
 = = = Albertus Magnus – De <unk> = = = 
 In the thirteenth century , scientific inquiry was returning and this was manifest through the production of encyclopaedias ; those noted for their plant content included a seven volume treatise by Albertus Magnus ( c . 1193 – 1280 ) a <unk> educated at the University of Padua and tutor to St Thomas Aquinas . It was called De <unk> ( c . 1256 AD ) and even though based on original observations and plant descriptions it bore a close resemblance to the earlier Greek , Roman and Arabic herbals . Other accounts of the period include De Proprietatibus Rerum ( c . 1230 – 1240 ) of English Franciscan monk <unk> Anglicus and a group of herbals called Tractatus de <unk> written and pained between 1280 and 1300 by Matthaeus <unk> at the East @-@ West cultural centre of Salerno Spain , the illustrations showing the fine detail of true botanical illustration . 
 = = Western Europe = = 
 Perhaps the best known herbals were produced in Europe between 1470 and 1670 . The invention in Germany of printing from movable type in a printing press c . 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism . The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described . 
 Three important herbals , all appearing before 1500 , were printed in Mainz , Germany . Two of these were by Peter Schoeffer , his Latin Herbarius in 1484 , followed by an updated and enlarged German version in 1485 , these being followed in 1491 by the Hortus <unk> printed by Jacob <unk> . Other early printed herbals include the Kreuterbuch of Hieronymus Tragus from Germany in 1539 and , in England , the New Herball of William Turner in 1551 were arranged , like the classical herbals , either alphabetically , according to their medicinal properties , or as " herbs , shrubs , trees " . Arrangement of plants in later herbals such as <unk> of Dodoens and John Gerard ’ s Herball of 1597 became more related to their physical similarities and this heralded the beginnings of scientific classification . By 1640 a herbal had been printed that included about 3800 plants – nearly all the plants of the day that were known . 
 In the Modern Age and Renaissance , European herbals diversified and innovated , and came to rely more on direct observation than being mere adaptations of traditional models . Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes by Leonhart Fuchs ( 1542 , with over 400 plants ) , the astrologically themed Complete Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper ( 1653 ) , and the Curious Herbal by Elizabeth Blackwell ( 1737 ) . 
 = = = Anglo @-@ Saxon herbals = = = 
 Anglo @-@ Saxon plant knowledge and gardening skills ( the garden was called a <unk> , literally , herb @-@ yard ) appears to have exceeded that on the continent . Our limited knowledge of Anglo @-@ Saxon plant vernacular comes primarily from manuscripts that include : the <unk> of Bald and the <unk> . The <unk> of Bald ( Bald was probably a friend of King Alfred of England ) was painstakingly produced by the scribe Cild in about 900 – 950 CE . This was written in the vernacular ( native ) tongue and not derived from Greek texts . The oldest illustrated herbal from Saxon times is a translation of the Latin Herbarius <unk> <unk> , one of the most popular medical works of medieval times , the original dating from the fifth century ; this Saxon translation was produced about 1000 – 1050 CE and is housed in the British Library . Another vernacular herbal was the Buch der <unk> or " Book of Nature " by Konrad von <unk> ( 1309 – 1374 ) which contains the first two botanical woodcuts ever made ; it is also the first work of its kind in the vernacular . 
 = = = Anglo @-@ Norman herbals = = = 
 In the 12th and early 13th centuries , under the influence of the Norman conquest , the herbals produced in Britain fell less under the influence of France and Germany and more that of Sicily and the Near East . This showed itself through the Byzantine @-@ influenced Romanesque framed illustrations . Anglo @-@ Saxon herbals in the vernacular were replaced by herbals in Latin including <unk> Herbal , De Viribus Herbarum ( largely derived from Pliny ) , with the English translation completed in about 1373 . 
 = = = Fifteenth @-@ century incunabula = = = 
 The earliest printed books and broadsheets are known as incunabula . The first printed herbal appeared in 1469 , a version of Pliny 's Historia Naturalis ; it was published nine years before Dioscorides De Materia Medica was set in type . Important incunabula include the encyclopaedic De Proprietatibus Rerum of Franciscan monk Bartholomew Anglicus ( c . 1203 – 1272 ) which , as a manuscript , had first appeared between 1248 and 1260 in at least six languages and after being first printed in 1470 ran to 25 editions . Assyrian physician Mesue ( 926 – 1016 ) wrote the popular De <unk> , <unk> and Liber <unk> <unk> the first of his printings being in 1471 . These were followed , in Italy , by the Herbarium of Apuleius <unk> and three German works published in Mainz , the Latin Herbarius ( 1484 ) , the first herbal published in Germany , German Herbarius ( 1485 ) , the latter evolving into the Ortus <unk> ( 1491 ) . To these can be added Macer ’ s De <unk> Herbarum , based on Pliny 's work ; the 1477 edition is one of the first printed and illustrated herbals . 
 = = = Fifteenth @-@ century manuscripts = = = 
 In medieval times , medicinal herbs were generally referred to by the apothecaries ( physicians or doctors ) as " simples " or " officinals " . Before 1542 , the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on simples by Avicenna and Serapion ’ s Liber De <unk> Medicina . The De <unk> and other publications of Simon <unk> , the Liber <unk> of <unk> Ben <unk> , which described the preparations made from plants , animals and minerals , provided a model for the chemical treatment of modern pharmacopoeias . There was also the <unk> Nicolai of Nicolaus de Salerno , which contained <unk> compounds arranged in alphabetical order . 
 = = = Spain and Portugal – de Orta , Monardes , Hernandez = = = 
 The Spaniards and Portuguese were explorers , the Portuguese to India ( Vasco da Gama ) and Goa where physician Garcia de Orta ( 1490 – 1570 ) based his work <unk> dos <unk> ( 1563 ) . The first botanical knowledge of the New World came from Spaniard Nicolas Monardes ( 1493 – 1588 ) who published Dos Libros between 1569 and 1571 . The work of Hernandez on the herbal medicine of the Aztecs has already been discussed . 
 = = = Germany – Bock , Brunfels and Fuchs = = = 
 Otto Brunfels ( c . 1489 – 1534 ) , Leonhart Fuchs ( 1501 – 1566 ) and Hieronymus Bock ( 1498 – 1554 ) were known as the " German fathers of botany " although this title belies the fact that they trod in the steps of the scientifically feted Hildegard of Bingen whose writings on herbalism were <unk> and Causae et <unk> ( together known as Liber <unk> ) of 1150 . The original manuscript is no longer in existence but a copy was printed in 1533 . Another major herbalist was Valerius Cordus ( 1515 – 1544 ) . 
 The 1530 , Herbarum <unk> <unk> of Brunfels contained the admired botanically accurate original woodcut colour illustrations of Hans <unk> along with descriptions of 47 species new to science . Bock , in setting out to describe the plants of his native Germany , produced the New Kreuterbuch of 1539 describing the plants he had found in the woods and fields but without illustration ; this was supplemented by a second edition in 1546 that contained 365 woodcuts . Bock was possibly the first to adopt a botanical classification in his herbal which also covered details of ecology and plant communities . In this , he was placing emphasis on botanical rather than medicinal characteristics , unlike the other German herbals and foreshadowing the modern Flora . De Historia Stirpium ( 1542 with a German version in 1843 ) of Fuchs was a later publication with 509 high quality woodcuts that again paid close attention to botanical detail : it included many plants introduced to Germany in the sixteenth century that were new to science . The work of Fuchs is regarded as being among the most accomplished of the Renaissance period . 
 = = = Low Countries – Dodoens , Lobel , Clusius = = = 
 The Flemish printer Christopher Plantin established a reputation publishing the works of Dutch herbalists Rembert Dodoens and Carolus Clusius and developing a vast library of illustrations . Translations of early Greco @-@ Roman texts published in German by Bock in 1546 as Kreuterbuch were subsequently translated into Dutch as <unk> by Dodoens ( 1517 – 1585 ) who was a Belgian botanist of world renown . This was an elaboration of his first publication <unk> ( 1554 ) . Matthias de Lobel ( 1538 – 1616 ) published his Stirpium Adversaria Nova ( 1570 – 1571 ) and a massive compilation of illustrations while Clusius ’ s ( 1526 – 1609 ) magnum opus was Rariorum Plantarum Historia of 1601 which was a compilation of his Spanish and Hungarian floras and included over 600 plants that were new to science . 
 = = = Italy – Mattioli , <unk> , Alpino = = = 
 In Italy , two herbals were beginning to include botanical descriptions . Notable herbalists included Pietro Andrea Mattioli ( 1501 – 1577 ) , physician to the Italian aristocracy and his Commentarii ( 1544 ) , which included many newly described species , and his more traditional herbal <unk> <unk> Libri <unk> ( 1561 ) . Sometimes , the local flora was described as in the publication <unk> di Monte <unk> ( 1566 ) of Francisco <unk> . Prospero Alpino ( 1553 – 1617 ) published in 1592 the highly popular account of overseas plants De Plantis <unk> and he also established a botanical garden in Padua in 1542 , which together with those at Pisa and Florence , rank among the world ’ s first . 
 = = = England – Turner , Gerard , Parkinson , Culpeper = = = 
 The first true herbal printed in Britain was Richard <unk> ' Herball of 1525 which , although popular in its day , was unillustrated and soon eclipsed by the most famous of the early printed herbals , Peter <unk> 's Grete Herball of 1526 ( derived in turn from the derivative French Grand Herbier ) . 
 William Turner ( ? 1508 – 7 to 1568 ) was an English naturalist , botanist , and theologian who studied at Cambridge University and eventually became known as the “ father of English botany . " His 1538 publication Libellus de re <unk> Novus was the first essay on scientific botany in English . His three @-@ part A New Herball of 1551 – 1562 – 1568 , with woodcut illustrations taken from Fuchs , was noted for its original contributions and extensive medicinal content ; it was also more accessible to readers , being written in vernacular English . Turner described over 200 species native to <unk> and his work had a strong influence on later eminent botanists such as John Ray and Jean Bauhin . 
 John Gerard ( 1545 – 1612 ) is the most famous of all the English herbalists . His Herball of 1597 is , like most herbals , largely derivative . It appears to be a reformulation of Hieronymus Bock 's Kreuterbuch subsequently translated into Dutch as <unk> by Rembert Dodoens ( 1517 – 1585 ) , and thence into English by Carolus Clusius , ( 1526 – 1609 ) then re @-@ worked by Henry Lyte in 1578 as A <unk> Herball . This became the basis of Gerard 's Herball or General Historie of <unk> that appeared in 1597 with its 1800 woodcuts ( only 16 original ) . Although largely derivative , Gerard 's popularity can be attributed to his evocation of plants and places in Elizabethan England and to the clear influence of gardens and gardening on this work . He had published , in 1596 , Catalogus which was a list of 1033 plants growing in his garden . 
 John Parkinson ( 1567 – 1650 ) was apothecary to James I and a founding member of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries . He was an enthusiastic and skilful gardener , his garden in Long Acre being stocked with rarities . He maintained an active correspondence with important English and Continental botanists , herbalists and plantsmen importing new and unusual plants from overseas , in particular the Levant and Virginia . Parkinson is celebrated for his two monumental works , the first Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris in 1629 : this was essentially a gardening book , a <unk> for which Charles I awarded him the title Botanicus Regius <unk> – Royal Botanist . The second was his Theatrum Botanicum of 1640 , the largest herbal ever produced in the English language . It lacked the quality illustrations of Gerard 's works , but was a massive and informative compendium including about 3800 plants ( twice the number of Gerard 's first edition Herball ) , over 1750 pages and over 2 @,@ 700 woodcuts . This was effectively the last and culminating herbal of its kind and , although it included more plants of no discernible economic or medicinal use than ever before , they were nevertheless arranged according to their properties rather than their natural affinities . 
 Nicholas Culpeper ( 1616 – 1654 ) was an English botanist , herbalist , physician , apothecary and astrologer from London 's East End . His published books were A Physicall Directory ( 1649 ) , which was a pseudoscientific pharmacopoeia . The English <unk> ( 1652 ) and the Complete Herbal ( 1653 ) , contain a rich store of pharmaceutical and herbal knowledge . His works lacked scientific credibility because of their use of astrology , though he combined diseases , plants and astrological prognosis into a simple integrated system that has proved popular to the present day . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The legacy of the herbal extends beyond medicine to botany and horticulture . Herbal medicine is still practiced in many parts of the world but the traditional grand herbal , as described here , ended with the European Renaissance , the rise of modern medicine and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs . The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways . Firstly , discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia . The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864 , but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and <unk> that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867 . Secondly , at a more popular level , there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens , medicinal and useful plants . Finally , the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that echo the herbals of the past , an example being Maud Grieve 's A Modern Herbal , first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions . 
 The magical and mystical side of the herbal also lives on . Herbals often explained plant lore , displaying a superstitious or spiritual side . There was , for example , the fanciful doctrine of signatures , the belief that there were similarities in the appearance of the part of the body affected the appearance of the plant to be used as a remedy . The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary <unk> ( <unk> gardening ) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy , aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine . 
 It is sometimes forgotten that the plants described in herbals were grown in special herb gardens ( physic gardens ) . Such herb gardens were , for example , part of the medieval monastery garden that supplied the simples or officinals used to treat the sick being cared for within the monastery . Early physic gardens were also associated with institutes of learning , whether a monastery , university or herbarium . It was this medieval garden of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries , attended by apothecaries and physicians , that established a tradition leading to the systems gardens of the eighteenth century ( gardens that demonstrated the classification system of plants ) and the modern botanical garden . The advent of printing , woodcuts and metal engraving improved the means of communication . Herbals prepared the ground for modern botanical science by pioneering plant description , classification and illustration . From the time of the ancients like Dioscorides through to Parkinson in 1629 , the scope of the herbal remained essentially the same . 
 The greatest legacy of the herbal is to botany . Up to the seventeenth century , botany and medicine were one and the same but gradually greater emphasis was placed on the plants rather than their medicinal properties . During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , plant description and classification began to relate plants to one another and not to man . This was the first glimpse of non @-@ anthropocentric botanical science since Theophrastus and , coupled with the new system of binomial nomenclature , resulted in " scientific herbals " called Floras that detailed and illustrated the plants growing in a particular region . These books were often backed by herbaria , collections of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras . In this way modern botany , especially plant taxonomy , was born out of medicine . As herbal historian Agnes <unk> remarks – " Sibthorp 's monumental Flora Graeca is , indeed , the direct descendant in modern science of the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides . " 
 = Saddlesore Galactica = 
 " Saddlesore Galactica " is the thirteenth episode of the eleventh season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 6 , 2000 . In the episode , the Simpson family rescues a diving horse named Duncan from the abuse of his owner and keeps him as a pet . When the cost of keeping Duncan rises , Homer and Bart train him to be a racehorse . Duncan wins several races and , as a result , Homer is threatened with death by a group of jockeys . Meanwhile , Lisa is upset over her school unfairly losing the musical band competition at a state fair and writes a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton in protest . 
 The episode features several guest appearances ; horse race caller Trevor Denman stars as himself , commentating the races in the episode , and voice artist Jim Cummings provides the animal sounds made by Duncan . Randy Bachman and Fred Turner appear as themselves as their rock band Bachman – Turner Overdrive performs at the state fair . " Saddlesore Galactica " was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer . A number of meta @-@ references are included in the episode , such as the character Comic Book Guy telling the Simpsons that they have owned a horse before in the episode " Lisa 's Pony " . 
 Around 9 @.@ 6 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing . In 2008 , it was released on DVD , along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season . " Saddlesore Galactica " is despised by many television critics and fans according to Long . It has been described by About.com 's Nancy Basile as one of the season 's worst episodes , by Marco <unk> of Maclean 's as the worst episode of the series , and has frequently been cited by fans as an example of the show jumping the shark . Criticism has been directed at its outlandish plot , which , among other things , features elf @-@ like jockeys who lure Homer into their secret lair where they threaten him to stop Duncan from winning . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Lisa and the other members of Springfield Elementary 's school band enter a music competition together at a state fair , performing James Brown 's " Living in America " . However , they lose to the Ogdenville Elementary band , which performs John Philip Sousa 's " Stars and Stripes Forever " and uses red , white , and blue glowsticks to form a flag . Lisa accuses Ogdenville of cheating as the use of visual aids is against the rules of the competition . She later writes a letter to President Clinton , complaining about the situation . At the fair , Homer and Bart see a horse named Duncan that can dive into pools . The Simpsons take Duncan home after his sleazy owner is accused of animal cruelty and flees . However , they end up having financial issues because of Duncan ; it costs them US $ 500 a week to keep him . 
 Homer and Bart try to think of a way that Duncan can make money to help offset the costs of keeping him . Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and suggests that he should be a racehorse . Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track , with Bart as the jockey . However , a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished . Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named " Furious D " , complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa 's bracelets for a nose ring . He intimidates the other horses and wins several races . Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge , which turns out to be a secret lair . The jockeys reveal themselves to be murderous elf @-@ like creatures who want Homer to have Duncan lose the upcoming race . They threaten to eat Homer 's brain if he does not comply . Though intimidated at first , Homer later vows to deal with those " murderous trolls " . 
 At the Springfield Derby , Duncan wins the race , and the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart. With the help of Marge and Lisa , who spray water on the jockeys with a hose , Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump . Afterwards , Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan 's retirement from racing to start a new life as a stud . President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons 's house to see Lisa , presenting her with a plaque . Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary 's band is the true champion .

 " Saddlesore Galactica " was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons ( 1999 – 2000 ) . The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica . The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City , New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century ; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving . When the animation process began , Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work . He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story , " we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality . So when everybody knew how to draw the horse and we got that out of the way , they could animate the horse acting . " Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode . 
 American horse race caller Trevor Denman guest starred in the episode as himself , commentating on Duncan 's races over the public @-@ address system . Randy Bachman and Fred Turner , known for their rock band Bachman – Turner Overdrive , made an appearance in the episode as themselves . They perform on stage at the state fair during the beginning of the episode . When Bachman and Turner tell the audience that they are going to play some songs from their new album , Homer immediately yells out demands for them to play their old song " Takin ' Care of Business " . The band starts the song and Homer then yells , " Get to the ' workin overtime ' part ! " The band obliges , skipping straight to the chorus . Bachman had left the band when " Saddlesore Galactica " was recorded and because of tension between him and Turner , the two recorded their lines separately on different occasions . Long has said that the Simpsons staff members " were thrilled to have [ them ] on the show " and that the pair " could not have been nicer . "

 The episode is heavily self @-@ referential and contains a number of meta @-@ references . When the Simpsons take Duncan home from the fair , Comic Book Guy points out to the Simpsons that they have already taken in a horse as a pet ( as seen in " Lisa 's Pony " ) , and that " the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart , with hilarious consequences . " In another scene later in the episode , when Lisa points out to Marge that Marge is showing signs of gambling problems , Comic Book Guy shows up again wearing a T @-@ shirt that says " Worst Episode Ever " and tells Lisa : " Hey , I 'm watching you ! " This refers to the fact that Marge 's gambling problems have already been explored in the episode " $ pringfield " . 
 Jonathan Gray analyzed the self @-@ referentiality in The Simpsons in his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons : Television , Parody , and Intertextuality , writing that " <unk> constantly ' reset ' themselves , living in [ ... ] an ' existential circle ' in which nothing really changes , and every episode starts more or less where the last one started ; and The Simpsons frequently plays with this sitcom clock , and with the amnesia of sitcom memory . The family members often forget important events in their ' history ' [ ... ] " . Gray noted that in " Saddlesore Galactica " , " the action continues as normal , as sitcom memory ( or lack thereof ) is pointed out but comically not acted upon . Thus , where David Grote [ author of The End of Comedy : The Sit @-@ Com and the Comedic Tradition ] ( 1983 : 67 ) notes that sitcom episodes ' live in a kind of time @-@ warp without any reference to the other episodes , ' producing a situation whereby everything ' remains inviolate and undisturbed , no matter what transitory events may occur ' ( 1983 : 59 ) , The Simpsons comically reflects upon this .

 The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 6 , 2000 . It was viewed in approximately 9 @.@ 6 million households that night . With a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 5 , " Saddlesore Galactica " finished 29th in the ratings for the week of January 31 – February 6 , 2000 . It was the second highest @-@ rated broadcast on Fox that week , following an episode of Malcolm in the Middle . On October 7 , 2008 , " Saddlesore Galactica " was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season . Staff members Tim Long , Lance Kramer , Mike Scully , Matt Groening , George Meyer , Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , Matt Selman , and Tom Martin participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode . Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set . 
 According to Long , " Saddlesore Galactica " is considered by many critics and fans as one of the worst episodes in the history of the show , particularly for the scenes featuring the jockey elves . In 2007 , Maclean 's writer Marco <unk> named it his least favorite episode of The Simpsons , elaborating : " This is the one where the Simpsons get a horse – again – and the plot devolves into something involving the secret land of the jockeys . Making meta @-@ references to the fact you ’ ve just made your ' worst episode ever ' doesn ’ t make it any funnier . " Nancy Basile of About.com listed the episode as one of the worst episodes of the season — one of the episodes that made her " cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots " . 
 Despite its criticisms , " Saddlesore Galactica " received some positive reviews . While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons , DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode , writing : " I remember that ' Saddlesore ' was much despised when it first aired , though I can ’ t recall if I joined that chorus as well . Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better , but I think that ' Saddlesore ' offers a decent number of laughs . It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self @-@ awareness , but it provides reasonable entertainment . " DVD Talk 's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as " fun " . 
 = Gunfighter = 
 Gunfighter and gunslinger / <unk> / are literary words used historically to refer to men in the American Old West who had gained a reputation of being dangerous with a gun and had participated in gunfights and shootouts . Gunman was a more common term used for these individuals in the 19th century . Today , the term " gunslinger " is now more or less used to denote someone who is quick on the draw with a pistol , but can also refer to riflemen and shotgun messengers . The gunfighter is also one of the most popular characters in the Western genre and has appeared in associated films , video games , and literature . 
 Gunfighters range from different occupations including lawman , outlaw , cowboy , <unk> and <unk> , but are more commonly synonymous to a hired gun who made a living with his weapons in the Old West . 
 = = Origin of the term = = 
 The term " gun slinger " was used in the Western film Drag Harlan ( 1920 ) . The word was soon adopted by other Western writers , such as Zane Grey , and became common usage . In his introduction to The <unk> ( 1976 ) , author Glendon <unk> says " gunslinger " and " gunfighter " are modern terms , and the more authentic terms for the period would have been " gunman " , " <unk> " , " <unk> , " or " bad man " ( sometimes written as " <unk> " ) . <unk> seems to have been correct about " gunslinger " , but the term " gunfighter " existed in several newspapers in the 1870s , and as such the term existed in the 19th century . Bat Masterson used the term " gunfighter " in the newspaper articles which he wrote about the lawmen and outlaws whom he had known . However , Joseph Rosa noted that , even though Masterson used the term " gunfighter " , he " preferred the term ' <unk> ' " when discussing these individuals . Clay Allison ( 1841 – 1887 ) , a notorious New Mexico and Texas gunman and cattleman , originated the term " <unk> " . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 Often , the term has been applied to men who would hire out for contract killings or at a ranch embroiled in a range war where they would earn " fighting wages " . Others , like Billy the Kid , were notorious bandits , and still others were lawmen like Pat Garrett and Wyatt Earp . A gunfighter could be an outlaw — a robber or murderer who took advantage of the wilderness of the frontier to hide from genteel society and to make periodic raids on it . The gunfighter could also be an agent of the state , archetypically a lone avenger , but more often a sheriff , whose duty was to face the outlaw and bring him to justice or to personally administer it . There were also a few historical cowboys who were actual gunfighters , such as the Outlaw cowboy gang who participated in the bloody Skeleton Canyon Massacre . 
 = = Depiction in culture = = 
 Gunslingers frequently appear as stock characters in Western movies and novels , along with cowboys . Often , the hero of a Western meets his opposite " double " , a mirror of his own evil side that he has to destroy . 
 Western gunslinger heroes are portrayed as local lawmen or enforcement officers , ranchers , army officers , cowboys , territorial marshals , nomadic loners , or skilled fast @-@ draw artists . They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle - courageous , moral , tough , solid , and self @-@ sufficient , maverick characters ( often with trusty sidekicks ) , possessing an independent and honorable attitude ( but often characterized as slow @-@ talking ) . They are depicted as similar to a knight @-@ errant , wandering from place to place with no particular direction , often facing curious and hostile enemies , while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry . The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own , commonly against lawlessness , with an expert display of his physical skills ( roping , gun @-@ play , horse @-@ handling , pioneering abilities , etc . ) . 
 In films , the gunslinger often possesses a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver . <unk> pistols , lightning draws , and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen of the big screen . In the real world , however , gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly , and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons . Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress , but to kill . 
 Another classic bit of cinema that is largely a myth is the showdown at high noon , where two well @-@ matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel . These duels did occasionally happen , as in the case of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel , but gunfights were typically more spontaneous , a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon , and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke . Gunfights could be won by simple distraction , or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury . When a gunman did square off , it rarely was with another gunfighter . Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth , and it was uncommon for two well @-@ known gunslingers to face off . The gunslinger 's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed . In Western films and books , young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation , but this rarely happened in real life . A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict . Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation . 
 In the days of the Old West , tales tended to grow with repeated telling , and a single fight might grow into a career @-@ making reputation . For instance , the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang , but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict . Some gunslingers , such as Bat Masterson , actively engaged in self @-@ promotion . Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians . 
 = = Fact and fiction = = 
 Most gunfights are portrayed in films or books as having two men square off , waiting for one to make the first move . This was rarely the case . Often , a gunfight was spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment , with one drawing his pistol , and the other reacting . Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover . In popular folklore , men who held noteworthy reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation . On the contrary , in cases where two men held a similar reputation , both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible . They rarely took undue risks , and usually weighed their options before confronting another well @-@ known gunman . This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well @-@ known gunmen matched up against one another , but rather one notable gunman against a lesser @-@ known opponent or opponents . 
 These fights were usually close @-@ up and personal , with a number of shots blasted from pistols , often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild . Much of the time , it would be difficult to tell who had " won ” the gunfight for several minutes , as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air . How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man . Many well @-@ known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed , they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a " blaze of glory " . Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness . 
 Mythology and folklore often exaggerate the skills of famous gunfighters . Most of these historical figures were not known to be capable of trick shooting , nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting . Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin , stylistic pistol twirling , glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent ( the bullet through the hat being an example ) , shooting an opponent 's belt buckle ( thus dropping his pants ) , a bullet cutting the hangman 's rope , or shooting the guns out of opponents ' hands ( typically as an alternative to killing ) . The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility , as <unk> bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill . Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver . 
 In Western movies , the characters ' gun belts are often worn low on the hip and outer thigh , with the holster cut away around the pistol 's trigger and grip for a smooth , fast draw . This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism . Fast @-@ draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh . Long before holsters were steel @-@ lined , they were soft and supple for comfortable all @-@ day wear . A gunfighter would use tie @-@ downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing . Most of the time , gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands . Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt @-@ forward holster type , which worked better on horseback . Other gunfighters would use <unk> rigs that gave a faster and easier draw . Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen , cowboys , and lawmen because of their <unk> and effectiveness on horseback . The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters . Dubbed the " Gun that Won the West " , it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier . Shotguns were also a popular weapon for " express messengers " and guards , especially those on stagecoaches and trains who were in charge of overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment . 
 Although quick draw and hip shooting was an important skill in the West , only a handful of historically known gunslingers were known to be fast , such as Luke Short , John Wesley Hardin , Wild Bill Hickok , Doc Holliday , and Billy the Kid . Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers , and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire <unk> . Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight , while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights . 
 Gunfighters King Fisher , John Wesley Hardin , Ben Thompson , Billy the Kid , Wild Bill Hickok and Pat Garrett all died as a result of ambush , killed by men who feared them because of their reputation . Gunmen Kid Curry , Jim Courtright , Dallas Stoudenmire and Dave Rudabaugh were killed in raging gun battles , much as portrayed in films about the era , and usually against more than one opponent . Bill Longley and Tom Horn were executed . Famed gunman Clay Allison died in a wagon accident . Gunmen Wyatt Earp , Bat Masterson , Bass Reeves , Commodore Perry Owens , and Luke Short all died of natural causes , living out their lives on reputation and avoiding conflict in secluded retirement . Gunfighter and lawman Frank Eaton , known as " Pistol Pete " lived into old age and gained further fame , before his death at age 97 , by becoming the mascot for Oklahoma A & M College ( now Oklahoma State University ) . Rare are the gunfighters who , like William Sidney " Cap " Light , died accidentally by their own hand .

 The image of a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth generated primarily by dime @-@ novel authors in the late 19th century . An estimate of 20 @,@ 000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900 , and over 21 @,@ 586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890 . The most notable and well @-@ known took place in the states / territories of Arizona , New Mexico , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Texas . Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare , very few and far between , but when gunfights did occur , the cause for each varied . Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment , while others were longstanding feuds , or between bandits and lawmen . Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause . Some of these shootouts became famous , while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving . To prevent gunfights from happening , many cities in the American frontier , such as Dodge City and Tombstone , put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area . 
 The Gunfight at the OK Corral is a famous example of a real @-@ life western shootout , between the Earp Brothers together with Doc Holliday , and the Clanton @-@ McLaury gang . It lasted only 30 seconds , contrary to many movie adaptations . The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral , but in a vacant lot outside of it . The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols . Both parties simultaneously drew their guns , which added to the confusion of who fired first . It is not known who fired the first shot , but Wyatt 's bullet was the first to hit , tearing through Frank McLaury 's belly and sending McLaury ’ s own shot wild through Wyatt ’ s coattail . Billy Clanton fired at Virgil , but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan 's shot through his ribcage . Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight . Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life . " Go to fighting or get away ! " , Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run . Doc instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun . Frank was running to Fremont Street , and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother , but Doc dropped his shotgun , drew his pistol , and shot Frank in the right temple . Wounded and dying , Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him , striking Virgil 's leg . Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy . 
 In April 14 , 1881 , lawman Dallas Stoudenmire participated in a gunfight in El Paso , Texas which many dubbed the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight , in which he killed three of the four fatalities with his twin .44 caliber Colt revolvers . One of those killed was an innocent Mexican bystander . Less than a year after these incidents , he would kill as many as six more men in gunfights while in the line of duty . 
 Another well @-@ documented gunfight resulted in the most kills by one person in a single event , when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single @-@ handedly on 19 December 1854 . Unknown to Davis and his companions , a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail . They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits : two Americans , one Frenchman , two Britons , five Sydney Ducks , and four Mexicans . As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot , the bandit gang charged out of the brush , pistols flaming . James McDonald died instantly , without time to draw his revolver or react in any way . Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six @-@ shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped , badly wounded . Captain Davis later described himself as being " in a fever of excitement at the time . " Unfazed , he stood his ground , pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws . He shot down his assailants , one after another . The outlaws ' bullets tore at Davis 's clothing , but caused only two slight flesh wounds . Within moments , seven of the bandits were dead or dying on the ground and Davis 's pistols were empty . Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off . Davis whipped out his Bowie knife , and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits . He stabbed one of them to death ; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand . The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid . Despite their weakened condition , they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives . The captain reacted in an instant . Slashing with his heavy Bowie , he killed them both . 
 In December 1 , 1884 , a town sheriff named <unk> Baca came face @-@ to @-@ face against 80 gunmen which became known as the Frisco shootout . The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him . In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca . Baca took refuge in an adobe house , and over the course of a 36 @-@ hour siege , the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house ( some accounts say a total of 4 @,@ 000 shots ) without touching Baca . He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8 . When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo , Baca strolled out of the house unscathed . Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945 , age 80 . 
 In January 1887 Commodore Perry Owens took office as Sheriff of Apache County , Arizona . He sent two deputies to arrest Ike Clanton . Clanton had instigated the Gunfight at the OK Corral and was charged with the later ambush shooting of Virgil Earp . Wyatt Earp searched for Ike Clanton in his vendetta , but never found him - Ike move north to Apache County to continue rustling cattle and killing . Owens ' two deputies killed Ike Clanton ; Phin Clanton was arrested ; three other gang members were killed ; and the Clanton gang was done . Then Sheriff Owens turned his attention to the Blevins family , the other rustling gang in the county . In June 1887 Old Man Blevins disappeared , presumably killed by the Tewksbury faction of the Pleasant Valley War . The Blevins sons searched for their father and in August Hamp Blevins and another were killed by the Tewksbury side . So Andy Blevins ( aka Cooper ) ambushed and killed John Tewksbury and Bill Jacobs in revenge . Blevins returned to Holbrook and was heard bragging about his killings . Sheriff Owens had inherited a warrant for Andy Blevins ' ( Cooper ) arrest for horse theft so he rode to <unk> on September 2 , 1887 . Sheriff Owens had hunted buffalo for the railroad and could shoot his Winchester from the hip with great accuracy . <unk> his Winchester rifle in his arm , Sheriff Owens knocked on the Blevins ' door . Andy Blevins answered with a pistol in hand , the lawman told him to come out , that he had a warrant for arrest . Blevins refused and tried to close the door . Owens shot his rifle from his hip through the door , hitting Andy Blevins in the stomach . Andy 's half @-@ brother , John Blevins , pushed a pistol out the door to Owens ' right and fired at the Sheriff . He missed and Owens shot John Blevins in the arm , putting him out of the fight . Owens saw Andy Blevins in the window moving to shoot back . Owens shot through the wall , striking Andy in the right hip - he died that night . Mose Roberts , boarding with the family , jumped out of a side window with a pistol . Sheriff Owens shot him through his back and chest , killing him . Fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Samuel Houston Blevins ran out the front door , with his brother 's revolver , and yelled " I 'll get him . " His mother ran out after him . Owens shot and Sam fell backward , dying in his mother 's arms . The shootout took less than one minute and made Owens a legend . In eight months Sheriff Owens had rid Apache County of two notorious gangs of rustlers and killers . 
 In many early western films and literature , Native Americans were often portrayed as savages ; having conflicts and battles against gunfighters and white settlements . According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census ( 1894 ) , an estimate of 19 @,@ 000 white men , women and children were killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30 @,@ 000 and 45 @,@ 000 casualties during the American Indian Wars . Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans . Among them was civilian Billy Dixon , who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills , by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a mile away with his Sharps rifle , during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls . 
 General George S. Patton himself had a gunfight when he was a young second lieutenant chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916 . Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San <unk> Ranch to look for Villa , who had recently raided the city of Columbus , New Mexico . Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa 's men came into the ranch on horseback . Patton drew his obsolete single @-@ action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men . The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot . After his troops took down the remaining outlaw , Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer .

 The image of two gunslingers with violent reputation squaring off in a street in a duel , where each draws his pistol and tries to kill the other , is a Hollywood invention . However , Wild West duels did occur in real life ( though rarely ) and as such are not entirely a myth . These duels were first recorded in the South , brought by emigrants to the American Frontier as a crude form of the " code duello , " a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry . By the second half of the 19th century , few Americans still fought duels to solve their problems , and became a thing of the past in the United States by the start of the 20th century . Writer Wyatt @-@ Brown in his book " Southern Honor : Ethics and Behavior in the Old South " described dueling in the American frontier as a " custom " , and was primarily used for teenage disputes , rise in ranking , status and scapegoating . 
 The most famous and well @-@ recorded duel occurred on 21 July 1865 , in Springfield , Missouri . Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and decided to have a gunfight . They arranged to walk towards each other at 6 p.m. Wild Bill 's armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings , leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square . When they were about 50 yards apart , both men drew their guns . The two fired at the same time , but Hickok 's shot hit Tutt in the heart , while Tutt 's shot missed . This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick @-@ draw duel . The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self @-@ defense . The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper 's Magazine in 1867 , and became a staple of the gunslinger legend . 
 The famous lawman Wyatt Earp gave an account of having participated a duel once during his vendetta . While in the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains , Earp 's posse found one of the outlaw cowboys named " Indian Charlie " Cruz . One account says that after the party recognized Cruz , they chased him down and a gunfight ensued . The party manage to capture Cruz and he confessed to have taken part in Morgan 's murder , and that he identified Stilwell , Hank Swilling , Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo as other of Morgan 's killers . During that time , Wyatt allowed Cruz to keep his revolver to " give him a chance to fight like a man . " After the confession , Wyatt told Cruz to draw , challenging him to a duel , and the posse counted to three before Wyatt gunned Cruz down . The Langford - Peel duel occurred in July 22 , 1867 between gunmen John Bull and Langford Peel . 
 Doc Holliday himself had a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas , New Mexico . One of the women who worked there had an ex @-@ boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been discharged from the Army . Gordon wanted her to stop working . When she told him to leave her alone , he became angry , went outside the saloon , and started shooting out the windows with his pistol . As bullets went through the saloon , Doc unflinching , holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver , and walked outside . Gordon then started shooting at him but missed . Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot . He then went back to the saloon . Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled . Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce 's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday . 
 Another well @-@ known duel in the American West happened in Fort Worth , Texas , and was known as the Luke Short @-@ Jim Courtright Duel . Timothy Isaiah " Longhair Jim " Courtright was running the <unk> Commercial agency in Fort Worth , which provided " protection " to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits . At the same time , Luke Short , a former friend of Courtright 's , was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services . But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to " go to Hell , " that he could do anything that was necessary to take care of his business . On February 8 , 1887 , the two quarreled , and with Bat Masterson at Short 's side , Courtright and Short dueled in the street . They drew their pistols at close range , and Short fired first , blowing off Courtright 's thumb . Courtright attempted the " border shift " , a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand , but he was too slow . Short shot him in the chest , killing him . 
 The Long Branch Saloon Shootout , involving Levi Richardson , a buffalo hunter , and " Cockeyed Frank " Loving , a professional gambler , happened on April 5 , 1879 . Richardson had developed some affection for Loving 's wife Mattie , and the two began to argue about her . In the saloon , Frank sat down at a long table , Richardson turned around and took a seat at the same table . The two were then heard speaking in low voices . After the conversation , Richardson drew his pistol , and Loving drew his in response . The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke . Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett , who was in Beatty & Kelley 's Saloon , heard the shots and came running . Both men were still standing , although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving 's Remington No. 44 was empty . Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun , while Bassett disarmed Loving . Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table , when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest , as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm . Frank Loving , who had only a slight scratch on the hand , was immediately taken to jail . Two days later , the coroner 's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self @-@ defense and Loving was immediately released . 
 On March 9 , 1877 , gamblers Jim Levy and Charlie Harrison argued over a game of cards in a saloon in Cheyenne , Wyoming . They met in an alley following an argument about a card game . Harrison shot first , but missed . Levy aimed carefully and hit Harrison , who died a week later . 
 Not as well known today but famous in his time was the dapper , derby @-@ wearing train robber Marion Hedgepeth , who despite his swell appearance , " was a deadly killer and one of the fastest guns in the Wild , Wild West " . William Pinkerton , whose National Detective Agency had sought to capture Hedgepeth and his gang for years , noted that Hedgepeth once gunned down another outlaw who had already <unk> his pistol before <unk> had drawn his revolver . The infamous assassin Tom Horn was also said to have participated in a duel with a second lieutenant from the Mexican Army , due to a dispute with a prostitute when he was twenty @-@ six years old . Gunfighters Jim Levy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes . 
 = = Living on reputation = = 
 Most Old West men who were labeled as being " gunfighters " did not kill nearly as many men in gunfights as they were given credit for , if any at all . They were often labeled as such due to one particular instance , which developed from rumors into them having been involved in many more events than they actually were . Often their reputation was as much " self @-@ promotion " as anything else ; such was the case of Bat Masterson . Wyatt Earp with his brothers Morgan and Virgil along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaw Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone , Arizona Territory . He has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime . But Prof. Bill O 'Neal cites just five incidents in his Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters . Earp expressed his dismay about the controversy that followed him his entire life . He wrote in a letter to John Hays Hammond on May 21 , 1925 , that " notoriety had been the bane of my life . " 
 After his brother Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants , the men suspected of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial . Wyatt and his brother Warren set out on a vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible . Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of film and books as a fearless Western hero . He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral , at least in part because he was the only one who was not wounded or killed . In fact , his brother , Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War , and in law enforcement as a sheriff , constable , and marshal . As city marshal , Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt 's assistance . But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography , Wyatt Earp : Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt 's death , Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies , television shows , biographies and works of fiction . 
 There are no records to support the reputation that Johnny Ringo developed . Of the documented instances where Ringo killed men , they were unarmed , and there is no evidence to support his participation in a single gunfight . Others deserved the reputation associated with them . Jim Courtright and Dallas Stoudenmire both killed several men in gunfights both as lawmen and as civilians . Clay Allison and Ben Thompson had well @-@ deserved reputations . At the same time , gunmen like Scott Cooley are all but unknown , when they actually led a life reflective of what most would consider a gunfighter to be . In other cases , certain gunfighters were possibly confused , over time , with being someone else with a similar name . The most well known of Butch Cassidy 's Wild Bunch gang , the Sundance Kid , was in reality only known to have been in one shootout during his lifetime , and no gunfights . Some historians have since stated that it is possible that over time he was confused with another Wild Bunch member , Kid Curry , who was without a doubt the most dangerous member of the gang , having killed many lawmen and civilians during his lifetime before being killed himself . Hence , it is the Sundance Kid who is better known . 
 = = Outlaw or lawman = = 
 It is often difficult to separate lawmen of the Old West from outlaws of the Old West . In many cases , the term gunfighter was applied to constables . Despite idealistic portrayals in television , movies , and even in history books , very few lawmen / gunfighters could claim their law enforcement role as their only source of employment . Unlike contemporary peace officers , these lawmen generally pursued other occupations , often earning money as gamblers , business owners , or outlaws — as was the case with " Curly " Bill Brocius , who , while always referred to as an outlaw , served as a deputy sheriff under sheriff Johnny Behan . Many shootouts involving lawmen were caused by disputes arising from these alternative occupations , rather than the lawman 's attempts to enforce the law . 
 Tom Horn , historically cited as an assassin , served both as a deputy sheriff and as a Pinkerton detective , a job in which he shot at least three people as a killer for hire . Ben Thompson , best known as a gunfighter and gambler , was a very successful chief of police in Austin , Texas . King Fisher had great success as a county sheriff in Texas . Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid both wore badges as lawmen at least once . " Big " Steve Long served as deputy marshal for Laramie , Wyoming , while the entire time committing murders and forced theft of land deeds . A town with a substantial violent crime rate would often turn to a known gunman as their town marshal , chief , or sheriff , in the hopes that the gunman could stem the violence and bring order . 
 Known gunmen / lawmen were generally effective , and in time the violence would subside , usually after the gunman / lawman had been involved in several shooting incidents , eventually leading to a substantial and well earned fear that kept everyone in line . At times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars . Although sanctioned by law enforcement officials , the gunmen were not always actually deputized . Sometimes , however , just to make things " official " , they would go through the formality of <unk> . A case in point : the service of the Jesse Evans Gang , and outlaw Jesse Evans himself , as agents for the Murphy @-@ Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War . While technically working as lawmen , they were little more than hired guns . 
 Usually , when a gunman was hired by a town as town marshal , they received the full support of the townspeople until order was restored , at which point the town would tactfully indicate it was time for a change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law . A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso , Texas , town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire . He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job , at which point they immediately changed their mind , saying he could keep his job . He resigned on his own a couple of days later .

 People relive the Wild West both historically and in popular culture by participating in cowboy action shooting events , where each gunslinger adopts his or her own look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s , and as part of that character , chooses an alias to go by . The sport originated in Southern California , USA , in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society ( SASS ) , Western Action <unk> Association ( WASA ) , and National Congress of Old West Shooters ( <unk> ) , as well as others in the USA and in other countries . There are different categories shooters can compete in . There 's the gunfighter , frontiersman , classic cowboy and <unk> - each with its own specifications . 
 Alongside the iconic cowboy , gunfighters have become a cultural image of the American people abroad , and also as an idealized image of violence , frontier justice , and adventure . Even outside of the Western genre , the term ' gunslinger ' has been used in modern times to describe someone who is fast and accurate with pistols , either in real life or in other fictional action genre . 
 The quick draw which gunfighters help popularize , is still an important skill in the American military . 
 = = = In popular culture = = = 
 Gunfighters have been featured in media even outside the Western genre , often combined with other elements and genres , mainly science @-@ fiction Space Westerns , steampunk , and the contemporary setting . Abilities , clothing and attitude associated with gunfighters are seen in many other genres . An example of these is Han shot first , in which Han Solo , a gunfighter @-@ like protagonist in Star Wars , kills his opponent with a subtle , under @-@ the @-@ table draw . He also wore his holster low on , and tied to , the thigh with a cutaway for the trigger . Roland Deschain from the fantasy series The Dark Tower is a gunfighter pitted against fantasy @-@ themed monsters and enemies . Inspired by the " Man with No Name " and other spaghetti @-@ western characters , he himself is detached or unsympathetic , often reacting as uncaring or angry at signs of cowardice or self @-@ pity , yet he possesses a strong sense of heroism , often attempting to help those in need , a morality much seen in Westerns . 
 Jonah Hex , from DC Comics , is a ruthless bounty hunter bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent . IGN ranked Jonah Hex the 73rd greatest comic book hero of all time . Throughout the DC Universe , Hex has been , on many occasions , transported from the Old West to the contemporary setting and beyond . Even in an unfamiliar territory and time period , Hex managed to outgun his enemies with more advanced weaponry . Two @-@ Gun Kid is another comic book gunfighter from Marvel Comics . Skilled with revolvers , he has aided many super @-@ heroes in future timelines , most notably She @-@ Hulk . 
 Many Japanese manga and anime have also adopted the western genre . Yasuhiro <unk> is known for creating the space western <unk> . The story 's protagonist , Vash the Stampede , is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past . Unlike other violence @-@ themed gunslingers , Vash carries a Shane @-@ like pacifist attitude , and avoids killing men , even dangerous enemies . Behind him is the gun @-@ toting priest named Nicholas D. <unk> , who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross . Nicholas is more violent than Vash , and the two would often argue about killing opponents . Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino 's Journey , who both incorporate knight @-@ errant gunslinger themes . 
 Modern @-@ day western gunslingers have also appeared in recent Neo @-@ Westerns . <unk> Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous moral code of an Old West sheriff , even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies . The hitman Anton <unk> from No Country For Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw . Additionally , the comic book character Vigilante is a self @-@ proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s . 
 Gunfighters have also been featured in many video games , both in traditional Old West , and in contemporary and future settings . Colton White , the protagonist of 2005 's best @-@ selling western video game Gun . Another well @-@ known video game Western protagonist is John Marston from Red Dead Redemption , who was nominated for 2010 Spike 's Video Game Awards . The New York Times stated : " he and his creators conjure such a convincing , cohesive and enthralling re @-@ imagination of the real world that it sets a new standard for sophistication and ambition in electronic gaming . " The main character Caleb in the video games Blood and Blood II : The Chosen is also a former Old West gunfighter . Gunfighter is also a callsign for a group of two Apache Helicopters in the video game Medal of Honor . They appear on mission named " Gunfighters " , and the player will act as Captain Brad " Hawk " Hawkins from 1st Aviation Regiment .

 = Daredevil ( season 2 ) = 
 The second season of the American web television series Daredevil , which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name , follows Matt Murdock / Daredevil , a blind lawyer @-@ by @-@ day who fights crime at night , crossing paths with the deadly Frank Castle / Punisher along with the return of an old girlfriend – Elektra Natchios . It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) , sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise . The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios , with Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez serving as showrunners , and series creator Drew Goddard acting as consultant . 
 Charlie Cox stars as Murdock , while Jon Bernthal and Élodie Yung are introduced as Castle and Natchios . Deborah Ann Woll , Elden Henson , Rosario Dawson , and Vincent D 'Onofrio also return from the first season , with Stephen Rider joining them . The season was ordered in April 2015 after the successful release of the first , with Petrie and Ramirez replacing the season one showrunner Steven S. DeKnight . Production on the season began in July 2015 and continued through December , with the season focusing on the nature of heroism through comparison of Murdock to Castle and Natchios , and showing how the latter two affect Murdock 's life . 
 The first two episodes of the season premiered in Paris on March 7 , 2016 , with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on March 18 . Critics praised the introduction of Castle and Natchios , as well as Bernthal 's performance in particular , the season 's action , and storylines . However , many missed the presence of Vondie Curtis @-@ Hall 's Ben Urich from season one , and D 'Onofrio 's Wilson Fisk during the first half of season two . The series was renewed for a third season in July 2016 .

 When asked about the future of the series following the first season , showrunner Steven S. DeKnight said that Daredevil " is one part of the bigger plan — Jessica Jones , Luke Cage , Iron Fist , and then The Defenders . How that all fits together , and whether or not there will be a second season of this show — or if it will fold into the others — are questions nobody really has answers to yet . " In November 2014 , DeKnight said that there " probably will be more " seasons of Daredevil following the first . In January 2015 , Netflix COO Ted Sarandos stated the series was " eligible to go into multiple seasons for sure " and Netflix would look at " how well [ they ] are addressing both the Marvel fanbase but also the broader fanbase " to determine if additional seasons would be appropriate . 
 On April 21 , 2015 , Marvel and Netflix announced that the series had been renewed for a second season , with Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez replacing DeKnight as showrunners as well as acting as executive producers ; both served as writers in the first season and worked closely with DeKnight and series creator Drew Goddard . The season introduces the Punisher , whom DeKnight and the writers had wanted to introduce in a post @-@ credits scene during the first season finale but were unable due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one . DeKnight felt that this " was the right decision . I think there ’ s a better , more organic way to introduce him to the world . " Ramirez referred to the second season internally as " Daredevil vs. the Punisher " . In September 2015 , Goddard explained that he was still involved with the season as an executive producer , consulting with Petrie and Ramirez when asked to . The season consists of 13 hour @-@ long episodes . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Ramirez talked about how the second season would be different from the first , saying that the writers had spent the first season wondering " if there was a place for dark and gritty content in superheroes " and because of the positive fan reaction to that ( " we got a loud answer of ' yes ' " ) , approached the second season with the mindset , " you wanted grounded and wanted dark , here ’ s Elektra and Punisher . You asked for it . " Petrie , talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season , said that sometimes it is best to " peel back the layer of the onion through flashback , or two people in a room talking can have all the power in the world . That ’ s something we get to pick and choose . " 
 On including the Punisher specifically in the season , where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe , Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character , as the writers are " able to do things on the small screen that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies . " Goddard stated that the season 's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than " pushing the boundary " or looking to shock the audience , though he noted that this could still go in a more " adult ... darker , dirtier " way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher . Petrie stated that the writers hoped to " stir the pot " and " get people to think " with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods , adding , " Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit . We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now . If you 've got a gun and you 're not the police you 're going to incite strong feelings . " Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as " Punisher " in the writer 's room , similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called " Kingpin " for season one , as it allowed the writers to think " about [ Castle ] as a man with a vendetta , who made an oath to his dead family . The more specific it got , the less it became about issues outside of Hell ’ s Kitchen or other things . " In the series , the moniker of " The Punisher " is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions . 
 For the timing of introducing the new characters , the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly , with Ramirez explaining that " one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall " , but it was important to take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience , particularly to the people who weren 't already familiar with them . Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock , Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with " amazing stuff " for the season , but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to " completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism . " Ramirez added , 
 It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in , and not vice versa . So , we built it like a Matt story , in terms of what we wanted to put him through , where we wanted to get him , by the end of the season , and what we wanted to have him learn about himself , and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout , to get him there ... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches , how do we watch them ? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here ? Do we divide it right down the middle ? Do we do a three @-@ act structure ? ... If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes , you would absolutely feel a structure , much like in the comics . That ’ s what we did this season . 
 Charlie Cox explained that with Wilson Fisk imprisoned following the first season , season two picks up with " the crime rate [ having ] plummeted . Things have returned to normal , if not better than normal " , which is when Punisher is introduced , who makes Matt Murdock " question everything . Matt has to reevaluate who is [ sic ] and what he does " . Jeph Loeb , head of Marvel Television , said that " if season one was really about Matt ’ s decision to become a hero , then season two really became about what is it to be a hero . " By introducing the Punisher and Elektra , the writers were able to " push and pull " on Murdock , contrasting their three ideologies — the Punisher seeing " justice in a very black @-@ and @-@ white kind of way " , and Elektra living " more in the gray " . On Elektra in particular , Loeb said that she has a very clear , self @-@ motivated agenda , and she challenges Murdock 's own agenda and " quest for justice . Who are you doing this for ? Why are you doing this ? What ’ s the end goal that you ’ re trying to achieve ? "

 Charlie Cox , Deborah Ann Woll , Elden Henson , Rosario Dawson , and Vincent D 'Onofrio return from the first season as Matt Murdock / Daredevil , Karen Page , Franklin " Foggy " Nelson , Claire Temple , and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin , respectively . In June 2015 , Jon Bernthal was cast as Frank Castle / Punisher , and Élodie Yung was cast as Elektra a month later . In September , Stephen Rider joined the cast as Blake Tower . 
 Also returning from season one are Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney , Susan Varon as Josie , Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison , Scott Glenn as Stick , Peter Shinkoda as Nobu Yoshioka , Rob Morgan as Turk Barrett , Matt Gerald as Melvin Potter , Peter McRobbie as <unk> , Amy <unk> as Marci Stahl , Kevin Nagle as Roscoe Sweeney , Wai Ching Ho as Gao , and Suzanne H.

 = = = Design = = = 
 Joshua Shaw designed costumes for characters in the season . Petrie stated that more layers were added to the series ' atmosphere to keep the season dark but provide more clarity to the viewer , an issue that occurred in the first season . Petrie also talked about the costumes for characters such as Elektra , noting that they had to not only look at the comics and " what looks cool " , but also " what would you really fight in ? What would protect you ? ... will people be wearing kick ass costumes in this show ? At some point , everybody does . We promise . But , that said , we want to make them feel as organic and grounded as possible . 
 Lorraine Calvert joined the series as costume designer for the season . On adapting Elektra 's costume for the season , which in the comics usually consists of impractically " <unk> " red cloth , Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing , while still being faithful to the comics . Originally starting out opposite of the eventual sleek design for both her fighting and daytime attire , Calvert said , " Ideas were tossed around about how she was possibly bohemian , [ because ] she was a free spirit who traveled all over the world with as much money as she possibly could . ” This eventually led to the final , sleeker design , because Elektra " really needs a very simple , elegant line because too much cloth is overwhelming . " The costume consisted of " black moto pants , a one @-@ piece zippered body suit , a sleeveless vest , and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra ’ s face . " The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil 's costume , as well as to match the darker tone of the series . Daredevil 's costume was also upgraded in the season , with Calvert calling it " a much more fluid suit and much more tactical in a way . ” The costume department " streamlined " the suit to make it simpler , using less material on the gauntlets and boots . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Production on the season began in July 2015 in East Harlem , with the working title Ringside , and a nine @-@ day @-@ per @-@ episode schedule . Filming ended in December 2015 . Martin Ahlgren joined the series as director of photography for the season , deciding to " go in a slightly different direction " than the first season , but retaining " the yellowish street light color that gave season one a very distinct style " . Ahlgren filmed season two in 4K resolution on RED Dragon cameras , and tried to use in @-@ shot lighting such as lamps and car headlights , as well as " 4 × 4 Light Blankets — flexible sheets of LED that was small enough to fit into tight locations and light enough that it could be taped to a wall , yet outputs a very nice soft light that can be adjusted from daylight to tungsten color " . 
 Ahlgren highlighted the car chase at the beginning of " Guilty as Sin " as a challenge , noting the many ninjas chasing the car , and the one that " jumps up on the car and travels on the roof for a block " , with all the stunts filmed on location . An Ultimate Arm , " a motorized crane mounted on a Porsche Cayenne " , was used for the sequence , a break from the series ' usual handheld and steadicam operations . The chase was shot over two nights in Greenpoint , Brooklyn , with the interior of the car then filmed on a green screen stage , a rarity for the series , " to give the actors a better environment to act in " . 
 On the season 's fight sequences and choreography , Bernthal said , " The fights are all character @-@ driven and the fights tell a story . " Cox added that " there is absolutely an attempt to make sure every punch or kick that is thrown is like a line of dialogue ; there is motive behind it , there is reason behind it , it means something . " Cox 's stunt double , Chris Brewster , explained how the series ' fight choreography has evolved , with the first season having shown Murdock just starting out as a vigilante — " he fought with all heart and soul , but wasn 't a polished fighter .... he was more raw and gritty " — while the second season sees the character having learned from previous mistakes — " his style is more defined and thought out now , but he will always fight with the Daredevil flair " . As for the fighting styles of Punisher and Elektra , Brewster said that because of the Punisher 's military background he uses a lot of weapons , and his " hand to hand style is more of a close quarter combat nature " , while Elektra was trained by Stick and the Hand , so she has similar movement to Daredevil who was also trained by Stick . " However , " Brewster continued , " The Hand are trained assassins who are all about stealth <unk> and quick kills . Her style shows elements of " that as well . The season uses multiple different martial art styles , including kali , Chinese kung fu , wing chun , kenjutsu , and boxing . 
 The one @-@ take fight in " New York 's Finest " in which Daredevil fights gang members down a staircase was described by Cox as " kind of like an homage " to the first season 's well received one @-@ take hallway fight scene , and " almost like that scene on crack " . Silvera noted that it is a metaphorical " descent into Hell " rather than a " test of will " like the first season 's scene . The stunt team had three days to prepare the fight , and the final sequence was filmed in a day and a half . Unlike the first season 's scene , which was shot on a set and used a camera mounted on a ceiling track , the stairwell sequence was filmed on location , and required the camera to be passed around multiple people to get the final shot . The season includes another homage to the hallway scene in " Seven Minutes in Heaven " , where the Punisher has his own hallway fight . Silvera noted that this " full @-@ blown " , murdering Punisher was " a strong contrast to Daredevil " . For all the season 's fights , the stunt team filmed a previsualization version using stunt doubles , with the actors , such as Cox , then shown this in sections on the day of filming , and allowed to make adjustments where necessary . Though the actors completed the majority of the fights , doubles were used for flips and major stunts .

 By September 2015 , John Paesano had begun composing music for the season . He felt that the season 's new showrunners " were true to what we were trying to do in season one . There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge " such as the Punisher and Elektra . He jokingly said that " it ’ s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory , you know ? It ’ s definitely still dark , still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels . " When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra , with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations , he " took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt " and waited to see what the season 's interpretation of the characters would be . Paesano worked closely with the series ' sound design team , spotting episodes with them to coordinate where " we were going to hit what " and " maintain that definable aspect of New York " and its sound . A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally on July 15 , 2016 .

 On references to the larger MCU , Ramirez said " those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun " , but there were times when the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series ' narrative and characters . Petrie stated that the writers wanted to " keep it in Hell 's Kitchen " and focus on issues such as " the air conditioner doesn ’ t work at Nelson and Murdock . That ’ s really what we ’ re interested in . " He explained that the real life New York City " has a larger than life presence " with celebrities that live there — " If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street , that ’ s great , but then you turn the corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel . We want our guys to be real New Yorkers . " The season features the motorcycle gang Dogs of Hell , who were first introduced through their Nevada chapter in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode " Yes Men " , and Roxxon Energy Corporation , a company featured throughout the MCU . It also mentions the vigilantes Jessica Jones and Luke Cage , the death of Oscar Clemons , and the law firm Hogarth , Chao , and <unk> , which are all references to the first season of Jessica Jones .

 Footage from the season was shown at New York Comic Con in October 2015 , and at Comic Con Experience that December . On February 15 , 2016 , the first part of the season trailer was released focusing on the Punisher , while the second part focusing on Elektra was released 10 days later , on February 25 . Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt the first part is " clearly going for a vibe similar to that first full @-@ length Dark Knight teaser back in December of 2007 , with Castle being framed as a natural byproduct of / reaction to Daredevil ’ s own vigilantism " . He also appreciated that it appeared Castle would be presented as a villain , as the previous film adaptions of the character always had Castle " still a hero at the end . " Mendelson 's one drawback to the trailer was when Castle starts " monologue @-@ ing " in the last third , feeling Bernthal " casts such an imposing and grim shadow as a near @-@ silent angel of death that the [ haunting and mythological ] mood is almost broken " . Joanna Robinson at Vanity Fair felt that the premise of the trailer , with Daredevil facing the Punisher , is " right in line with the big superhero trend this spring " , comparing it to Captain America : Civil War and Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , which feature Captain America fighting Iron Man and Batman fighting Superman , respectively . Robinson wondered if , like those films , the season also has a separate , " bigger bad waiting in the wings to unite our vigilantes " that the trailer is hiding . 
 On March 7 , 2016 , the first two episodes of the season premiered in Paris , with a premiere in New York City on March 10 . Also in early March , billboards were erected in Toronto featuring character posters for Daredevil , Punisher and Elektra . The series ' Twitter account encouraged users to vote for which character was their favorite , with the other two receiving blood and bruises added to their billboards .

 The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74 % approval rating with an average rating of 7 @.@ 1 / 10 based on 31 reviews . The website 's critical consensus reads , " Bolstered by some impressive action , Daredevil keeps its footing in season two , even if the additions of Punisher and Elektra can 't quite fill the void left by Wilson Fisk . " Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 68 out of 100 , based on 12 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 Reviewing the first seven episodes , Brian Lowry of Variety said , the season begins " on an uneven note " , comparing some of the early moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah , " complete with slow @-@ motion bullets and blood sprays . Stick with it , though , and the show blossoms , featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra . " Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt the first seven episodes of the season seemed " to have learned the best of both " from season one and Jessica Jones , " placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway , but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them , rather than shout platitudes about saving the city . " He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra , respectively , and enjoyed " the improved spotlight " for Foggy and Karen , given the reduction of Dawson saying , " So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action , and Daredevil 's particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original . " However , Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis @-@ Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season . He concluded that the season 's progression " feels much cleaner " than the first 's , " moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories ... Even the aim feels that much more cohesive , to start in a place of Matt , Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles , but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless . " Merrill Barr of Forbes said , " Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was ... but in the places it isn ’ t , it ’ s also very much improved " . Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher , and noted the reduction in the amount of " thick blacks " in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for . 
 Collider.com 's Chris Cabin also praised the first seven episodes of the season , giving it four stars , and saying that the series " finds overwhelmingly sincere and effective traces of humanity in a genre that has been hard @-@ pressed to feel overtly pre @-@ conceived in its political , societal , and philosophical ideas . " He said Daredevil , like Jessica Jones , " feels like a show that is constantly evolving , and consistently searching for challenges . " Cabin also felt that " the show ’ s use of sound and image to infer or suggest as much as any line of dialogue ... continues to set this series apart from its half @-@ measured kin . " He added that the season " goes to great lengths to make the stakes of " the moral and ethical issues , as seen by pitting Daredevil 's methods against the Punisher , " intensely involving and thrilling , " while also praising the action sequences of the season and the " streamlined focus on character in the writing " , claiming that " none of the [ MCU ] films have even an iota of the seductive intimacy and heart of this show . " Dennis Perkins writing for The A.V. Club awarded the season a " B + " , missing D ’ Onofrio ’ s " towering menace as Wilson Fisk " , but feeling that Bernthal and Yung " make Castle and Elektra an effective season @-@ long two @-@ pronged assault on Matt Murdock ’ s heroic identity , which gives Daredevil 's supporting characters a clearer purpose as well . " IGN reviewer Matt Fowler , after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually , gave the season a 9 @.@ 3 out of 10 , saying that it " excelled at both action and story while giving us a more complex and layered season than the first .... Gone was a notable ' main villain ' , but instead we were given fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung . " 
 Jack Shepherd of The Independent was slightly more critical of the early episodes of the season , saying the ideological battle between Murdock and Castle " is the crux of these first few episodes and also highlights the main problem with Daredevil " pointing out that " there is no real bad guy here " and there " is only so many times you can watch an episode end with Daredevil and Punisher beating each other up before you start thinking there is a glitch in the Matrix . " He also agreed with <unk> regarding Curtis @-@ Hall 's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season . Despite this , Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode , with the introduction of Elektra , capping with episodes six and seven , which he called " by far the season ’ s best , laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead " , while also praising Cox , Henson , Woll , Bernthal and Yung for their performances . Daniel Fienberg , reviewing the first seven episodes for The Hollywood Reporter , expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd , feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D 'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season , or at least " the through @-@ line threat that he presented ... Fortunately , the [ Punisher and Elektra ] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal and maybe the big picture will emerge in the season 's second half . Because of the portrayals of those two characters , he felt " that there 's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don 't involve them " . Despite being " right on the edge of desensitization " regarding the fight scenes , Fienberg still praised them , highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used " vary [ ing ] the dynamic enough " . 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen award the season a " C " , calling it " a straight @-@ up disappointment . " Calling the early episodes with Daredevil 's face @-@ off with the Punisher " skimpy and sluggish from the get @-@ go " , Jensen also added that they were " a flatline of inert drama , with long scenes of windy exposition or dull skulking interrupted by the occasional well @-@ staged if ridiculously gory fight sequence . " Jensen added that " hope for improvement " came with the introduction of Elektra , and that the sixth episode should be a template for the rest of the season , which ultimately , he felt was " stiff and silly . " Daniel D 'Addario for Time was also disappointed with the season , saying , " it ’ s hard not to feel that one is being taken for a long , and not particularly enjoyable , ride ... Daredevil just wants to dole out fun doses of extreme gore on the path to an endpoint on a business plan . Any viewer committed to story is left searching in the dark . " Vulture 's Abraham Riesman joined the criticism , calling the seven episodes reviewed " a dour parade of one cliché after another , recycling themes , images , and rhetoric that audiences have seen countless times before . " Though he wouldn 't call it " bad " , he felt that with all the other superhero content released in the same year , " it feels woefully unnecessary . " However , he did praise Bernthal 's performance , saying it was " another excitingly sympathetic antagonist " after D 'Onofrio 's " standout performance " as Fisk in the first season , but was " nowhere near as fun " . In contrast to the first season of Jessica Jones , which <unk> called Marvel 's " first attempt to depict sex in any kind of realistic way " , he called the second season of Daredevil " astoundingly un @-@ sexy . "

 = Velites = 
 Velites ( singular : <unk> ) were a class of infantry in the Roman army of the mid @-@ Republic . Velites were light infantry and skirmishers who were armed with a number of light javelins ( Latin : hastae <unk> ) to fling at the enemy , and also carried short thrusting swords , or gladii , for use in melee . They rarely wore armour as they were the youngest and poorest soldiers in the legion and could not afford much equipment . They did carry small wooden shields for protection though , and wore a headdress made from wolf skin to allow officers to differentiate between them and other heavier legionaries . 
 Velites did not form their own units ; a number of them were attached to each maniple of hastati , principes and triarii . They were typically used as a screening force , driving off enemy skirmishers and disrupting enemy formations with javelin throws before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier @-@ armed hastati to attack . They were normally the ones who engaged war elephants and chariots if they were present on the field ; their high mobility and ranged weaponry made them much more effective against these enemies than heavy infantry . An early Roman legion contained approximately 1000 velites . Velites were eventually done away with after the Marian reforms . 
 = = Equipment and organization = = 
 Velites were the youngest and usually the poorest soldiers in the legion , and could rarely afford much equipment . They were armed with hastae <unk> , light javelins with tips designed to bend on impact to prevent it being thrown back , similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries . As backup weapons , they also carried gladii , relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres ( 29 inches ) in length that were the main weapons of the hastati and principes . They fought in a very loose , staggered formation like most irregular troops and carried small round shields , 90 cm ( 3 feet ) in diameter . 
 In the legion , the velites were attached to each maniple of hastati , principes and triarii . They usually formed up at the front of the legion before battle to harass the enemy with javelin throws and to prevent the enemy doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack . In a pitched battle , the velites would form up at the front of the legion and cover the advance of the hastati , who were armed with swords , and were the first line of attack . If the hastati failed to break the enemy , they would fall back and let the principes , similarly equipped though more experienced infantry , take over . If the principes failed , they would retire behind the triarii , heavily armoured , spear armed legionaries and let them carry on . 
 = = History = = 
 Velites were descended from an earlier class of light infantry , leves , dating from the Camillan legion of the 5th century BC , who had a very similar role to the velites . They were also the poorer and younger soldiers in the legion , though the rorarii and accensi classes were considerably poorer and were eventually done away with , having insufficient equipment to be effective soldiers . Leves were likewise armed with a number of javelins , but carried a spear rather than a sword . Like the velites , leves did not have their own units , but were attached to units of hastati . 
 Velites were first used at the siege of Capua in 211 BC , and were made up of citizens who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower . They were trained to ride on horseback with the <unk> and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy . After the siege , they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest . 
 With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC , designed to combat a shortage of manpower due to wars against Jugurtha , the different classes of units were done away with entirely . The wealth and age requirements were scrapped . Now soldiers would join as a career , rather than as service to the city , and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same , state purchased equipment . <unk> , local irregular troops , would now be used to fulfill other roles such as archery , skirmishing and flanking . 
 = Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI = 
 Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI ( [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; Indonesian for Treachery of G30S / PKI ) is a 1984 Indonesian docudrama written and directed by Arifin C. Noer , produced by G. Dwipayana , and starring Amoroso Katamsi , Umar Kayam , and Syubah Asa . Produced over a period of two years with a budget of Rp . 800 million , the film was sponsored by Suharto 's New Order government . It was based on an official history of the 30 September Movement ( Gerakan 30 September , or G30S ) coup in 1965 written by Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh , which depicted the coup as being orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia ( Partai Komunis Indonesia , or PKI ) . 
 The film depicts the period leading up to the coup and several days after it . In a time of economic turmoil , six generals are kidnapped and killed by the PKI and Air Force , purportedly to pre @-@ empt a coup against President Sukarno . General Suharto destroys the coup and , afterwards urges the Indonesian populace to commemorate those killed and fight against all forms of communism . The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning " every move to the last detail " , taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals , depictions which have been read as portraying " the state 's enemies as outside the realm of the human " . 
 The first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965 , Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was a commercial and critical success . It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival , winning one , and reached record viewership numbers – although in many cases audiences were required to see the film . It was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse ; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students . Since the fall of Suharto in 1998 , such use of the film has become less common . Although the film 's artistic aspects remain well @-@ received , its misrepresentation of history has been criticised . 
 = = Background = = 
 Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was based on the version of the coup endorsed by Suharto 's New Order government , in which the 30 September Movement ( Gerakan 30 September , or G30S ) coup was orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia ( Partai Komunis Indonesia , or PKI ) . In the early 1960s the PKI and other leftist parties had the support of President Sukarno , giving them great political power . By 1965 the PKI claimed millions of members , a growing number influenced by hyperinflation and widespread poverty . The Army , however , was distrustful of the PKI , a feeling which the PKI reciprocated . 
 On the night of 30 September – 1 October 1965 , a group of Indonesian National Armed Forces members calling themselves the 30 September Movement captured and killed six Army generals thought to belong to an anti @-@ revolutionary " Generals ' Council " , including Commander of the Army Ahmad Yani ; another target , Abdul Haris Nasution , escaped . The bodies , along with those of others captured by the G30S , were dumped down a well at Lubang Buaya , Jakarta . Later that morning , armed forces occupied Merdeka Square in central Jakarta . From the Radio Republik Indonesia ( RRI ) office there , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Untung <unk> of the Presidential Guard announced that the movement had secured several key locations in the city in an attempt to forestall a coup by the Generals ' Council . They also announced that President Sukarno was under their power . The movement 's core leadership , later joined by the President , stayed at Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base . 
 Major @-@ General Suharto , the interim leader after Yani 's death , became aware of the movement on the morning of 1 October . By evening he had convinced a G30S battalion in Merdeka Square and those occupying the RRI building to surrender , without any bloodshed . Army loyalists under Suharto retook Halim Air Force Base early the following morning . By that time the G30S leadership had escaped , while Sukarno had withdrawn to his palace in Bogor . In the years that followed , the Indonesian Army and general populace undertook a campaign of retribution , killing or capturing registered and suspected PKI members – including most of the G30S leadership . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Indonesia is in turmoil . The populace lives in poverty , while the rich flaunt their wealth . President Sukarno ( Umar Kayam ) is ill and may die . Meanwhile , his political concept of Nasakom ( nationalism , religion , and communism ) has promoted an explosive growth in the PKI . The party , which staged a coup in 1948 , has been attacking and killing people throughout the country . The weakened president is also being manipulated by the party . The PKI has manufactured a story , based on the forged Gilchrist Document , that a Generals ' Council is preparing for a coup should Sukarno die . Aidit ( Syubah Asa ) , <unk> , and the Communist Party leadership secretly plan to use this as an excuse for their own coup . The rank and file members of the Party accept the leadership 's explanation and , with the help of " forward @-@ thinking " soldiers and officers ( mostly from the Air Force ) , work to gather the Party 's forces . They plan to kidnap seven generals ( said to be members of the Generals ' Council ) , overtake the city , and secure Sukarno . The newly named G30S begins training . The rightist members of the Army are unaware of this upcoming coup , living happily with their families . By the time they realise that something is amiss , it is too late . 
 On the night of 30 September – 1 October , seven units are sent to kidnap the generals associated with the Council . Nasution manages to escape over a wall , while his attaché Pierre Tendean comes running out , wielding a gun ; Tendean is quickly captured and , when asked where Nasution is , confesses himself to be the general . Yani , who fights back , is killed in his home ; Major General M. T. <unk> meets a similar fate . Chief Military Prosecutor <unk> <unk> , Major General <unk> <unk> , and Lieutenant General Soeprapto are captured . Brigadier General D. I. <unk> goes willingly , but when he prays for too long before entering the truck he is killed . The bodies and prisoners are taken to the G30S / PKI camp in Lubang Buaya , where the survivors are tortured and killed . Their bodies are then thrown into a well . Later that morning , members of the movement take over the RRI office and force the staff there to read a speech by Untung ( Bram <unk> ) , which states that the G30S has moved to forestall a coup by the Generals ' Council and announces the formation of a " Revolutionary Council " . Other G30S / PKI men go to the palace to secure the president but find that he has already left . At Halim , the president speaks with the G30S leaders and declares that he will take full control of the Army . Another radio speech is soon read , outlining the composition of the new Revolutionary Council and announcing changes to Army hierarchy . The G30S leaders begin planning their escape from Halim , to be done before midnight . 
 Suharto ( Amoroso Katamsi ) , awoken early in the morning , denies Untung 's announcement , stating explicitly that there is no Generals ' Council and making an adjunct record notes on the true nature of G30S . As there is a power vacuum with Yani dead , Suharto takes temporary control of the Army and begins planning a counter @-@ assault with his men ; he is , however , unwilling to force a fight . He instead states that he will give a radio announcement , which is delivered after forces loyal to him retake the RRI office ; it outlines the situation , describes G30S as counter @-@ revolutionary , and states that the Army will deal with the coup . The G30S leaders flee Halim , and Suharto 's troops retake the air base . Some time later , forces under Suharto 's leadership attack a G30S / PKI headquarters . While PKI @-@ affiliated soldiers fight , the Party leadership escapes and separates , planning to continue their struggle underground . 
 Suharto is soon called to the secondary palace in Bogor to speak with Sukarno . There , the president says that he has received assurances from Air Marshal Omar Dani that the Air Force was not involved . Suharto refutes the statement , noting that the movement 's arms were like those of the Air Force . The meeting eventually results in Suharto being confirmed as leader of the Army , working together with <unk> <unk> . In their investigation of the events , the Army discovers the camp at Lubang Buaya – including the generals ' bodies , which are recovered while Suharto delivers a speech describing the coup and the PKI 's role in it . The generals are interred elsewhere and Suharto delivers a hagiographic eulogy in which he condemns the G30S and PKI and urges the Indonesian people to continue the fallen generals ' struggle . 
 = = Production = = 
 Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was directed by Arifin C. Noer , a Citra Award @-@ winning director with a background in theatre . He had previous experience in the genre , having made the war film Serangan Fajar ( Dawn Attack ; 1981 ) , which emphasised Suharto 's role in the National Revolution . Noer was assigned to work on the film by the state @-@ owned National Film Production Company ( <unk> Produksi Film Negara , or PPFN ) , which maintained a degree of control over the production . Professors of Indonesian culture Krishna Sen and David T. Hill suggest that Noer 's creative input was minimal . Instead , " for all intents and purposes " the film was the work of its producer , Brigadier @-@ General <unk> Dwipayana , then the head of PPFN and a member of the presidential staff . However , Noer 's wife Jajang C. Noer insists that he had remained independent while making the film . 
 The screenplay for Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was based on a 1968 book by the military historian Nugroho Notosusanto and the investigator Ismail Saleh entitled The Coup Attempt of the 30 September Movement in Indonesia . The book , which was meant to counter foreign theories about the coup , detailed the 30 September Movement as the government viewed it . Only Notosusanto , the higher @-@ ranking of the two authors , was credited for his contribution . In adapting the book Noer read much of the available literature ( including court documents ) and interviewed numerous eyewitnesses ; Jajang , in a 1998 interview , said that her husband had not only read the official government version , but also the controversial Cornell Paper , which portrayed the coup as entirely an internal Army affair . During filming the crew emphasised realism , " paying great attention to detail " and using the generals ' actual homes . 
 Owing to the large number of roles – including some 100 bit parts and more than 10 @,@ 000 extras – casting for Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was difficult . Noer attempted to cast actors who resembled the historical figures depicted ; Rano Karno later recalled that he was rejected for the role of Pierre Tendean as the latter did not have a mole on his face . Ultimately the film starred Bram <unk> as Untung , Amoroso Katamsi as Suharto , Umar Kayam as Sukarno , and Syubah Asa as Aidit ; other actors included Ade Irawan , Sofia W.D. , Dani <unk> , and Charlie Sahetapy . Kayam , then a lecturer at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta , did not have the time to research Sukarno 's mannerisms from his books and speeches ; instead , he portrayed the president based on testimonials from the staff at the Bogor palace . Katamsi , on the other hand , studied Suharto 's role from books and , by the time filming had commenced , felt as if " was Pak Harto , not an imitation of Pak Harto . " Sanusi , meanwhile , considered his own performance underwhelming . 
 Production of Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI , originally titled Sejarah Orde Baru ( History of the New Order ) , took nearly two years , spending four months in pre @-@ production and a year and half in filming . It cost Rp . 800 million , receiving funding from the government . Cinematography was handled by Hasan Basri , with music by Arifin 's brother <unk> C. Noer . Editing was done by <unk> . Parts of the film , particularly the final ten minutes , reused archival footage and newspaper clippings contemporaneous to the events . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI portrays the PKI and communism as inherently evil , with its followers " beyond redemption " , while the G30S leadership are seen as cunning and ruthless , plotting " every move to the last detail " . The historian Katherine McGregor finds this emphasised in the film 's portrayal of the G30S leadership as gangsters , sitting in secret meetings amidst clouds of cigarette smoke . She considers an opening scene , where the PKI attacks an Islamic school , as likewise meant to show the " evil " nature of communists . 
 The PKI are portrayed as enjoying violence , with the film heavily featuring " eye @-@ gouging women and decomposed , tortured bodies " . The generals are kidnapped , and in several cases killed , in front of their families ; later the captured generals are tortured while the communists dance around a bonfire . The sociologist Adrian Vickers suggests that the film 's violence was meant to portray " the state 's enemies as outside the realm of the human " , similar to monsters in horror films . Yoseph <unk> Taum of Sanata Dharma University notes that members of the leftist women 's movement <unk> are shown as part of a " crazy " Communist Party , dancing in the nude and cutting off the general 's penises . However , Vickers considers these portrayals as ambiguous , suggesting that the New Order government was allowed a monopoly on violence . McGregor suggests that the violence in once @-@ tranquil homes shows the " ' destruction ' of the family " . Sen notes the violence belies a " representation of chaos before order " which is common in New Order films . 
 = = Release = = 
 Before its commercial release , Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was pre @-@ screened for high @-@ ranking military officers who had been involved in stopping the coup , including Suharto and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo . The film was released in 1984 , the first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965 . It was seen by 699 @,@ 282 people in Jakarta by the end of 1984 , a national record which remained unbroken for over a decade . However , not all audiences attended of their own volition . The Indonesian sociologist Ariel <unk> records students as being " required to pay " to see the film during school hours , a fact not reflected in contemporary records . A novelisation by popular writer <unk> <unk> likewise helped promote the film . 
 Dwipayana 's influence ensured that contemporary reviews , especially synopses , repeated the government 's position on the G30S coup . This is not to say all reviews were positive . <unk> of Kompas , for instance , found that Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was highly detailed , with extensive work and quality acting going to represent events accurately . He felt , however , that the film felt too long and , as viewers knew instantly who the good and bad characters were , it became " nothing but a black @-@ and @-@ white portrait without any complex issues " , which ignored the underlying problems which had sparked the G30S movement . 
 Suharto , after viewing an early screening , stated that the story was unfinished and suggested that a sequel was necessary . Two sequels by PPFN , Operasi Trisula ( Operation Trisula ; 1987 ) and Djakarta 1966 ( Jakarta 1966 ; 1988 ) , followed . Operasi Trisula , directed by BZ <unk> , dealt with the extermination of G30S and PKI members in Blitar , East Java . Djakarta 1966 , meanwhile , was directed by Noer and showed the lead @-@ up to the signing of Supersemar on 11 March 1966 , in which Sukarno gave Suharto authority to take whatever measures he " deemed necessary " ; Kayam and Katamsi reprised their roles for the latter film , which won seven awards at the 1989 Bandung Film Festival . 
 = = Propaganda use = = 
 Beginning in 1984 the New Order government used Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI as a propaganda vehicle , showing it annually on 30 September . The film was broadcast by the state @-@ owned network TVRI , and later on private television stations after they were established . It was also shown at schools and government institutions ; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group . Because of this use , Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI is the most @-@ broadcast and most @-@ watched Indonesian film of all time . A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97 per cent of the 1 @,@ 101 students surveyed had seen the film ; 87 per cent of them had seen it more than once . 
 During the remainder of the 1980s and early 1990s the historical accuracy of Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI was little disputed , and the film became representative of canonical history ; its version of the 1965 events was the only one allowed in open discourse . By the mid @-@ 1990s , however , anonymous internet communities and small publications had begun questioning the movie 's contents ; one online message , sent anonymously through a mailing list , asked " If only a small section of the PKI leadership and military agents knew about [ the coup , as in the film ] , how is it that over a million people were killed and thousands of people who knew nothing had to be imprisoned , exiled , and lost their civil rights ? " <unk> suggests that this resulted from an unintended polyphony in the film , while Sen and Hill opine that Noer may have been aware of the government 's intent for propaganda and thus made the film 's political message " obviously contradictory " . 
 In September 1998 , four months after the fall of Suharto , the Information Minister Yunus <unk> declared that the film would no longer be compulsory viewing material , reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto in the centre . Tempo reported in 2012 that Saleh <unk> of the Air Force had influenced this decree . The magazine stated that <unk> had called the Education Minister <unk> <unk> and asked him to not screen Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI , as it was damaging to the Air Force . Two other films , Janur Kuning ( Yellow Coconut Leaves ; 1979 ) and Serangan Fajar , were likewise affected by the decree ; Janur Kuning portrayed Suharto as the hero behind the 1 March 1949 General Assault while Serangan Fajar showed him as a major hero of the revolution . At the time it was suggested that TVRI was attempting to distance itself from the former president . This occurred in a period of <unk> symbols related to the events , and by the early 2000s non @-@ government versions of the G30S coup were easily available in Indonesia . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI has proven Noer 's most controversial film , although until his death in 1995 the director remained publicly ambivalent . The film 's visuals have generally received positive reviews , but its use for propaganda and historical accuracy have been widely condemned . The Indonesian director Hanung Bramantyo praised the film 's style , stating that close @-@ up shots of men smoking were " brilliant " and that , at times , he felt " it 's not a film . But real ! " The director Monty Tiwa likewise praised the film 's shots , citing a scene where <unk> 's daughter cries hysterically as her father is shot as " full of drama and using a shot [ he had ] never seen before in an Indonesian film " . Sen and Hill , however , find " none of the aesthetic hallmarks " of the director 's other works . 
 Hilmar Farid , an Indonesian historian , called the film propaganda mixed with " some [ of the New Order 's ] fantasies " . The reporter Hendro Subroto , who recorded the retrieval of the generals ' bodies from Lubang Buaya , criticised the film 's accuracy in 2001 ; he stated that the bodies did not show any evidence of torture . The former Lekra writer Putu Oka <unk> , meanwhile , described the film as underplaying the suffering of PKI members and other leftists in the events following the G30S coup , thus becoming " a lie to the people " . The historian John Roosa contrasts the portrayal of the G30S leadership with a document by Brigadier General M.A. <unk> , which portrays the coup – led by " flummoxed , indecisive , and disorganized " men – as largely defeating itself . 
 In a 2012 interview , Katamsi admitted the film was in part overacted and that it had been a potent way to spread and indoctrinate viewers in the New Order 's ideology . The Tempo survey suggested that it was effective propaganda , leading viewers to " reject all that smelled of the PKI and communism " . Although it is no longer broadcast on 30 September , the film remains available . A video CD edition was released by Virgo in 2001 and the G30S / PKI museum at Lubang Buaya offers regular screenings in an on @-@ site cinema . Both a 35 mm and VHS copy are stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta .

 Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI received seven nominations at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival ( Festival Film Indonesia , or FFI ) , winning one Citra Award for Best Screenplay . It was beaten in four categories , for Best Director , Best Cinematography , Best Leading Actor , and Best Musical Direction , by Sjumandjaja 's Budak Nafsu ( Slave to Passion ) , while Slamet Rahardjo 's Ponirah Terpidana ( Ponirah Convicted ) took Best Artistic Direction . At the 1985 FFI Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI received an <unk> Award as the best @-@ selling film of the preceding calendar year . The film scholar Thomas Barker suggests that the film 's awards were , in part , a conjunction of state and FFI interests : both were focused on promoting a united national culture .

 Louise Nevelson ( September 23 , 1899 – April 17 , 1988 ) was an American sculptor known for her monumental , monochromatic , wooden wall pieces and outdoor sculptures . 
 Born in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian Empire ( present @-@ day Ukraine ) , she emigrated with her family to the United States in the early 20th century . Nevelson learned English at school , as she spoke Yiddish at home . 
 By the early 1930s she was attending art classes at the Art Students League of New York , and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition . A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross , Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects , and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her <unk> to sculpture . Usually created out of wood , her sculptures appear puzzle @-@ like , with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces , often 3 @-@ D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white . A figure in the international art scene , Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale . Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations . Nevelson remains one of the most important figures in 20th @-@ century American sculpture . 
 = = Early personal life = = 
 Louise Nevelson was born Leah <unk> in 1899 in <unk> , Poltava Governorate , Russian Empire , to Minna Sadie and Isaac <unk> , a contractor and lumber merchant . Even though the family lived comfortably , Nevelson 's relatives had begun to leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s . The <unk> had to stay behind , as Isaac , the youngest brother , had to care for his parents . While still in Europe , Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson 's siblings : Nathan ( born 1898 ) and Anita ( 1902 ) . On his mother 's death , Isaac moved to the United States in 1902 . After he left , Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area . According to family lore , young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father 's departure that she became mute for six months . 
 In 1905 , Minna and the children emigrated to the United States , where they joined Isaac in Rockland , Maine . Isaac initially struggled to establish himself there , suffering from depression while the family settled into their new home . He worked as a woodcutter before opening a junkyard . His work as a lumberjack made wood a consistent presence in the family household , a material that would figure prominently in Nevelson 's work . Eventually he became a successful lumberyard owner and realtor . The family had another child , Lillian , in 1906 . Nevelson was very close to her mother , who suffered from depression , a condition believed to be brought on by the family 's migration from Russia and their minority status as a Jewish family living in Maine . Minna overly compensated for this , dressing herself and the children up in clothing " regarded as sophisticated in the Old Country " . Her mother wore flamboyant outfits with heavy make @-@ up ; Nevelson described her mother 's " dressing up " as " art , her pride , and her job " , also describing her as someone who should have lived " in a palace " . 
 Nevelson 's first experience of art was at the age of nine at the Rockland Public Library , where she saw a plaster cast of Joan of Arc . Shortly thereafter she decided to study art , taking drawing in high school , where she also served as basketball captain . She painted watercolor interiors , in which furniture appeared molecular in structure , rather like her later professional work . Female figures made frequent appearances . In school , she practiced her English , her second language , as Yiddish was spoken at home . Unhappy with her family 's economic status , language differences , the religious discrimination of the community , and her school , Nevelson set her sights on moving to high school in New York . 
 She graduated from high school in 1918 , and began working as a stenographer at a local law office . There she met Bernard Nevelson , co @-@ owner with his brother Charles of the Nevelson Brothers Company , a shipping business . Bernard introduced her to his brother , and Charles and Louise Nevelson were married in June 1920 in a Jewish wedding at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston . Having satisfied her parent 's hope that she would marry into a wealthy family , she and her new husband moved to New York City , where she began to study painting , drawing , singing , acting and dancing . She also became pregnant , and in 1922 she gave birth to her son Myron ( later called Mike ) , who grew up to be a sculptor . Nevelson studied art , despite the disapproval of her parents @-@ in @-@ law . She commented : " My husband 's family was terribly refined . Within that circle you could know Beethoven , but God forbid if you were Beethoven . " 
 In 1924 the family moved to Mount Vernon , New York , a popular Jewish area of Westchester County . Nevelson was upset with the move , which removed her from city life and her artistic environment . During the winter of 1932 – 1933 she separated from Charles , unwilling to becoming the socialite wife he expected her to be . She never sought financial support from Charles , and in 1941 the couple divorced .

 Starting in 1929 , Nevelson studied art full @-@ time under Kenneth Hayes Miller and <unk> Nicolaides at the Art Students League . Nevelson credited an exhibition of Noh kimonos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a catalyst for her to study art further . In 1931 she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe , paying for the trip by selling a diamond bracelet that her now ex @-@ husband had given her on the occasion of Mike 's birth . In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France . Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied under Hofmann , who was serving as a guest instructor at the Art Students League . She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Plaza . The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera 's wife , Frida Kahlo , an artist Nevelson greatly admired . Shortly thereafter , Nevelson started taking Chaim Gross 's sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance . She continued to experiment with other artistic mediums , including lithography and etching , but decided to focus on sculpture . Her early works were created from plaster , clay and <unk> . During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows . In 1935 , she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) . She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939 . For several years , the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace to keep warm ; the firewood she found served as the starting point for the art that made her famous . Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture , painting and drawing . Early ink and pencil drawings of nudes show the same fluidity seen in the works of Henri Matisse . Nevelson also created terra @-@ cotta semi @-@ abstract animals and oil paintings . 
 = = = First exhibitions and the 1940s = = = 
 In 1941 , Nevelson had her first solo exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery . Gallery owner Karl Nierendorf represented her until his death in 1947 . During her time at Nierendorf , Nevelson came across a shoeshine box owned by local shoeshiner Joe Milone . She displayed the box at the Museum of Modern Art , bringing her the first major attention she received from the press . An article about her appeared in Art Digest in November 1943 . In the 1940s , she began producing Cubist figure studies in materials such as stone , bronze , terra cotta , and wood . In 1943 , she had a show at <unk> Gallery called " The Clown as the Center of his World " in which she constructed sculptures about the circus from found objects . The show was not well received , and Nevelson stopped using found objects until the mid @-@ 1950s . Despite poor reception , Nevelson 's works at this time explored both figurative abstracts inspired by Cubism and the exploitative and experimental influence of Surrealism . The decade provided Nevelson with the materials , movements , and self @-@ created experiments that would mold her signature modernist style in the 1950s . 
 = = = Mid @-@ career = = = 
 During the 1950s , Nevelson exhibited her work as often as possible . Yet despite awards and growing popularity with art critics , she continued to struggle financially . To make ends meet she began teaching sculpture classes in adult education programs in the Great Neck public school system . Her own work began to grow to monumental size , moving beyond the human scale sized works she had been creating during the early 1940s . Nevelson also visited Latin America , and discovered influences for her work in Mayan ruins and the steles of Guatemala . In 1955 Nevelson joined Colette Roberts ' Grand Central Modern Gallery , where she had numerous one @-@ woman shows . There she exhibited some of her most notable mid @-@ century works : Bride of the Black Moon , First Personage , and the exhibit " Moon Garden + One " , which showed her first wall piece , Sky Cathedral , in 1958 . The 1958 series of exhibitions were described by critic Hilton Kramer as " remarkable and unforgettable . " That year the Museum of Modern Art purchased one of Nevelson 's Sky Cathedral works , and in 1959 Nevelson was included in MoMA 's Sixteen Americans exhibition . During this period , she painted her wood black and put on entirely black shows . In the early 1960s , she began creating white and gold pieces , and enclosing her small sculptures in wooden boxes . The change in scale of her sculptures , the influence of Latin American ancient art , and her gallery activity during this time is credited with bringing " Nevelson 's sculpture in league with the grand scale of Abstract Expressionist painting , as well as the earlier mural painting of Rivera . " 
 From 1957 to 1958 , she was president of the New York Chapter of Artists ' Equity and in 1958 she joined the Martha Jackson Gallery , where she was guaranteed income and became financially secure . That year , she was photographed and featured on the cover of Life . In 1960 she had her first one @-@ woman show in Europe at Galerie Daniel Cordier in Paris . Later that year a collection of her work , grouped together as " Dawn 's Wedding Feast " , was included in the group show , " Sixteen Americans " , at the Museum of Modern Art alongside Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns . In 1962 she made her first museum sale to the Whitney Museum of American Art , who purchased the black wall , Young Shadows . That same year , her work was selected for the 31st Venice Biennale and she became national president of Artists ' Equity , serving until 1964 . 
 In 1962 she left Martha Jackson Gallery for a brief stint at the Sidney Janis Gallery . After an unsuccessful first show in which none of her work sold , Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her and was unable to recoup . Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke , depressed , and at risk of becoming homeless . However , at this time Nevelson was offered a funded , six @-@ week artist fellowship at Tamarind <unk> Workshop ( now Tamarind Institute ) in Los Angeles , which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City . She explained , " I wouldn 't ordinarily have gone . I didn 't care so much about the idea of prints at that time but I desperately needed to get out of town and all of my expenses were paid . " 
 At Tamarind , Nevelson made twenty @-@ six lithographs and became the most productive artist to complete the fellowship up until that time . The lithographs she created were some of her most creative graphic work , using unconventional materials like cheese cloth , lace , and textiles on the lithographic stone to create interesting textural effects . With fresh creative inspiration and replenished funds , Nevelson returned to New York in better personal and professional circumstances . She joined Pace Gallery in the fall of 1963 , where she had shows regularly until the end of her career . In 1967 the Whitney Museum hosted the first retrospective of Nevelson 's work , showing over one hundred pieces , including drawings from the 1930s and contemporary sculptures . In 1964 she created two works : Homage to 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 I and Homage to 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 II as a tribute to victims of The Holocaust . Nevelson hired several assistants over the years : Teddy Haseltine , Tom Kendall , and Diana <unk> , who helped in the studio and handled daily affairs . By this time , Nevelson had solidified commercial and critical success . 
 = = = Later career and life = = = 
 Nevelson continued to utilize wood in her sculptures , but also experimented with other materials such as aluminum , plastic and metal . Black Zag X from 1969 , in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist 's all @-@ black assemblages incorporating the plastic , Formica . In the fall of 1969 , she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture . After completion of her first outdoor sculptures , Nevelson stated : " Remember , I was in my early seventies when I came into monumental outdoor sculpture ... I had been through the enclosures of wood . I had been through the shadows . I had been through the enclosures and come out into the open . " Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor @-@ ten steel , which she described as a " blessing " . She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size . These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry . Nevelson 's public art commissions were a monetary success , but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport states that these pieces were not Nevelson 's strongest works , and that Nevelson 's " intuitive gesture " is not evident in the large steel works . 
 In 1973 the Walker Art Center curated a major exhibition of her work , which traveled for two years . In 1975 she designed the chapel of St. Peter 's Lutheran Church in midtown Manhattan . When asked about her role as a Jewish artist creating Christian @-@ themed art , Nevelson stated that her abstract work transcended religious barriers . Also in 1975 , she created and installed a large wood sculpture titled Bicentennial Dawn at the new James A. Byrne United States Courthouse in Philadelphia . During the last half of her life , Nevelson solidified her fame and her persona , cultivating a personal style for her " petite yet flamboyant " self that contributed to her legacy : dramatic dresses , scarves and large false eyelashes . When Alice Neel asked Nevelson how she dressed so beautifully , Nevelson replied " Fucking , dear , fucking " , in reference to her sexually liberated lifestyle . The designer Arnold <unk> created many of her clothes . Nevelson died on April 17 , 1988 . 
 At the time of his death in 1995 , her friend Willy <unk> was working on a book about Nevelson . 
 = = Style and works = = 
 When Nevelson was developing her style , many of her artistic colleagues – Alexander Calder , David Smith , Theodore Roszak – were welding metal to create their large @-@ scale sculptures . Nevelson decided to go in the opposite direction , exploring the streets for inspiration and finding it in wood . Nevelson 's most notable sculptures are her walls ; wooden , wall @-@ like collage driven reliefs consisting of multiple boxes and compartments that hold abstract shapes and found objects from chair legs to balusters . Nevelson described these immersive sculptures as " environments " . The wooden pieces were also cast @-@ off scraps , pieces found in the streets of New York . While Marcel Duchamp caused uproar with his Fountain , which was not accepted as " art " at the time of its release due to Duchamp 's attempt to mask the urinals true form , Nevelson took found objects and by spray painting them she disguised them of their actual use or meaning . Nevelson called herself " the original <unk> " owing to her extensive use of discarded objects , and credited Pablo Picasso for " giving us the cube " that served as the groundwork for her cubist @-@ style sculpture . She found strong influence in Picasso and Hofmann 's cubist ideals , describing the Cubist movement as " one of the greatest <unk> that the human mind has ever come to . " She also found influence in Native American and Mayan art , dreams , the cosmos and archetypes . 
 As a student of Hans Hofmann she was taught to practice her art with a limited palette , using colors such as black and white , to " discipline " herself . These colors would become part of Nevelson 's repertoire . She spray painted her walls black until 1959 . Nevelson described black as the " total color " that " means totality . It means : contains all ... it contained all color . It wasn 't a negation of color . It was an acceptance . Because black encompasses all colors . Black is the most aristocratic color of all . The only aristocratic color ... I have seen things that were transformed into black , that took on greatness . I don 't want to use a lesser word . " In the 1960s she began incorporating white and gold into her works . Nevelson said that white was the color that " summoned the early morning and emotional promise . " She described her gold phase as the " baroque phase " , inspired by the idea being told as a child that America 's streets would be " paved with gold " , the materialism and hedonism of the color , the sun , and the moon . Nevelson revisited the Noh robes and the gold coin collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration . 
 Through her work , Nevelson often explored the themes of her complicated past , factious present , and anticipated future . A common symbol that appears in Nevelson 's work is the bride , as seen in Bride of the Black Moon ( 1955 ) . The symbol of the bride referred to Nevelson 's own escape from matrimony in her early life , and her own independence as a woman throughout the rest of her life . Her Sky Cathedral works often took years to create ; Sky Cathedral : Night Wall , in the collection of the Columbus Museum of Art , took 13 years to build in her New York City studio . On the Sky Cathedral series , Nevelson commented : " This is the Universe , the stars , the moon – and you and I , everyone . " 
 Nevelson 's work has been exhibited in a number of galleries , including the Anita <unk> Gallery in New York City , Margot Gallery in Lake Worth , Florida , and Woodward Gallery in New York .

 Louise Nevelson constructed her sculpture much as she constructed her past : shaping each with her legendary sense of self as she created an extraordinary iconography through abstract means . – The Jewish Museum , 2007 
 A sculpture garden , Louise Nevelson Plaza ( 40 @.@ 7076 ° N 74 @.@ 0080 ° W ﻿ / 40 @.@ 7076 ; <unk> ) , is located in downtown New York City and features a collection of works by Nevelson . Nevelson donated her papers in several installments from 1966 to 1979 . They are fully digitized and in the collection of the Archives of American Art . The Farnsworth Art Museum , in Nevelson 's childhood home of Rockland , Maine , houses the second largest collection of her works , including jewelry she designed . In 2000 , the United States Postal Service released a series of commemorative postage stamps in Nevelson 's honor . The following year , friend and playwright Edward Albee wrote the play <unk> as a homage to the sculptor . The show opened in New York in 2002 with Anne Bancroft playing Nevelson , but it never moved beyond previews owing to Bancroft 's illness . Nevelson 's distinct and eccentric image has been documented by photographers such as Robert Mapplethorpe , Richard Avedon , Hans Namuth and Pedro E. Guerrero . Nevelson is listed on the Heritage Floor , among other famous women , in Judy Chicago 's 1974 – 1979 masterpiece The Dinner Party . 
 Upon Nevelson 's death her estate was worth at least $ 100 million . Her son , Mike Nevelson , removed 36 sculptures from her house . Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works , worth millions , to her friend and assistant of 25 years Diana MacKown , yet Mike Nevelson claimed otherwise . Proceedings began about the estate and will , which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown . There was talk of a potential <unk> case , but despite public speculation that the two women were lovers , MacKown maintained that she had never had a sexual relationship with Nevelson , as did Mike Nevelson . 
 In 2005 , Maria Nevelson , the youngest granddaughter , established the Louise Nevelson Foundation , a non @-@ profit <unk> ( 3 ) . Its mission is to educate the public and celebrate the life and work of Louise Nevelson .

 I 'm not a feminist . I 'm an artist who happens to be a woman . – Louise Nevelson 
 Louise Nevelson has been a fundamental key in the feminist art movement . Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art , Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark , monumental , masculine and totem @-@ like artworks . Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual , not " masculine @-@ feminine labels " , and chose to take on her role as an artist , not specifically a female artist . Reviews of Nevelson 's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist . A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated : " We learned the artist is a woman , in time to check our enthusiasm . Had it been otherwise , we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns . " Another review was similar in its sexism : " Nevelson is a sculptor ; she comes from Portland , Maine . You 'll deny both these facts and you might even insist Nevelson is a man , when you see her Portraits in Paint , showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery . " 
 Even with her influence upon future generations of feminist artists , Nevelson 's opinion of discrimination within the art world bordered on the belief that artists who were not gaining success based on gender suffered from a lack of confidence . When asked by Feminist Art Journal if she suffered from sexism within the art world , Nevelson replied " I am a woman 's liberation . " 
 = Battle of Coral – Balmoral = 
 The Battle of Coral – Balmoral ( 12 May – 6 June 1968 ) was a series of actions fought during the Vietnam War between the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) and the North Vietnamese 7th Division and Viet Cong Main Force units , 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north @-@ east of Saigon . Following the defeat of the communist Tet offensive in January and February , in late April two Australian infantry battalions — the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment ( RAR ) — with supporting arms , were again deployed from their base at Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province to positions astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict renewed movement against the capital . Part of the wider allied Operation Toan Thang I , it was launched in response to intelligence reports of another impending communist offensive , yet the Australians experienced little fighting during this period . Meanwhile , the Viet Cong successfully penetrated the capital on 5 May , plunging Saigon into chaos during the May Offensive in an attempt to influence the upcoming Paris peace talks scheduled to begin on the 13th . During three days of intense fighting the attacks were repelled by US and South Vietnamese forces , and although another attack was launched by the Viet Cong several days later , the offensive was again defeated with significant losses on both sides , causing extensive damage to Saigon and many civilian casualties . By 12 May the fighting was over , and the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were forced to withdraw having suffered heavy casualties . US casualties were also heavy and it proved to be their most costly week of the war . 
 1 ATF was redeployed on 12 May to obstruct the withdrawal of forces from the capital , with two battalions establishing a fire support base named FSB Coral , just east of Lai Khe in Binh Duong Province , in an area of operations known as AO Surfers . However , poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning led to delays and confusion during the fly @-@ in , and the Australians had only partially completed FSB Coral by the evening . The North Vietnamese mounted a number of battalion @-@ sized assaults on the night of 12 / 13 May , with a heavy bombardment from 03 : 30 signalling the start . Exploiting the disorganised defence to penetrate the Australian perimeter , the North Vietnamese 141st Regiment temporarily captured a forward gun position during close @-@ quarters fighting , before being repulsed by superior firepower the following morning . Casualties were heavy on both sides and although the Australians had won a convincing victory , they had come close to suffering both a political and military defeat at the hands of the North Vietnamese . The following day 1 RAR was deployed to defend FSB Coral , while 3 RAR established FSB Coogee to the west to ambush staging areas and infiltration routes . Coral was again assaulted in the early hours of 16 May , coming under a heavy barrage followed by another regimental @-@ sized attack . Again the base was penetrated but after a six @-@ hour battle the North Vietnamese were forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses . Expecting further fighting , the Australians were subsequently reinforced with Centurion tanks and additional artillery . On 22 May , FSB Coral was again attacked overnight , coming under a short but accurate mortar bombardment which was broken up by Australian artillery and mortars . 
 The Australians then moved against the communist base areas east of Route 16 , with 3 RAR redeploying to establish FSB Balmoral on 24 May , 4 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) to the north . Now supported by tanks which had arrived from Coral just hours before , the infantry at Balmoral were subjected to a two @-@ battalion attack by the North <unk> 165th Regiment . Following a rocket and mortar barrage at 03 : 45 on 26 May , the attack fell primarily on D Company before being repelled with heavy casualties by the combined firepower of the tanks and infantry . The next day the Australians at Coral assaulted a number of bunkers that had been located just outside the base , with a troop of Centurions supported by infantry destroying the bunkers and their occupants without loss . A second major North Vietnamese attack , again of regimental strength , was made against Balmoral at 02 : 30 on 28 May but was called off after 30 minutes after being soundly defeated by the supporting fire of the tanks , artillery and mortars . Regardless , the battle continued into June as the Australians patrolled their area of operations . However , with contacts decreasing , 1 ATF returned to Nui Dat on 6 June , being relieved by US and South Vietnamese forces . The battle was the first time the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army units operating in regimental strength in conventional warfare . During 26 days of fighting the communists sustained heavy losses and were forced to postpone a further attack on Saigon , while 1 ATF also suffered significant casualties . The largest unit @-@ level action of the war for the Australians , today the battle is considered one of the most famous actions fought by the Australian Army during the Vietnam War . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Military situation = = = 
 Based in Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province , the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) was part of US II Field Force , Vietnam ( <unk> ) , under the overall command of Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand . By early 1968 , 1 ATF had been reinforced and was at full strength with three infantry battalions supported by armour , artillery , aviation and engineers , while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group ( 1 <unk> ) based at the port of Vung Tau . Commanded by Brigadier Ron Hughes , 1 ATF had continued to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy , and while the war had become a series of large @-@ scale search @-@ and @-@ destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans , the Australians had largely pursued their own counter @-@ insurgency campaign despite the differences between Australian and American methods at times producing friction between the allies . Regardless , 1 ATF was also available for deployment elsewhere in the III Corps Tactical Zone and with the province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the Australians would increasingly spend a significant period of time conducting operations further afield . 
 The Tet offensive began on 31 January 1968 , with 85 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops simultaneously assaulting population centres and allied installations across South Vietnam in an attempt to incite a general uprising against the South Vietnamese government and its American supporters . In response , 1 ATF was deployed along likely infiltration routes in order to defend the vital Bien Hoa @-@ Long Binh complex near Saigon between January and March , as part of Operation Coburg . Heavy fighting resulted in 17 Australians killed and 61 wounded , while communist casualties included at least 145 killed , 110 wounded and five captured , with many more removed from the battlefield . Meanwhile , the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy were stretched thin , with elements of 3 RAR successfully repelling an assault on Ba Ria and later spoiling a harassing attack on Long Dien and conducting a sweep of Hoa Long , killing 50 Viet Cong and wounding 25 for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded . 
 At the strategic level the general uprising never eventuated , and in late @-@ February the communist offensive collapsed after suffering more than 45 @,@ 000 killed , against South Vietnamese and allied losses of 6 @,@ 000 men . Regardless , it proved to be a turning point in the war and although it had been a tactical disaster for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong , Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory as confidence in the American military and political leadership collapsed , as did public support for the war in the United States . Prior to Tet , American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war , arguing that General William Westmoreland 's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced . Yet the scale of the offensive , and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched , had shocked the American public and contradicted such predictions of imminent victory ; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would no longer seek a second term in office . Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion , and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia . Amid the initial shock , Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8 @,@ 000 personnel . 
 On the ground , the war continued without respite and Hughes — the 1 ATF commander — turned his attention to D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion , deciding to strike at its base areas in the Minh Dam Secret Zone located in the Long Hai hills south of Long Dien and Dat Do , 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) from Nui Dat . The 5th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 5 RAR ) had suffered heavy casualties in February 1967 while operating in the Long Hais , which were heavily defended by mines and booby traps ; despite previous operations by the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in June 1966 and two smaller South Vietnamese operations , the area had remained a Viet Cong safe haven . However , this time the Australians would use two battalions supported by tanks and air strikes in an attempt to reduce the base area . Operation <unk> began on 27 February , with 2 RAR and 3 RAR <unk> off the complex with the rifle companies patrolling and ambushing at night in order to prevent the Viet Cong from escaping . On 8 March the Australians conducted a wide encircling movement to tighten the cordon , while a sustained bombardment by US B @-@ 52 heavy bombers and artillery targeted the hill the next day . A combined force of infantry from 3 RAR supported by armour then advanced on the foothills , before clearing the minefields and destroying an extensive base area which included a deep cave system that had first been used by the Viet Minh against the French in the 1950s . Each Australian rifle company then methodically searched its area of operations , while engineers destroyed the underground facilities ; a task which required the use of tonnes of explosives . 
 The operation lasted until 15 April , with mines — including many M16s that had been lifted by the Viet Cong from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians at Dat Do — once again claiming a significant toll . Ten Australians were killed and another 36 were wounded , while known Viet Cong casualties included 21 killed , 14 wounded and 40 captured . Fifty @-@ seven camps and bunker systems were also destroyed , as were large quantities of weapons , munitions and supplies . Judged a success by the Australians despite their heavy losses , the operation had resulted in significant disruption to the Viet Cong and hindered their operations for some time . Regardless , with 1 ATF lacking the manpower to hold the area , the failure of South Vietnamese forces to permanently occupy the Long Hais meant that any gains were only fleeting , and the D445 Battalion headquarters soon returned to the area after ejecting a South Vietnamese regional force company a few months later . Meanwhile , 7 RAR had finished its last operation in March and was relieved by 1 RAR on 9 April , returning to Australia having completed its twelve @-@ month tour .

 Despite their losses during the previous fighting , the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong appeared to have gained the initiative . Indeed , although the Tet offensive had devastated the Viet Cong , costing them about half their strength in the south , the Defense Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam — General Vo Nguyen Giap — had moved quickly to replace these losses with reinforcements , and by early May 15 @,@ 000 North Vietnamese soldiers were serving in Viet Cong units in South Vietnam . On 8 April , Westmoreland launched a series of large @-@ scale sweeps involving over 70 @,@ 000 South Vietnamese , American , Australian , New Zealand and Thai troops , code @-@ named Operation Toan Thang I. Meanwhile , on 5 May the Viet Cong launched attacks against 119 provincial and district capitals , military installations and major cities during the May Offensive in an attempt to gain an advantage at the first session of peace negotiations scheduled to begin in Paris on the 13th . Saigon was successfully infiltrated in an event that received widespread international media coverage and resulted in considerable embarrassment for the Americans and their allies , with as many as five of the 13 attacking Viet Cong battalions penetrating the city 's outer defences , plunging the capital into chaos and resulting in heavy civilian casualties . After three days of intense fighting American and South Vietnamese forces successfully repelled the assault while , as the peace talks neared , a fresh wave of attacks was launched on Saigon several days later . However , by 12 May the fighting was over , and the communists were forced to withdraw having suffered more than 5 @,@ 500 dead in just over one week of fighting . US casualties were also heavy , amounting to 652 killed and 2 @,@ 225 wounded , which made it the most costly week of the war for the Americans . 
 The Australians were initially employed on operations inside Phuoc Tuy Province during Operation Toan Thang I. Viet Cong activity in their traditional base areas in the Hat Dich north of Nui Thi Vai hills , had been increasing in February and March and 3 RAR subsequently commenced operations along the north @-@ western border of Phuoc Tuy Province on 21 April . These operations resulted in little contact . In light of this , the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam — Major General Arthur MacDonald — believed that the task force would be better employed against North Vietnamese conventional forces , rather than in local pacification operations ; later , following a request from Weyand , 1 ATF would again redeploy outside the province . As such , in an operation similar to those three months earlier at Bien Hoa , it was planned that 1 ATF would be used to help block infiltration towards Saigon . Overall responsibility for the defence of the capital was assigned to US <unk> , and included the US 1st , 9th and 25th Divisions , as well as the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade , 1 ATF , and a number of South Vietnamese units . The main deployment began on 25 April in response to intelligence reports of another impending offensive , with 1 ATF headquarters established at the American base at Bearcat , while 2 RAR and 3 RAR deployed to the Bien Hoa @-@ Long Khanh border to block likely infiltration routes east of the large American base complex at Long Binh , which included the airbase at Bien Hoa and the large Long Binh Logistics Depot . Meanwhile , the task force base at Nui Dat was defended by one infantry battalion , a squadron of tanks and the remainder of the cavalry . The SAS squadron also remained in Phuoc Tuy during this period , continuing reconnaissance and surveillance operations in the province . 
 2 RAR was tasked with patrolling and ambushing tracks and likely rocket @-@ launching sites to disrupt the expected attack against Saigon . The battalion established FSB Hunt , and conducted a number of small but successful ambushes . Meanwhile , 3 RAR established FSB Evans and conducted search @-@ and @-@ ambush operations before returning to Nui Dat on 3 May after being replaced by 1 RAR , which then joined 2 RAR for a sweep . In response to the attacks on Saigon , elements of 1 ATF redeployed on 5 May , relieving the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade in an area of operations ( AO ) known as AO Columbus so that it could be released for operations elsewhere , with companies from both battalions deploying to ambush suspected infiltration routes in the expectation of an attack by the 274th Regiment from the Viet Cong 5th Division . Five days later 2 RAR was relieved by 3 RAR , having completed its last major operation before returning to Australia . The Australians waited for the Viet Cong to make their move , but they again proved elusive and contact was only light , and by 10 May just six had been killed and one wounded after 21 days of operations . Having missed the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese units as they infiltrated the capital , it was planned that the Australians would be again redeployed on 12 May in order to obstruct the withdrawal of these forces following their defeat in Saigon . The task force would subsequently concentrate astride Route 16 on one of the major north @-@ south supply routes 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north @-@ east of Saigon , just east of Lai Khe in Binh Duong Province , in a new area of operations known as AO Surfers . Meanwhile , US forces would operate in support on the flanks .

 1 ATF would move with its headquarters and two infantry battalions — 1 RAR and 3 RAR — as well as cavalry , artillery , engineer and aviation elements operating in support , including M113 armoured personnel carriers from A Squadron , 3rd Cavalry Regiment , 105 mm M2A2 howitzers from 12th Field Regiment , Royal Australian Artillery , Bell H @-@ 13 Sioux light observation helicopters from 161st Reconnaissance Flight and mortar locating radars from 131st Divisional Locating Battery . The concept of operations called for the establishment battalion <unk> , named Bondi , Manly and Newport . 1 RAR was allocated to AO Bondi with artillery support from the 102nd Field Battery established at a fire support base , named FSB Coral . 3 RAR was initially allocated to AO Manly , west of Bondi , and would also be supported from FSB Coral by its own supporting battery , 161st Battery , Royal New Zealand Artillery . The operation would be conducted in three phases . 3 RAR — under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jim Shelton — would conduct an air assault into Coral early on 12 May , with the lead elements securing the landing zone for the fly @-@ in of the remainder of the battalion , and 1 RAR under Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Bennett . Leaving its supporting artillery and one infantry company for protection , 3 RAR would then move west to establish blocking positions and patrol AO Manly in order to intercept North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces attempting to withdraw from the south and south @-@ west . Meanwhile , 1 RAR would establish its supporting artillery and mortars at FSB Coral , and then with one company , clear Route 16 to the village of Tan <unk> , 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) to the south . The battalion would then occupy blocking positions and patrol AO Bondi . 1 ATF headquarters would then move from Bearcat to FSB Coral on 13 May , while the forward task force maintenance area would move from Bearcat by road convoy and be operational by 14 May . 
 A number of People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) units had been identified in AO Surfers , including the regular North Vietnamese 7th Division — consisting of the North Vietnamese 141st and 165th Regiments under the command of Nguyen the Bon , the Vietcong 5th Division — consisting of Viet Cong 274th and 275th Regiments , and the Dong Nai Regiment . These divisions were believed to have participated in the assault on Saigon and allied intelligence considered it likely they would attempt to withdraw through the Australian area of operations in order to regroup . Other forces included North Vietnamese 85th Regiment as well as the 165th , 233rd , 269th , 275th , <unk> and <unk> Viet Cong Infiltration Groups and various units used for reconnaissance , guiding , logistics , liaison and other tasks . In total , an estimated strength of 3 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 men . Regardless , despite earlier warnings that they may concentrate up to regimental @-@ strength , a breakdown in the passage of intelligence led the Australians to believe that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would remain dispersed in small groups in an attempt to avoid detection . As such the Australians assumed that the communist forces would pose little threat and envisioned patrolling from company harbours to find and ambush them as they withdrew . Meanwhile , due to the risk of heavy ground fire , only a very limited aerial reconnaissance of the new area of operations was undertaken and this later had significant implications .

 = = = Occupation of FSB Coral , 12 May 1968 = = = 
 On the night of 11 / 12 May , only a few hours before the Australian redeployment was scheduled to commence , American forces from US 1st Division operating in AO Surfers were attacked just west of the proposed landing zone ( LZ ) . Continuing through the night and into the following morning , the fighting prevented the Americans from leaving the area and led to initial delays in occupying FSB Coral . Further delays arose after the terrain around the proposed LZ was found to be unsuitable for helicopters , and Shelton was forced to designate a new location 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) to the south @-@ west for his battalion . Meanwhile , the American company providing security for the lead Australian elements had to redeploy to secure the alternate LZ . Communications were problematic throughout the operation and this further compounded the delays . The first infantry company to fly in — B Company , 3 RAR under the command of Major Bert Irwin — was already airborne and Shelton directed them to the new LZ . On landing , Irwin moved quickly to the original position , and despite rapidly clearing it , the insertion was further delayed . 
 1 ATF was not well practised in flying in and setting up a large fire support base , and a poorly co @-@ ordinated , prolonged and dislocated operation caused considerable delay in getting on the ground , and the scattering of a number of units . Confusion continued to affect the operation , with 161st Battery , RNZA arriving by CH @-@ 47 Chinook before FSB Coral was ready , and being forced to land in an improvised LZ in a clearing 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) to the south @-@ west . Meanwhile , the continued presence of American forces in AO Manly also prevented 3 RAR from deploying as planned , and as the battalion began landing it was forced to remain on the western side of the FSB . 102nd Field Battery , the direct support battery for 1 RAR , was subsequently landed at FSB Coral and Major Brian Murtagh , second @-@ in @-@ command of 12th Field Regiment and the artillery tactical headquarters , was subsequently designated as the FSB commander , even though his guns were now physically dislocated from each other . 
 These delays in turn affected the fly @-@ in of 1 RAR , with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO <unk> before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral . Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15 : 30 to discuss aspects of the defence , as well as events planned for the following day . The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16 : 10 , with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight , more than four hours late . It became clear to Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy to the east of the FSB , and with just two hours before last light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions , the last of which were not established until 17 : 00 . Due to the hurried deployment , by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their supporting elements were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups , rather than in a co @-@ ordinated defensive position . The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally , yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly — Commanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment — both remained in Bearcat . Hughes was not present either , having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat , and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day . 
 There had been little opportunity for co @-@ ordination , with the Australian infantry strung out along the routes away from FSB Coral in preparation for their move the next day . 3 RAR was responsible for the security of FSB Coral , with D Company defending the north @-@ west approaches , while the remaining three companies were dispersed over 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the west , spread between the FSB and the New Zealand gun positions to the south @-@ west . 1 RAR occupied the eastern approaches , with its rifle companies dispersed over 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) harbouring in night ambush positions , while C Company was isolated to the south @-@ east picketing the road to Tan <unk> in order to provide security for the convoy due to arrive from Bearcat the following day . Bennett kept his anti @-@ tank and assault pioneer platoons inside the FSB to protect the battalion command post , while the mortar platoon would be particularly exposed , being located adjacent to the 102nd Field Battery gun position in an open area on the outer edge of the base facing to the north and east . The rifle companies to the north @-@ east provided the only protection , yet there were large gaps between these positions and they could be easily bypassed . Although the Australians made further efforts to co @-@ ordinate their defences prior to last light , attempting to tie in their positions to achieve mutual support between the sub @-@ units , these arrangements remained incomplete as night fell . 
 Command posts were dug in and weapons pits and shell scrapes were commenced , yet many were not completed to any depth due to a lack of time , while a heavy rainfall started at 18 : 00 and soon filled the pits with water anyway . No claymore mines or barbed wire were laid out either , as the wire had not yet arrived , while lack of materials also prevented the construction of overhead protection . 7 @.@ 62 mm M60 machine @-@ guns were placed out around the perimeter , but there was no time to test fire them or to properly tie in their arcs of fire . Meanwhile , 90 mm M67 recoilless rifles ( RCLs ) from the 1 RAR Anti @-@ Tank Platoon armed with High Explosive Anti @-@ tank ( HEAT ) and anti @-@ personnel flechette ammunition were sited to support the forward machine @-@ guns . Due to their previous experiences fighting the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province , the Australians were not overly alarmed despite the defences at FSB Coral suffering due to the hasty deployment and , although the recent fighting involving the US 1st Division only 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the west may have been additional cause for concern , its extent was unknown to the Australians at the time . Expecting the North Vietnamese to be operating in small groups while trying to avoid battle as they had done during the last three weeks , there was little thought of a major threat to the FSB . Commencing night routine , sentries were posted while the rest of the Australians stood down to get some sleep . 
 = = = First attack on FSB Coral , 12 / 13 May 1968 = = = 
 Unknown to 1 ATF , the headquarters of the North Vietnamese 7th Division was located approximately 9 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) to the east of FSB Coral and several units of the division were also based in the vicinity . The North Vietnamese 165th Regiment was operating to the north and the 141st Regiment to the east , while the battalion @-@ strength 275th Infiltration Group had only recently arrived , having left the Ho Chi Minh Trail on the Cambodian border just 48 hours earlier . The North Vietnamese divisional commander had quickly dispatched reconnaissance elements to observe the fly @-@ in of the Australians and their defensive preparations during the afternoon , and they soon reported the opportunity to attack the exposed gun positions of the 102nd Field Battery . One battalion of 141st Regiment , augmented by the 275th and 269th Infiltration Groups , was subsequently tasked to attack FSB Coral that night . This reconnaissance had not gone unnoticed by the Australian infantry , however , and companies from both 1 RAR and 3 RAR had fleeting contacts with small groups of North Vietnamese at last light and into the evening . D Company , 1 RAR — under Major Tony Hammett — contacted a ten @-@ man group of North Vietnamese while moving into ambush positions 2 @,@ 500 metres ( 2 @,@ 700 yd ) north of FSB Coral late in the afternoon . In a brief exchange the North Vietnamese broke contact after losing one killed , firing rocket @-@ propelled grenades into the trees above the Australians and wounding one of them . 
 During the evening B Company , 1 RAR — under the command of Major Bob Hennessy — had a further contact to the east with another ten @-@ man group . Later , Major Colin Adamson 's A Company detected 20 North Vietnamese moving on the perimeter utilising newly issued Starlight scopes and subsequently killed and wounded some of them . However , such events appeared to be chance encounters and caused the Australians no particular concern . By midnight the rain had stopped , and five minutes later the 1 RAR mortar position was probed and a fire @-@ fight ensued , resulting in possibly three North Vietnamese being killed . Later it became apparent that they had been marking assault lanes , while at 02 : 25 three North Vietnamese from a forward reconnaissance party walked into a D Company , 1 RAR ambush and in the ensuing contact one was killed before they again broke contact , firing rocket @-@ propelled grenades that killed one Australian and wounded 11 from a single platoon . Yet despite a number of minor clashes the North Vietnamese successfully bypassed the Australian rifle companies , conducting a forced march under cover of darkness and rain to dig in within 250 metres ( 270 yd ) of FSB Coral undetected . 
 Finally at 03 : 30 , rocket and mortar fire began falling on FSB Coral , concentrating on the 102nd Field Battery and the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon positions in an intense bombardment lasting five minutes . Following a ten @-@ minute pause a number of flares signalled the start of the assault . Intending to capture the field guns , two North Vietnamese companies rushed the Australians from the north @-@ east firing their AK @-@ 47 assault rifles , with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon taking the brunt of the initial attack , while the 1 ATF Defence Platoon was also pinned down by heavy machine @-@ gun fire . The New Zealand howitzers and 3 RAR mortars began firing in support , however they failed to halt the North Vietnamese and the initial assault succeeded in over @-@ running the 1 RAR mortars , killing five and wounding eight . The flank of the main assault force then ran through the position at speed before moving on towards the gun position . During their earlier reconnaissance , the North Vietnamese had likely observed the guns to be laid facing east and had probably planned to assault from the north as a result , yet shortly before the main attack the battery had fired a mission to the north and the guns were now directly facing their axis of assault . Moving in long straight lines across a frontage of 150 to 200 men , the main North Vietnamese assault moved against the gun position as the Australian gunners opened fire over open sights with Splintex rounds at point blank range , with thousands of darts ripping through their ranks and breaking up successive waves into small groups . Amid the confusion , follow @-@ up sections hesitated upon reaching the mortar position , while other groups skirmished around the flanks and between the artillery and mortars . 
 Meanwhile , the 1 RAR Anti @-@ Tank Platoon — commanded by Lieutenant Les Tranter — also engaged with Splintex from their 90 mm RCLs , firing across the front of the mortars and relieving the immediate pressure on them . However , with the North Vietnamese having successfully achieved a break @-@ in , and faced with the possibility of imminent annihilation , the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon second @-@ in @-@ command — Lieutenant Tony Jensen — was forced to direct the RCLs onto his own position , to which Bennett agreed . As the North Vietnamese attempted to turn the captured mortars against the Australians , the flechette darts swept the area , clearing everything above ground , causing heavy casualties among the assaulting force and damaging a number of mortar tubes . Elsewhere , the North Vietnamese assault had reached the Australian gun position , over @-@ running two guns as desperate close quarters fighting broke out between the emplacements . The attackers subsequently succeeded in capturing No. 6 gun on the extreme edge of the gun @-@ line and then attempted to destroy it with satchel charges . In both the mortar and artillery positions the North Vietnamese and Australians occupied adjacent pits , fighting each other at close range for their possession . The gun position officer — Captain Ian Ahearn — co @-@ ordinated the defence , and the Australians finally drove off the assault with grenades and small arms , as well as Splintex rounds fired from the Anti @-@ Tank Platoon . Meanwhile , with the assault falling mainly on 1 RAR and 102nd Field Battery , to the west 3 RAR had largely remained out of contact . 
 Although the North Vietnamese troops were well trained and equipped , they were ultimately unable to prevail against the superior firepower of the Australian infantry and gunners , which had turned the battle in their favour . Throughout the night , fire support was co @-@ ordinated by the 1 RAR command post and the fire support co @-@ ordinating centre , which controlled integral fires from 102nd Field Battery , its direct support battery , as well as from 161st Battery RNZA and the 81 mm mortars from 3 RAR . Yet the Australian gunners soon ran out of Splintex rounds , and they were forced to use standard high @-@ explosive with their direct @-@ action fuses set to ' delay ' . The guns were then depressed to fire the shell at the ground approximately 40 to 50 metres ( 44 to 55 yd ) in front of the emplacement , which caused the round to ricochet and explode in the air above the heads of the assaulting force , an expedient which proved very effective . The Australians were also supported by artillery from a number of neighbouring American batteries that were in range , as well as by aerial strafing from helicopter gunships and continuous illumination by flares . Forward observers adjusted the artillery to within 20 metres ( 22 yd ) of the Australian position , while C @-@ 47 Spooky gunships armed with mini @-@ guns fired thousands of rounds into the assaulting forces . 
 After an hour of intense fighting , by 04 : 30 the main attack began to falter and the North Vietnamese subsequently withdrew into a rubber plantation to the north @-@ east , carrying many of their dead and wounded . However , in an attempt prevent the Australians from following them a company @-@ sized force remained , and the Australian gunners attempted to engage them with their remaining Splintex rounds and high explosive . Taking advantage of the extinguishing of a fire that the Australians had been using to direct the helicopter gunships , the North Vietnamese again attacked at 05 : 00 in an effort to further cover their withdrawal . Greatly reduced in strength , the attack was quickly broken up in a crossfire of high explosive and Splintex . A series of sporadic contacts then took place between the Australians and withdrawing North Vietnamese parties , while at 05 : 30 a helicopter light @-@ fire team became effective and forced the North Vietnamese rearguard to abandon its positions . Also during this time , rockets and mortars had landed on B Company , 1 RAR 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) to the south @-@ east , killing one Australian and wounding another . At 05 : 45 , 161st Battery RNZA began firing on likely withdrawal routes as the pre @-@ dawn light began to appear . The Australians then began a sweep of their position , with the 102nd Field Battery clearing the gun position while Bennett accompanied the 1 RAR Anti @-@ Tank Platoon and a regimental medical officer 's party to clear the rest of the perimeter . A number of North Vietnamese soldiers were subsequently located , with the last killed in the gun position at 06 : 10 . The two patrols then met in the mortar position while a patrol from 3 RAR carried out a similar sweep from north to south , and FSB Coral was finally cleared by 06 : 25 . By 06 : 30 the evacuation of the Australian dead and wounded began by helicopter . The communists finally completed their withdrawal by 08 : 00 . 
 The fighting had been costly for both sides . Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded , while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged . North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead , who lay strewn around the perimeter , while 23 small arms and seven crew @-@ served weapons had also been captured by the Australians . While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was little doubt that the Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack , even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe , with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed . The initial delays during the fly @-@ in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and , had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians , the result may have been different . Equally , the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid in the direction of the main North Vietnamese assault , and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive . The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience . Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co @-@ ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander . The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese , while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell . Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified . 
 = = = 1 ATF consolidates in AO Surfers , 13 – 15 May 1968 = = = 
 The 1 ATF forward tactical headquarters arrived from Bearcat by Chinook on 13 May , while additional personnel and stocks were brought in by road convoy to establish the forward task force maintenance area . Hughes arrived at 08 : 00 and directed Bennett to redeploy his companies in all @-@ round defence of FSB Coral , with 1 RAR consolidating their defensive arrangements with wire , sandbags , overhead protection and claymore mines , while tripod @-@ mounted machine @-@ guns were also emplaced to fire on fixed lines . Meanwhile , 3 RAR established FSB Coogee in AO Manly 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) west , with C Company securing the fire support base while the other three rifle companies conducted search operations which resulted in one being Australian killed . 161st Battery RNZA was then redeployed by air to Coogee . M @-@ 113 armoured personnel carriers from A Squadron , 3 CAV ( less one troop ) — under the command of Major John Keldie — arrived at Coral the same day , after escorting the rear echelons and 155 mm M109 self @-@ propelled artillery from A Battery , US 2 / 35th Artillery Regiment . The APCs were then split between the fire support bases , with 1 Troop assigned to 1 RAR and 2 Troop to 3 RAR , with Keldie appointed as local defence commander at FSB Coral in order to co @-@ ordinate the actions of units on the perimeter . 1st Field Squadron also provided engineer teams to each combat arm , while other elements prepared command post bunkers and fortifications within the fire support bases . 
 The unsuccessful assault against FSB Coral on the night of 12 / 13 May had demonstrated that the North Vietnamese would react violently to Australian attempts to control AO Surfers , and with 1 ATF deployed astride a key route to Saigon and threatening a number of communist bases and staging areas located nearby , further heavy fighting was expected over the following days . In response , the Australians were forced to refine their tactics and Hughes decided to establish strong defensive positions in order to destroy the North Vietnamese by fire , rather than by the painstaking patrolling more familiar to the Australians . The <unk> would be heavily defended by night , while the battalions would conduct defensive patrols by day . Later , fighting patrols up to company @-@ size with armoured support would then be used to locate and destroy the Viet Cong main force bases . As such the Australian concept of operations subsequently evolved from one of searching and clearing in order to locate and cut infiltration and withdrawal routes , into a series of reconnaissance @-@ in @-@ force operations from heavily defended bases . Meanwhile , in AO Manly , 3 RAR continued patrolling for the next seven days , successfully ambushing staging areas and infiltration routes between 13 – 19 May for the loss of one soldier killed . 
 On 14 May there were a number of patrol clashes in AO Bondi , as both sides tried to determine the intentions of the other . The Australians sent out platoon @-@ sized defensive patrols between 3 to 4 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 to 2 @.@ 5 mi ) from Coral and in nine contacts they suffered three killed and five wounded , while North Vietnamese casualties included 12 killed and two wounded . Later , two more Australians were wounded by a rocket @-@ propelled grenade fired into FSB Coral . During the afternoon , the patrol activity resulted in heavy fighting , and two separate actions fought within half an hour of each other by different platoons from 1 RAR led to two Australians being awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal ( DCM ) — Lance Corporal David Griffiths and Private Richard Norden . The communists appeared to be probing the Australians to gain information on their dispositions and these efforts continued the following day with the defenders observing two North Vietnamese near the perimeter of FSB Coral , while patrols from 1 RAR later contacted a number of small groups and uncovered a recently used company @-@ sized camp just 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) from the base . By 15 May , the Australians considered their defences to be properly co @-@ ordinated , while nearby the North Vietnamese 141st Regiment was again preparing to attack Coral after evading the intensive patrolling . Yet that night a large number of lights and flares were observed by the defenders , effectively warning them of the impending assault . 
 = = = Second attack on FSB Coral , 16 May 1968 = = = 
 At 02 : 30 on 16 May the North Vietnamese began a heavy barrage of rocket @-@ propelled grenades and mortar fire , concentrating on A Company 1 RAR , 1 ATF headquarters , and the forward task force maintenance area . Now heavily reinforced , the Australian and American artillery and mortars quickly responded with heavy counter @-@ battery fire , with a total of 60 guns from three batteries of 105 mm field guns , one battery of 155 mm howitzers , one 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) battery and nine 81 mm mortars firing in support , augmented by air support from three heavy fire teams ( each of three Iroquois helicopter gunships ) and three fighters with bombs and napalm . Regardless , at 02 : 40 the North Vietnamese launched a battalion @-@ sized attack , which initially fell on A and B Companies . Even with the artillery and mortars concentrating on close defensive fire tasks , the assault was largely held at the perimeter , although they did succeed in over @-@ running part of 3 Platoon , A Company . Commanded by Lieutenant Neil Weekes , the platoon had been hit heavily by indirect fire during the initial bombardment and had suffered several casualties . Concentrating on the gap created in the Australian perimeter , the North Vietnamese then assaulted with the support of 12 @.@ 7 mm DShK heavy machine @-@ guns . Ordering his men to fix bayonets , Weekes successfully reorganised the defences however , and called in close mortar fire to stabilise the position , resulting in heavy casualties among the assaulting force . He was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership . Unable to achieve a break @-@ in , the North Vietnamese then broadened their attack to include C Company , engaging three of the four Australian companies on the perimeter . Yet after successfully opening a number of gaps in the wire , they failed to press home their attack . 
 By 04 : 00 A Company was still heavily engaged and the Australians called in helicopter light @-@ fire teams and C @-@ 47 Spooky gunships , which dropped flares continuously from 04 : 30 to illuminate the battlefield . By 05 : 00 the main attack was halted and the North Vietnamese began withdrawing , just as the Australians were beginning to run low on ammunition . During the lull A Company was resupplied by APC , while the Australians pushed an RCL team forward to provide additional support . At 05 : 15 the North Vietnamese attacked again , targeting the boundary between A and C Companies on the northern edge of the perimeter , only to be repulsed by mortar fire . Later a two @-@ battalion attack on A , B and C Companies was also turned back . The Australians then counter @-@ attacked with elements of A Company supported by APCs , regaining the lost 3 Platoon section post . Finally , after a six @-@ hour battle the North Vietnamese broke contact at 06 : 30 and withdrew with their dead and wounded , fighting a series of rearguard actions to prevent follow @-@ up . The Australians also began collecting their casualties for evacuation , while another resupply was completed with APCs . 1 RAR subsequently commenced a clearance of the area , with the four Australian rifle companies patrolling to a depth of 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) , killing one North Vietnamese soldier and capturing another . Five Australians had been killed and 19 wounded , while two US artillerymen were also wounded during the fighting . Only 34 North Vietnamese bodies were counted on the perimeter at dawn , however intelligence later indicated that fewer than 100 of the 790 attacking troops had survived unwounded . Meanwhile , in an attempt to disrupt the North Vietnamese withdrawal , Keldie led a troop of cavalry from Coral , engaging a North Vietnamese battalion during a pursuit that lasted until 15 : 00 . 
 On 17 May , Westmoreland visited FSB Coral and congratulated the task force on its defence . Both Australian battalions continued to patrol with minor contacts , and during one such incident at least six North Vietnamese were killed when a group of approximately 35 was engaged by artillery and armed helicopters after being observed by scouts from B Company , 3 RAR . During the week that followed Australian patrols clashed with groups of North Vietnamese moving through AO Surfers , many of them from the North Vietnamese 165th Regiment , which was believed to be withdrawing into War Zone D after attacking Tan Son Nhut airbase , near Saigon . A Company , 3 RAR subsequently occupied a blocking position on the Suoi Ba Pho creek , ambushing North Vietnamese moving northwards and directing mortar firing onto evasion routes , killing eight and capturing two . Elsewhere , C Company , 3 RAR located and destroyed a number of base camps in the vicinity of FSB Coogee . Meanwhile , with the approval of MacDonald , Hughes departed on a long @-@ planned leave to Singapore on 18 May , and Colonel Donald Dunstan , the task force second @-@ in @-@ command , took over as Commander 1 ATF on 20 May . A respected and experienced leader , he quickly took control amidst growing tension . 
 At 01 : 00 on 22 May FSB Coral was again attacked , though not on the same scale as before , coming under a short but accurate mortar bombardment that was subsequently broken up artillery and mortar fire . In order to bolster his defences and provide an increased offensive capability , on 21 May Dunstan ordered the Centurion tanks from C Squadron , 1st Armoured Regiment to redeploy the 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) from Nui Dat . Under the command of Major Peter Badman , the slow @-@ moving armoured column departed on 22 May , traversing the difficult terrain that included a number of old , rusting Bailey bridges , which threatened to collapse under the 50 @-@ tonne weight of the Centurions . Moving via the inland route under cover provided by an observation aircraft from 161st Reconnaissance Flight , they drove north on Route 2 , then west on Highway 1 to Long Binh where they staged overnight . Just north of Blackhorse the lead vehicle of the convoy hit a road mine , damaging a dozer tank but resulting in no casualties . They finally arrived at FSB Coral at 02 : 30 on 23 May . Four tanks from 1 Troop were subsequently allocated to 1 RAR , while 2 Troop was allocated to 3 RAR . Two American M42 40 mm Self @-@ Propelled Anti @-@ Aircraft Guns had also accompanied the tanks and further strengthened the Australian <unk> in a ground support role . 
 = = = First attack on FSB Balmoral , 26 May 1968 = = = 
 With 3 RAR achieving limited results in AO Manly , MacDonald suggested that Dunstan establish the battalion in a new location east of Route 16 in order to locate and destroy the North Vietnamese bases suspected to be in the area . 3 RAR subsequently occupied FSB Balmoral in AO Newport , 4 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) north of Coral , on 24 May in the hope of provoking another battle . Shelton was keen to avoid the mistakes that had been made during the earlier occupation of FSB Coral however , and he sent two companies forward on foot to occupy the new fire support base while the battalion tactical headquarters accompanied them in APCs . During the insertion there were a number of contacts between the Australians and North Vietnamese , with at least one North Vietnamese soldier being killed . Yet with B and D Companies securing the landing zone , the remainder of 3 RAR was inserted by helicopter from FSB Coogee in the late afternoon . FSB Balmoral would be developed as a battalion defensive position only , and 161st Battery RNZA was subsequently flown to FSB Coral , in order to concentrate all of the artillery in that location from where they would be able to cover the whole of the new AO . Meanwhile , the North Vietnamese had been caught by surprise and , with no time prepare an attack , they were unable to respond on the first evening . Regardless , 3 RAR worked quickly to establish their defensive position , digging in and laying wire and claymore mines . 
 On 25 May , 3 RAR began local defensive and familiarisation patrols . Four Centurion tanks from 2 Troop , C Squadron were ordered to redeploy to FSB Balmoral to bolster the defences , escorted by two infantry platoons from B Company , 1 RAR under Captain Bob Hennessy . En route , the North Vietnamese contacted the Australian infantry from a series of bunkers , pinning them down with machine @-@ gun fire at close range . In response the Australian tanks moved forward , suppressing the bunkers with canister rounds while the infantry was extracted . The Australians had struck the edge of a large , defended base camp estimated at company @-@ size , however under orders to continue to Balmoral before nightfall , they broke contact . The column subsequently arrived at FSB Balmoral without further incident at 15 : 30 and B Company , 1 RAR then returned to FSB Coral by helicopter . At least two North Vietnamese were killed in the encounter , while one Australian was wounded . Although a relatively minor action , the tanks had been decisive and the engagement was early proof of their effectiveness in co @-@ operation with the infantry . Meanwhile , the North Vietnamese commander was no longer able to tolerate the Australian encroachment into his base areas , and with FSB Balmoral located just 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) away , he subsequently tasked the <unk> Regiment — commanded by Phan Viet Dong — to attack Balmoral . That evening tracer rounds , shots and lights again alerted the defenders of an impending attack . 
 At 03 : 45 on 26 May the North Vietnamese began a heavy bombardment with mortar and rockets , accompanied by machine @-@ gun and small @-@ arms fire . Immediately following the barrage , Balmoral was subjected to a ground assault across the open ground from the north @-@ east by a force of up to battalion strength , falling primarily on D Company , commanded by Major Peter Phillips . At the same time the North Vietnamese conducted a feint on the southern perimeter opposite A Company — under Major Horrie Howard — using Bangalore torpedoes to break through the wire , although the gap was not exploited . Two Centurions that had been sited directly on the main axis of assault but concealed during the day , rolled forward under the cover of darkness . Their machine @-@ guns and canister rounds proved telling during the fighting ; the main attack stalled as it reached the wire before being repelled with heavy casualties by the combined firepower of the Australian infantry and tanks . Meanwhile , as sporadic mortar , rocket @-@ propelled grenade and small @-@ arms fire continued , to the south FSB Coral was also hit with suppressing fire from mortars , recoilless rifles and rocket @-@ propelled grenades between 04 : 15 and 04 : 30 , killing one Australian and wounded another . The defenders at Balmoral then directed fire from helicopter gunships and C @-@ 47 Spooky aircraft onto likely assembly areas and mortar base plate locations . Around 05 : 00 the North Vietnamese finally broke contact and withdrew , removing the majority of their casualties under covering fire as the Australian artillery fired on their escape routes . Clearing patrols from 3 RAR then swept the area at first light but found only six North Vietnamese dead and a large quantity of weapons , ammunition and equipment . The Australians subsequently began the evacuation of their casualties , having lost a further three dead and 14 wounded . 
 = = = Bunker clash and patrolling in AO Surfers , 26 – 27 May 1968 = = = 
 Dunstan subsequently directed the clearance of the bunker system that had been located the previous day , and a combined force of D Company , 1 RAR and 1 Troop C Squadron under the command of Major Tony Hammett was tasked with carrying out a reconnaissance @-@ in @-@ force . Departing at 06 : 00 on the morning of the 26 May , the lead Australian infantry platoon was contacted at 12 : 27 by small arms fire and rocket @-@ propelled grenades 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) from Coral , after having paused to direct an air strike by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF onto a nearby bunker system . In what would become the first Australian combined infantry and tank assault since the Bougainville campaign against the Japanese in the Second World War , the tanks were called forward and attacked the bunkers with anti @-@ tank solid shot and machine @-@ guns , while the infantry indicated targets with their M79 grenade launchers . Moving forward two or three abreast , the Centurions crushed many of the bunkers with their tracks and engaged others at point @-@ blank range with their main armament . Further bunkers were exposed when the foliage was cut away by canister rounds and the infantry followed the tanks using rifles and grenades , while assault pioneers provided support with a flame @-@ thrower as artillery and mortar fire engaged depth targets . 
 The bunkers were well constructed and camouflaged , while visibility was limited to just 10 to 20 metres ( 11 to 22 yd ) among the dense vegetation and consequently many were not located by the Australians until they were upon them . The bunkers were sited to be mutually supporting , and the North Vietnamese defending them responded with a crossfire of RPG @-@ 2 rocket @-@ propelled grenades , although the heavy armour of the Centurions proved impervious and they remained undamaged . During a three @-@ hour battle the Australians and North Vietnamese fought each other from bunker to bunker . However , with aerial reconnaissance revealing that the bunker system was part of a much larger base area , and with the Australian force judged too small to deal with it , Bennett directed Hammett to retire by late afternoon . Amidst a heavy rain the Australians broke contact at 16 : 00 under the cover of artillery and mortar fire , and they moved quickly back to FSB Coral . Fourteen bunkers had been destroyed , while seven North Vietnamese bodies were counted and quantities of weapons , ammunition and documents were also captured . Yet many more men were undoubtedly entombed in the bunkers after being crushed by the tanks , making a comprehensive body count impossible . Although it had been a fierce engagement the Australians suffered no casualties , a fact which was attributed to the effectiveness of the tanks , and further validated Dunstan 's decision to call them forward from Nui Dat . Second Lieutenant John Salter was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during this and other actions . 
 Over the following days 1 ATF continued patrolling , although these operations resulted in only small @-@ scale contact with the North Vietnamese . On 27 May an Australian Sioux light observation helicopter was damaged by ground fire during a reconnaissance flight 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) outside AO Newport , and air strikes on the area exposed several bunkers which were likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as a headquarters ; they were subsequently destroyed by artillery fire . 
 = = = Second attack on FSB Balmoral , 28 May 1968 = = = 
 A second regimental @-@ sized attack against 3 RAR at Balmoral was launched by the North Vietnamese at 02 : 30 on 28 May , with a two @-@ battalion assault preceded by 60 mm and 80 mm mortar fire from the south . Meanwhile , FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02 : 45 . Similar to the attack two nights before , it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company , but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small @-@ arms fire from their M60 machine @-@ guns , L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles . The main assault began at 03 : 10 from the north @-@ east , with the brunt again being borne by Phillips ' D Company . The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine @-@ guns , while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires , with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position . Although the assault was well co @-@ ordinated , the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise , with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders . The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes , while at 03 : 40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated . Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light @-@ fire teams and C @-@ 47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese , directed by forward air control aircraft . From 05 : 00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded , and they finally withdrew by 05 : 30 . 
 At first light a clearing patrol from D Company , 3 RAR swept the area with tanks and APCs in support , killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B @-@ 52 bomb craters to the north of Balmoral . The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners , while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded . Quantities of weapons , clothing , ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians . Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle . Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years , evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15 @-@ year @-@ old boys into its combat units ; as had happened after the earlier fighting , their bodies were collected by a bulldozer and buried in a mass grave . Later , a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north @-@ east of Balmoral during an aerial reconnaissance by a Sioux light observation helicopter , and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing defensive fire tasks early in the battle . The successful defence of Balmoral and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling . The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers , and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or Balmoral . 
 = = = Operation Toan Thang I concludes , 28 May − 6 June 1968 = = = 
 The Australians continued to patrol aggressively , with further clashes occurring between companies from 1 RAR and 3 RAR , and the North Vietnamese . On the morning of 30 May , C Company , 1 RAR under Major Ian Campbell had patrolled into a bunker system 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) east of FSB Coral and was contacted by a large dug @-@ in North Vietnamese force . At 08 : 30 the lead platoon , 9 Platoon , came under fire and was pinned down by rocket @-@ propelled grenades and 7 @.@ 62 mm RPD light machine @-@ guns . Meanwhile , 7 Platoon moved to assist but was also pinned down , with one section suffering heavy casualties and losing an M60 machine @-@ gun . Campbell struggled to establish a company defensive position , pushing 8 Platoon forward covered by armed helicopters and indirect fire . Yet with the two forces facing each other at only 10 to 15 metres ( 11 to 16 yd ) , the Australian artillery and mortars were rendered ineffective and Dunstan subsequently dispatched two tanks from Coral to reinforce them as heavy fighting developed . Supported by APCs , the Australian infantry and tanks then assaulted and cleared several bunkers , allowing the lead platoon to withdraw after three hours of fighting . Suffering one killed and seven wounded , C Company broke contact by 11 : 55 , withdrawing 500 metres ( 550 yd ) as artillery , mortars and air strikes engaged the bunker system . Three days later C Company returned to the area to recover the lost machine @-@ gun only to find the position as they had left it ; strewn with dead bodies and caved @-@ in bunkers with the battlefield having been abandoned by the North Vietnamese , who had also withdrawn following the Australian assault . The tanks had destroyed at least eight bunkers , while communist casualties included 24 dead and a further eight believed killed . Another group of 13 had also been engaged in the open by artillery , and were also possibly killed . 
 The North Vietnamese then appeared to abandon AO Surfers to the Australians , and increasingly diverted their movement around Coral and Balmoral . Operation Toan Thang I continued for another six days regardless , and 1 ATF patrolled extensively into June . However , with contacts decreasing , on 1 June Weyand judged the Australian blocking operation to have been successful in limiting the communist offensive against Saigon , and directed US and ARVN units to relieve them . Meanwhile , Hughes returned from leave and visited Dunstan at FSB Coral to discuss the situation and the task force 's redeployment to Phuoc Tuy . FSB Balmoral was subsequently declared closed on 5 June , with 3 RAR and its direct support battery returning to Nui Dat by air , while FSB Coral was also closed the following day . The operation finally concluded on 6 June , with 1 RAR returning to Nui Dat by Chinook after handing over the area of operations to the US 1st Infantry Division , while the logistic , artillery and armoured elements returned by road convoy . Yet the approach of the wet season concerned Hughes , who believed it could hinder the movement of the Centurions and leave them stranded 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) from base until the dry season . Nonetheless , the tanks departed FSB Coral on 5 June ; travelling via Bearcat and Route 15 , the road move went without incident and they returned to Nui Dat by 17 : 00 on 6 June .

 = = = Casualties = = = 
 Although Operation Toan Thang I had begun relatively quietly for the Australians it had ended far more spectacularly . During 26 days of fighting they had inflicted punishing losses on the communists and forced the North Vietnamese 7th Division to postpone a further attack on Saigon . North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties in AO Surfers included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured , while Australian losses were 25 killed and 99 wounded . Five New Zealanders and five American soldiers were also wounded . Westmoreland had been impressed by the results achieved by 1 ATF in May and June , and while US and South Vietnamese forces had undoubtedly borne the brunt of the fighting for the allies during this time , 1 ATF had featured prominently in American reports . The battle was the first occasion that the Australians had met the North Vietnamese Army in regimental strength , and operating in depth in a series of engagements akin to conventional warfare they had ultimately fought their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . For their involvement in the action the Royal Australian Regiment , the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and 1st Armoured Regiment were all subsequently awarded the battle honour " Coral @-@ Balmoral " , one of only five presented to Australian units during the war . On 14 May 2008 the 102nd Field Battery , RAA was awarded the honour title " Coral " in recognition of their involvement in the battle , the first such award to an Australian sub @-@ unit . 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 The fighting represented a watershed in the campaign for the Australians , and while they had deployed outside Phuoc Tuy Province previously , they now faced regular North Vietnamese formations and Viet Cong Main Force units operating in battalion and regimental strength , rather than southern Viet Cong guerrillas . With 1 ATF deploying astride the communist lines of communication the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had been forced to respond , resulting in a set @-@ piece battle far removed from the counter @-@ insurgency doctrine the Australians normally espoused . Yet while the battle ended in victory for 1 ATF , they had come close to suffering defeat at the hands of the North Vietnamese . Inexperienced at large air @-@ mobile operations , poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning had caused delays and confusion during the fly @-@ in to FSB Coral , leaving the Australian force exposed to attack on the first night . The North Vietnamese had fought in greater numbers , with heavier firepower and greater intensity than previously experienced by the Australians in Vietnam , forcing them to refine their tactics . Later , the Australian use of platoon patrols to search an area and conduct ambushes was challenged by the constant movement of North Vietnamese forces operating in superior strength , which threatened to quickly overwhelm an isolated patrol . 
 Meanwhile , prolonged operations outside of Phuoc Tuy during the first half of 1968 had placed considerable strain on the Australian logistic system . Australian logistic resupply arrangements for Operation Toan Thang I had been modelled on the experience of Operation Coburg , and again required the Vung Tau @-@ based 1 <unk> to be split in order to provide a forward logistic element at the US base at Long Binh . A forward task force maintenance area had also been established , first at Bearcat and then later at FSB Coral . Re @-@ supply by road had continued daily from Long Binh to Bearcat , while following the move to Coral re @-@ supply was primarily by air due to the threat of possible interdiction . Movement from unit echelons in the forward maintenance area was also undertaken by helicopter . Units in the field received one fresh meal each day , with the other two meals based half on the American C ration and half on the Australian combat ration . Although the supply of fuel and ammunition was generally satisfactory , stocks had run dangerously low on one occasion during heavy fighting at FSB Coral due to the calculation of usage rates based on previous operations , requiring an emergency night @-@ time resupply by Chinook while the base was under attack . Re @-@ supply of water had also been particularly difficult due to unavailability of a permanent water point . Ultimately water had to be delivered by air from Long Binh at a rate of 14 @,@ 000 liters ( 3 @,@ 700 U.S. gal ) per day using rubber fuel bladders . 
 While many of the failings in Australian command arrangements evident from the initial stages of the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard operating procedures , future operational planning would need pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols , as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub @-@ units operating independently . Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive . Indeed , while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army , the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all . Indeed , whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions , afterwards they did not like working without them . Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support , particularly during the clearance of bunker systems , proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry . 
 In contrast , for the North Vietnamese the battle was just one part of the May Offensive , although they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack — a fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time . They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack on the first night in an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications ; however , while the attacks on Coral and Balmoral had been well co @-@ ordinated , the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion . Meanwhile , rigid command @-@ and @-@ control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules , preventing them from taking the initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations . Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability , with the communist commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral on the first night , and mounting very similar attacks against Balmoral on the nights of 26 and 28 May , both of which ended in costly failures . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 Meanwhile , 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 4 RAR ) had arrived to replace 2 RAR . Joined by two New Zealand infantry companies — W and V Companies — it was designated 4 RAR / NZ ( ANZAC ) and under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lee Greville they commenced operations in June . Later , on 13 June , 1 RAR was again deployed to protect the bases at Long Binh and Bien Hoa from rocket attacks , operating to the north and east of Bien Hoa as part of a wider allied operation , known as Operation Toan Thang II . On 23 June the battalion was joined by 4 RAR / NZ ( ANZAC ) and 1 ATF headquarters was deployed under Dunstan 's command as the operation expanded . On 3 July , 1RAR was relieved by <unk> and returned to Nui Dat . Largely uneventful , the operation resulted in minimal contact and lasted until 18 July . Three Viet Cong were killed and 13 captured , while Australian casualties included one killed and one wounded . The Australians then attempted to interdict Viet Cong supplies , with a small force of tanks and APCs supported B Company 3 RAR occupying the area along Route 15 to the west and north @-@ west of Baria between 25 – 30 June during Operation Ulladulla . As part of the operation the tanks ambushed a river and sank seven loaded sampans with their 20 @-@ pounder main armament . 
 On 10 June 1968 , General Creighton Abrams replaced Westmoreland and the change in command had resulted in a transformation of both the concept of the war and its conduct . Abrams directed that the allied main effort would switch to protecting population centres , rather than searching for and attempting to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong main force units as they had done previously . Equally , the prosecution of the war would increasingly be handed over to the South Vietnamese under a policy of Vietnamization , with the Americans aiming to keep North Vietnamese and Viet Cong units off balance to prevent them from interfering with resupply and reinforcement until the South Vietnamese could fight the war on their own . For the Australians the change in allied strategy foreshadowed a return to the pacification of Phuoc Tuy Province . Operations outside the province over the previous eighteen months had been costly , and of the 228 Australians killed and 1 @,@ 200 wounded during the war to that point , almost two @-@ thirds had been killed since January 1967 . From July , 1 ATF completed a number of search @-@ and @-@ clear operations along the northern border areas and west of their Tactical Area of Responsibility in Phouc Tuy Province . 
 Meanwhile , the Viet Cong began their third general offensive for the year on 17 August 1968 , attacking dozens of towns and military installations throughout South Vietnam with rockets and mortars , including Saigon . As part of the allied response the Australians were deployed to defend Ba Ria , the provincial capital , while during 20 – 23 August , B and C Company , 1 RAR with a troop of Centurion tanks were involved in intense urban fighting while supporting South Vietnamese forces to clear a company @-@ sized force from D445 VC Battalion occupying Long Dien . At least 17 Viet Cong were killed during the fighting , while Australian casualties included six wounded . During the next three weeks , all three Australian battalions were deployed on search @-@ and @-@ destroy operations , yet the Viet Cong successfully eluded them . Continuing until 30 September , the renewed offensive lacked the scale of the previous attacks and again resulted in heavy communist casualties , failing to produce lasting military gains and contributing to an overall decline in Viet Cong and North Vietnamese combat power in the south . Yet such failures were neither final nor decisive and Hanoi seemed to increasingly hold the upper hand . The war continued regardless , while allied military strategic objectives were increasingly coming into question . In late @-@ 1968 1 ATF was again deployed outside its base in Phouc Tuy , operating against suspected communist bases in the May Tao and Hat Dich areas as part of Operation Goodwood . The operation led to sustained fighting during a 78 @-@ day sweep between December 1968 and February 1969 and later became known as the Battle of Hat Dich .

 The 2007 Coca @-@ Cola 600 was the twelfth stock car race of the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series and the 48th iteration of the event . It was held on May 27 , 2007 , before a crowd of 175 @,@ 000 in Concord , North Carolina at Lowe 's Motor Speedway , one of ten intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races . The 400 @-@ lap race was won by Casey Mears of the Hendrick Motorsports team , who started from 16th position . J. J. Yeley finished second and Kyle Petty came in third . 
 Ryan Newman won the pole position and kept the lead for the first ten laps before his Penske Racing South teammate Kurt Busch moved into the lead on lap 11 . Busch held the lead for 107 laps ( longer than any other driver in the race ) until Brian Vickers moved into the lead after the first round of green @-@ flag pit stops . Jimmie Johnson gained the lead from Vickers on lap 185 and held it for 83 laps , battling with Vickers and Matt Kenseth for the position . At the race 's final restart on lap 342 , Tony Stewart led and maintained his position until he made a pit stop for fuel 51 laps later . Mears became the leader after Dale Earnhardt , Jr. and Denny Hamlin made similar pit stops ; Mears held the lead after slowing to conserve fuel to win the race . There were thirteen cautions and 29 lead changes among fifteen drivers during the race . 
 As of 2016 , the 2007 race is Mears ' only win of the Nextel Cup Series , which is now known as the Sprint Cup Series . After the race , Jeff Gordon 's lead in the Drivers ' Championship was reduced because he crashed in the early part of the race . Chevrolet increased its points advantage in the Manufacturers ' Championship , placing it 41 points ahead of Ford . Dodge moved further ahead of Toyota in the battle for third place , with 24 races left in the season .

 The Coca @-@ Cola 600 was the twelfth scheduled stock car race of the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series , out of 36 , and the 48th iteration of the event . It was held on May 27 , 2007 in Concord , North Carolina at Lowe 's Motor Speedway , now called Charlotte Motor Speedway , one of ten intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races ; the others are Atlanta Motor Speedway , Chicagoland Speedway , Darlington Raceway , Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway , Kansas Speedway , New Hampshire Motor Speedway , Kentucky Speedway , Las Vegas Motor Speedway , and Texas Motor Speedway . The standard track at Lowe 's Motor Speedway is a four @-@ turn , 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) -long , quad @-@ oval track . The track 's turns are banked at 24 degrees ; both the front stretch ( the location of the finish line ) and the back stretch ( opposite the front ) have a five @-@ degree banking . 
 Before the race , Jeff Gordon led the Drivers ' Championship with 1 @,@ 881 points , with teammate Jimmie Johnson in second and Matt Kenseth third . Denny Hamlin and Jeff Burton were fourth and fifth , and Tony Stewart , Kurt Busch , Kevin Harvick , Clint Bowyer , Carl Edwards , Kyle Busch and Jamie McMurray rounded out the top twelve . Chevrolet led the Manufacturers ' Championship with 96 points , 35 points ahead of its rival Ford in second . Dodge with 52 points was 19 points ahead of Toyota in the battle for third place . Kasey Kahne was the race 's defending champion . 
 The Coca @-@ Cola 600 was conceived by race car driver Curtis Turner , who built the Charlotte Motor Speedway . It was first held in 1960 in an attempt by NASCAR to stage a Memorial Day weekend race to compete with the open @-@ wheel Indianapolis 500 ; the two races were held together on the same day starting from 1974 . The race is the longest in terms of distance on the NASCAR calendar , and is considered by several drivers to be one of the sport 's most important races alongside the Daytona 500 , the Brickyard 400 and the Southern 500 . The long distance makes it the most physically demanding event in NASCAR , and teams adapt to changing track conditions because the race occurs between late afternoon and evening . It was known as the World 600 until 1984 when The Coca @-@ Cola Company purchased the naming rights to the race and renamed it the Coca @-@ Cola World 600 in 1985 . It has been called the Coca @-@ Cola 600 every year since 1986 except for 2002 when the name changed to Coca @-@ Cola Racing Family 600 . 
 In preparation for the race , NASCAR held several test sessions on May 7 – 8 , 2007 , to allow teams to prepare for the May races at Lowe 's Motor Speedway . Sessions began at 2 : 00 p.m. EDT on May 7 and concluded at 9 : 00 p.m. On May 8 , sessions started at 1 : 00 p.m. and stopped at 9 : 00 p.m. Eighty @-@ two cars participated in the May 7 afternoon session ; Martin Truex , Jr. was quickest with a speed of 180 @.@ 596 miles per hour ( 290 @.@ 641 km / h ) and David Stremme had the highest speed of the two days at 187 @.@ 000 miles per hour ( 300 @.@ 947 km / h ) in the evening session . Towards the end of the second session , Hamlin lost control of his car and made heavy contact with an outside SAFER barrier ; he was evaluated at the infield care center and was later released to continue testing . During the third session with eighty @-@ four cars , Jeremy Mayfield had the fastest speed of 183 @.@ 667 miles per hour ( 295 @.@ 583 km / h ) and Kurt Busch set the fastest speed of 185 @.@ 644 miles per hour ( 298 @.@ 765 km / h ) in the fourth and final session held in the evening . David Gilliland spun but avoided contact with the wall . 
 There was one change of driver before the race . Starting at the 2007 Coca @-@ Cola 600 , 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott returned to NASCAR on a part @-@ time schedule for the Wood Brothers Racing team , replacing the team 's regular driver Ken Schrader , who drove in the season 's first eleven races . Elliott was eligible to use six Champion 's <unk> if the need arose . Elliott was looking forward to returning to racing : " I was pretty honored to get a call from the Wood Brothers to drive the 21 car . I 've seen them struggle the last few weeks , being outside the top 35 , and it breaks my heart to see them miss races . I hope I can get in the car , get us qualified well every week and see what we can make up in the points battle along the way . " 
 = = = Practice and qualification = = = 
 Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race ; one on Thursday and two on Saturday . The first session lasted 90 minutes , the second 50 minutes and the third 60 minutes . In the first practice session , Elliott Sadler was fastest with a time of 29 @.@ 697 seconds ; Kahne was second and Ricky Rudd third . Johnson was fourth , and Casey Mears placed fifth . Kenseth , Joe Nemechek , Kyle Busch , Scott Riggs and Jamie McMurray completed the session 's top @-@ ten drivers . Sterling Marlin hit one of the walls lining the track and switched to a back @-@ up car . Michael Waltrip did not need to switch cars after a similar collision .
