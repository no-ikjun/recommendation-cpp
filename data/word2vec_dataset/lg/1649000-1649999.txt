 = Michael Jordan statue = 
 The Michael Jordan statue , officially known as The Spirit ( and sometimes referred to as Michael Jordan 's Spirit ) , is a bronze sculpture by Omri Amrany and Julie Rotblatt @-@ Amrany outside the United Center in the Near West Side community area of Chicago . The sculpture was originally commissioned after Jordan 's initial retirement following three consecutive NBA championships and unveiled prior to the Bulls taking residence in their new home stadium the following year . Depicting Basketball Hall of Fame member Michael Jordan and unveiled on November 1 , 1994 , the 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) sculpture stands atop a 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) black granite base . Although not critically well received , the statue has established its own legacy as a meeting place for fans at subsequent Bulls championships and as a rallying point for Chicago Blackhawks fans during their prideful times . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Michael Jordan had spent his entire career with the Chicago Bulls since being drafted in the 1984 NBA Draft by the team with the third overall selection . Eventually , he led the Bulls to three consecutive championships in the 1991 , 1992 and 1993 NBA Finals . During each of these championship seasons he was an NBA All @-@ Star , NBA scoring champion , All @-@ NBA Team first team selection , NBA All @-@ Defensive Team first team selection , and the NBA Finals MVP . 
 After Jordan retired following the 1992 – 93 NBA season , Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf sought a sculptor to honor Jordan and requested that Chicago Bulls Vice President Steve <unk> seek proposals from artists . Twelve artists made proposals . In January 1994 , <unk> hired Omri and Julie Rotblatt @-@ Amrany of Highland Park , Illinois , who erected a statue at the Bulls ' new home for the 1994 – 95 NBA season , the United Center . Until 1994 when they both moved , the Bulls and Blackhawks had played at Chicago Stadium . 
 = = = Creation and installation = = = 
 While the sculpture was a work in progress , the location of the sculptor 's rented studio was kept secret from the public , while the husband @-@ and @-@ wife sculptor team and three assistants spent four months working for sixteen hours every day of the week . The process involved two sittings with Jordan for measurements and photos , including one in which the clay version had to be driven from Chicago to Nashville , to ensure the accuracy of the clay likeness . The 2 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 907 @.@ 2 kg ) sculpture , which is 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) tall , rests on a 5 @-@ foot high black granite base that has an inscription reading " The best there ever was . The best there ever will be . " The base also includes a list of his accomplishments . The bronze statue used lost @-@ wax casting . The sculpture has led to a lot of similar work for the couple . 
 The sculpture 's official address is United Center , 1901 W. Madison Street . Officially named The Spirit , it is located outside of Gate 4 . The United Center opened on August 18 , 1994 . The exact pose of Jordan in <unk> is left for artistic interpretation , but speculations include his 63 @-@ point performance against Boston in the 1986 NBA Playoffs , the 1988 NBA All @-@ Star Game slam @-@ dunk contest at Chicago Stadium and his <unk> logo that has been on Jordan branded Nike products since the 1980s . Jordan is depicted doing a right @-@ handed slam dunk over two opponents while jumping right @-@ to @-@ left in the eastward facing statue giving him a southbound trajectory . Prior to the beginning of each basketball season , the sculpture gets touched up . 
 The sculpture was installed on October 31 and unveiled on November 1 , 1994 in front of a national audience by Jordan , Reinsdorf and Larry King . Jordan 's jersey number was retired during the ceremony . Only Jordan 's knee is attached to the base via a triple @-@ steel post . A stationary basketball hoop was almost part of the sculpture too . The sculpture , which is hollow , was designed to withstand the natural elements . After his second retirement following the 1997 – 98 NBA season , the following quote from the 1992 film A River Runs Through It was added to the base : " At that moment I knew , surely and clearly , that I was witnessing perfection . He stood before us , suspended above the earth , free from all its laws like a work of art , and I knew , just as surely and clearly , that life is not a work of art , and that the moment could not last . " 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Some complain that the sculpture does not depict Jordan 's well @-@ known open @-@ mouthed tongue wag . Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner says the inscription at the base that reads " The best there ever was . The best there ever will be . " refers only to the subject and not the sculpture . Following the Bulls ' second three @-@ peat after Jordan 's return , the statue became a sports mecca for fans to gather and take photographs . ESPN The Magazine listed the sculpture as one of the ten greatest sports photo opportunities in 1998 . 
 In 1995 , 123 28 @-@ inch ( 71 @.@ 1 cm ) bronze maquettes of the sculpture on 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 2 cm ) granite bases were produced by the Rotblatt @-@ <unk> and sold at $ 10 @,@ 000 ( $ 15 @,@ 530 in 2016 dollars ) each as a fundraiser for the James Jordan Boys & Girls Club . The TNT 2 @-@ hour broadcast of the original ceremony had also been in part a fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Club , but some had thought it was overdone and ungraceful . 
 At times , the statue has been adorned with various Chicago Blackhawks player jerseys . When Denis Savard 's jersey was retired on March 19 , 1998 , fans put his jersey on the statue , but it was removed one hour later . During the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals , United Center personnel added an ice hockey helmet , a Reebok jersey of captain Jonathan Toews and Reebok ice skates to the statue . Within 48 hours , the Reebok logos on the ice skates had been covered by Nike stickers . When Chicagoan Barack Obama welcomed the Blackhawks to the White House as President of the United States , he made mention of the jersey being placed on the Jordan statue . In May 2011 , there was an announcement the Hockey Hall of Famers Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull would have statues placed outside of the United Center near Jordan 's sometime early during the 2011 – 12 NHL season . 
 = Interstate 70 in Colorado = 
 Interstate 70 ( I @-@ 70 ) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway in the United States , stretching from Cove Fort , Utah to Baltimore , Maryland . In Colorado , the highway traverses an east – west route across the center of the state . In western Colorado , the highway connects the metropolitan areas of Grand Junction and Denver via a route through the Rocky Mountains . In eastern Colorado , the highway crosses the Great Plains , connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in Kansas and Missouri . Bicycles and other non @-@ motorized vehicles , normally prohibited on Interstate Highways , are allowed on those stretches of I @-@ 70 in the Rockies where no other through route exists . 
 The U.S. Department of Transportation ( USDOT ) lists the construction of I @-@ 70 among the engineering marvels undertaken in the Interstate Highway system , and cites four major accomplishments : the section through the Dakota Hogback , Eisenhower Tunnel , Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon . The Eisenhower Tunnel , with a maximum elevation of 11 @,@ 158 feet ( 3 @,@ 401 m ) and length of 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) , is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point along the Interstate Highway System . The portion through Glenwood Canyon was completed on October 14 , 1992 . This was one of the final pieces of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic , and is one of the most expensive rural highways per mile built in the United States . The Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) earned the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers for the completion of I @-@ 70 through the canyon . 
 When the Interstate Highway system was in the planning stages , the western terminus of I @-@ 70 was proposed to be at Denver . The portion west of Denver was included into the plans after lobbying by Governor Edwin C. Johnson , for whom one of the tunnels along I @-@ 70 is named . East of Idaho Springs , I @-@ 70 was built along the corridor of U.S. Highway 40 , one of the original transcontinental U.S. Highways . West of Idaho Springs , I @-@ 70 was built along the route of U.S. Highway 6 , which was extended into Colorado during the 1930s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Colorado River = = = 
 I @-@ 70 enters Colorado from Utah , concurrent with US 6 and US 50 , on a plateau between the north rim of Ruby Canyon of the Colorado River and the south rim of the Book Cliffs . The plateau ends just past the state line and the highway descends into the Grand Valley , formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries . The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area , the largest conurbation in the area locally known as the Western Slope . The highway directly serves the communities of Fruita , Grand Junction and Palisade . Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City and serves as the economic hub of the area . The freeway passes to the north of downtown , while US 6 and 50 retain their original routes through downtown . US 6 rejoins I @-@ 70 east of Grand Junction ; US 50 departs on a course toward Pueblo . 
 I @-@ 70 exits the valley through De <unk> Canyon , a path carved by the Colorado River that separates the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa . The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains . In the canyon , I @-@ 70 enters the <unk> Mountain Tunnel , the first of several tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies . This tunnel design features a curved sidewall , unusual for tunnels in the United States , where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side @-@ walls . Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength . After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs , the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle . 
 = = = Glenwood Canyon = = = 
 Approaching the city of Glenwood Springs , the highway enters Glenwood Canyon . Both the federal and state departments of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon . A 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) section of roadway features the No Name Tunnel , Hanging Lake Tunnel , Reverse Curve Tunnel , 40 bridges and viaducts , and miles of retaining walls . Through a significant portion of the canyon , the eastbound lanes extend cantilevered over the Colorado River and the westbound lanes are suspended on a viaduct several feet above the canyon floor . Along this run , the freeway hugs the north bank of the Colorado River , while the main line of the former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad ( now part of Union Pacific ) occupies the south bank . 
 To minimize the hazards along this portion , a command center staffed with emergency response vehicles and tow trucks on standby monitors cameras along the tunnels and viaducts in the canyon . Traffic signals have been placed at strategic locations to stop traffic in the event of an accident , and variable message signs equipped with radar guns will automatically warn motorists exceeding the design speed of one of the curves . The USDOT makes provision for bicycles , which are usually prohibited along Interstate Highways , along the freeway corridor in Glenwood Canyon . 
 = = = Rocky Mountains = = = 
 The highway departs the Colorado River near <unk> , the name given to the railroad separation for the two primary mountain crossings , the original via Tennessee Pass / Royal Gorge and the newer and shorter Moffat Tunnel route . I @-@ 70 uses a separate route between the two rail corridors . From this junction I @-@ 70 follows the Eagle River toward Vail Pass , at an elevation of 10 @,@ 666 feet ( 3 @,@ 251 m ) . In this canyon I @-@ 70 reaches the western terminus of U.S. Highway 24 , which meanders through the Rockies before rejoining I @-@ 70 . US 24 is known as the Highway of the <unk> , from the concentration of mountains exceeding 14 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) along the highway corridor . Along the ascent , I @-@ 70 serves the ski resort town of Vail and the ski areas of Beaver Creek Resort , Vail Ski Resort and Copper Mountain . 
 The construction of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel . One of the challenges of this portion is the management of the wildlife that roams this area . Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses . At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross . 
 The highway descends to Dillon Reservoir , near the town of Frisco , and begins one final ascent to the Eisenhower Tunnel , where the freeway crosses the Continental Divide . At the time of dedication , this tunnel was the highest vehicular tunnel in the world , at 11 @,@ 158 feet ( 3 @,@ 401 m ) . As of 2010 , the facility was still the highest vehicular tunnel in the United States . The Eisenhower Tunnel is noted as both the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System . The tunnel has a command center , staffed with 52 full @-@ time employees , to monitor traffic , remove stranded vehicles , and maintain generators to keep the tunnel 's lighting and ventilation systems running in the event of a power failure . Signals are placed at each entrance and at various points inside the tunnel to close lanes or stop traffic in an emergency . There are several active and former ski resorts in the vicinity of the tunnel , including Breckenridge Ski Resort , Keystone Resort , Arapahoe Basin , Loveland Ski Area , Berthoud Pass Ski Area and Winter Park Resort . 
 = = = Clear Creek = = = 
 The freeway follows Clear Creek down the eastern side of the Rockies , passing through the Veterans Memorial Tunnels near Idaho Springs . Farther to the east , I @-@ 70 departs the US 6 corridor , which continues to follow Clear Creek through a narrow , curving gorge . The interstate , however , follows the corridor of US 40 out of the canyon . The highway crests a small mountain near Genesee Park to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains . This portion features grade @-@ warning signs with unusual messages , such as " Trucks : Don 't be fooled , " " Truckers , you are not down yet , " and " Are your brakes adjusted and cool ? " Runaway truck ramps are a prominent feature along this portion of I @-@ 70 , with a total of seven used along the descent of either side the Continental Divide to stop trucks with failed brakes . 
 The last geographic feature of the Rocky Mountains traversed before the highway reaches the Great Plains is the Dakota Hogback . The path through the <unk> features a massive cut that exposes various layers of rock millions of years old . The site includes a nature study area for visitors . 
 = = = Great Plains = = = 
 As the freeway passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains , I @-@ 70 enters the Denver metropolitan area , part of a larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor . The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district , the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver . Through the downtown area , US 40 is routed along Colfax Avenue , which served as the primary east – west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I @-@ 70 . Through downtown , US 6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I @-@ 70 corridor to join Interstate 76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska . The freeway meets Interstate 25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap . From I @-@ 25 on to I @-@ 225 , I @-@ 70 serves — together with those two Interstates — as part of an inner beltway around Denver . 
 I @-@ 70 has one official branch in Colorado , Interstate 270 , which connects the interstate with the Denver – Boulder Turnpike . Where these two freeways merge is the busiest portion of I @-@ 70 in the state , with an annual average daily traffic of 183 @,@ 000 vehicles per day . While State Highway 470 and E @-@ 470 are not officially branches of I @-@ 70 , they are remnants of plans for an I @-@ 470 outer beltway around Denver that were cancelled when the allocated funds were spent elsewhere . 
 Leaving Denver , the highway serves the redevelopment areas on the former site of Stapleton International Airport ; runway 17R / 35L crossed over the Interstate at the runway 's midsection . East of Aurora , I @-@ 70 rejoins the alignment of U.S. Highway 40 at Colfax Avenue . The freeway proceeds east across the Great Plains , briefly dipping south to serve the city of Limon , which bills itself as Hub City because of the many rail and road arteries that intersect there . I @-@ 70 enters Kansas near Burlington , a small community known for having one of the oldest carousels in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 As first proposed in 1944 , the western terminus of I @-@ 70 was Denver , along the corridor of US 40 . The portion across the Rocky Mountains was added to the plans , after lobbying by Colorado officials , following the US 6 corridor . The origins of both the US 40 and US 6 pre @-@ date the U.S. System of numbered highways , using established transcontinental trails . 
 = = = Earlier routes = = = 
 Before the formation of the United States Numbered Highways , the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads , organized by various competing interests , collectively called the auto trail system . The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains . Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado , but left the state without a transcontinental artery . When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming , officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska , enter Colorado , and return to the main route in Wyoming . While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way , the loop proved impractical and was soon removed . 
 After losing the connection to the Lincoln Highway , officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state . The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail . The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War , cresting at Berthoud Pass . After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada , the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway 's main rival for San Francisco @-@ bound traffic . When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926 , the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40 . 
 While US 6 was also one of the original 1926 U.S. Highways , the road originally served the portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains . The highway was not extended to the Pacific coast until 1937 , mostly following the Midland Trail . Around the time the U.S. Highway system was formed , the portion of the Midland Trail through Glenwood Canyon , known as the Taylor State Road , was destroyed by a flood . When US 6 was extended , the Works Progress Administration was rebuilding the road through the canyon and the Public Works Administration was nearing completion of a new highway over Vail Pass . In western Colorado , US 6 was routed concurrent with US 50 from the Utah state line to Grand Junction and eventually replaced US 24 from Grand Junction to near Vail . To keep these routes over the Rockies competitive with alternatives in other states , the Colorado Department of Highways relied on ingenuity to keep the roads safe . The department pioneered new machines to clear snow and various bridge and culvert designs to protect the roads from flooding . 
 = = = Interstate Highway planning = = = 
 Governor Edwin C. Johnson , for whom one of the tunnels along I @-@ 70 was later named , was a primary force in persuading the planners of the Interstate Highway System to extend the highway across the state . He stated to the Senate subcommittee : 
 You are going to have a four @-@ lane highway through Wyoming . You are going to build two four @-@ lane highways through New Mexico and Arizona . Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states . We do not want to take anything away from them . We do not want them to get way out ahead of us , either , because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on . 
 Colorado held several meetings to convince reluctant Utah officials they would benefit from a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City . Utah officials expressed concerns that , given the terrain between these cities , this link would be difficult to build . They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority . Colorado officials persisted , presenting three alternatives to route I @-@ 70 west of Denver , using the corridors of US 40 , US 6 and a route starting at Pueblo , proceeding west along US 50 / US 285 / US 24 . In March 1955 , Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver . The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I @-@ 70 along the US 6 corridor . Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I @-@ 15 near Spanish Fork , Utah , linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas . 
 Congress approved the extension of I @-@ 70 ; however , the route still had to be approved by the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee . Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California ; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected . Military planners approved the extension , but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort , using I @-@ 70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City . Utah officials objected to the modification , complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state . After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension , Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route .

 The first Colorado portion of I @-@ 70 opened to traffic in 1961 . This section bypassed and linked Idaho Springs to the junction where US 6 currently separates from I @-@ 70 west of the city . The majority of the alignment through Denver was completed by 1964 . The Mousetrap reused some structures that were built in 1951 , before the formation of the Interstate Highway system . The last piece east of Denver opened to traffic in 1977 . 
 = = = = Eisenhower Tunnel = = = = 
 Planning on how to route the freeway over the Rocky Mountains began in the early 1960s . The US 6 corridor crosses two passes : Loveland Pass , at an elevation of 11 @,@ 992 feet ( 3 @,@ 655 m ) and Vail Pass , at 10 @,@ 666 feet ( 3 @,@ 251 m ) . Engineers recommended tunneling under Loveland Pass to bypass the steep grades and hairpin curves required to navigate US 6 . The project was originally called the Straight Creek Tunnel , after the waterway that runs along the western approach . The tunnel was later renamed the Eisenhower – Johnson Memorial Tunnel , after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colorado Governor Edwin C. Johnson . 
 Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15 , 1968 . Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget . One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores . These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave @-@ ins and collapses . A total of nine workers were killed during the construction of both bores . Further complicating construction was that the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high altitudes , and the productivity was significantly less than planned . The frustration prompted one engineer to comment , " We were going by the book , but the damned mountain couldn 't read " . The first bore was dedicated March 8 , 1973 . Initially this tunnel was used for two @-@ way traffic , with one lane for each direction . The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions , and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the second tube ( the Johnson bore ) , which was finished on December 21 , 1979 . The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $ 42 million ; the actual cost was $ 108 million ( equivalent to $ 576 million today ) . Approximately 90 % of the funds were paid by the federal government , with the state of Colorado paying the rest . At the time , this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project . The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $ 102 @.@ 8 million ( equivalent to $ 335 million today ) . 
 The tunnel construction became unintentionally involved in the women 's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was given a position in the construction of the Straight Creek Tunnel project . After 18 months on the job , however , she had still not entered the tunnel . There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site ; one supervisor stated that if she entered , " Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they 'd never come back " . Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado , she finally entered the tunnel on November 9 , 1972 . Several workers did walk off the job , but most returned the next day . 
 = = = = Vail Pass = = = = 
 While designing the Eisenhower Tunnel , controversies erupted over how to build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon . The route of US 6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive " V " shape . Initially engineers thought they could shorten the route of I @-@ 70 by about 10 miles ( 16 km ) by tunneling from Gore Creek to South Willow Creek , an alternative known as the Red Buffalo Tunnel . This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an easement across federally protected lands , through what is now called the Eagles Nest Wilderness . After the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture refused to grant the easement , the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass . The engineers added infrastructure to accommodate wildlife , and had significant portions of the viaducts constructed offsite and lifted in place to minimize the environmental footprint . The grade over Vail Pass reaches seven percent . 
 = = = = Glenwood Canyon = = = = 
 Glenwood Canyon has served as the primary transportation artery through the Rocky Mountains , even before the creation of U.S. highways . Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and a dirt road was built through the canyon in the early 20th century . The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 25 million today ) . 
 With the Eisenhower Tunnel finished , the last remaining obstacle for I @-@ 70 to be an interstate commercial artery was the two lane , non @-@ freeway portion in Glenwood Canyon . Construction had started on this section in the 1960s with a small section opening to traffic in 1966 . The remainder was stopped due to environmentalist protests that caused a 30 @-@ year controversy . The original design was criticized as " the epitome of environmental insensitivity " . Engineers scrapped the original plans and started work on a new design that would minimize additional environmental impacts . A new design was underway by 1971 , which was approved in 1975 ; however , environmental groups filed lawsuits to stop construction , and the controversy continued even when construction finally resumed in 1981 . The final design included 40 bridges and viaducts , three additional tunnel bores ( two were completed before construction was stopped in the 1960s ) and 15 miles ( 24 km ) of retaining walls for a stretch of freeway 12 miles ( 19 km ) long . The project was further complicated by the need to build the four @-@ lane freeway without disturbing the operations of the railroad . This required using special and coordinated blasting techniques . Engineers designed two separate tracks for the highway , one elevated above the other , to minimize the footprint in the canyon . The final design was praised for its environmental sensitivity . A Denver architect who helped design the freeway proclaimed , " Most of the people in western Colorado see it as having preserved the canyon . " He further stated , " I think pieces of the highway elevate to the standard of public art . " A portion of the project included shoring up the banks of the Colorado River to repair damage and remove flow restrictions created in the initial construction of US 6 in the 1930s . 
 The freeway was finally completed on October 14 , 1992 , in a ceremony covered nationwide . Most coverage celebrated the engineering achievement or noted this was the last major piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic . However , newspapers in western Colorado celebrated the end of the frustrating traffic delays . For most of the final 10 years of construction , only a single lane of traffic that reversed direction every 30 minutes remained open in the canyon . One newspaper proudly proclaimed " You heard right . For the first time in more than 10 years , construction delays along that 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) stretch of Interstate 70 will be non @-@ existent . " 
 The cost was $ 490 million ( equivalent to $ 800 million today ) to build 12 miles ( 19 km ) , 40 times the average cost per mile predicted by the planners of the Interstate Highway system . This figure exceeded that of Interstate 15 through the Virgin River Gorge , which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the United States . The construction of I @-@ 70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for the Colorado Department of Transportation , including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers . At the dedication it was claimed that I @-@ 70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic . For this reason , the system was proclaimed to be complete . However , as of 2009 , at least two sections of the original Interstate Highway System have not been constructed : a section of Interstate 95 in central New Jersey , and a section of I @-@ 70 in Breezewood , Pennsylvania .

 When first approved , the extension of I @-@ 70 from Denver to Cove Fort was criticized in some area newspapers as a road to nowhere ; an information liaison specialist with the U.S. Department of Transportation in Baltimore , Maryland — the eastern terminus of I @-@ 70 — claims people have asked " did we think Baltimoreans were so desperate to get to Cove Fort that we were willing to pay $ 4 billion to get them there ? " However , a resident engineer with the USDOT has called the extension one of the " crown jewels " of the Interstate Highway System . In Colorado , the freeway helped unite the state , despite the two halves being separated by the formidable Rocky Mountains . The Eisenhower Tunnel alone is credited with saving up to an hour from the drive across the state . Prior to I @-@ 70 's construction , the highway through Glenwood Canyon was one of the most dangerous in the state . With the improvements , the accident rate has dropped 40 % even though traffic through the canyon has substantially increased . The Colorado Department of Transportation is considering the nomination of various portions of I @-@ 70 as a National Historic Landmark , even though the freeway will not qualify as historical for several decades . 
 The freeway is credited with enhancing Colorado 's ski industry . The ski resort town of Vail did not exist until I @-@ 70 began construction , with developers working in close partnership with the Department of Transportation . By 1984 , the I @-@ 70 corridor between Denver and Grand Junction contained the largest concentration of ski resorts in the United States . The towns and cities along the corridor have experienced significant growth , luring recreational visitors from the Denver area . As one conservationist lamented , I @-@ 70 " changed rural Colorado into non @-@ rural Colorado " . 
 One accident at the Mousetrap , a complex interchange , had national ramifications . On August 1 , 1984 , a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned . The situation was made worse as no one answered at the phone number provided with the cargo , and an unknown liquid was leaking from one of the torpedoes . It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene , U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base . The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver 's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours . Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated . Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by officers , and was specifically warned to avoid the Mousetrap . The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment , a violation of federal law , and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment . The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system , with some structures built in 1951 . The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design . Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003 . 
 In 2014 , mile marker 420 was altered by CDOT to read " Mile 419 @.@ 99 " following repeat thefts of the original sign due to the significance of the number 420 in cannabis culture .

 = Borodino @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers ( Russian : <unk> крейсера <unk> « <unk> » ) were a group of four battlecruisers ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy before World War I. Also referred to as the Izmail class , they were laid down in December 1912 at Saint Petersburg for service with the Baltic Fleet . Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad . The start of World War I slowed their construction still further as the imported components were often not delivered and domestic production was diverted into areas more immediately useful for the war effort . 
 Three of the four ships were launched in 1915 and the fourth in 1916 . Work on the gun turrets lagged , and it became evident that Russian industry would not be able to complete the ships during the war . The Russian Revolution of 1917 put a stop to their construction , which was never resumed . Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to completion , they were all eventually sold for scrap by the Soviet Union . The Soviet Navy proposed in 1925 to convert Izmail , the ship closest to completion , to an aircraft carrier , but the plan was cancelled after political maneuvering by the Red Army led to funding not being available .

 After the end of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1905 , the Russian Naval General Staff decided that it needed a squadron of fast " armoured cruisers " that could use their speed to engage the leader of an enemy 's battle line , much as Admiral Tōgō had done against the Russian fleet during the Battle of Tsushima . Initially the Naval General Staff wanted a ship with high speed ( 28 knots or 52 kilometres per hour or 32 miles per hour ) , 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns , and limited protection ( a waterline belt of 190 mm or 7 @.@ 5 in ) ; the Emperor approved construction of four such ships on 5 May 1911 , but the Duma session ended before the proposal could be voted on . Preliminary bids for the ships were solicited from private builders , but the bids proved to be very high , leading to a reconsideration of the requirements . A new specification was issued on 1 July 1911 by the Naval General Staff for a ship with a speed of only 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) and with armour increased to 254 mm ( 10 in ) . Armaments were increased to nine 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) guns in three non @-@ superfiring triple @-@ gun turrets , based on a false rumor that the Germans were increasing the caliber of their guns . The Russian Navy believed that widely separating the main gun magazines improved the survivability of the ship , and that under a superfiring arrangement , muzzle blast would hurt the sailors manning the gun sights in the lower turrets through the open sighting hoods on the turret roofs . 
 The Naval Ministry solicited new bids on 8 September from 23 shipbuilders , domestic and foreign , but only seven responded , even after the deadline was extended by a month . A number of designs were rejected for not meeting the revised criteria . In the meantime , the Artillery Section of the Main Administration of Shipbuilding had decided that it preferred a four @-@ turret design , and new bids were solicited in May 1912 from the leading contenders from the first round of bidding . The eventual winner was a design by the Admiralty Works in Saint Petersburg , which had the extra turret added to a new hull section inserted into the original three @-@ turret design . 
 The Duma approved construction in May 1912 , before the design was finalised , and allocated 45 @.@ 5 million rubles for each ship . However , the increase in armaments and consequential increase in the size of the ships raised their estimated cost by seven million rubles each , and some money was diverted from the budget for the Svetlana @-@ class cruisers . Orders were placed on 18 September 1912 for a pair of ships each from the New Admiralty Shipyard and the Baltic Works . The first pair was to be ready for trials on 14 July 1916 and the second pair on 14 September 1916 . 
 Full @-@ scale armour trials revealed serious weaknesses in the proposed protection scheme . The trials employed the obsolete ironclad Chesma , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the Gangut @-@ class battleships then under construction . The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin , and the structure supporting the side armour was not strong enough to withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells . 
 The design of the Borodino @-@ class ships was modified as a consequence , which slowed their construction . Deck armour was reinforced with extra plates , the turret roofs were increased to a thickness of 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) , and the side and roof of the conning tower were increased by 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) and 125 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) respectively . To compensate for the additional weight , the rear conning tower was removed entirely and the thickness of the main belt was reduced by 4 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 18 in ) . <unk> and tenon joints were introduced between the armour plates along their vertical edges to better distribute the shock of a shell impact and to lessen the stress on the supporting hull structure . The launching of the first pair of ships was postponed by six months because of these changes , plus delays imposed by the large number of ship orders already in hand . 
 The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 caused further delays as a number of components had been ordered from foreign manufacturers . As an example , the gun turrets rested on 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) roller bearings made in Germany , but attempts to order replacements from the United Kingdom and Sweden proved futile , as no company was willing and able to make the bearings . Components for the turbines of Navarin and Izmail that had been ordered from AG Vulcan in Germany were seized by the German government at the beginning of the war and used in the construction of the two Brummer @-@ class cruisers .

 The Borodino @-@ class ships were 223 @.@ 85 metres ( 734 ft 5 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 30 @.@ 5 metres ( 100 ft 1 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 81 metres ( 28 ft 11 in ) at full load . The ships displaced 32 @,@ 500 long tons ( 33 @,@ 000 t ) normally , and 36 @,@ 646 long tons ( 37 @,@ 234 t ) at ( full load ) . High @-@ tensile steel was used throughout the hull with mild steel used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength . The hull was subdivided into 25 transverse watertight bulkheads and the engine room was divided by a longitudinal bulkhead . The double bottom had a height of 1 @.@ 275 metres ( 4 ft 2 @.@ 2 in ) , while the vitals of the ship were protected by a triple bottom that added an extra 875 millimetres ( 34 @.@ 4 in ) of depth . The design called for a freeboard of 8 @.@ 89 metres ( 29 ft 2 in ) forward , 6 @.@ 24 metres ( 20 ft 6 in ) amidships and 6 @.@ 49 metres ( 21 ft 4 in ) aft . The ships were fitted with three Frahm anti @-@ rolling tanks on each side . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Two sets of steam turbines were ordered on 22 April 1913 from the Franco @-@ Russian Works in Saint Petersburg for the Admiralty @-@ built ships ; the Baltic Works built its own turbines and one pair for Navarin was ordered by the AG Vulcan Stettin in Germany , with some components ordered from abroad . The wing propeller shafts were powered by high @-@ pressure impulse @-@ reaction turbines , and the inboard shafts were powered by low @-@ pressure reaction @-@ type turbines . They produced a total of 66 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 49 @,@ 000 kW ) and were designed to be overloaded to 90 @,@ 000 shp ( 67 @,@ 000 kW ) . The turbines were powered by 25 triangular Yarrow boilers with a working pressure of 17 kg / cm2 ( 1 @,@ 667 kPa ; 242 psi ) . The forward boilers were grouped into three compartments with three oil @-@ fired boilers in each compartment . The rear boilers were split into four compartments with each containing four coal @-@ fired boilers fitted with oil sprayers . Maximum speed was estimated at 26 @.@ 5 knots , although forcing the machinery would increase it to 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) . Coal capacity was 1 @,@ 974 long tons ( 2 @,@ 006 t ) and fuel oil capacity was 1 @,@ 904 long tons ( 1 @,@ 935 t ) , which gave an estimated range of 2 @,@ 280 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 220 km ; 2 @,@ 620 mi ) at full speed . 
 The Borodino @-@ class ships had six turbo generators and two diesel generators , each rated at 320 kilowatts ( 430 hp ) . These were divided among four compartments on the platform deck , two forward and two aft of the machinery . The generators powered a complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy @-@ load machinery such as the turret motors . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament consisted of four electrically powered turrets , which were never built . The turrets were designed to elevate and traverse at a rate of 3 ° per second . Each would have had three 52 @-@ calibre 356 @-@ millimetre ( 14 in ) Model 1913 guns . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to + 25 ° . They could be loaded at any angle between − 5 ° and + 15 ° ; the expected rate of fire was three rounds per minute . At full load , 80 rounds per gun could be carried . The guns fired 747 @.@ 6 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 648 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 731 @.@ 5 m / s ( 2 @,@ 400 ft / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 23 @,@ 240 metres ( 25 @,@ 420 yd ) . 
 The secondary armament consisted of twenty @-@ four 55 @-@ calibre 130 mm Pattern 1913 guns mounted in casemates . A pair of casemates were situated on each side , below the three rear turrets ; near the forward turret were six additional casemates , two of which were directly above the middle pair . This positioning reflected the Naval General Staff 's prediction of the most likely direction of attack by torpedo boats . 
 The anti @-@ aircraft armament was intended to be four 38 @-@ caliber 64 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns fitted on the upper deck with 220 rounds stored per gun . Four 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns were to be mounted in pairs on the main turret roofs for sub @-@ caliber training with the main guns . Six underwater 450 @-@ millimetre ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes were fitted , three on each broadside ; they were provided with a total of eighteen torpedoes . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 The fore and aft main gun turrets were given a 6 @-@ meter ( 19 ft 8 in ) rangefinder , and there was another 5 @-@ metre ( 16 ft 5 in ) unit on top of the conning tower . These would provide data for the Geisler central artillery post computer , which would then transmit commands to the gun crew . The mechanical fire @-@ control computer would have been either a Pollen Argo range clock , which had been bought in 1913 , or a domestically designed Erikson system .

 The trials with the Chesma greatly affected the armour protection design of the Borodino @-@ class ships . The Krupp cemented @-@ armour plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints , and they were locked together with mortise @-@ and @-@ tenon joints to better distribute the shock of a shell 's impact . The 237 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 35 in ) waterline belt covered the middle 151 @.@ 2 metres ( 496 ft 1 in ) of the ship . It had a total height of 5 @.@ 015 metres ( 16 ft 5 @.@ 4 in ) , 3 @.@ 375 metres ( 11 ft 0 @.@ 9 in ) of which was above the design waterline and 1 @.@ 64 metres ( 5 ft 5 in ) below . It was backed by 75 millimeters of wood to make a better fit between the hull and the armour . The remaining portion of the waterline was protected by 125 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) plates backed by 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of wood . The upper belt was 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick and had a height of 2 @.@ 89 metres ( 9 ft 6 in ) . It thinned to 75 mm forward of the casemates all the way to the bow . The rear portion of the forecastle deck was protected by an upward extension of the upper belt in the area of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates . The upper casemates themselves were protected from axial fire by 100 mm transverse bulkheads . Behind the side armour was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick between the middle and lower decks . This decreased to 25 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) between the middle and upper decks . The bulkhead sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armour belt with a total thickness of 75 mm . The slope was one 50 mm plate of Krupp non @-@ cemented armour ( KNC ) on a 25 mm nickel @-@ steel plate . The forward end of the armoured citadel was protected separately and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 75 mm thick . The rear bulkhead had no other protection and was 300 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick between the middle and lower decks , decreasing to 75 mm at the level of the armour belt . 
 The main gun turrets had sides 300 mm thick with 150 mm roofs . The gun ports were protected by 50 mm plates , and 25 mm bulkheads separated each gun . The barbettes were 247 @.@ 5 mm ( 9 @.@ 74 in ) thick , decreasing to 147 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 81 in ) when behind other armour . They were shaped like truncated cones which matched the trajectories of descending shells and thus lessened their protective value . The conning tower was 400 millimetres ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) thick , reduced to 300 mm below the upper deck . The funnel uptakes were protected by 50 mm of armour . The upper deck was 37 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 48 in ) thick while the middle deck consisted of 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) plates of KNC on 25 mm of nickel @-@ steel over the armoured citadel . Underwater protection was minimal : there was only a 10 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) watertight bulkhead behind the upward extension of the double bottom , and even this was thinner as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets . 
 = = Construction = = 
 All four ships were officially laid down on 19 December 1912 , but work did not begin until March – April 1913 . After a progress review on 4 June 1914 , launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914 . When World War I began , the hull of Izmail , the most advanced ship , was judged 43 percent complete , with the others lagging considerably behind . The war caused more delays , including problems obtaining imported components , and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war . Three of the four ships were launched in 1915 , but it was clear that Russian industry would not be able to complete them during the war , mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed . They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916 . 
 A number of plans were made for the post @-@ war completion of the ships , including modifying the turrets to load at a fixed angle of + 4 ° to reduce the weight and complexity of the loading equipment . Another intended change was to lengthen the funnels by 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) to minimise smoke interference with the bridge , as this had been noted as a problem on the Gangut @-@ class dreadnoughts . There were suggestions to improve the machinery with geared turbines , turbo @-@ electric drive , or Föttinger 's hydraulic transmission , but these were more theoretical than practical . 
 After the February Revolution , the condition of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917 . The ship that was furthest along was the Ismail : her hull , engines , and boilers were around 65 % complete , and her armour was 36 % complete . Her turrets , however , were not expected to be completed until 1919 . The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid @-@ 1917 , but only to provide jobs . The Provisional Government halted all work on Borodino , Kinburn , and Navarin on 24 October 1917 , and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917 . 
 After the end of the Russian Civil War the victorious Bolsheviks considered finishing Izmail , and possibly Borodino , to their original design . It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmail 's turrets , even if enough guns had been available . Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912 , but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising , given the state of their heavy industry in the wake of the Civil War . Another problem was the complicated electrical system ; it could not be completed under current conditions , and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system . 
 The Soviets considered finishing Kinburn and Navarin to a modified design that featured 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) guns ; a two @-@ gun turret weighed slightly less than a triple 14 @-@ inch gun turret . Four proposals were made with various changes to the turrets ' armour scheme , but none were accepted , not least because the prospects of actually acquiring such guns were minimal . Domestic industry was not capable of building such large guns and they were not able to purchase the guns from any foreign company . Other ideas were examined for the three less complete ships . These included converting the hulls to cargo ships , passenger liners , or 22 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 22 @,@ 000 t ) oil barges , but most of the ideas were rejected as the hulls were thought to be too large and unwieldy for the proposed alternative uses . None of the proposals was accepted , and all three of the less complete ships were sold to a German company for scrap on 21 August 1923 to raise much @-@ needed cash for the government . 
 The Operational Administration of the Soviet Navy worked out the requirements in May 1925 for a conversion that would have made Izmail into an aircraft carrier with a top speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) and a capacity of fifty aircraft . She would have been armed with eight 183 @-@ millimetre ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) guns and her armour reduced to a maximum of 76 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) . This proposal was approved by Alexey Rykov , Chairman of the Council of the People 's Commissars on 6 July 1925 . The plan was cancelled on 16 March 1926 after the Red Army managed to gain control of a commission appointed to review the needs of the Navy , and the Army was strongly opposed to spending additional money on naval projects . She was scrapped beginning in 1931 in Leningrad .

 = Carousel ( musical ) = 
 Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers ( music ) and Oscar Hammerstein II ( book and lyrics ) . The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnár 's 1909 play Liliom , transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline . The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow , whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs . He attempts a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child ; after it goes wrong , he is given a chance to make things right . A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow . The show includes the well @-@ known songs " If I Loved You " , " June Is Bustin ' Out All Over " and " You 'll Never Walk Alone " . Richard Rodgers later wrote that Carousel was his favorite of all his musicals . 
 Following the spectacular success of the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical , Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) , the pair sought to collaborate on another piece , knowing that any resulting work would be compared with Oklahoma ! , most likely unfavorably . They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to Liliom ; Molnár had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past , and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre . After acquiring the rights , the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful . 
 The musical required considerable modification during out @-@ of @-@ town tryouts , but once it opened on Broadway on April 19 , 1945 , it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences . Carousel initially ran for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the West End in 1950 . Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as Oklahoma ! , the piece has been repeatedly revived , and has been recorded several times . A production by Nicholas Hytner enjoyed success in 1992 in London , in 1994 in New York and on tour . In 1999 , Time magazine named Carousel the best musical of the 20th century .

 = = = Liliom = = = 
 Ferenc Molnár 's Hungarian @-@ language drama , Liliom , premiered in Budapest in 1909 . The audience was puzzled by the work , and it lasted only thirty @-@ odd performances before being withdrawn , the first shadow on Molnár 's successful career as a playwright . Liliom was not presented again until after World War I. When it reappeared on the Budapest stage , it was a tremendous hit . 
 Except for the ending , the plots of Liliom and Carousel are very similar . Andreas <unk> ( nicknamed Liliom , the Hungarian word for " lily " , a slang term for " tough guy " ) , a carnival barker , falls in love with Julie Zeller , a servant girl , and they begin living together . With both discharged from their jobs , Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie , but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant . A subplot involves Julie 's friend Marie , who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld , a hotel porter — after the two marry , he becomes the owner of the hotel . Desperate to make money so that he , Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life , Liliom conspires with lowlife <unk> to commit a robbery , but it goes badly , and Liliom stabs himself . He dies , and his spirit is taken to heaven 's police court . As <unk> suggested while the two waited to commit the crime , would @-@ be robbers like them do not come before God Himself . Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family , but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory . 
 On his return to Earth , Liliom encounters his daughter , Louise , who like her mother is now a factory worker . Saying that he knew her father , he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens . When Louise refuses to take it , he strikes her . Not realizing who he is , Julie confronts him , but finds herself unable to be angry with him . Liliom is ushered off to his fate , presumably Hell , and Louise asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a kiss . Julie <unk> tells her daughter that it is very possible for that to happen . 
 An English translation of Liliom was credited to Benjamin " Barney " Glazer , though there is a story that the actual translator , uncredited , was Rodgers ' first major partner Lorenz Hart . The Theatre Guild presented it in New York City in 1921 , with Joseph <unk> as Liliom , and the play was a success , running 300 performances . A 1940 revival , with Burgess Meredith and Ingrid Bergman was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers . Glazer , in introducing the English translation of Liliom , wrote of the play 's appeal : 
 And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched — Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell ; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father ; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery ; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken @-@ hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom , the thieves ' song ringing in her ears ; the two policemen <unk> about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death ; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven . ... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist . 
 = = = Inception = = = 
 In the 1920s and 1930s , Rodgers and Hammerstein both became well known for creating Broadway hits with other partners . Rodgers , with Lorenz Hart , had produced a string of over two dozen musicals , including such popular successes as Babes in Arms ( 1937 ) , The Boys from Syracuse ( 1938 ) and Pal Joey ( 1940 ) . Some of Rodgers ' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre : On Your Toes was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot ( in the " Slaughter on Tenth Avenue " scene ) , while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero . Hammerstein had written or co @-@ written the words for such hits as Rose @-@ Marie ( 1924 ) , The Desert Song ( 1926 ) , The New Moon ( 1927 ) and Show Boat ( 1927 ) . Though less productive in the 1930s , he wrote material for musicals and films , sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern , " The Last Time I Saw Paris " , which was included in the 1941 film Lady Be Good . 
 By the early 1940s , Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil , becoming unreliable and prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him . Hammerstein was eager to do so , and their first collaboration was Oklahoma ! ( 1943 ) . Thomas Hischak states , in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia , that Oklahoma ! is " the single most influential work in the American musical theatre . In fact , the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma ! and what came after it . " An innovation for its time in integrating song , character , plot and dance , Oklahoma ! would serve , according to Hischak , as " the model for Broadway shows for decades " , and proved a huge popular and financial success . Once it was well @-@ launched , what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair . Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma ! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself , which according to Rodgers " was Sam 's blunt but funny way of telling me that I 'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma ! " As they considered new projects , Hammerstein wrote , " We 're such fools . No matter what we do , everyone is bound to say , ' This is not another Oklahoma ! ' " 
 Oklahoma ! had been a struggle to finance and produce . Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild , producers of the blockbuster musical , who together formed what they termed " the <unk> Club " . At one such luncheon , Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Molnár 's Liliom into a musical . Both men refused — they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre . In addition , given the unstable wartime political situation , they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal . At the next luncheon , Helburn and Langner again proposed Liliom , suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole . Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks , but decided that Creole dialect , filled with " zis " and " <unk> " would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics . 
 A breakthrough came when Rodgers , who owned a house in Connecticut , proposed a New England setting . Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945 @,@ 
 I began to see an attractive ensemble — sailors , whalers , girls who worked in the mills up the river , <unk> on near @-@ by islands , an amusement park on the seaboard , things people could do in crowds , people who were strong and alive and lusty , people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin @-@ lipped puritans — a libel I was anxious to refute ... as for the two leading characters , Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest . Liliom is , of course , an international character , indigenous to nowhere . 
 Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed " the tunnel " of Molnár 's second act — a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Liliom 's suicide — followed by a dark ending . They also felt it would be difficult to set Liliom 's motivation for the robbery to music . Molnár 's opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue ; he had famously turned down Giacomo Puccini when the great composer wished to transform Liliom into an opera , stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his , not Puccini 's . In 1937 , Molnár , who had recently emigrated to the United States , had declined another offer from Kurt Weill to adapt the play into a musical . 
 The pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a Liliom adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944 — writing the film musical State Fair and producing I Remember Mama on Broadway . Meanwhile , the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see Oklahoma ! Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt Liliom as beautifully as they had modified Green Grow the Lilacs into Oklahoma ! , he would be pleased to have them do it . The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943 . The playwright received one percent of the gross and $ 2 @,@ 500 for " personal services " . The duo insisted , as part of the contract , that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot . At first , the playwright refused , but eventually yielded . Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won , " we could never have made Carousel . " 
 In seeking to establish through song Liliom 's motivation for the robbery , Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in Pal Joey . Rodgers and Hart had overcome the problem with a song that Joey sings to himself , " I 'm Talking to My Pal " . This inspired " Soliloquy " . Both partners later told a story that " Soliloquy " was only intended to be a song about Liliom 's dreams of a son , but that Rodgers , who had two daughters , insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl . However , the notes taken at their meeting of December 7 , 1943 state : " Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father , in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy , and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely . " 
 Hammerstein and Rodgers returned to the Liliom project in mid @-@ 1944 . Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked , fearing that no matter what they did , Molnár would disapprove of the results . Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little @-@ known work ; Liliom was a theatrical standard . Molnár 's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society . A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife , attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy . Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers . He also built up the secondary couple , who are incidental to the plot in Liliom ; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge . " This Was a Real Nice Clambake " was repurposed from a song , " A Real Nice Hayride " , written for Oklahoma ! but not used . 
 Molnár 's ending was unsuitable , and after a couple of false starts , Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical . According to Frederick Nolan in his book on the team 's works : " From that scene the song " You 'll Never Walk Alone " sprang almost naturally . " In spite of Hammerstein 's simple lyrics for " You 'll Never Walk Alone " , Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music . Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending , 
 Liliom was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people . The way Molnár wrote it , the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory , leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless . We couldn 't accept that . The way we ended Carousel it may still be a tragedy but it 's a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others . 
 When the pair decided to make " This Was a Real Nice Clambake " into an ensemble number , Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like , and researched the matter . Based on his initial findings , he wrote the line , " First came codfish chowder " . However , further research convinced him the proper term was " <unk> chowder " , a term unfamiliar to many playgoers . He decided to keep it as " codfish " . When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast , Hammerstein wrote the line " We slit ' em down the back / And peppered ' em good " . He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front . The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back . Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back . One error not caught involved the song " June Is Bustin ' Out All Over " , in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring — they actually do so in the winter . Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein 's attention , he told his informant that 1873 was a special year , in which sheep mated in the spring . 
 Rodgers early decided to dispense with an overture , feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves . In his autobiography , Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musical 's small orchestra . He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a pantomime scene accompanied by what became known as " The Carousel Waltz " . The pantomime paralleled one in the Molnár play , which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience . Author Ethan Mordden described the effectiveness of this opening : 
 Other characters catch our notice — Mr. Bascombe , the pompous mill owner , Mrs. Mullin , the widow who runs the carousel and , apparently , Billy ; a dancing bear ; an acrobat . But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy — the way she stands frozen , staring at him , while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billy 's spiel . And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel , and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd , and the orchestra storms to a climax , and the curtain falls , we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well . They have plunged into the story , right into the middle of it , in the most intense first scene any musical ever had . 
 = = = Casting and out @-@ of @-@ town tryouts = = = 
 The casting for Carousel began when Oklahoma ! ' s production team , including Rodgers and Hammerstein , was seeking a replacement for the part of Curly ( the male lead in Oklahoma ! ) . Lawrence Langner had heard , through a relative , of a California singer named John Raitt , who might be suitable for the part . Langner went to hear Raitt , then urged the others to bring Raitt to New York for an audition . Raitt asked to sing Largo al factotum , Figaro 's aria from The Barber of Seville , to warm up . The warmup was sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a Curly , they had found a Liliom ( or Billy Bigelow , as the part was renamed ) . Theresa Helburn made another California discovery , Jan Clayton , a singer / actress who had made a few minor films for MGM . She was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of Julie . 
 The producers sought to cast unknowns . Though many had played in previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works , only one , Jean Casto ( cast as carousel owner Mrs. Mullin , and a veteran of Pal Joey ) , had ever played on Broadway before . It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads , due to the war — Rodgers told his casting director , John Fearnley , that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive . Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made Oklahoma ! a success , including director Rouben Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille . Miles White was the costume designer while Jo Mielziner ( who had not worked on Oklahoma ! ) was the scenic and lighting designer . Even though Oklahoma ! orchestrator Russell Bennett had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on Carousel due to a radio contract , Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time . He orchestrated " The Carousel Waltz " and " ( When I Marry ) Mister Snow " before finally being replaced by Don Walker . A new member of the creative team was Trude Rittmann , who arranged the dance music . Rittmann initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman , and found him difficult to work with , but the two worked together on Rodgers ' shows until the 1970s . 
 Rehearsals began in January 1945 ; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present . Raitt was presented with the lyrics for " Soliloquy " on a five @-@ foot long sheet of paper — the piece ran nearly eight minutes . Staging such a long solo number presented problems , and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were never fully addressed . At some point during rehearsals , Molnár came to see what they had done to his play . There are a number of variations on the story . As Rodgers told it , while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein , the composer spotted Molnár in the rear of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner . Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right . At the end , the two walked to the back of the theatre , expecting an angry reaction from Molnár . Instead , the playwright said enthusiastically , " What you have done is so beautiful . And you know what I like best ? The ending ! " Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that . 
 Like most of the pair 's works , Carousel contains a lengthy ballet , " Billy Makes a Journey " , in the second act , as Billy looks down to the Earth from " Up There " and observes his daughter . In the original production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille . It began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor , with the village women gathered for a " birthing " . The ballet involved every character in the play , some of whom spoke lines of dialogue , and contained a number of subplots . The focus was on Louise , played by Bambi Linn , who at first almost soars in her dance , expressing the innocence of childhood . She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates , and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people , who symbolize Billy 's world . A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise , as she discovers her own sexuality , but he decides she is more girl than woman , and he leaves her . After Julie comforts her , Louise goes to a children 's party , where she is shunned . The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the children 's party , with Louise lost between the two groups . At the end , the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies . 
 The play opened for tryouts in New Haven , Connecticut on March 22 , 1945 . The first act was well @-@ received ; the second act was not . Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1 : 30 a.m. The staff immediately sat down for a two @-@ hour conference . Five scenes , half the ballet , and two songs were cut from the show as the result . John Fearnley commented , " Now I see why these people have hits . I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life . " De Mille said of this conference , " not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished . Nor was there any idle joking . ... We cut and cut and cut and then we went to bed . " By the time the company left New Haven , de Mille 's ballet was down to forty minutes . 
 A major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the characters He and She ( later called by Rodgers " Mr. and Mrs. God " ) , before whom Billy appeared after his death . Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife , seen in their parlor . The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening . Rodgers said to Hammerstein , " We 've got to get God out of that parlor " . When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity , Rodgers replied , " I don 't care where you put Him . Put Him on a ladder for all I care , only get Him out of that parlor ! " Hammerstein duly put Mr. God ( renamed the Starkeeper ) atop a ladder , and Mrs. God was removed from the show . Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake , leading to a more fantastic afterlife , which was later criticized by The New Republic as " a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality , not truth but escape from truth " . 
 Hammerstein wrote that Molnár 's advice , to combine two scenes into one , was key to pulling together the second act and represented " a more radical departure from the original than any change we had made " . A reprise of " If I Loved You " was added in the second act , which Rodgers felt needed more music . Three weeks of tryouts in Boston followed the brief New Haven run , and the audience there gave the musical a warm reception . An even shorter version of the ballet was presented the final two weeks in Boston , but on the final night there , de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes , and it brought the house down , causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to embrace her .

 = = = Act 1 = = = 
 Two young female <unk> in 1873 Maine visit the town 's carousel after work . One of them , Julie Jordan , attracts the attention of the barker , Billy Bigelow ( " The Carousel Waltz " ) . When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride , Mrs. Mullin , the widowed owner of the carousel , tells Julie never to return . Julie and her friend , Carrie Pipperidge , argue with Mrs. Mullin . Billy arrives and , seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous , mocks her ; he is fired from his job . Billy , unconcerned , invites Julie to join him for a drink . As he goes to get his belongings , Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him , but Julie is evasive ( " You 're a Queer One , Julie Jordan " ) . Carrie has a beau too , fisherman Enoch Snow ( " ( When I Marry ) Mister Snow " ) , to whom she is newly engaged . Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie 's job . Mr. Bascombe , owner of the mill , happens by along with a policeman , and offers to escort Julie to her home , but she refuses and is fired . Left alone , she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love , but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ( " If I Loved You " ) . 
 Over a month passes , and preparations for the summer clambake are under way ( " June Is Bustin ' Out All Over " ) . Julie and Billy , now married , live at Julie 's cousin Nettie 's spa . Julie confides in Carrie that Billy , frustrated over being unemployed , hit her . Carrie has happier news — she is engaged to Enoch , who enters as she discusses him ( " ( When I Marry ) Mister Snow ( reprise ) ) " . Billy arrives with his ne 'er @-@ do @-@ well whaler friend , Jigger . The former barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie , then leaves with Jigger , followed by a distraught Julie . Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family , larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having ( " When the Children Are Asleep " ) . 
 Jigger and his shipmates , joined by Billy , then sing about life on the sea ( " Blow High , Blow Low " ) . The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery , but Billy declines , as the victim — Julie 's former boss , Mr. Bascombe — might have to be killed . Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel ( and to her ) . He would have to abandon Julie ; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single . Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave . She tells him that she is pregnant , and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness , ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel . Once alone , Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr . — until he realizes that his child might be a girl , and reflects soberly that " you 've got to be a father to a girl " ( " Soliloquy " ) . Determined to provide financially for his future child , whatever the means , Billy decides to be Jigger 's accomplice . 
 The whole town leaves for the clambake . Billy , who had earlier refused to go , agrees to join in , to Julie 's delight , as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger 's alibi ( " Act I Finale " ) . 
 = = = Act 2 = = = 
 Everyone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun ( " This Was a Real Nice Clambake " ) . Jigger tries to seduce Carrie ; Enoch walks in at the wrong moment , and declares that he is finished with her ( " <unk> In the Winder " ) , as Jigger jeers ( " There 's Nothin ' So Bad for a Woman " ) . The girls try to comfort Carrie , but for Julie all that matters is that " he 's your <unk> and you love him " ( " What 's the Use of Wond 'rin ' ? " ) . Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and , trying to stop him , feels the knife hidden in his shirt . She begs him to give it to her , but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery . 
 As they wait , Jigger and Billy gamble with cards . They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils . Billy loses : his participation is now pointless . Unknown to Billy and Jigger , Mr. Bascombe , the intended victim , has already deposited the mill 's money . The robbery fails : Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes . Billy stabs himself with his knife ; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die . Julie strokes his hair , finally able to tell him that she loved him . Carrie and Enoch , reunited by the crisis , attempt to console Julie ; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair ( " You 'll Never Walk Alone " ) . 
 Billy 's defiant spirit ( " The Highest Judge of All " ) is taken Up There to see the Starkeeper , a heavenly official . The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven , but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him , he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself . He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since the former barker 's suicide , and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter , Louise . He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her ( instrumental ballet : " Billy Makes a Journey " ) . Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter . The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife @-@ beater . In the dance , a young ruffian , much like her father at that age , flirts with her and abandons her as too young . The dance concludes , and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter . He steals a star to take with him , as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice . 
 Outside Julie 's cottage , Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now @-@ wealthy Enoch . Carrie 's husband and their many children enter to fetch her — the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day . Enoch Jr . , the oldest son , remains behind to talk with Louise , as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter , invisible to the other characters . Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe . He says that he will stop her by marrying her , but that his father will think her an unsuitable match . Louise is outraged : each insults the other 's father , and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away . Billy , able to make himself visible at will , reveals himself to the sobbing Louise , pretending to be a friend of her father . He offers her a gift — the star he stole from heaven . She refuses it and , frustrated , he slaps her hand . He makes himself invisible , and Louise tells Julie what happened , stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss , not a blow — and Julie understands her perfectly . Louise retreats to the house , as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped ; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy 's presence ( " If I Loved You ( Reprise ) " ) . 
 Billy invisibly attends Louise 's graduation , hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself . The beloved town physician , Dr. Seldon ( who resembles the Starkeeper ) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents ' success or be held back by their failure ( words directed at Louise ) . Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song , " You 'll Never Walk Alone " . Billy , still invisible , whispers to Louise , telling her to believe Seldon 's words , and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl , she learns she does not have to be an outcast . Billy goes to Julie , telling her at last that he loved her . As his widow and daughter join in the singing , Billy is taken to his heavenly reward .

 The original Broadway production opened at the Majestic Theatre on April 19 , 1945 . The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly , and the pair feared the new work would not be well received . One successful last @-@ minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime . The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian , and his version was not working . Rodgers had injured his back the previous week , and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain . Sedated with morphine , he could see only part of the stage . As he could not hear the audience 's applause and laughter , he assumed the show was a failure . It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause . Bambi Linn , who played Louise , was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character , when she next appeared , and bow . Rodgers ' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend , Stephen Sondheim , both teenagers then , across several rows ; both had eyes wet with tears . 
 The original production ran for 890 performances , closing on May 24 , 1947 . The original cast included John Raitt ( Billy ) , Jan Clayton ( Julie ) , Jean Darling ( Carrie ) , Eric Mattson ( Enoch Snow ) , Christine Johnson ( Nettie Fowler ) , <unk> Vye ( Jigger ) , Bambi Linn ( Louise ) and Russell Collins ( Starkeeper ) . In December 1945 , Clayton left to star in the Broadway revival of Show Boat and was replaced by Iva Withers ; Raitt was replaced by Henry Michel in January 1947 ; Darling was replaced by Margot Moser . 
 After closing on Broadway , the show went on a national tour for two years . It played for five months in Chicago alone , visited twenty states and two Canadian cities , covered 15 @,@ 000 miles ( 24 @,@ 000 km ) and played to nearly two million people . The touring company had a four @-@ week run at New York City Center in January 1949 . Following the City Center run , the show was moved back to the Majestic Theatre in the hopes of filling the theatre until South Pacific opened in early April . However , ticket sales were mediocre , and the show closed almost a month early . 
 The musical premiered in the West End , London , at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane on June 7 , 1950 . The production was restaged by Jerome Whyte , with a cast that included Stephen Douglass ( Billy ) , Iva Withers ( Julie ) and Margot Moser ( Carrie ) . Carousel ran in London for 566 performances , remaining there for over a year and a half . 
 = = = Subsequent productions = = = 
 Carousel was revived in 1954 and 1957 at City Center , presented by the New York City Center Light Opera Company . Both times , the production featured Barbara Cook , though she played Carrie in 1954 and Julie in 1957 ( playing alongside Howard Keel as Billy ) . The production was then taken to Belgium to be performed at the 1958 Brussels World 's Fair , with David Atkinson as Billy , Ruth <unk> as Nettie , and Clayton reprising the role of Julie , which she had originated . 
 In August 1965 , Rodgers and the Music Theater of Lincoln Center produced Carousel for 47 performances . John Raitt reprised the role of Billy , with Jerry Orbach as Jigger and Reid Shelton as Enoch Snow . The roles of the Starkeeper and Dr. Seldon were played by Edward Everett Horton in his final stage appearance . The following year , New York City Center Light Opera Company brought Carousel back to City Center for 22 performances , with Bruce Yarnell as Billy and Constance Towers as Julie . 
 Nicholas Hytner directed a new production of Carousel in 1992 , at London 's Royal National Theatre , with choreography by Sir Kenneth MacMillan and designs by Bob Crowley . In this staging , the story begins at the mill , where Julie and Carrie work , with the music slowed down to emphasize the drudgery . After work ends , they move to the shipyards and then to the carnival . As they proceed on a revolving stage , carnival characters appear , and at last the carousel is assembled onstage for the girls to ride . Louise is seduced by the ruffian boy during her Act 2 ballet , set around the ruins of a carousel . Michael Hayden played Billy not as a large , gruff man , but as a frustrated smaller one , a time bomb waiting to explode . Hayden , Joanna Riding ( Julie ) and Janie Dee ( Carrie ) all won Olivier Awards for their performances . Patricia Routledge played Nettie . Enoch and Carrie were cast as an interracial couple whose eight children , according to the review in The New York Times , looked like " a walking United Colors of Benetton ad " . Clive Rowe , as Enoch , was nominated for an Olivier Award . The production 's limited run from December 1992 through March 1993 was a sellout . It re @-@ opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in September 1993 , presented by Cameron Mackintosh , where it continued until May 1994 . 
 The Hytner production moved to New York 's Vivian Beaumont Theater , where it opened on March 24 , 1994 and ran for 322 performances . This won five Tony Awards , including best musical revival , as well as awards for Hytner , MacMillan , Crowley and Audra McDonald ( as Carrie ) . The cast also included Sally Murphy as Julie , Shirley Verrett as Nettie , Fisher Stevens as Jigger and Eddie <unk> as Enoch . One change made from the London to the New York production was to have Billy strike Louise across the face , rather than on the hand . According to Hayden , " He does the one unpardonable thing , the thing we can 't forgive . It 's a challenge for the audience to like him after that . " The Hytner Carousel was presented in Japan in May 1995 . A U.S. national tour with a scaled @-@ down production began in February 1996 in Houston and closed in May 1997 in Providence , Rhode Island . Producers sought to feature young talent on the tour , with Patrick Wilson as Billy and Sarah <unk> Berry , and later Jennifer Laura Thompson , as Julie . 
 A revival opened at London 's Savoy Theatre on December 2 , 2008 , after a week of previews , starring Jeremiah James ( Billy ) , Alexandra Silber ( Julie ) and Lesley Garrett ( Nettie ) . The production received warm to mixed reviews . It closed in June 2009 , a month early . Michael Coveney , writing in The Independent , admired Rodgers ' music but stated , " Lindsay Posner 's efficient revival doesn 't hold a candle to the National Theatre 1992 version " . 
 = = = Film , television and concert versions = = = 
 A film version of the musical was made in 1956 , starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones . It follows the musical 's story fairly closely , although a prologue , set in the Starkeeper 's heaven , was added . The film was released only a few months after the release of the film version of Oklahoma ! . It garnered some good reviews , and the soundtrack recording was a best seller . As the same stars appeared in both pictures , however , the two films were often compared , generally to the disadvantage of Carousel . Thomas Hischak , in The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia , later wondered " if the smaller number of Carousel stage revivals is the product of this often @-@ lumbering [ film ] musical " . 
 There was also an abridged ( 100 minute ) 1967 network television version that starred Robert Goulet , with choreography by Edward Villella . 
 The New York Philharmonic presented a staged concert version of the musical from February 28 , 2013 to March 2 , 2013 at Avery Fisher Hall . Kelli O 'Hara played Julie , with Nathan Gunn as Billy , Stephanie Blythe as Nettie , Jessie Mueller as Carrie , Jason <unk> as Enoch , Shuler Hensley as Jigger , John Cullum as the Starkeeper , and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin . <unk> Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle . The production was directed by John Rando . Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote , " this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear . " It was broadcast as part of the PBS " Live from Lincoln Center " series , premiering on April 26 , 2013 .

 = = = Musical treatment = = = 
 Rodgers designed Carousel to be an almost continuous stream of music , especially in Act 1 . In later years , Rodgers was asked if he had considered writing an opera . He stated that he had been sorely tempted to , but saw Carousel in operatic terms . He remembered , " We came very close to opera in the Majestic Theatre . ... There 's much that is operatic in the music . " 
 Rodgers uses music in Carousel in subtle ways to differentiate characters and tell the audience of their emotional state . In " You 're a Queer One , Julie Jordan " , the music for the placid Carrie is characterized by even eighth @-@ note rhythms , whereas the emotionally restless Julie 's music is marked by dotted eighths and sixteenths ; this rhythm will characterize her throughout the show . When Billy whistles a snatch of the song , he selects Julie 's dotted notes rather than Carrie 's . Reflecting the close association in the music between Julie and the as @-@ yet unborn Louise , when Billy sings in " Soliloquy " of his daughter , who " gets hungry every night " , he uses Julie 's dotted rhythms . Such rhythms also characterize Julie 's Act 2 song , " What 's the Use of Wond 'rin ' " . The stable love between Enoch and Carrie is strengthened by her willingness to let Enoch not only plan his entire life , but hers as well . This is reflected in " When the Children Are Asleep " , where the two sing in close harmony , but Enoch musically interrupts his intended 's turn at the chorus with the words " Dreams that won 't be interrupted " . Rodgers biographer Geoffrey Block , in his book on the Broadway musical , points out that though Billy may strike his wife , he allows her musical themes to become a part of him and never interrupts her music . Block suggests that , as reprehensible as Billy may be for his actions , Enoch requiring Carrie to act as " the little woman " , and his having nine children with her ( more than she had found acceptable in " When the Children are Asleep " ) can be considered to be even more abusive . 
 The twelve @-@ minute " bench scene " , in which Billy and Julie get to know each other and which culminates with " If I Loved You " , according to Hischak , " is considered the most completely integrated piece of music @-@ drama in the American musical theatre " . The scene is almost entirely drawn from Molnár and is one extended musical piece ; Stephen Sondheim described it as " probably the single most important moment in the revolution of contemporary musicals " . " If I Loved You " has been recorded many times , by such diverse artists as Frank Sinatra , Barbra Streisand , Sammy Davis Jr . , Mario Lanza and Chad and Jeremy . The D @-@ flat major theme that dominates the music for the second act ballet seems like a new melody to many audience members . It is , however , a greatly expanded development of a theme heard during " Soliloquy " at the line " I guess he 'll call me ' The old man ' " . 
 When the pair discussed the song that would become " Soliloquy " , Rodgers improvised at the piano to give Hammerstein an idea of how he envisioned the song . When Hammerstein presented his collaborator with the lyrics after two weeks of work ( Hammerstein always wrote the words first , then Rodgers would write the melodies ) , Rodgers wrote the music for the eight @-@ minute song in two hours . " What 's the Use of Wond 'rin ' " , one of Julie 's songs , worked well in the show but was never as popular on the radio or for recording , and Hammerstein believed that the lack of popularity was because he had concluded the final line , " And all the rest is talk " with a hard consonant , which does not allow the singer a vocal climax . 
 Irving Berlin later stated that " You 'll Never Walk Alone " had the same sort of effect on him as the 23rd Psalm . When singer Mel Tormé told Rodgers that " You 'll Never Walk Alone " had made him cry , Rodgers nodded impatiently . " You 're supposed to . " The frequently recorded song has become a universally accepted hymn . The cast recording of Carousel proved popular in Liverpool , like many Broadway albums , and in 1963 , the Brian Epstein @-@ managed band , Gerry and the Pacemakers had a number @-@ one hit with the song . At the time , the top ten hits were played before Liverpool F.C. home matches ; even after " You 'll Never Walk Alone " dropped out of the top ten , fans continued to sing it , and it has become closely associated with the soccer team and the city of Liverpool . A BBC program , Soul Music , ranked it alongside " Silent Night " and " Abide With Me " in terms of its emotional impact and iconic status . 
 = = = Recordings = = = 
 The cast album of the 1945 Broadway production was issued on 78s , and the score was significantly cut — as was the 1950 London cast recording . Theatre historian John Kenrick notes of the 1945 recording that a number of songs had to be abridged to fit the 78 format , but that there is a small part of " Soliloquy " found on no other recording , as Rodgers cut it from the score immediately after the studio recording was made . 
 A number of songs were cut for the 1956 film , but two of the deleted numbers had been recorded and were ultimately retained on the soundtrack album . The expanded CD version of the soundtrack , issued in 2001 , contains all of the singing recorded for the film , including the cut portions , and nearly all of the dance music . The recording of the 1965 Lincoln Center revival featured Raitt reprising the role of Billy . Studio recordings of Carousel 's songs were released in 1956 ( with Robert Merrill as Billy , Patrice <unk> as Julie , and Florence Henderson as Carrie ) , 1962 and 1987 . The 1987 version featured a mix of opera and musical stars , including Samuel Ramey , Barbara Cook and Sarah Brightman . Kenrick recommends the 1962 studio recording for its outstanding cast , including Alfred Drake , Roberta Peters , <unk> Turner , Lee Venora , and Norman <unk> . 
 Both the London ( 1993 ) and New York ( 1994 ) cast albums of the Hytner production contain portions of dialogue that , according to Hischak , speak to the power of Michael Hayden 's portrayal of Billy . Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all @-@ around performance of Carousel on disc , despite uneven singing by Hayden , due to Sally Murphy 's Julie and the strong supporting cast ( calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard ) . The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015 . 
 = = Critical reception and legacy = = 
 The musical received almost unanimous rave reviews after its opening in 1945 . According to Hischak , reviews were not as exuberant as for Oklahoma ! as the critics were not taken by surprise this time . John Chapman of the Daily News termed it " one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always " . The New York Times 's reviewer , Lewis Nichols , stated that " Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d , who can do no wrong , have continued doing no wrong in adapting Liliom into a musical play . Their Carousel is on the whole delightful . " <unk> Waldorf of the New York Post , however , complained , " Carousel seemed to us a rather long evening . The Oklahoma ! formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille 's ballets . All right , go ahead and shoot ! " Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits for her role as Louise , stating , " Bambi doesn 't come on until twenty minutes before eleven , and for the next forty minutes , she practically holds the audience in her hand " . Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune also applauded the dancing : " It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show . " 
 When the musical returned to New York in 1949 , The New York Times reviewer Brooks Atkinson described Carousel as " a conspicuously superior musical play ... Carousel , which was warmly appreciated when it opened , seems like nothing less than a masterpiece now . " In 1954 , when Carousel was revived at City Center , Atkinson discussed the musical in his review : 
 Carousel has no comment to make on anything of topical importance . The theme is timeless and universal : the devotion of two people who love each other through thick and thin , complicated in this case by the wayward personality of the man , who cannot fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed . ... Billy is a bum , but Carousel recognizes the decency of his motives and admires his independence . There are no slick solutions in Carousel . 
 Stephen Sondheim noted the duo 's ability to take the innovations of Oklahoma ! and apply them to a serious setting : " Oklahoma ! is about a picnic , Carousel is about life and death . " Critic Eric Bentley , on the other hand , wrote that " the last scene of Carousel is an impertinence : I refuse to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children , the nature of the good life , and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls . " 
 New York Times critic Frank Rich said of the 1992 London production : " What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner 's direction , aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness , is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein 's vision of redemption , which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good . " The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier Carousel , which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s . Clive Barnes of the New York Post called it a " defining Carousel — hard @-@ nosed , imaginative , and exciting . " 
 Critic Michael Billington has commented that " lyrically [ Carousel ] comes perilously close to acceptance of the inevitability of domestic violence . " <unk> stated in 2013 that Carousel is now " considered somewhat controversial " because Julie " opts to stays [ sic ] with Billy Bigelow even after he begins hitting her " ; actress Kelli O 'Hara noted that the domestic violence that Julie " chooses to deal with – is a real , existing and very complicated thing . And exploring it is an important part of healing it . " 
 Rodgers considered Carousel his favorite of all his musicals and wrote , " it affects me deeply every time I see it performed " . In 1999 , Time magazine , in its " Best of the Century " list , named Carousel the Best Musical of the 20th century , writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein " set the standards for the 20th century musical , and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling " . Hammerstein 's grandson , Oscar Andrew Hammerstein , in his book about his family , suggested that the wartime situation made Carousel 's ending especially poignant to its original viewers , " Every American grieved the loss of a brother , son , father , or friend ... the audience empathized with [ Billy 's ] all @-@ too @-@ human efforts to offer advice , to seek forgiveness , to complete an unfinished life , and to bid a proper good @-@ bye from beyond the grave . " Author and composer Ethan Mordden agreed with that perspective : 
 If Oklahoma ! developed the moral argument for sending American boys overseas , Carousel offered consolation to those wives and mothers whose boys would only return in spirit . The meaning lay not in the tragedy of the present , but in the hope for a future where no one walks alone .

 = Peter Canavan = 
 Peter Canavan ( born 9 April 1971 ) is a former Gaelic footballer and manager . 
 He played inter @-@ county football for Tyrone , and is one of the most decorated players in the game 's history , winning two All @-@ Ireland Senior Football Championship medals , six All Stars Awards ( more than any other Ulster player , and joint third overall ) , four provincial titles , and two National Leagues and several under @-@ age and club championship medals . He represented Ireland in the International Rules Series on several occasions from 1998 until 2000 . He is considered one of the great players of the last twenty years by commentators such as John Haughey of the BBC , and in 2009 , he was named in the Sunday Tribune 's list of the 125 Most Influential People in GAA History . 
 His scoring record of 218 points is the second highest of all time in the Ulster Senior Football Championship . His early high scoring rate , when he would often be Tyrone 's best performer – particularly in the 1995 All @-@ Ireland Senior Football Championship Final when he scored eleven of Tyrone 's twelve points — led to claims that Tyrone was a " one @-@ man show , " and that the team was too dependent on him , particularly in his early career . 
 Since retiring as a player he has managed the Fermanagh inter @-@ county Gaelic football team ( 2011 – 2013 ) . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Canavan is from <unk> , near Ballygawley , County Tyrone and was the tenth of eleven children . His older brother , Pascal , played with him on the Tyrone panel for most of the 1990s . He is married to Finola ( sister of former Tyrone team @-@ mate Ronan <unk> ) , and has four children , <unk> , Claire , Darragh and <unk> , and has been a Physical Education teacher in Holy Trinity College , Cookstown , throughout most of his career ( Gaelic games are amateur sports ) . While there , he taught Eoin Mulligan his point @-@ taking technique , and the pair have been known in the media as ' master and student ' ever since , particularly by television commentators . 
 He writes a column for the Gaelic games magazine , Hogan Stand and the Northern Ireland edition of The Daily <unk> and in 2008 , Canavan joined TV3 as a football pundit for their first year of broadcasting live GAA matches . 
 In 2003 , just over a week before Tyrone 's Ulster final appearance against Down , Canavan 's father , Seán , died . It came as a shock to Canavan , who had thought his father ( who was already in hospital ) was getting better . He decided to play in the match , stating that he knew , subconsciously " [ he ] was going to be playing in the Ulster final all along and Daddy certainly wouldn 't have wanted [ him ] to do anything but play . " 
 Canavan has suffered from asthma since he was a child , and has battled throughout his career to control the ailment . He told the Asthma Society of Ireland , " I thought to myself , this is something that I am just going to have to put up with . " In later years , however , improved medication has afforded Canavan what he described as , " a better quality of life " . 
 = = Under @-@ age career = = 
 To play for an inter @-@ county GAA team , Canavan had to work around a Gaelic Athletic Association ( GAA ) bylaw , because of a dispute in his parish , Errigal Ciarán . Two clubs claimed to represent the parish , the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran 's club and the newly formed club , then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh <unk> . Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members , because the club failed to register correctly . Canavan registered as a member of the <unk> hurling club , even though he didn 't play the sport , just so he would be eligible for selection for the Tyrone minors . Prior to that , he had not played legitimate club football , but had forged his way onto the Tyrone under @-@ age teams with his performances at school level . The two clubs united under the banner of Errigal Ciaran two years later . 
 In 1988 , Canavan won the Ulster minor Championship , an under <unk> tournament , but lost in the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final to Kerry . The crux of this team , including Adrian Cush , Ciaran Corr and others , would stay together as part of the senior team for most of the nineties . Canavan captained Tyrone to two All @-@ Ireland Under @-@ 21 Football Championships titles in 1991 and 1992 , having been on the team which lost the 1990 final , again to Kerry . In four years as an Under 21 player , Canavan scored 13 – 53 ( 13 goals and 53 points — each goal equals 3 points ; 13 × 3 + 53 = 92 points , see GAA scoring rules ) for Tyrone . By the time he was twenty , he was already an automatic choice in the senior panel .

 Canavan 's name was already known around Tyrone because of his exploits for the Under 21 team , but he started to make an impact in the Ulster Senior Football Championship in 1994 , as Tyrone lost to eventual All @-@ Ireland champions , Down . He was the top scorer in the province , earning him his first All Star , at the age of 23 .

 Throughout the 1995 championship , Canavan had spearheaded Tyrone 's march to the final , with round after round of massive scoring exploits . Against Derry in the Ulster Semi @-@ final , he scored 0 – 8 , and against Galway in the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final , he scored 1 – 7 . 
 Tyrone reached their second All @-@ Ireland Final in 1995 , and were up against Dublin who hadn 't won a Championship since the 1980s . In a turgid match , Canavan scored eleven of Tyrone 's twelve points in the , but still ended up on the losing side . The game was remembered as contentious for Tyrone fans , for the fact that a point that would have equalised the match in the dying seconds was controversially disallowed , because the blind @-@ sided referee deemed Canavan to have touched the ball on the ground . The referee , Paddy Russell stated in his autobiography that he was certain the ball was on the ground , but Canavan contested in the same book that he managed to get elevation on the ball as he punched , which would have been very difficult to do if it was touching the ground . He was the top scorer in Ireland that year , with a total of 1 – 38 , earning him the inaugural Footballer of the Year title . The fact that Canavan 's scoring tally was so far ahead of his peers on the team led to suggestions that Tyrone were depending too heavily on him . 
 = = = 1996 : Injury = = = 
 For the 1996 championship , Canavan was handed the captaincy of Tyrone , and was Ulster 's leading scorer for the third year in a row , and subsequently awarded his third successive All Star . Tyrone reached the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final against Meath , but Canavan was one of six Tyrone players to sustain injuries that day , which some Tyrone fans attribute to Meath 's heavy @-@ handedness . Canavan 's injury was so severe that he was still feeling the effects for over a year , and there was speculation as to whether he had been playing on a broken foot .

 During a weak period for Tyrone Seniors in the late 1990s , Canavan represented Ireland in the inaugural International Rules Series in 1998 against Australia . In 1999 , he was named vice @-@ captain of the team for the tour to Australia , and Ireland came away convincing winners , with Canavan scoring eleven points in the first test in Adelaide , South Australia . In 2000 , In the first test Australia 's Jason Akermanis gave Canavan a bloody nose 20 seconds into the game . Canavan was sent off in the second test , after fighting with Akermanis . He was banned for one match , which wouldn 't be played until the next year , so he ruled himself out of the next series . In five tests Canavan scored 37 points , becoming one of the few Irish players to leave their mark on the Australian supporters . 
 = = Late senior career = = 
 Tyrone were one of the favourites for the 2002 All @-@ Ireland , having won their first National Football League in the spring , but ended up losing a qualifying match to Sligo , even though Canavan scored six points on the day . That particular defeat stunned him so much , he considered retiring Inter County football . Despite that , he won his fourth All Star that year , the only Tyrone player to do so , which made him Tyrone 's most represented player on the All Star Roll of Honour , overtaking Eugene McKenna , his manager at the time . 
 = = = 2003 : Championship glory = = = 
 In 2003 , Canavan shook off his tag as ' the greatest player never to win an All @-@ Ireland ' , captaining Tyrone to their first All @-@ Ireland Senior Football Championship . As he approached the podium on Croke Park 's Hogan Stand after the final , his nervousness was visible , and after being handed the trophy , he made an emotional speech about how he had to <unk> watch other Ulster teams lift the Sam Maguire Cup , but " to eventually win it is something else . " 
 His appearance in the final was remarkable for the fact that he was the top scorer of the day with five points , despite having suffered an ankle injury in the previous match , and was not expected ( or advised ) to play . He started the final and was taken off before half time . During the break , and even some way into the second half , he was receiving treatment to his ankle , including pain @-@ killing injections . 
 With ten minutes remaining , he was reintroduced by manager Mickey Harte , likely due to his experience as the only member of the team who had played in an All @-@ Ireland final before . This reintroduction , while not the first time it had happened ( blood substitutions had been used sporadically , for example ) , was seen as one of the greatest moments in the GAA in the last forty years . 
 In the drawn Ulster final against Down , Canavan was playing a week after the death of his father . He remarked in his autobiography that he feared Tyrone were going to lose by one of the biggest margins in Ulster Championship history , if they didn 't stem the flow of the Down attack . When Tyrone were awarded a penalty , Canavan stepped up , due to Stephen O 'Neill ( the first choice penalty @-@ taker ) being on the bench . He took the kick , and managed to find the net , later describing it as " the most important [ kick ] of my career , " citing the fact that if Tyrone had been heavily beaten , they probably wouldn 't have been able to pick themselves up to play in the ' back door ' qualifier series . 
 Over the course of the 2003 Championship , he amassed a total of 1 – 48 ( a total of 51 points ) , and had won the National League in the spring , all of which earned him a fifth All Star . Among his more notable performances of the year included an eight @-@ point haul in the replayed first round match against Derry , and in the replayed Ulster Final , Canavan scored eleven points . 
 He became the first GAA star to gain an honorary doctorate from the University of Ulster , and was also voted BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality of the Year , a regional award of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year . Following an email campaign throughout Ireland , Canavan was an early forerunner for the national award , despite the fact that Gaelic games have very little exposure in Great Britain . 
 Following the 2003 final , Canavan relinquished the captaincy to Cormac McAnallen , but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old died shortly after taking up the position . This tragedy adversely affected the mindset of the team , and they were unable to defend their All @-@ Ireland . 
 = = = 2005 : Championship swan song = = = 
 Canavan was used mostly as an ' impact substitute ' throughout the 2005 Championship — brought on to either unsettle the opposition , or rally his teammates . This backfired when he was controversially sent off within a minute of coming on as a substitute in the Ulster Final replay replay . 
 In the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final against Armagh ( who were meeting Tyrone for the third time that year ) , Canavan scored with the last kick of the game , winning the match for Tyrone . Kevin McStay , a former Mayo player , described it as the point of the season , despite the free kick being from a relatively straightforward position . 
 Mickey Harte chose Canavan on the starting line @-@ up of the All @-@ Ireland final and went on to score Tyrone 's only goal , winning on a scoreline of 1 – 16 to 2 – 10 . 
 He retired from inter @-@ county football following this performance with a sixth All Star , ending a sixteen @-@ year tenure in Senior championship football . He said of his decision , " I have spent enough time on the treatment table " , referring to the instances where he played while carrying potentially career @-@ threatening injuries , as he had done in 1996 and 2003 . Canavan 's appearance in the 2005 final ( his last game for Tyrone ) , was his forty @-@ ninth Championship match .

 Canavan was part of both Tyrone sides that won the National Football League title two years in a row — in 2002 and 2003 — and he competed in the 1994 final against Derry . His success in other competitions include five Railway Cups , two Vocational Schools titles , and one Dr. McKenna Cup .

 = Mythicomyces = 
 Mythicomyces is a fungal genus in the family Psathyrellaceae . A monotypic genus , it contains the single species Mythicomyces corneipes , first described by Elias Fries in 1861 . The fungus produces fruit bodies with shiny yellowish @-@ orange to tawny caps that are 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter . These are supported by stems measuring 2 – 5 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) long and 1 – 2 mm thick . A rare to uncommon species , it is found in northern temperate regions of North America and Europe , where it typically fruits in groups , in wet areas of coniferous forests . There are several species with which M. corneipes might be confused due to a comparable appearance or similar range and habitat , but microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish between them . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Mythicomyces was circumscribed in 1986 by mycologists Scott Redhead and Alexander H. Smith to contain the species originally named Agaricus corneipes by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861 . Fries described the species from collections made in a fir forest near <unk> , Sweden ; it was subsequently recorded in North America ( northwestern USA ) by Andrew Price Morgan in 1907 , and several times by Smith . When listing the synonyms of the species , Redhead and Smith cited the publication year of Fries 's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861 , which rendered their new combination invalid according to the rules of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature , although the generic name was valid . The binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011 . 
 In its taxonomic history , the species has also been placed in <unk> by Lucien Quélet in 1886 , and Psilocybe by Petter Karsten in 1879 . Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán excluded the taxon from the latter genus in his 1983 monograph , based on its roughened spores that lacked a germ pore , pale spore print , stem texture , and the tawny basal mycelium . Guzmán , who examined Smith 's US collections , suggested that the material might be more appropriately considered a Galerina , but Redhead and Smith noted that several features of Mythicomyces corneipes are inconsistent with placement in Galerina , including spore print color , presence of metuloids , stem texture , and tawny basal mycelium . 
 Redhead and Smith placed the genus in the Strophariaceae , as the biology of the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984 . They noted , however , that the genus did not fit well in a more restricted concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls . More recently , taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae ; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group . Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister to the rest of the family . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is initially somewhat conical with margins rolled inward , and expands to become bell @-@ shaped or broadly convex in maturity , reaching a diameter of 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) . The cap sometimes has an umbo , which is rounded to conical . The color of the cap ranges from dull to bright orange when young , to yellowish @-@ brown ( tawny ) in maturity . It is hygrophanous , and the color fades to yellowish @-@ buff . The cap surface is smooth and polished , and somewhat translucent , such that the radial gill lines can be seen on the margin . The gills are closely spaced , and have two tiers of interspersed lamellulae ( short gills ) . Gills have an adnate to adnexed attachment to the stem , although the gills tend to secede ( separate from the stem ) in maturity . They are initially pallid to whitish in color before turning brownish when the spores mature . The smooth stem measures 3 – 5 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) long by 1 – 2 mm thick . <unk> to pale orange near the top and dark reddish brown below , it has tawny mycelium at the base . In maturity the stem turns black from the base upward . In 1907 , Morgan noted the stipe to be remarkably similar to that of Marasmius <unk> . The mushroom flesh has an odor that ranges from indistinct to somewhat of geraniums , while its taste is indistinct to faintly bitter . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . 
 The spore print is pale purplish brown . Spores are ovoid ( egg @-@ shaped ) to somewhat ellipsoidal , binucleate ( visible when stained with acetocarmine solution ) , often contain a single oil droplet , and measure 6 – 8 @.@ 5 by 4 – 5 @.@ 5 µm . The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges , and have a small plage . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 24 – 26 by 6 – 8 @.@ 5 µm . Cystidia on the gill face ( pleurocystidia ) are abundant . They are spindle @-@ shaped with swollen middles , and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals . They have dimensions of 43 – 86 by 10 – 24 µm , with walls that are pale brown to translucent , and up to 3 µm thick . Cystidia on the gill edge ( cheilocystidia ) are roughly the same morphologically , but shorter . The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1 – 4 µm in diameter . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Stagnicola perplexa is similar in appearance and shares habitats and a geographical range comparable to Mythicomyces corneipes . S. perplexa generally has a more faded coloration , and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones . The two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics , as Stagnicola has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls . Owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses , Phaeocollybia attenuata might be confused with M. corneipes . Phaeocollybia attenuata can readily be differentiated in the field by the long <unk> pseudorhiza extending below the substrate , and microscopically by the much more heavily ornamented <unk> @-@ globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia . Other morphologically similar species include Hypholoma <unk> and H. <unk> , but unlike M. corneipes , both of these agarics have smooth spores , yellow <unk> , and lack metuloids . The lookalike Galerina <unk> is found in Washington , Michigan , and Sweden , where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs . It has distinct microscopic characteristics , such as a wider range of basidial widths ( 20 – 40 µm ) , and a lack of pleurocystidia . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Mythicomyces corneipes is a saprobic fungus , and uses plant debris — usually bits of wood — as a substrate . Fruit bodies appear in autumn , and grow in groups among mosses in moist habitats , such as near the edges of bogs , or under conifers or birch in soil wet from spring flooding . It has been recorded from North America , where it is most common in the Pacific Northwest region , and Europe , where it is rare , but widespread across the northern part of the continent . In 1938 , Smith called the species " extremely rare " . 
 = Post @-@ punk revival = 
 Post @-@ punk revival ( also described as new wave revival , garage rock revival , or new rock revolution ) is a genre of alternative rock and indie rock that developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , inspired by the original sounds and aesthetics of garage rock of the 1960s and new wave and post @-@ punk of the 1980s . Bands that broke through to the mainstream from local scenes across the world in the early 2000s included the Strokes , Interpol , the White Stripes , the Hives and the Vines , who were followed to commercial success by many established and new acts . By the end of the decade , most of the bands had broken up , moved on to other projects or were on hiatus , although some bands returned to recording and touring in the 2010s . 
 = = Definitions and characteristics = = 
 In the early 2000s , a new group of bands that played a stripped down and back @-@ to @-@ basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream . They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock , new wave or post @-@ punk revival . Influences ranged from traditional blues , through new wave to grunge . The music ranged from the atonal tracks of bands like Liars to the melodic pop songs of groups like the Sounds , popularising distorted guitar sounds . They shared an emphasis on energetic live performance and used aesthetics ( in hair and clothes ) closely aligned with their fans , often drawing on fashion of the 1950s and 1960s , with " skinny ties , white belts [ and ] shag haircuts " . There was an emphasis on " rock authenticity " that has been seen as a reaction to the commercialism of MTV @-@ oriented nu metal , hip hop and " bland " post @-@ Britpop groups . Because the bands came from across the globe , cited diverse influences and adopted differing styles of dress , their unity as a genre has been disputed . For historian of garage rock Eric James Abbey , these were diverse bands that appropriated , or been given , the label " garage " to gain a degree of credibility . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Genres , scenes and origins = = = 
 There were attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s , and by 2000 , scenes had grown up as part of the alternative and indie music scenes in several countries . The Detroit rock scene included the Von Bondies , Electric Six , the Dirtbombs and the Detroit Cobras , while New York 's included Radio 4 , Liars , Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the Rapture . Billy Childish and The Buff Medways from the United Kingdom , the ( International ) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden , and the 5 @.@ 6 @.@ 7 @.@ 8 's from Japan , enjoyed underground , regional or national success . 
 New wave was a term adopted in the aftermath of punk rock to describe a generation of bands who generally pursued a more commercially successful punk @-@ influenced sound . Major acts included Talking Heads , Devo , the Cars , the Go @-@ Go 's , the Pretenders , Elvis Costello and " skinny tie " bands like Blondie and the Knack . The term post @-@ punk was originally coined to describe groups of this era who took punk and experimented with more challenging musical structures , lyrical themes , and a self @-@ consciously art @-@ based image , while retaining punk 's initial iconoclastic stance . AllMusic argued that rather than a revival , the history of post @-@ punk was more of a continuum from the mid @-@ 1980s , with scattered bands that included Big Flame , World Domination Enterprises , and Minimal Compact extending the genre . In the mid @-@ 1990s , notable bands in this vein included Six Finger Satellite , Brainiac and Elastica . American band <unk> was also considered as an early example of the new wave revival sound . 
 At the turn of the century , the term post @-@ punk began to appear in the music press again , with a number of critics reviving the label to describe a new set of bands that shared some of the aesthetics of the original post @-@ punk era . Music critic Simon Reynolds noted that bands like the Rapture and Franz Ferdinand were influenced by the more angular strain of post @-@ punk , particularly bands such as Wire and Gang of Four . Others identified this movement as another wave of garage rock revivalism , with NME in 2003 designating it a " new garage rock revolution " , or simply a " new rock revolution " . According to music critic Jim DeRogatis , the Strokes , the White Stripes and the Hives all had a sound " to some extent rooted in Nuggets @-@ era garage rock " . 
 = = = Commercial breakthrough = = = 
 The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands : the Strokes , who emerged from the New York club scene with their debut album Is This It ( 2001 ) ; the White Stripes , from Detroit , with their third album White Blood Cells ( 2001 ) ; the Hives , from Sweden , with their compilation album Your New Favourite Band ( 2001 ) ; and the Vines , from Australia , with Highly Evolved ( 2002 ) . Both the Strokes and the White Stripes obtained their initial commercial success in the UK , before achieving recognition in the US and elsewhere . They were christened by the media as the " The " bands , and dubbed " the saviours of rock ' n ' roll " , prompting Rolling Stone magazine to declare on its September 2002 cover , " Rock is Back ! " The attention in the press in turn led to accusations of hype , and some dismissed the scene as unoriginal , image @-@ conscious and tuneless . According to Simon Reynolds , " apart from maybe the White Stripes , none could really be described as retro " . 
 In the wake of this attention existing acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels . A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition as a result of the movement included Interpol , Black Rebel Motorcycle Club , the Killers , Kings of Leon , the <unk> , Mooney Suzuki and the Go from the US . From the UK were Franz Ferdinand , Bloc Party , <unk> Park , Editors , the Libertines , the Fratellis , Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs . Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking , with two number one singles and Whatever People Say I Am , That 's What I 'm Not ( 2006 ) , which became the fastest @-@ selling debut album in British chart history .

 As a dominant commercial force , the revival was relatively short @-@ lived . By 2007 , the initial success of the movement was beginning to subside , leading commentators to discuss its decline as a phenomenon and argue that it had been overtaken by the more musically and emotionally complex music of indie rock bands like Arcade Fire ( which , nevertheless , has been characterized by critics as featuring post @-@ punk influences and sound ) and Death Cab for Cutie . By the end of the decade , many of the bands of the movement had broken up , were on hiatus or had moved into other musical areas , and very few were making significant impact on the charts . Bands that returned to recording and touring in the 2010s included Arctic Monkeys , the Strokes and Interpol .

 " Cog " is a British television and cinema advertisement launched by Honda in 2003 to promote the seventh @-@ generation Accord line of cars . It follows the convention of a Rube Goldberg machine , utilizing a chain of colliding parts taken from a disassembled Accord . Wieden + Kennedy developed a GB £ 6 million marketing campaign around " Cog " and its partner pieces , " Sense " and " Everyday " , broadcast later in the year . The piece itself was produced on a budget of £ 1 million by Partizan Midi @-@ Minuit . Antoine Bardou @-@ Jacquet directed the seven @-@ month production , contracting The Mill to handle post @-@ production . The 120 @-@ second final cut of " Cog " was broadcast on British television on 6 April 2003 , during a commercial break in ITV 's coverage of the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix . 
 The campaign was very successful both critically and financially . Honda 's UK domain saw more web traffic in the 24 hours after " Cog " ' s television début than all but one UK automotive brand received during that entire month . The branded content attached to " Cog " through interactive television was accessed by over 250 @,@ 000 people , and 10 @,@ 000 people followed up with a request for a brochure for the Honda Accord or a DVD copy of the advertisement . The media reaction to the advertisement was equally effusive ; The Independent 's Peter York described it as creating " the water @-@ cooler ad conversation of the year " , while Quentin Letts of The Daily Telegraph believed it was " certain to become an advertising legend " . 
 The high cost of 120 @-@ second slots in televised commercial breaks meant that the full version of " Cog " was broadcast only a handful of times , and only in the United Kingdom , Australia , and Sweden . Despite its limited run , it is regarded as one of the most groundbreaking and influential commercials of the 2000s , and received more awards from the television and advertising industries than any commercial in history . Its success was blighted , however , by persistent accusations of plagiarism by Peter Fischli and David Weiss , the creators of The Way Things Go ( 1987 ) . 
 = = Sequence = = 
 " Cog " opens with a close @-@ up on a transmission bearing rolling down a board into a <unk> hub . The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog , which falls off of the board and into a camshaft and pulley wheel . The camera tracks slowly from left to right , following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space . The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses , growing from simple collisions to ziplines made from a bonnet release cable , scales and see @-@ saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts , and a swinging mobile of suspended glass windows . Later sequences begin to make use of the Accord 's electronic systems ; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor , and a side door with a door @-@ mirror indicator lowers the automated window to let a part pass through . 
 The majority of " Cog " takes place in complete silence , the only sounds coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves . This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord , which begins playing The Sugarhill Gang 's 1979 single " Rapper 's Delight " . The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed , closing the hatchback of a fully assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer . The car rolls off of the trailer , and stops in front of a <unk> cover bearing the " Accord " marque , while narrator Garrison Keillor asks " Isn 't it nice when things just work ? " . The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand 's motto , " The Power of Dreams " .

 Sales of Honda products within Europe had been in decline since 1998 , and the company 's position as the number two Japanese automotive company , behind Toyota , had been taken by Nissan . European consumers perceived the brand as staid , uninspiring , and the cars to be of lesser quality than those produced by European manufacturers . In one survey , one quarter of respondents " wouldn 't dream of buying a Honda as their next car " . It was in this climate in 2001 that Wieden + Kennedy proposed to Honda a new advertising strategy based on the company 's Japanese motto , " Yume No Chikara " ( " Power of Dreams " ) . The stated goal of the campaign was to increase Honda 's share of the UK market to five percent within three years and to change the public image of the brand from " dull but functional " to " warm and consumer @-@ friendly " , all on a lower marketing budget than their predecessors had demanded . 
 The first series of promotions in the United Kingdom adopted the strapline " What if ... ? " , and explored various " dream @-@ like " scenarios . The first television campaign explicitly introduced the premise of the campaign by asking what would happen if the world 's favourite word ( Okay ) was replaced with " What if ? " . The next few pieces of the campaign , " <unk> Order " , " Seats " , and " Bus Lane " for television and " Doodle " , " Big Grin " , and " <unk> " for radio , became progressively more surreal , and featured oddities ranging from a traffic cone draped in leopard fur to trees growing traffic lights from their branches . In 2002 , Matt Gooden , a creative director , and Ben Walker , a copywriter , proposed a new television and cinema advertisement to promote the seventh @-@ generation Honda Accord line that had recently been rolled out in Europe and Japan . The advertisement , based on a complex chain reaction of moving parts from the Accord itself , was approved and given the working title " Cog " . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 Gooden and Walker had been working together since 1988 . By 2002 , their portfolio included a Guinness World Record @-@ holding one @-@ second advertisement produced for Leo Burnett Worldwide , and a depression @-@ awareness booklet for the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust . The pair approached Honda with a rough , low @-@ budget 30 @-@ second trial film inspired by the children 's board game Mouse Trap , Caractacus Potts ' breakfast @-@ making machine in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , and a 1987 Swiss art film by Peter Fischli and David Weiss , Der Lauf der Dinge ( The Way Things Go ) . 
 The Honda executives were intrigued , but demanded a cut using actual automotive parts before giving permission to go ahead with the full @-@ scale project . " Cog " was approved with a budget of £ 1 million , and Gooden & Walker recruited a London @-@ based team to go through the logistics of the shoot in detail . The team , which comprised engineers , special effects technicians , car designers , and even a sculptor , spent a month working with parts from a disassembled Honda Accord before the design for the advertisement 's set was even finalised . Approval for the script took another month . Honda insisted that several specific Accord features , such as a door with a wing @-@ mirror indicator and a rain @-@ sensitive windscreen , appear in the final cut . The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures . Antoine Bardou @-@ Jacquet was hired to direct the piece . Bardou @-@ Jacquet was mostly known for directing several award @-@ winning music videos , including Alex Gopher 's " The Child " , <unk> 's " Number One " , and Air 's " How Does It Make You Feel " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Bardou @-@ Jacquet wanted to compose the advertisement with as little computer @-@ generated imagery as possible , believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience . To this end , he set two months aside for the creation of hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts , and a further four months for practical testing and development . For the testing phase , the script was broken into small segments , each comprising only one or two interactions . Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew , such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car , were abandoned , and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed . 
 The final cut of " Cog " consists of two continuous sixty @-@ second dolly shots taken from a <unk> , stitched together later in post @-@ production . ( The stitching appears during the moment when the muffler rolls across the floor . ) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots , two days for each minute @-@ long section . Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting , as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch . Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period , small variations in ambient temperature , humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early . It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second . Between testing and filming , 606 takes were needed to capture the final cut . The team commandeered two of Honda 's six hand @-@ assembled Accords — one to roll off the trailer at the end of the advertisement , the other to be stripped for parts . While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components , by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries . 
 = = = Post @-@ production = = = 
 " Cog " needed only limited post @-@ production work , as the decision had been made early on to eschew computer @-@ generated imagery wherever possible . To further reduce the work required , " Barnsley " , a specialist in the Flame editing tool ( real name , Andrew Wood ) , from The Mill , spent a lot of time on set during filming , where he advised the film crew on whether particular sections could be accomplished more easily by re @-@ filming or by manipulating the image afterwards . Even so , the constant movement of the components on @-@ camera made it difficult to achieve a seamless transition between the two 60 @-@ second shots . Several sections also required minor video editing , such as re @-@ centering the frame to stay closer to the action , removal of wires , highlighting a spray of water , and adjusting the pace for dramatic purposes .

 " Cog " was first aired on British television on Sunday 6 April 2003 . It filled an entire commercial break in ITV 's coverage of the Brazilian Grand Prix . The release was widely remarked upon by the media , with articles appearing in both broadsheets such as The Daily Telegraph , The Independent , and The Guardian , and tabloid papers such as The Sun and The Daily Mirror . The day after " Cog " ' s debut , the Honda website received more hits than at any time in its history , and overnight became the second most @-@ popular automotive website in the UK . 
 The full 120 @-@ second version of the advertisement aired only 10 times in all , and only in the 10 days after the initial screening . The slots were chosen for maximum impact , mostly in high @-@ profile sporting events such as the UEFA Champion 's League football match between Manchester United and Real Madrid . The full version was then put aside in favour of a 60 @-@ second and five 30 @-@ second variations , which continued to air for a further six weeks . These shortened versions made use of newly introduced interactive options on the Sky Digital television network . Viewers were encouraged to press a button on their remote control , bringing up a menu that allowed the viewer to see the full 120 @-@ second version of the advertisement . Other menu options included placing an order for a free documentary DVD and a brochure for the Honda Accord . The DVD , which was also included as an insert in 1 @.@ 2 million newspapers in the first week of the commercial 's rollout , contained a " making @-@ of " documentary featuring interviews and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage of the production process , a virtual tour of the Accord , the original music video to " Rapper 's Delight " by the Sugarhill Gang , and an illustrated guide to all the parts shown in " Cog " . The interactive 30 @-@ second versions of " Cog " proved hugely successful . Over 250 @,@ 000 people used the menu option , spending an average of two and a half minutes in the dedicated advertising area . A significant number watched the looped 120 @-@ second version for up to ten minutes . Of those who opened the menu , 10 @,@ 000 requested either a DVD or a brochure , and Honda used the data collected from the interactive option to arrange a number of test drives . 
 Expansion of the " Cog " campaign to a worldwide market was fraught with a number of logistical difficulties . The cost of airing a 120 @-@ second commercial proved prohibitive in most markets . Combined with Honda 's use of different advertising agencies in different regions and the relative autonomy of its various business units in marketing decisions , meant that " Cog " screened in only a few selected markets : the United Kingdom , Sweden , and Australia , and in cinemas in only a handful of other countries . For most markets , including the United States , the only way for audiences to see the piece was via the Internet , or in one of a handful of unsolicited and unpaid broadcasts on news channel review programmes . Traffic to Honda websites quadrupled ; in the first few weeks , " Cog " was downloaded by over a million people . By mid @-@ May , the number was twice that . It has been estimated that more people in the United States voluntarily chose to watch " Cog " than any other Honda commercial . 
 In financial terms , " Cog " was an unprecedented success for Honda . The £ 32 @,@ 000 spent on placements on the BSkyB network alone achieved a greater response than a previous £ 1 million direct mailing campaign . Sales of Honda vehicles in the United Kingdom jumped by 28 percent , despite lower marketing and public relations spending by the company and an increase in prices relative to their competitors . Visits to Honda dealerships rose from an average of 3 @,@ 500 to 3 @,@ 700 per month , with 22 percent of these resulting in the purchase of a Honda , compared to 19 percent before the campaign . In all , " Cog " has been credited with increasing Honda 's revenue by nearly £ 400m . 
 = = = Plagiarism accusations = = = 
 Shortly after Cog appeared on television , Wieden + Kennedy received a letter from Peter Fischli and David Weiss , creators of the 1987 art film Der Lauf der Dinge . The film was well known in the advertising industry , and its creators had been approached several times with offers for the right to use the concept , but had always declined . The letter pointed out several similarities between their work and " Cog " , and warned the agency that they were considering legal action on the basis of the " commercialisation and simplification of the film 's content and the false impression that [ they ] might have endorsed the use " . When interviewed by Creative Review magazine , the pair made clear that they wished they had been consulted on the advertisement , and that they would not have given permission if asked . Media publications quickly picked up the story , and asserted that Fischli and Weiss were already in the process of litigation against the car manufacturer . 
 Comparisons were made between the case and that of Mehdi <unk> , a British director who complained about Diageo 's , the drinks conglomerate , for allegedly plagiarising his work in their 1994 Anticipation campaign for Guinness @-@ brand stout . The matter was complicated by the fact that Wieden + Kennedy acknowledged that the film had served as an " inspiration " for " Cog " , and had distributed copies of the work to its script @-@ writers . Ultimately , Fischli and Weiss did not file a lawsuit against either Wieden + Kennedy or Honda UK . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 Despite the lingering shadow of these accusations , " Cog " drew an unprecedented amount of critical acclaim . It received more awards than any commercial in history ; so many that it was both the most @-@ awarded commercial of 2004 and the 33rd @-@ most @-@ awarded commercial of 2003 . The jury for the British Television Advertising Awards gave the piece the highest score of any commercial ever recorded ; the jury 's chairman Charles Inge commented : " My own opinion is that this is the best commercial that I have seen for at least ten years . " After awarding " Cog " with several Silver awards , the president @-@ elect of the D & AD Awards , Dick Powell , said of the piece : " It delights and entrances , [ ... ] it communicates engineering quality and quality of thinking , and leaves you with a smile . " 
 Having swept the majority of award ceremonies within the advertising community to date , " Cog " was widely believed to be the favourite for the industry 's top award , the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival . Its chief competition was thought to be " Sheet Metal " for Saturn automobiles . " Cog " held a disadvantage in that the chairman of the Cannes voting jury , Dan Wieden , was one of the founders of Wieden + Kennedy , the firm responsible for creating " Cog " ; tradition holds that it is bad form for the chairman of the jury to vote for a piece by his or her own agency . 
 The result at Cannes was a surprise ; after the longest judging period in the festival 's history , the Grand Prix went to neither of the two event favourites . Instead , the jury awarded the prize to " Lamp " , a U.S. advertisement directed by Spike Jonze for the IKEA chain of furniture stores . Voted second was a British ad , " Ear Tennis " for the Xbox video game console . Chief among speculated reasons for the outcome was the plagiarism debate surrounding " Cog " . Ben Walker told Adweek " A couple of people on the jury told me the reason it didn 't win is ' cause they didn 't want to be seen to be awarding something which people in some corners had said we copied . "

 The popularity and recognition received by " Cog " led a number of other companies to create pieces in a similar vein — either as homages , in parody , or simply to further explore the design space . The first of these was Just Works , a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 directory assistance service in the summer of 2003 , in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel , a flamingo and a space hopper , with impetus provided by two <unk> runners . Just Works was created by advertising agency <unk> . It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith , whose previous work included spots for BT <unk> , Heinz , and Guinness , and the Oscar @-@ nominated short film Holiday Romance . Honda refused to give <unk> permission to copy their advert , which , under <unk> guidelines , prevented either the 60- or 90 @-@ second Just Works spots from appearing on British television . Instead , the ad was shown online and promoted virally . Just Works went on to win a number of awards in its own right , including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards , a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival , and a Bronze award from The One Club . 
 In 2004 , BBC Radio Manchester asked for and received permission from Wieden + Kennedy to produce a television advertisement in the style of " Cog " to advertise coverage of football events by local radio stations . The ad , which was directed by Reg Sanders and produced by Tracy Williams , shows pieces of sports equipment such as footballs and team shirts knocking into each other in sequence . In all , 65 versions were broadcast , each tailored to advertise the local BBC Radio station . Wieden + Kennedy were pleased to gain the extra publicity and Neil Christie , managing director of Wieden + Kennedy London , commented : " We are very happy that every time the BBC runs one of their adverts , the person who watches it thinks of Honda . " 
 Campaign magazine listed " Cog " , along with Balls for the Sony BRAVIA line of high @-@ definition televisions , as one of the most @-@ imitated commercials in recent times . Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from " Cog " are a 2003 piece for breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs , <unk> for the Oslo School of Architecture and Design , a 30 @-@ second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup , an advertisement for BBC Radio Merseyside football coverage , and the 2007 Tipping Point , advertising Guinness stout . When asked about the similarities between " Cog " and " Tipping Point " , Paul Brazier , executive creative director at the advertising agency behind Tipping Point , replied : " I knew the ad was similar in places , but as an executive creative director , you have to look at things like that and make a decision . The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn ’ t that near " Cog " . "

 " Cog " has also inspired a number of other creative endeavours outside of the advertising industry , including an elaborate domino @-@ toppling world record attempt by Robin <unk> , and a three @-@ minute introductory trailer to the BBC show Bang Goes the Theory . In 2004 , the United States Coast Guard Training Centre in California requested permission to use the ad in their training regime as a demonstration of the importance of attention to detail . Discussion of " Cog " as an example of the confluence of art and advertising , and as an example of inspiration versus plagiarism , has been ongoing . Mark <unk> included " Cog " as part of his video art installation " Cinema in the Round " , in the Tate Britain gallery , London , in 2008 . It was also the focus of a panel discussion at the Tate Modern during a retrospective of Fischli & Weiss ' work there in 2006 . 
 The next piece created by Wieden + Kennedy for Honda , Sense , advertised the company 's " Integrated Motor System " hybrid car technology . Deliberate steps were taken to distance the spot from " Cog " , using metaphor to make the promotion , rather than focusing on the technology itself . In 2005 , Honda was once again in contention for the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Film Festival , with the animated 60 @-@ second spot <unk> . This time , it returned home triumphant , defeating Singing in the rain for the Volkswagen Golf and Stella Artois ' Pilot to bring home the top prize . Antoine Bardou @-@ Jacquet went on to direct two further Honda advertisements for Wieden + Kennedy . Choir , created with the help of fellow " Cog " team @-@ members Ben Walker and Matt Gooden , was released in 2006 , and Problem Playground in 2008 . 
 = Evolution of cetaceans = 
 The evolutionary history of cetaceans is thought to have occurred in the Indian subcontinent from even @-@ toed ungulates 50 million years ago , over a period of at least 15 million years . Cetaceans are fully aquatic marine mammals belonging to the order Artiodactyla , and branched off from other artiodactyls around 50 mya ( million years ago ) . Cetaceans are thought to have evolved during the Eocene or earlier , sharing a closest common ancestor with hippopotamuses . Being mammals , they surface to breathe air ; they have finger bones in their fins ; they nurse their young ; and , despite their fully aquatic life style , they retained many skeletal features from their terrestrial , mammalian ancestors . These mammalian characteristics all point to their terrestrial origin , also the first mammals were terrestrial , so cetaceans , being mammals , must have come from the land . Discoveries starting in the late 1970s in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea . 
 The two modern parvorders of cetaceans – Mysticeti ( baleen whales ) and Odontoceti ( toothed whales ) – are thought to have separated from each other , and the archaeocetes , around 34 million years ago in a second cetacean radiation , the first occurring with the archaeocetes . The adaptation of echolocation in toothed whales distinguishes them from fully aquatic archaeocetes and early baleen whales . The presence of baleen in baleen whales occurred gradually , with earlier varieties having very little baleen , and their size is linked to baleen dependence ( and subsequent increase in filter feeding ) . 
 Modern @-@ day cetacean evolution is largely affected by local culture and social network . Tool @-@ use for foraging in certain societies affects the diet , and allows them to access more varieties of food . This behavior is passed down from mother @-@ to @-@ child , as in the bottlenose dolphins residing in Shark Bay , where many use sponges to protect their beak while foraging . Social bonds between dolphins in a pod can affect overall fitness in a habitat , decreasing or increasing the survival chances for any particular individual in that pod . Social bonds between different species can sometimes cause interbreeding , which always results in infertile hybrids when it occurs . 
 = = Early evolution = = 
 The aquatic lifestyle of cetaceans first began in the Indian subcontinent from even @-@ toed ungulates 50 million years ago , over a period of at least 15 million years , however a jawbone discovered in Antarctica may reduce this to 5 million years . Archaeoceti is an extinct parvorder of Cetacea containing ancient whales . The traditional theory of cetacean evolution , first proposed by Van Valen in 1966 , was that whales were related to the mesonychids , an extinct order of carnivorous ungulates ( hoofed animals ) that resembled wolves with hooves and were a sister group of the artiodactyls ( even @-@ toed ungulates ) . This theory arose due to similarities between the unusual triangular teeth of the mesonychids and those of early whales . However , molecular phylogeny data indicates that whales are very closely related to the artiodactyls , with hippopotamuses as their closest living relative . Because of this , cetaceans and hippopotamuses are placed in the same suborder , Whippomorpha . Cetartiodactyla ( formed from the words Cetacea and Artiodactyla ) is a proposed name for an order containing both cetaceans and artiodactyls . However , the earliest anthracotheres , the ancestors of hippos , do not appear in the fossil record until the Middle Eocene , millions of years after Pakicetus , the first known whale ancestor , appeared during the Early Eocene , implying the two groups diverged well before the Eocene . Since molecular analysis identifies artiodactyls as being very closely related to cetaceans , mesonychids are probably an offshoot from Artiodactyla , and cetaceans did not derive directly from them . 
 The molecular data is supported by the discovery of Pakicetus , the earliest <unk> . The skeletons of Pakicetus show that whales did not derive directly from mesonychids . Instead , they are artiodactyls that began to take to the water soon after artiodactyls split from mesonychids . <unk> retained aspects of their <unk> ancestry ( such as the triangular teeth ) which modern artiodactyls , and modern whales , have lost . The earliest ancestors of all hoofed mammals were probably at least partly carnivorous or scavengers , and today 's artiodactyls and perissodactyls became herbivores later in their evolution . Whales , however , retained their carnivorous diet because prey was more available and they needed higher caloric content in order to live as marine endotherms ( warm @-@ blooded ) . <unk> also became specialized carnivores , but this was likely a disadvantage because large prey was uncommon . This may be why they were out @-@ competed by better @-@ adapted animals like the <unk> and later Carnivora . 
 = = = Indohyus = = = 
 Indohyus was a small chevrotain @-@ like animal that lived about 48 million years ago in what is now the Kashmir . It belongs to the artiodactyl family <unk> , and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea . Indohyus is identified as an artiodactyl because it has two trochlea hinges , a trait unique to artiodactyls . About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat , this herbivorous creature shared some traits of modern whales , most notably the involucrum , a bone growth pattern which is the diagnostic characteristic of any cetacean ; this is not found in any other species . It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life , including dense limb bones that reduce buoyancy so that they could stay underwater , which are similar to the adaptations found in modern aquatic mammals such as the hippopotamus . This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African <unk> or water chevrotain which , when threatened by a bird of prey , dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The pakicetids were digitigrade hoofed mammals that are thought to be the earliest known cetaceans , with Indohyus being the closest sister group . They lived in the early Eocene , around 50 million years ago . Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979 , located at a river not far from the shores of the former Tethys Sea . After the initial discovery , more fossils were found , mainly in the early Eocene fluvial deposits in northern Pakistan and northwestern India . Based on this discovery , pakicetids most likely lived in an arid environment with ephemeral streams and moderately developed floodplains millions of years ago . By using stable oxygen isotopes analysis , they were shown to drink fresh water , implying that they lived around freshwater bodies . Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking or some freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river . The elongated cervical vertebrae and the four , fused sacral vertebrae are consistent with artiodactyls , making Pakicetus one of the earliest fossils to be recovered from the period following the Cetacea / Artiodactyla divergence event . 
 Pakicetids are classified as cetaceans mainly due to the structure of the auditory bulla ( ear bone ) , which is formed only from the ectotympanic bone . The shape of the ear region in pakicetids is highly unusual and the skull is cetacean @-@ like , although a blowhole is still absent at this stage . The jawbone of pakicetids also lacks the enlarged space ( mandibular foramen ) that is filled with fat or oil , which is used in receiving underwater sound in modern cetaceans . They have dorsal orbits ( eye sockets facing up ) , which are similar to crocodiles . This eye placement helps submerged predators observe potential prey above the water . According to a 2009 study , the teeth of pakicetids also resemble the teeth of fossil whales , being less like a dog 's incisors , and having serrated triangular teeth , which is another link to more modern cetaceans . It was initially thought that the ears of pakicetids were adapted for underwater hearing , but , as would be expected from the anatomy of the rest of this creature , the ears of pakicetids are specialized for hearing on land . However , pakicetids were able to listen underwater by using enhanced bone conduction , rather than depending on the tympanic membrane like other land mammals . This method of hearing did not give directional hearing underwater . 
 Pakicetids have long thin legs , with relatively short hands and feet which suggest that they were poor swimmers . To compensate for that , their bones are unusually thick ( <unk> ) , which is probably an adaptation to make the animal heavier to counteract the buoyancy of the water . According to a 2001 morphological analysis by Thewissen et al . , pakicetids display no aquatic skeletal adaptation ; instead they display adaptations for running and jumping . Hence pakicetids were most likely aquatic waders . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Ambulocetus , which lived about 49 million years ago , was discovered in Pakistan in 1994 . It was probably amphibious , and resembled crocodiles in its physical appearance . In the Eocene , ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Sea in northern Pakistan . The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near @-@ shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral mollusks . Although they are found only in marine deposits , their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed a range of water with different degree of salinity , with some specimens having no evidence of sea water consumption and others that did not ingest fresh water at the time when their teeth were fossilized . It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations . Hence , ambulocetids represent a transition phase of cetacean ancestors between fresh water and marine habitat . 
 The mandibular foramen in ambulocetids had increased in size , which indicates that a fat pad was likely to be housed in the lower jaw . In modern toothed whales , this fat pad in the mandibular foramen extends posteriorly to the middle ear . This allows sounds to be received in the lower jaw , and then transmitted through the fat pad to the middle ear . Similar to pakicetids , the orbits of ambulocetids are on the top of the skull , but they face more laterally than in pakicetids . 
 Ambulocetids had relatively long limbs with particularly strong hind legs , and they retained a tail with no sign of a fluke . The hindlimb structure of Ambulocetids shows that their ability to engage in terrestrial locomotion was significantly limited compared to that of contemporary terrestrial mammals . The skeletal structures of the knee and ankle indicates that the motion of the hindlimbs was restricted into one plane . This suggests that , on land , propulsion of the hindlimbs was powered by the extension of dorsal muscles . Although they could walk on land , in addition to swimming , it is clear that they were not fast in either environment . It has been speculated that Ambulocetids hunted like crocodiles , lurking in the shallows to snatch unsuspecting riparian prey and fish . They probably swam by pelvic paddling ( a way of swimming which mainly utilizes their hind limbs to generate propulsion in water ) and caudal undulation ( a way of swimming which uses the undulations of the vertebral column to generate force for movements ) , as otters , seals and modern cetaceans do . This is an intermediate stage in the evolution of cetacean locomotion , as modern cetaceans swim by caudal oscillation ( a way of swimming similar to caudal undulation , but is more energy efficient ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> lived in the Middle @-@ Eocene in South Asia , about 49 to 43 million years ago . Compared to family <unk> and <unk> , <unk> was a diverse family found in north and central Pakistan and western India . <unk> were also found in shallow marine deposits , but they were obviously more aquatic than <unk> . This is demonstrated by the recovery of their fossils from a variety of coastal marine environments , including near @-@ shore and lagoonal deposits . According to stable oxygen isotopes analysis , most remingtonocetids did not ingest fresh water , and had hence lost their dependency on fresh water relatively soon after their origin . 
 The orbits of remingtonocetids faced laterally and were small . This suggests that vision was not an important sense for them . The nasal opening , which eventually becomes the blowhole in modern cetaceans , was located near the tip of the snout . The position of the nasal opening had remained unchanged since pakicetids . One of the notable features in remingtonocetids is that the semicircular canals , which are important for balancing in land mammals , had decreased in size . This reduction in size had closely accompanied the cetacean radiation into marine environments . According to a 2002 study done by <unk> et al . , this modification of the semicircular canal system may represent a crucial ‘ point of no return ’ event in early cetacean evolution , which excluded a prolonged semi @-@ aquatic phase . 
 Compared to ambulocetids , remingtonocetids had relatively short limbs . Based on their skeletal remains , remingtonocetids were probably amphibious cetaceans that were well adapted to swimming , and likely to swim by caudal undulation only . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The protocetids form a diverse and heterogeneous group known from Asia , Europe , Africa , and North America . They lived in the Eocene , approximately 48 to 35 million years ago . The fossil remains of protocetids were uncovered from coastal and lagoonal facies in South Asia ; unlike previous cetacean families , their fossils uncovered from Africa and North America also include open marine forms . They were probably amphibious , but more aquatic compared to remingtonocetids . <unk> were the first cetaceans to leave the Indian subcontinent and disperse to all shallow subtropical oceans of the world . There were many genera among the family <unk> . Great variations in aquatic adaptations exist among them , with some probably able to support their weight on land , whereas others could not . Their supposed amphibious nature is supported by the discovery of a pregnant <unk> , in which the fossilised fetus was positioned for a head @-@ first delivery , suggesting that <unk> gave birth on land . If they gave birth in the water , the fetus would be positioned for a tail @-@ first delivery to avoid drowning during birth . 
 Unlike remingtonocetids and ambulocetids , protocetids have large orbits which are oriented laterally . Increasingly lateral @-@ facing eyes might be used to observe underwater prey , and are similar to the eyes of modern cetaceans . Furthermore , the nasal openings were large and were halfway up the snout . The great variety of teeth suggests diverse feeding modes in protocetids . In both remingtonocetids and protocetids , the size of the mandibular foramen had increased . The large mandibular foramen indicates that the mandibular fat pad was present . However the air @-@ filled sinuses that are present in modern cetaceans , which function to isolate the ear acoustically to enable better underwater hearing , were still not present . The external auditory meatus ( ear canal ) , which is absent in modern cetaceans , was also present . Hence , the method of sound transmission that were present in them combines aspects of pakicetids and modern odontocetes ( toothed whales ) . At this intermediate stage of hearing development , the transmission of airborne sound was poor due to the modifications of the ear for underwater hearing while directional underwater hearing was also poor compared to modern cetaceans . 
 Some protocetids had short , wide fore- and hindlimbs that were likely to have been used in swimming , but the limbs gave a slow and cumbersome locomotion on land . It is possible that some protocetids had flukes . However , it is clear that they were adapted even further to an aquatic life @-@ style . In Rodhocetus , for example , the sacrum ( a bone that , in land @-@ mammals , is a fusion of five vertebrae that connects the pelvis with the rest of the vertebral column ) was divided into loose vertebrae . However , the pelvis was still connected to one of the sacral vertebrae . The ungulate ancestry of these archaeocetes is still underlined by characteristics like the presence of hooves at the ends of the toes in Rodhocetus . 
 The foot structure of Rodhocetus shows that protocetids were predominantly aquatic . A 2001 study done by Gingerich et al. hypothesized that Rodhocetus <unk> in the oceanic environment similarly to how ambulocetids pelvic paddling , which was supplemented by caudal undulation . Terrestrial locomotion of Rodhocetus was very limited due to their hindlimb structure . It is thought that they moved in a way similar to how eared seals move on land , by rotating their hind flippers forward and underneath their body . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> and dorudontines lived together in the late Eocene around 41 to 35 million years ago , and are the oldest known obligate aquatic cetaceans . They were fully recognizable whales which lived entirely in the ocean . This is supported by their fossils usually found in deposits indicative of fully marine environments , lacking any freshwater influx . They were probably distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical seas of the world . <unk> are commonly found in association with dorudontines , and were closely related to one another . The fossilised stomach contents in one <unk> indicates that it ate fish . 
 Although they look very much like modern cetaceans , basilosaurids lacked the ' melon organ ' that allows toothed whales to use echolocation . They had small brains ; this suggests they were solitary and did not have the complex social structures of some modern cetaceans . The mandibular foramen of basilosaurids covered the entire depth of the lower jaw as in modern cetaceans . Their orbits faced laterally , and the nasal opening had moved even higher up the snout , closer to the position of the blowhole in modern cetaceans . Furthermore , their ear structures were functionally modern , with the insertion of air @-@ filled sinuses between ear and skull . Unlike modern cetaceans , basilosaurids retained a large external auditory meatus . 
 Both basilosaurids have skeletons that are immediately recognizable as cetaceans . A <unk> was as big as the larger modern whales , with genera like Basilosaurus reaching lengths of up to 60 ft ( 18 m ) long ; dorudontines were smaller , with genera like <unk> reaching about 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) long . The large size of basilosaurids is due to the extreme elongation of their lumbar vertebrae . They had a tail fluke , but their body proportions suggest that they swam by caudal undulation and that the fluke was not used for propulsion . In contrast , dorudontines had a shorter but powerful vertebral column . They too had a fluke and , unlike basilosaurids , they probably swam similarly to modern cetaceans , by using caudal oscillations . The forelimbs of basilosaurids were probably flipper @-@ shaped , and the external hind limbs were tiny and were certainly not involved in locomotion . Their fingers , however , retained the mobile joints of their <unk> relatives . The two tiny but well @-@ formed hind legs of basilosaurids were probably used as claspers when mating . The pelvic bones associated with these hind limbs were not connected to the vertebral column as they were in protocetids . Essentially , any sacral vertebrae can no longer be clearly distinguished from the other vertebrae . 
 Both basilosaurids and dorudontines are relatively closely related to modern cetaceans , which belong to parvorders Odontoceti and Mysticeti . However , according to a 1994 study done by Fordyce and Barnes , the large size and elongated vertebral body of basilosaurids preclude them from being ancestral to extant forms . As for dorudontines , there are some species within the family that do not have elongated vertebral bodies , which might be the immediate ancestors of Odontoceti and Mysticeti . The other basilosaurids became extinct .

 = = = Baleen whales = = = 
 All modern baleen whales or mysticetes are filter @-@ feeders which have baleen in place of teeth , though the exact means by which baleen is used differs among species ( gulp @-@ feeding within <unk> , skim @-@ feeding within <unk> , and bottom plowing within <unk> ) . the first members of both groups appeared during the middle Miocene . Filter feeding is very beneficial as it allows baleen whales to efficiently gain huge energy resources , which makes the large body size in modern variety possible . The development of filter feeding may have been a result of worldwide environmental change and physical changes in the oceans . A large @-@ scale change in ocean current and temperature could have initiated the radiation of modern mysticetes , leading to the demise of the toothed forms . The earlier variety of baleen whales , or " <unk> " , such as Janjucetus and Mammalodon had very little baleen and relied mainly on their teeth . Generally it is speculated the four modern mysticete families have separate origins among the <unk> . Modern baleen whales , Balaenopteridae ( rorquals and humpback whale , Megaptera <unk> ) , Balaenidae ( right whales ) , Eschrichtiidae ( gray whale , <unk> robustus ) , and Neobalaenidae ( pygmy right whale , Caperea marginata ) all have derived characteristics presently unknown in any <unk> and vice versa ( such as a <unk> crest ) . 
 = = = Toothed whales = = = 
 The adaptation of echolocation occurred when toothed whales ( Odontoceti ) split apart from baleen whales , and distinguishes modern toothed whales from fully aquatic archaeocetes . This happened around 34 million years ago in a second cetacean radiation . Modern toothed whales do not rely on their sense of sight , but rather on their sonar to hunt prey . Echolocation also allowed toothed whales to dive deeper in search of food , with light no longer necessary for navigation , which opened up new food sources . Toothed whales echolocate by creating a series of clicks emitted at various frequencies . Sound pulses are emitted , reflected off objects , and retrieved through the lower jaw . Skulls of Squalodon show evidence for the first hypothesized appearance of echolocation . Squalodon lived from the early to middle Oligocene to the middle Miocene , around 33 – 14 million years ago . Squalodon featured several commonalities with modern toothed whales : the cranium was well compressed ( to make room for the melon , a part of the nose ) , the rostrum telescoped outward into a beak , a characteristic of the modern toothed whales that gave Squalodon an appearance similar to them . However , it is thought unlikely that squalodontids are direct ancestors of modern toothed whales . 
 The first oceanic dolphins such as <unk> , evolved in the late Oligocene and diversified greatly during the mid @-@ Miocene . The first fossil cetaceans near shallow seas ( where porpoises inhabit ) were found around the North Pacific ; species like <unk> were found along California ( in what was then estuaries ) . These animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later , during the Pliocene . The earliest known ancestor of arctic whales is <unk> <unk> from the late Miocene around 9 – 10 million years ago . A single fossil from Baja California indicates the family once inhabited warmer waters . 
 Ancient sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and the shape of the face and jaws . For example , Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum . Genera from the Oligocene and Miocene had teeth in their upper jaws . These anatomical differences suggest that these ancient species may not have necessarily been deep @-@ sea squid hunters like the modern sperm whale , but that some genera mainly ate fish . Contrary to modern sperm whales , most ancient sperm whales were built to hunt whales . <unk> had a short and wide rostrum measuring 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) across , which gave the whale the ability to inflict major damage on large struggling prey , such as other early whales . Species like these are collectively known as killer sperm whales . 
 <unk> whales consist of over 20 genera . Earlier variety were probably preyed upon by killer sperm whales and large sharks such as Megalodon . In 2008 , a large number of fossil ziphiids were discovered off the coast of South Africa , confirming the remaining <unk> species might just be a remnant of a higher diversity that has since gone extinct . After studying numerous fossil skulls , researchers discovered the absence of functional maxillary teeth in all South African ziphiids , which is evidence that suction feeding had already developed in several beaked whale lineages during the Miocene . Extinct ziphiids also had robust skulls , suggesting that tusks were used for male @-@ male interactions . 
 = = Skeletal evolution = = 
 Modern cetaceans have internal , rudimentary hind limbs , such as reduced femurs , <unk> , and <unk> , and a pelvic girdle . Indohyus has a thickened ectotympanic internal lip of the ear bone . This feature compares directly to that of modern cetaceans . Another similar feature was the composition of the teeth , which contained mostly calcium phosphate which is needed for eating and drinking by aquatic animals , though , unlike modern day toothed whales , they had a heterodont ( more than one tooth morphology ) dentition as opposed to a <unk> ( one tooth morphology present ) dentition . Although they somewhat resembled a wolf , the fossils of pakicetids showed the eye sockets were much closer to the top of their head than that of other terrestrial mammals , but similar to the structure of the eyes in cetaceans . Their transition from land to water led to reshaping of the skull and food processing equipment because the eating habits were changing . Ultimately , the change in position of the eyes and limb bones is what led the pakicetids to become waders . The ambulocetids also began to develop long snouts , which is seen in current cetaceans . Their limbs ( and hypothesized movement ) were very similar to otters . 
 <unk> in cetaceans does not represent a regression of fully formed limbs nor the absence of limb bud initiation , but rather arrest of limb bud development . Limb buds develop normally in cetacean embryos . Limb buds progress to the condensation phase of early <unk> , where nerves grow into the limb bud and the apical <unk> ridge ( AER ) , a structure that ensures proper limb development , appears functional . Occasionally , the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature legs ( atavism ) . 
 Pakicetus had a pelvic bone most similar to that of terrestrial mammals . In later species , such as Basilosaurus , the pelvic bone , no longer attached to the vertebrae and the ilium , was reduced . Certain genes are believed to be responsible for the changes that occurred to the cetacean pelvic structure , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The pelvic girdle in modern cetaceans were once thought to be vestigial structures that served no purpose at all . The pelvic girdle in male cetaceans is different in size compared to females , and the size is thought to be a result of sexual dimorphism . The pelvic bones of modern male cetaceans are more massive , longer , and larger than those of females . Due to the sexual dimorphism displayed , they were most likely involved in supporting male genitalia that remain hidden behind abdominal walls until sexual reproduction occurs . 
 Early archaeocetes such as Pakicetus had the nasal openings at the end of the snout , but in later species such as Rodhocetus , the openings had begun to drift toward the top of the skull . This is known as nasal drift . The nostrils of modern cetaceans have become modified into blowholes that allow them to break to the surface , inhale , and submerge with convenience . The ears began to move inward as well , and , in the case of Basilosaurus , the middle ears began to receive vibrations from the lower jaw . Today 's modern toothed whales use their melon organ , a pad of fat , for echolocation .

 = = = Culture = = = 
 Culture is group @-@ specific behavior transferred by social learning . Tool use to aid with foraging is one example . Whether or not a dolphin uses a tool affects their eating behavior , which causes differences in diet . Also , using a tool allows a new niche and new prey to open up for that particular dolphin . Due to these differences , fitness levels change within the dolphins of a population , which further causes evolution to occur in the long run . Culture and social networks have played a large role in the evolution of modern cetaceans , as concluded in studies showing dolphins preferring mates with the same socially learned behaviors , and humpback whales using songs between breeding areas . For dolphins particularly , the largest non @-@ genetic effects on their evolution are due to culture and social structure . 
 Based on a 2014 study , the population of Indo @-@ Pacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops sp . ) around Shark Bay of Western Australia can be divided into spongers and nonspongers . <unk> put sea sponges on their snout as a protective means against abrasions from sharp objects , stingray barbs , or toxic organisms . The sponges also help the dolphins target fish without swim bladders , since echolocation cannot detect these fish easily against a complex background . <unk> also specifically forage in deep channels , but nonspongers are found foraging in both deep and shallow channels . This foraging behavior is mainly passed on from mother to child . Therefore , since this is a group behavior being passed down by social learning , this tool use is considered a cultural trait . 
 Researchers in a 2014 study in Shark Bay found the fatty acid analyses between the West and East Gulf populations to differ , which is due to the two areas having different food sources . However , when comparing data from within the West Gulf , the spongers vs. the nonspongers in the deep channels had very different fatty acid results even though they are in the same habitat . <unk> from deep and shallow channels had similar data . This suggests that sponging was the cause of the different data and not the deep vs. shallow channels . <unk> opened up a new niche for the dolphins and allowed them access to new prey , which caused long @-@ term diet changes . By producing different food sources within a population , there is less <unk> competition for resources , showing character displacement . As a result , the carrying capacity increases since the entire population does not depend on one food source . The fitness levels within the population also change , thus allowing this culture to evolve . 
 = = = = Social structure = = = = 
 Social structure forms groups with individuals that interact with one another , and this allows for cultural traits to emerge , exchange , and evolve . This relationship is especially seen in the bottlenose dolphin populations in southwestern Australia , which have been known to beg for food from fishermen . This begging behavior was spread through the population due to individual ( dolphins spending time around boats ) and social ( dolphins spending time with other dolphins who express begging behavior ) learning . 
 Culture can , however , impact social structure by causing behavior matching and assertive mating . Individuals within a certain culture are more likely to mate with individuals using the same behaviors rather than a random individual , thus influencing social groups and structure . For example , the spongers of Shark Bay preferentially stick with other spongers . Also , some bottlenose dolphins in Moreton Bay , Australia followed prawn trawlers to feed on their debris , while other dolphins in the same population did not . The dolphins preferentially associated with individuals with same behavior even though they all lived in the same habitat . Later on , prawn trawlers were no longer present , and the dolphins integrated into one social network after a couple of years . 
 Social networks can still affect and cause evolution on their own by impending fitness differences on individuals . According to a 2012 study , male calves had a lower survival rate if they had stronger bonds with juvenile males . However , when other age and sex classes were tested , their survival rate did not significantly change . This suggests that juvenile males impose a social stress on their younger counterparts . In fact , it has been documented that juvenile males commonly perform acts of aggression , dominance , and intimidation against the male calves . According to a 2010 study , certain populations of Shark Bay dolphins had varying levels of fitness and calf success . This is either due to social learning ( whether or not the mother passed on her knowledge of reproductive ability to the calves ) , or due to the strong association between mother dolphins in the population ; by sticking in a group , an individual mother does not need to be as vigilant all the time for predators . 
 Genetic studies conducted on Clymene dolphins ( Stenella <unk> ) focused on their natural histories , and the results show that the origin of the species was actually an outcome of hybrid speciation . Hybridization between spinner dolphins ( Stenella longirostris ) and striped dolphins ( Stenella <unk> ) in the North Atlantic was caused by constant habitat sharing of the two species . Relationships between these three species had been speculated according to notable resemblances between anatomies of the Clymene and the spinner dolphins , resulting in the former being regarded as subspecies of the latter until 1981 , and the possibility of the Clymene dolphin as a hybrid between the spinner and the striped dolphins have come to question based on anatomical and behavioral similarities between these two species .

 Genome sequences done in 2013 revealed that the Yangtze River dolphin , or " baiji " ( Lipotes vexillifer ) , lacks single nucleotide polymorphisms in their genome . After reconstructing the history of the baiji genome for this dolphin species , researchers found that the major decrease in genetic diversity occurred most likely due to a bottleneck event during the last deglaciation event . During this time period , sea levels were rising while global temperatures were decreasing . Other historical climate events can be correlated and matched with the genome history of the Yangtze River dolphin as well . This shows how global and local climate change can drastically affect a genome , leading to changes in fitness , survival , and evolution of a species . 
 The European population of common dolphins ( Delphinus <unk> ) in the Mediterranean have differentiated into two types : eastern and western . According to a 2012 study , this seems to be due to a recent bottleneck as well , which drastically decreased the size of the eastern Mediterranean population . Also , the lack of population structure between the western and eastern regions seems contradictory of the distinct population structures between other regions of dolphins . Even though the dolphins in the Mediterranean area had no physical barrier between their regions , they still differentiated into two types due to ecology and biology . Therefore , the differences between the eastern and western dolphins most likely stems from highly specialized niche choice rather than just physical barriers . Through this , environment plays a large role in the differentiation and evolution of this dolphin species . 
 The divergence and speciation within bottlenose dolphins has been largely due to climate and environmental changes over history . According to research , the divisions within the genus correlate with periods of rapid climate change . For example , the changing temperatures could cause the coast landscape to change , niches to empty up , and opportunities for separation to appear . In the Northeast Atlantic , specifically , genetic evidence suggests that the bottlenose dolphins have differentiated into coastal and pelagic types . Divergence seems most likely due to a founding event where a large group separated . Following this event , the separate groups adapted accordingly and formed their own niche specializations and social structures . These differences caused the two groups to diverge and to remain separated . 
 Two endemic , distinctive types of pilot whale , Tappanaga ( or <unk> ) the larger , northern type and Magondou the smaller , southern type , can be found along the Japanese archipelago where distributions of these two types mostly do not overlap by the oceanic front border around the easternmost point of Honshu . It is thought that the local extinction of long @-@ finned pilot whales in the North Pacific in the 12th century could have triggered the appearance of Tappanaga , causing short @-@ finned pilot whales to colonize the colder ranges of the long @-@ finned variant . 
 = Cult film = 
 A cult film , also commonly referred to as a cult classic , is a film that has acquired a cult following . Cult films are known for their dedicated , passionate fanbase , an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings , quoting dialogue , and audience participation . Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions , especially box office bombs , while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure , transgressive films shunned by the mainstream . The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror <unk> disputes about art . The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies , though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that . 
 Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and suppressed films kept alive by dedicated fans . In some cases , reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release , occasionally for their camp value . Other cult films have since become well @-@ respected or reassessed as classics ; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films . After failing in the cinema , some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video . Others have inspired their own film festivals . Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures . Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge . 
 Cult films frequently break cultural taboos , and many feature excessive displays of violence , gore , sexuality , profanity , or combinations thereof . This can lead to controversy , censorship , and outright bans ; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent . Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films . Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films ; fans of these films often emphasize the films ' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects . Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons , such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing , will often be ostracized or ridiculed . Likewise , fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection . 
 Since the late 1970s , cult films have become increasingly popular . Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream , and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture . <unk> usage of the term has resulted in controversy , as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional ; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic . Films are frequently stated to be an " instant cult classic " now , occasionally before they are released . <unk> fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release . At the same time , other films have acquired massive , quick cult followings , thanks to spreading virally through social media . Easy access to cult films via video on demand and peer @-@ to @-@ peer file sharing has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films . 
 = = Definition = = 
 A cult film is any film that has a cult following , although the term is not easily defined and can be applied to a wide variety of films . The definition is occasionally expanded to exclude films that have been released by major studios or have big budgets , try specifically to become cult films , or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics . Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as they are content . This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized audience participation , film festivals , or cosplay . Over time , the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier , stricter views . Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy , as cinephiles argue that the term has become meaningless or " elastic , a catchall for anything slightly maverick or strange " . Academic Mark Shiel has criticized the term itself as being a weak concept , reliant on subjectivity ; different groups can interpret films in their own terms . According to feminist scholar Joanne Hollows , this subjectivity causes films with strong female cult followings to be perceived as too mainstream and not transgressive enough to qualify as a cult film . Academic Mike Chopra ‑ Gant says that cult films become <unk> when studied as a group , and Shiel criticizes this <unk> as cultural commodification . 
 In 2008 , Cineaste asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film . Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism , explicitly requiring a transgressive element , though others disputed the transgressive potential , given the demographic appeal to white males and mainstreaming of cult films . Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements . Most definitions also required a strong community aspect , such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior . Citing misuse of the term , Mikel J. Koven took a self @-@ described hard @-@ line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria . Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open @-@ ended definition rooted in structuration , where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized . Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings , arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to , while Jonathan Rosenbaum rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword . Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term . That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad , failure and success , innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self @-@ evident . This ambiguity leads critics of postmodernism to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism , as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or <unk> . These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans . 
 Writing in Defining Cult Movies , <unk> et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce , who defines cult films in terms of paracinema , marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance : everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography . However , they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature ; instead , they state that cult films are united in their " subcultural ideology " and opposition to mainstream tastes , itself a vague and undefinable term . Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt , and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist , albeit unintentionally . At the same time , they state that bourgeois , masculine tastes are frequently reinforced , which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie , rather than a rebellion against it . This results in an anti @-@ academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies , such as defamiliarization . This contradiction exists in many subcultures , especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream . This nonconformity is eventually co @-@ opted by the dominant forces , such as Hollywood , and marketed to the mainstream . Academic Xavier Mendik also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content , especially if it is transgressive . Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal , Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political ; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films . 
 = = General overview = = 
 Cult films have existed since the early days of cinema . Film critic Harry Allan <unk> traces them back to 1910s France and the reception of Pearl White , William S. Hart , and Charlie Chaplin , which he described as " a dissent from the popular ritual " . Nosferatu ( 1922 ) was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker 's Dracula . Stoker 's widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy . All known copies of the film were destroyed , and Nosferatu become an early cult film , kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs . Academic Chuck Kleinhans identifies the Marx Brothers as making other early cult films . On their original release , some highly regarded classics from the Golden Age of Hollywood were panned by critics and audiences , relegated to cult status . The Night of the Hunter ( 1955 ) was a cult film for years , quoted often and championed by fans , before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic . During this time , American exploitation films and imported European art films were marketed similarly . Although critics Pauline Kael and Arthur Knight argued against arbitrary divisions into high and low culture , American films settled into rigid genres ; European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions , and these exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films . Much like later cult films , these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation , influenced by live theater and vaudeville . 
 Modern cult films grew from 1960s counterculture and underground films , popular among those who rejected mainstream Hollywood films . These underground film festivals led to the creation of midnight movies , which attracted cult followings . The term cult film itself was an outgrowth of this movement and was first used in the 1970s , though cult had been in use for decades in film analysis with both positive and negative connotations . These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier avant @-@ garde films . Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream , peaking with the release of The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) , which finally found its audience several years after its release . Eventually , the rise of home video would marginalize midnight movies once again , after which many directors joined the burgeoning independent film scene or went back underground . Home video would give a second life to box office flops , as positive word @-@ of @-@ mouth or excessive replay on cable television led these films to develop an appreciative audience , as well as obsessive replay and study . For example , The Beastmaster ( 1982 ) , despite its failure at the box office , became one of the most played movies on American cable television and developed into a cult film . Home video and television broadcasts of cult films were initially greeted with hostility . Joanne Hollows states that they were seen as turning cult films mainstream – in effect , <unk> them by opening them to distracted , passive audiences . 
 Releases from major studios – such as The Big Lebowski ( 1998 ) , which was distributed by Universal Studios – can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues , such as midnight movies , festivals , and home video . Hollywood films , due to their nature , are more likely to attract this kind of attention , which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture . With major studios behind them , even financially unsuccessful films can be re @-@ released multiple times , which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues . The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream , Hollywood films , such as The Big Lebowski , can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open @-@ minded demographics not often associated with cult films , such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers . Thus , even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film , perceived by fans as transgressive , niche , and uncommercial . Discussing his reputation for making cult films , Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap said , " I didn 't set out to make cult films . I wanted to make box @-@ office hits . " Writing in Cult Cinema , academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism is not out of character , as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts : they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they are anything else . 
 In a global context , popularity can vary widely by territory , especially with regard to limited releases . Mad Max ( 1979 ) was an international hit – except in America where it became an obscure cult favorite , ignored by critics and available for years only in a dubbed version though it earned over $ 100M internationally . Foreign cinema can put a different spin on popular genres , such as Japanese horror , which was initially a cult favorite in America . Asian imports to the West are often marketed as exotic cult films and of interchangeable national identity , which academic Chi @-@ Yun Shin criticizes as reductive . Foreign influence can affect fan response , especially on genres tied to a national identity ; when they become more global in scope , questions of authenticity may arise . Filmmakers and films ignored in their own country can become the objects of cult adoration in another , producing perplexed reactions in their native country . Cult films can also establish an early viability for more mainstream films both for filmmakers and national cinema . The early cult horror films of Peter Jackson were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and its cinema . As more artistic films emerged , New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood , which mirrored Jackson 's career trajectory . Heavenly Creatures ( 1994 ) acquired its own cult following , became a part of New Zealand 's national identity , and paved the way for big @-@ budget , Hollywood @-@ style epics , such as Jackson 's Lord of the Rings trilogy . 
 Mathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management . Fans will often watch films obsessively , an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time . They may also watch films idiosyncratically : sped up , slowed down , frequently paused , or at odd hours . Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel , non @-@ linear narratives , and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular . Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits , such as viewing horror films on Halloween , sentimental melodrama on Christmas , and romantic films on Valentine 's Day . These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites . Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor . These films , ritually watched every season , give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers . New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of It 's A Wonderful Life ( 1946 ) and Miracle on 34th Street ( 1947 ) . These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values . Halloween , on the other hand , allows flaunting society 's taboos and testing one 's fears . Horror films have appropriated the holiday , and many horror films debut on Halloween . Mathijs criticizes the over @-@ <unk> , commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films , which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community . Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect . 
 Despite their oppositional nature , cult films can produce celebrities . Like cult films themselves , authenticity is an important aspect of their popularity . Actors can become typecast as they become strongly associated with such iconic roles . Tim Curry , despite his acknowledged range as an actor , found casting difficult after he achieved fame in The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Even when discussing unrelated projects , interviewers frequently bring up the role , which causes him to tire of discussing it . Mary <unk> , known for her transgressive roles in cult films , eventually transitioned to mainstream films . She was expected to recreate the transgressive elements of her cult films within the confines of mainstream cinema . Instead of the complex gender deconstructions of her Andy Warhol films , she became typecast as a lesbian or domineering woman . Sylvia Kristel , after starring in Emmanuelle ( 1974 ) , found herself highly associated with the film and the sexual liberation of the 1970s . Caught between the transgressive elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft @-@ core pornography , she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and Emmanuelle sequels . Despite her immense popularity and cult following , she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if she was even mentioned . Similarly , Chloë Sevigny has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in transgressive films . Cult films can also trap directors . Leonard Kastle , who directed The Honeymoon Killers ( 1969 ) , never directed another film again . Despite his cult following , which included François Truffaut , he was unable to find financing for any of his other screenplays . Qualities that bring cult films to prominence – such as an uncompromising , unorthodox vision – caused Alejandro Jodorowsky to languish in obscurity for years . 
 = = Transgression and censorship = = 
 Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s . Unconcerned with genre distinctions , they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of European art cinema and experimental film , the gritty subject matter of Italian neorealism , and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation . Some used hardcore pornography and horror , occasionally at the same time . In the 1980s , filmmaker Nick Zedd identified this movement as the Cinema of Transgression and later wrote a manifesto . Popular in midnight showings , they were mainly limited to large urban areas , which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as " downtown culture " . These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies , such as The Village Voice . Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them , which gave many people their first taste of underground film . Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations , such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film . Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions , such as Battle Royale ( 2000 ) , which broke many rules of teenage slasher films . The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans . Audience participation itself can be transgressive , such as breaking long @-@ standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen . 
 According to Mathijs , critical reception is important to a film 's perception as cult , through topicality and controversy . <unk> , which can be regional ( such as objection to government funding of the film ) or critical ( such as philosophical objections to the themes ) , enables attention and a contextual response . Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy , such as a moral panic , which provides opposition . Cultural values transgressed in the film , such as sexual promiscuity , can be attacked by proxy , through attacks on the film . These concerns can vary from culture to culture , and they need not be at all similar . However , Mathijs says the film must invoke <unk> for it to be more than simply culturally important . While referencing previous arguments , critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist . Taking stances on these varied issues , critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status . Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films , an example of which would be Rex Reed 's comments about Korean culture in his review of <unk> ( 2003 ) . Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates , such as how Joe Bob Briggs and Roger Ebert dueled over I Spit On Your Grave ( 1978 ) . Briggs would later contribute a commentary track to the DVD release in which he describes it as a feminist film . Films which do not attract enough controversy may be ridiculed and rejected when suggested as cult films . 
 Academic Peter Hutchings , noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements , states that cult films are known in part for their excesses . Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms . Violence , gore , sexual perversity , and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema . Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult to find , common criteria used to define cult films . Despite this , these films remain well @-@ known and prized among collectors . Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis , which they believe <unk> and misinterprets paracinema . In marketing these films , young men are predominantly targeted . Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films . Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes , such as misogyny , using these films as catharsis for the things that they hate most in life . <unk> , transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire . Frank <unk> faced censorship and ridicule , but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch , such as violence , drug addiction , and misogyny . Lloyd Kaufman sees his films ' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities . Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood , vomit , and diarrhea , Kaufman 's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics . Excess can also exist as camp , such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism . 
 Films that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films . Director Jean Rollin worked within cinéma fantastique , an unpopular genre in modern France . Influenced by American films and early French <unk> , he drifted between art , exploitation , and pornography . His films were reviled by critics , but he retained a cult following drawn by the nudity and eroticism . Similarly , Jess Franco chafed under fascist censorship in Spain but became influential in Spain 's horror boom of the 1960s . These transgressive films that straddle the line between art and horror may have overlapping cult followings , each with their own interpretation and reasons for appreciating it . The films that followed Jess Franco were unique in their rejection of mainstream art . Popular among fans of European horror for their <unk> and obscurity , these later Spanish films allowed political dissidents to criticize the fascist regime within the cloak of exploitation and horror . Unlike most exploitation directors , they were not trying to establish a reputation . They were already established in the art @-@ house world and intentionally chose to work within paracinema as a reaction against the New Spanish Cinema , an artistic revival supported by the fascists . As late as the 1980s , critics still cited Pedro Almodóvar 's anti @-@ macho iconoclasm as a rebellion against fascist mores , as he grew from countercultural rebel to mainstream respectability . Transgressive elements that limit a director 's appeal in one country can be celebrated or highlighted in another . Takashi Miike has been marketed in the West as a shocking and avant @-@ garde filmmaker despite his many family @-@ friendly comedies , which have not been imported . 
 The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship . During the 1970s and early 1980s , a wave of explicit , graphic exploitation films caused controversy . Called " video nasties " within the UK , they ignited calls for censorship and stricter laws on home video releases , which were largely unregulated . Consequently , the British Board of Film Classification banned many popular cult films due to issues of sex , violence , and incitement to crime . Released during the cannibal boom , Cannibal Holocaust ( 1980 ) was banned in dozens of countries and caused the director to be briefly jailed over fears that it was a real snuff film . Although opposed to censorship , director Ruggero Deodato would later agree with cuts made by the BBFC which removed unsimulated animal killings , which limited the film 's distribution . Frequently banned films may introduce questions of authenticity as fans question whether they have seen a truly uncensored cut . Cult films have been falsely claimed to have been banned to increase their transgressive reputation and explain their lack of mainstream penetration . Marketing campaigns have also used such claims to raise interest among curious audiences . Home video has allowed cult film fans to import rare or banned films , finally giving them a chance to complete their collection with imports and bootlegs . Cult films previously banned are sometimes released with much fanfare and the fans assumed to be already familiar with the controversy . Personal responsibility is often highlighted , and a strong anti @-@ censorship message may be present . Previously lost scenes cut by studios can be re @-@ added and restore a director 's original vision , which draws similar fanfare and acclaim from fans . Imports are sometimes censored to remove elements that would be controversial , such as references to Islamic spirituality in Indonesian cult films . 
 Academics have written of how transgressive themes in cult films can be regressive . David Church and Chuck Kleinhans describe an uncritical celebration of transgressive themes in cult films , including misogyny and racism . Church has also criticized gendered descriptions of transgressive content that celebrate masculinity . Joanne Hollows further identifies a gendered component to the celebration of transgressive themes in cult films , where male terms are used to describe films outside the mainstream while female terms are used to describe mainstream , conformist cinema . Jacinda Read 's expansion states that cult films , despite their potential for empowerment of the marginalized , are more often used by politically incorrect males . Knowledgeable about feminism and multiculturalism , they seek a refuge from the academic acceptance of these progressive ideals . Their playful and ironic acceptance of regressive lad culture invites , and even dares , condemnation from academics and the uncool . Thus , cult films become a tool to reinforce mainstream values through transgressive content ; Rebecca <unk> states that cultural hierarchies can also be reaffirmed through mockery of films perceived to be lacking masculinity . However , the sexploitation films of Doris Wishman took a feminist approach which avoids and subverts the male gaze and traditional goal @-@ oriented methods . Wishman 's subject matter , though exploitative and transgressive , was always framed in terms of female empowerment and the feminine spectator . Her use of common cult film motifs – female nudity and ambiguous gender – were repurposed to comment on feminist topics . Similarly , the films of Russ Meyer were a complicated combination of transgressive , mainstream , progressive , and regressive elements . They attracted both acclaim and denouncement from critics and progressives . Transgressive films imported from cultures that are recognizably different yet still relatable can be used to progressively examine issues in another culture .

 Cult films can be used to help define or create groups as a form of subcultural capital ; knowledge of cult films proves that one is " authentic " or " non @-@ mainstream " . They can be used to provoke an outraged response from the mainstream , which further defines the subculture , as only members could possibly tolerate such deviant entertainment . More accessible films have less subcultural capital ; among extremists , banned films will have the most . By referencing cult films , media can identify desired demographics , strengthen bonds with specific subcultures , and stand out among those who understand the intertextuality . Popular films from previous eras may be reclaimed by genre fans long after they have been forgotten by the original audiences . This can be done for authenticity , such as horror fans who seek out now @-@ obscure titles from the 1950s instead of the modern , well @-@ known remakes . Authenticity may also drive fans to deny genre categorization to films perceived as too mainstream or accessible . Authenticity in performance and expertise can drive fan acclaim . Authenticity can also drive fans to decry the mainstream in the form of hostile critics and censors . Especially when promoted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable programmers , choice of venue can be an important part of expressing individuality . Besides creating new communities , cult films can link formerly disparate groups , such as fans and critics . As these groups intermix , they can influence each other , though this may be resisted by older fans , unfamiliar with these new references . In extreme cases , cult films can lead to the creation of religions , such as <unk> . For their avoidance of mainstream culture and audiences , enjoyment of irony , and celebration of obscure subcultures , academic Martin Roberts compares cult film fans to hipsters . 
 A film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has unusual significance . For example , Norman Wisdom 's films , friendly to Marxist interpretation , amassed a cult following in Albania , as they were among the few Western films allowed by the country 's Communist rulers . The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) and its star , Judy Garland , hold special significance to American and British gay culture , although it is a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture . Similarly , James Dean and his brief film career have become icons of alienated youth . Cult films can have such niche appeal that they are only popular within certain subcultures , such as Reefer Madness ( 1936 ) and Hemp for Victory ( 1942 ) among stoner subculture . Beach party musicals , popular among American surfers , failed to find an equivalent audience when imported to the United Kingdom . When films target subcultures like this , they may seem unintelligible without the proper cultural capital . Films which appeal to teenagers may offer subcultural identities that are easily recognized and differentiate various subcultural groups . Films which appeal to stereotypical male activities , such as sports , can easily gain strong male cult followings . Sports metaphors are often used in the marketing of cult films to males , such as emphasizing the " extreme " nature of the film , which increases the appeal to youth subcultures fond of extreme sports . 
 Matt Hills ' concept of the " cult blockbuster " involves cult followings inside larger , mainstream films . Although these are big budget , mainstream films , they still attract cult followings . The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways : longstanding devotion to the film , distinctive interpretations , and fan works . Hills identifies three different cult followings for The Lord of the Rings , each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream . Academic Emma Pett identifies Back to the Future ( 1985 ) as another example of a cult blockbuster . Although the film topped the charts when it was released , it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years . The hammy acting by Christopher Lloyd and quotable dialogue draw a cult following , as they mimic traditional cult films . Blockbuster science fiction films that include philosophical subtexts , such as The Matrix , allow cult film fans to enjoy them on a higher level than the mainstream . Star Wars , with its large cult following in geek subculture , has been cited as both a cult blockbuster or a cult film . Although a mainstream epic , Star Wars has provided its fans with a spirituality and culture outside of the mainstream . Fans , in response to the popularity of these blockbusters , will claim elements for themselves while rejecting others . For example , in the Star Wars film series , mainstream criticism of Jar Jar Binks focused on racial stereotyping ; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments , he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing . Also , instead of valuing textual rarity , fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings . They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media , as cult blockbusters are often franchised , preconceived as a film series , or both . To reduce mainstream accessibility , a film series can be self @-@ reflexive and full of in @-@ jokes that only longtime fans can understand . 
 Cult films can create their own subculture . Rocky Horror , originally made to exploit the popularity of glam subculture , became what academic Gina Marchetti called a " sub @-@ subculture " , a variant that outlived its parent subculture . Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans , cult film fandom can include many newer , less experienced members . Familiar with the film 's reputation and having watched clips on YouTube , these fans may take the next step and enter the film 's fandom . If they are the majority , they may alter or ignore long @-@ standing traditions , such as audience participation rituals ; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized , but accepted rituals bring subcultural capital to veteran fans who introduce them to the newer members . Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions . Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing , but longtime fans often cite the community . Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film , as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself . Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation . Fans of cult films , as in media fandom , are frequently producers instead of mere consumers . Unconcerned with traditional views on intellectual property , these fan works are often unsanctioned , transformative , and ignore fictional canon . 
 Like cult films themselves , magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self @-@ conscious offensiveness . They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny , gore , and racism . Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital . Specialist stores on the fringes of society ( or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites ) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom , especially when they use erotic or gory imagery . By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia , non @-@ fans can be excluded . Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation . Casual readers and non @-@ fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates , as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute . When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons , such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal , they may be ridiculed . Thus , fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the " Other " , a philosophical construct divergent from social norms . Commercial aspects of fandom ( such as magazines or books ) can also be defined in terms of " otherness " and thus valid to consume : consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers , but the mainstream is denigrated . Irony or self @-@ deprecating humor can also be used . In online communities , different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital . Even within subcultures , fans who break subcultural scripts , such as denying the <unk> of a disturbing film , will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity . 
 = = Types = = 
 = = = " So bad it 's good " = = = 
 The critic Michael Medved characterized examples of the " so bad it 's good " class of low @-@ budget cult film through books such as The Golden Turkey Awards . These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs , such as Plan 9 from Outer Space ( 1959 ) and The Room ( 2003 ) . Similarly , Paul Verhoeven 's Showgirls ( 1995 ) bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video . Catching on , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer capitalized on the film 's ironic appeal and marketed it as a cult film . Films which attract the derision of audiences can turn into outlets for fan creativity where fans impose their own interpretation , such as reinterpreting an earnest melodrama as a comedy . Jacob <unk> of the Carroll County Times states that films can be perceived as nonsensical or inept when audiences misunderstand avant @-@ garde filmmaking or misinterpret parody . Films such as Rocky Horror can be misinterpreted as " weird for weirdness sake " by people unfamiliar with the cult films that it <unk> <unk> ultimately rejects the use of the label " so bad it 's good " as mean @-@ spirited and often misapplied . Alamo Drafthouse programmer Zack Carlson has further said that any film which succeeds in entertaining an audience is good , regardless of irony . The rise of the Internet and on @-@ demand films has led critics to question whether " so bad it 's good " films have a future now that people have such diverse options in both availability and catalog , though fans eager to experience the worst films ever made can lead to lucrative showings for local theaters and merchandisers . 
 = = = Camp and guilty pleasures = = = 
 Chuck Kleinhans states that the difference between a guilty pleasure and a cult film can be as simple as the number of fans ; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following , especially now that home video makes fans difficult to count . As these cult films become more popular , they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations , such as camp , irony , genuine affection , or combinations thereof . Earnest fans , who recognize and accept the film 's faults , can make minor celebrities of the film 's cast , though the benefits are not always clear . Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously . Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious , artistic @-@ minded films . This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle , method @-@ inspired acting . Mark Chalon Smith of the Los Angeles Times says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas , such as camp or transgressive content . Smith states that the early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed , but Waters ' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema . Films such as Myra Breckinridge ( 1970 ) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls ( 1970 ) can experience critical reappraisal later , once their camp excess and avant @-@ garde filmmaking are better accepted , and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy . Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them , as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic . 
 = = = Nostalgia = = = 
 According to academic Brigid Cherry , nostalgia " is a strong element of certain kinds of cult appeal . " When <unk> added many cult films to their site , they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity . Academic I. Q. Hunter describes cult films as " New Hollywood in extremis " and a form of nostalgia for that period . Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia as a form of resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time @-@ based economy . By virtue of the time travel plot , Back to the Future permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s . Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods , which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics , nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released , and looking to the past to find a better time period . Similarly , films directed by John Hughes have taken hold in midnight movie venues , trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism . Mathijs and Sexton describe Grease ( 1978 ) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following . Other cult films , such as Streets of Fire ( 1984 ) , create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past . Cult films may also subvert nostalgia , such as The Big Lebowski , which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow . Author China Miéville praises the use of satire in Donnie Darko for its avoidance of falling into facile and comforting nostalgia , but Nathan Lee of the New York Sun identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds . 
 = = = Midnight movies = = = 
 Author Tomas Crowder @-@ Taraborrelli describes midnight movies as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America , and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to libertarian , united in their anti @-@ establishment attitude and punk aesthetic . These films are resistant to simple categorization and are defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences . Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively . Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s . Like the surrealists and <unk> , they not only satirically attacked society but also the very structure of film – a counter @-@ cinema that deconstructs narrative and traditional processes . In the late 1980s and 1990s , midnight movies transitioned from underground showings to home video viewings ; eventually , a desire for community brought a resurgence , and The Big Lebowski kick @-@ started a new generation . Demographics shifted , and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them . Although studios expressed skepticism , large audiences were drawn to box office flops , such as Donnie Darko ( 2001 ) and Office Space ( 1999 ) . Modern midnight movies retain their popularity and have been strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight . Mainstream cinemas , eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits , have begun abandoning midnight screenings . Although classic midnight movies have dropped off in popularity , they still bring reliable crowds . 
 = = = Art and exploitation = = = 
 Although seemingly at odds with each other , art and exploitation films are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom , listed alongside each other and described in similar terms : their ability to provoke a response . The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their academic recognition ignored . This flattening of culture follows the popularity of post @-@ structuralism , which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art . Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation , as is occasionally assumed , this is a key component ; they write that exploitation , which exists on the fringes of the mainstream and deals with taboo subjects , is well @-@ suited for cult followings . Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are " the most masculinized , youth @-@ oriented , populist , and openly pornographic softcore area . " The sexploitation films of Russ Meyer were among the first to abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following . His persistent vision saw him received as an auteur worthy of academic study ; director John Waters attributes this to Meyer 's ability to create complicated , sexually charged films without resorting to explicit sex . Myrna Oliver described Doris Wishman 's exploitation films as " crass , coarse , and camp ... perfect fodder for a cult following . " " Sick films " , the most disturbing and graphically transgressive films , have their own distinct cult following ; these films transcend their roots in exploitation , horror , and art films . In 1960s and 1970s America , exploitation and art films shared audiences and marketing , especially in New York City 's grindhouse cinemas . 
 = = = B and genre films = = = 
 Mathijs and Sexton state that genre is an important part of cult films ; cult films will often mix , mock , or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres . Science fiction , fantasy , and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings ; as science fiction films become more popular , fans emphasize non @-@ mainstream and less commercial aspects of it . B films , which are often conflated with exploitation , are as important to cult films as exploitation . Teodor <unk> of Malta Today states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta 's burgeoning film industry . Genre films , B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations , can appeal to cult film fans : given their transgressive excesses , horror films are likely to become to cult films ; films like Galaxy Quest ( 1999 ) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction ; and authentic martial arts skills in Hong Kong action films can drive them to become cult favorites . Cult musicals can range from the traditional , such as Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) , which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia , camp , and spectacle , to the more non @-@ traditional , such as Cry @-@ Baby ( 1990 ) , which parodies musicals , and Rocky Horror , which uses a rock soundtrack . Romantic fairy tale The Princess Bride ( 1987 ) failed to attract audiences in its original release , as the studio did not know how to market it . The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films , and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun . Ad Week writes that cult B films , when released on home video , market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 Animation can provide wide open vistas for stories ; the French film Fantastic Planet ( 1972 ) explored ideas beyond the limits of traditional , live @-@ action science fiction films . Phil Hoad of The Guardian identifies Akira ( 1988 ) as introducing violent , adult Japanese animation ( known as anime ) to the West and paving the way for later works . Anime , according to academic Brian Ruh , is not a cult genre , but the lack of individual fandoms inside anime fandom itself lends itself to a bleeding over of cult attention and can help spread works internationally . Anime , which is often highly franchised , provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity . The Ghost in the Shell franchise , for example , provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies . Markets that did not support the sale of these materials saw less cult activity . Ralph Bakshi 's career has been marked with controversy : Fritz the Cat ( 1972 ) , the first animated film to be rated " X " by the MPAA , provoked outrage for its racial caricatures and graphic depictions of sex , and Coonskin ( 1975 ) was decried as racist . Bakshi recalls that older animators had tired of " kid stuff " and desired edgier work , whereas younger animators hated his work for " destroying the Disney images " . Eventually , his work would be reassessed and cult followings , which include Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez , developed around several of his films . Heavy Metal ( 1981 ) faced similar denunciations from critics ; Donald Liebenson of the Los Angeles Times cites the violence and sexual imagery as alienating critics , who did not know what to make of the film . It would go on to become a popular midnight movie and frequently bootlegged by fans , as licensing issues kept it from being released on video for many years . 
 = = = Nonfiction = = = 
 <unk> documentaries called mondo films replicate the most shocking and transgressive elements of exploitation films ; they are usually modeled after " sick films " and cover similar subject matter . In The Cult Film Reader , academics Mathijs and Mendik write that these documentaries often present non @-@ Western societies as " stereotypically mysterious , seductive , immoral , deceptive , barbaric or savage " . Though they can be interpreted as racist , Mathijs and Mendik state that they also " exhibit a liberal attitude towards the breaking of cultural taboos " . Mondo films like Faces of Death mix real and fake footage freely , and they gain their cult following through the outrage and debate over authenticity that results . Like " so bad it 's good " cult films , old propaganda and government hygiene films may be enjoyed ironically by more modern audiences for the camp value of the outdated themes and outlandish claims made about perceived social threats , such as drug use . Academic Barry K. Grant states that Frank Capra 's Why We Fight World War II propaganda films are explicitly not cult , because they are " slickly made and have proven their ability to persuade an audience . " The sponsored film Mr. B Natural became a cult hit when it was broadcast on the satirical television show Mystery Science Theater 3000 ; cast member Trace Beaulieu cited these educational shorts as his favorite to mock on the show . Mark <unk> states that cult audiences are drawn to these films because of their " very banality or incoherence of their political positions " , unlike traditional cult films , which achieve popularity through auteurist radicalism . 
 = = Mainstream popularity = = 
 Mark Shiel explains the rising popularity of cult films as an attempt by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film , as well as a lack of condescension in both critics and the films ; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles . According to Xavier Mendik , " academics have been really interested in cult movies for quite a while now . " Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine @-@ Excess , a film festival . I. Q. Hunter states that " it 's much easier to be a cultist now , but it is also rather more inconsequential . " Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust , Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess , as they 've now become meaningless . Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics , music videos , and fashion . Cult films have shown up in less expected places ; as a sign of his popularity , a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown , and L 'Osservatore Romano , the official newspaper of the Holy See , has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture . When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods , fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films " cultural vandalism " . Cult films can also drive tourism , even when it is unwanted . 
 As far back as the 1970s , Attack of the Killer Tomatoes ( 1978 ) was designed specifically to be a cult film , and The Rocky Horror Picture Show was produced by 20th Century Fox , a major Hollywood studio . Over its decades @-@ long release , Rocky Horror became the seventh highest grossing R @-@ rated film when adjusted for inflation ; Journalist Matt Singer has questioned whether Rocky Horror 's popularity invalidates its cult status . Founded in 1974 , Troma Entertainment , an independent studio , would become known for both its cult following and cult films . In the 1980s , Danny Peary 's Cult Movies ( 1981 ) would influence director Edgar Wright and film critic Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club . The rise of home video would have a mainstreaming effect on cult films and cultish behavior , though some collectors would be unlikely to self @-@ identify as cult film fans . Film critic Joe Bob Briggs began reviewing drive @-@ in theater and cult films , though he faced much criticism as an early advocate of exploitation and cult films . Briggs highlights the mainstreaming of cult films by pointing out the respectful obituaries that cult directors have received from formerly hostile publications and acceptance of politically incorrect films at mainstream film festivals . This acceptance is not universal , though , and some critics have resisted this mainstreaming of paracinema . Beginning in the 1990s , director Quentin Tarantino would have the greatest success in turning cult films mainstream . Tarantino later used his fame to champion obscure cult films that had influenced him and set up the short @-@ lived Rolling Thunder Pictures , which distributed several of his favorite cult films . Tarantino 's clout led Phil Hoad of The Guardian to call Tarantino the world 's most influential director . 
 As major Hollywood studios and audiences both become savvy to cult films , productions once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits , and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films . Remarking on the popular trend of remaking cult films , Claude <unk> @-@ <unk> of New York magazine states that Hollywood studios have been <unk> hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia . Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films now that they have finally become successful and mainstream , are too slick to attract a proper cult following , lack context , or are too easily found online . In response , David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films , often using illegal distribution methods , which preserves the outlaw status of cult films . Virtual spaces , such as online forums and fan sites , replace the traditional fanzines and newsletters . Cult film fans consider themselves collectors , rather than consumers , as they associate consumers with mainstream , Hollywood audiences . This collecting can take the place of <unk> of a single film . Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like Rocky Horror , academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings . Koven also identifies television shows , such as Twin Peaks , as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture . David Lynch himself has not ruled out another television series , as studios have become reluctant to take chances on non @-@ mainstream ideas . Despite this , the Alamo Drafthouse has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from Rocky Horror and retro promotional gimmickry . They sell out their shows regularly and have acquired a cult following of their own . 
 Academic Bob Batchelor , writing in Cult Pop Culture , states that the Internet has democratized cult culture and destroyed the line between cult and mainstream . Fans of even the most obscure films can communicate online with each other in vibrant communities . Although known for their big @-@ budget blockbusters , Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have criticized the current Hollywood system of gambling everything on the opening weekend of these productions . Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent instead suggests that Hollywood look to capitalize on cult films , which have exploded in popularity on the Internet . The rise of social media has been a boon to cult films . Sites such as Twitter have displaced traditional venues for fandom and courted controversy from cultural critics who are unamused by campy cult films . After a clip from one of his films went viral , director @-@ producer Roger Corman made a distribution deal with YouTube . Found footage which had originally been distributed as cult VHS collections eventually went viral on YouTube , which opened them to new generations of fans . Films such as <unk> ( 2008 ) and The Room ( 2003 ) gained quick , massive popularity , as prominent members of social networking sites discussed them . Their rise as " instant cult classics " bypasses the years of obscurity that most cult films labor under . In response , critics have described the use of viral marketing as astroturfing and an attempt to manufacture cult films . 
 I. Q. Hunter identifies a prefabricated cult film style which includes " deliberately , insulting bad films " , " slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation " , and mainstream films " that sell themselves as worth obsessing over " . Writing for NPR , Scott Tobias states that Don <unk> , whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings , has drifted into this realm . Tobias criticizes <unk> as trying too hard to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness . Influenced by the successful online hype of The Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) , other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom with the use of prefabricated cult appeal . Snakes on a Plane ( 2006 ) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans . Uniquely , its cult following preceded the film 's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be . This reached the point of convergence culture when fan speculation began to impact on the film 's production . Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game @-@ changer before it was released , it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following . In retrospect , critic Spencer Kornhaber would call it a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a " more naive era of the Internet " . However , it became influential in both marketing and titling . This trend of " instant cult classics " which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer , who states that the phrase is an oxymoron . 
 Cult films are often approached in terms of auteur theory , which states that the director 's creative vision drives a film . This has fallen out of favor in academia , creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics . Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films ; fans that see a film as continuing a director 's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult . According to academic Greg Taylor , auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant @-@ garde film criticism . Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship . By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details , auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans . Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream . Academic Joe Tompkins states that this <unk> is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs . This may take the place of – and even ignore – political readings of the director . Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content , daring , and independence , but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture . While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation , Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films , such as sensational exploitation . Someone like George Romero , whose films are both transgressive and subversive , will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored . 
 = Hermann Detzner = 
 Hermann Philipp Detzner ( 16 October 1882 – 1 December 1970 ) was an officer in the German colonial security force ( Schutztruppe ) in Kamerun ( Cameroon ) and German New Guinea , as well as a surveyor , an engineer , an adventurer , and a writer . 
 In early 1914 , the German government sent Detzner to explore and chart the interior of Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland , the imperial protectorate on the island of New Guinea . When World War I broke out in Europe , he was well into the interior and without radio contact . He refused to surrender to Australian troops when they occupied German New Guinea , concealing himself in the jungle with a band of approximately 20 soldiers . For four years , Detzner and his troops provocatively marched through the bush , singing " Watch on the Rhine " and flying the German Imperial flag . He led at least one expedition from the Huon Peninsula to the north coast , and a second by a mountain route , to attempt an escape to the neutral Dutch colony to the west . He explored areas of the New Guinean interior formerly unseen by Europeans and surrendered in full dress uniform , flying the Imperial flag , to Australian forces in January 1919 . 
 Detzner received a hero 's welcome when he returned to Germany . He wrote a book about his adventures — Four Years Among the Cannibals in the Interior of German New Guinea under the Imperial Flag , from 1914 until the Armistice — that achieved notoriety in Great Britain and Germany , entered three printings , and was translated into French , English , Finnish and Swedish . He received a position in the Imperial Colonial Archives , and appeared frequently on the lecture circuit throughout the 1920s . In the late 1920s , scientific portions of his book were discredited . In 1932 , he admitted that he had mixed fact and fiction and , after that time , eschewed public life . 
 = = Family = = 
 Detzner was the son of a dentist , Johann Philipp Detzner ( 12 July 1846 – 1907 ) and his wife , Wilhelmine Katharina Faber , in the city of Speyer , in the Bavarian Palatinate , a cultural , economic , and historical center on the Rhine River . His father received his degree from Heidelberg University and was licensed to practice by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1867 ; Detzner 's father pioneered innovations in dental prosthetics . His large family included nine children . Hermann Detzner was trained as a topographer , surveyor , and an engineer , and received his promotion to <unk> in the 6 Infantry Regiment ( Prussian ) , 2nd Pioneer Battalion , in February 1902 . During World War I , military authorities transferred his commission to the 1st Bavarian Pioneer Battalion . 
 = = Early explorations = = 
 Hermann Detzner participated in a joint British @-@ German scientific and surveying expedition to Kamerun in 1908 and 1909 and again in 1912 – 1913 . He and one Captain Nugent , Royal Artillery , identified and marked the frontiers of Kamerun and explored the Niger valley . Detzner later published a paper on the marking of the boundary . 
 Navigators charted the coastline of the northern and eastern portions of New Guinea in the early 17th century and , later in the century , British Admiralty navigators named the visible mountain ranges . Most German surveying efforts had focused on coastal regions and river basins , where Germans had established plantations , leaving the interior unexplored . In late 1913 , the Imperial Colonial office appointed Detzner to lead an expedition to survey the border between the British protectorate , called Papua , and the German territory , called Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland , and to survey and map the interior . 
 Detzner 's mission was also to be the first serious attempt to explore the unknown interior and to evaluate and describe its contents . The boundary between Papua and Kaiser Wilhelmsland had been broadly established by a joint British @-@ German expedition in 1909 , but the interior had not been mapped and the German colonial administration maintained that the boundary was imprecise . Since then , Papuan gold prospectors may have crossed into the German territory which , from the German perspective , made the accuracy of the border essential . Detzner had had experience in joint operations in Kamerun in 1907 – 08 and could be expected to understand the challenges faced by the previous commission ; he had a reputation as a methodical and precise engineer . Although small , he was tough and wiry , extremely focused and determined , and seemed like the right man for the job . 
 = = Adventures in New Guinea = = 
 In January 1914 , Detzner travelled to Rabaul on New Pomerania ( now New Britain ) . In February , he began his expedition into Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland . His survey immediately revealed inaccuracies in the 1909 joint survey ; by March , Detzner had concluded that the border corridor was already showing a discrepancy of more than 650 meters ( 2 @,@ 133 ft ) from the 8 ° <unk> parallel . The discrepancy increased the further west he traveled , revealing a widening wedge in the boundary as it was agreed upon , and as it was marked . The discrepancy favored German interests . 
 He was well into the interior when , on 4 August 1914 , Britain declared war on Germany . As World War I spread to the Pacific , Australian troops invaded German New Guinea , taking the German barracks in Herbertshöhe ( <unk> ) and forcing the defending German colonial troops to capitulate on 21 September after their defeat at Bita Paka . At the beginning of October , he was still unaware of the state of war that now existed between his country and the Commonwealth . 
 The several months following the outbreak of war found Detzner on border survey work with his sergeant , <unk> , 25 police and 45 carriers , two servants and an interpreter in the high country between Mt Chapman , the Ono River , and Mt Lawson , that is to say along the territorial boundary between Australian @-@ governed Papua and German New Guinea . Eventually he sighted people he named <unk> or " skirted Papuans ' - these were <unk> people perhaps in the area south of <unk> in the southernmost part of Morobe Province or the northern part of Gulf Province . On 11 November 1914 , one of the carriers , left with several others to rest at a temporary camp , arrived bearing a note from Frederick Chisholm , an Australian Patrol Officer , informing him of the state of war between Germany and Great Britain and requesting him to surrender at <unk> on the Lakekamu River , five days walk away . 
 = = = Four years in the unexplored interior of New Guinea = = = 
 Rather than comply , Detzner led his party , on a forced march north to the Markham Valley . His route is uncertain , but his description of a valley with steep grassy ravines entering from east and west may place the latter part of his journey in the <unk> Valley , through which flows a tributary of the Watut River . A clash with local people that he describes has been identified as having occurred at <unk> among with Middle Watut people . Once on the Watut itself , the party built rafts and floated downstream to the Markham . 
 His final destination was Sattelberg on the Huon peninsula . His second in command , Sergeant <unk> , who suffered from frequent bouts of malaria , and a German officer , were captured by the Australians by spring 1915 . Eventually , Detzner found his way to the vicinity of Lutheran mission at the Sattelberg , at a foggy , cool area at 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 625 ft ) , above Finschhafen . The Sattelberg mission was one of the <unk> Mission Society enterprises established by the Old Lutheran missionary , Johann <unk> , in 1885 . This station , and additional mission stations in <unk> , <unk> , Tami Islands , and <unk> , were an important evangelical presence in the Morobe Province . The missionaries had signed oaths of neutrality for the Australians , who allowed them to remain at their Stations and continue their work . 
 Once Detzner reached the vicinity of the Sattelberg Mission , nearby villagers in the <unk> valley housed him and his remaining men , which had dwindled to about 20 soldiers , plus four European officers and , on his behalf , the villagers sought assistance from the Sattelberg director , Christian Keyser , and another missionary , Otto Thiele . They reluctantly agreed to keep Detzner 's presence a secret . Among the villagers , Detzner established a base camp from which he could depart at short notice . The valley was relatively secure for him , and inaccessible for the Australians , but if they ventured too close to his base , Detzner and his men would retreat into the mountainous Saruwaged , or , if necessary , further into the Finisterre mountains . These were rugged and remote locations , accessible to Detzner , who had the help of native guides , but which the Australians , who usually traveled in larger patrols , could not penetrate . 
 Detzner and his band stayed near the Sattelberg Mission for the remainder of the war . After the war , however , Detzner would claim he had roamed throughout the eastern jungles of the island , eluding Australian patrols and making little effort to hide . He said he flew the Imperial German flag ( sewn from dyed <unk> ) in villages throughout the bush , and marched his command through the jungle , loudly singing such patriotic German songs as " Watch on the Rhine " ( Die Wacht am Rhein ) and popular sentimental ballads like " The Linden Tree " ( Der Lindenbaum ) . 
 = = = Escape attempts = = = 
 Detzner may have made attempts to reach West New Guinea , which was then neutral Dutch New Guinea , but his claims to have been the first outsider to enter the Papua New Guinea highlands can be discounted . In 1915 , and again in 1917 , Detzner and some of his men tried to escape along the coast in two canoes . In 1917 , they reached the vicinity of Friedrich @-@ Wilhelmshafen , which today is Madang . There lay anchored the Australian ship , HMAS Una , which earlier had been the German imperial yacht , the SMS Komet , designated for use by the German governor of the colony . The ship blocked any further travel , and ended any notions they had of a water escape to Dutch New Guinea . On this escape attempt , Detzner also learned the Australians had orders to shoot him on sight . He made one further attempt to escape overland to Dutch New Guinea , but had to be carried back suffering from an internal hemorrhage . He spent the remainder of the time investigating the island 's inhabitants and its flora and fauna , particularly in the Huon peninsula and Huon gulf .

 In late November 1918 , Detzner received the news of the end of the war from a worker at the Sattelberg Mission Station . He wrote a letter to the Australian commander in Morobe in which he offered his capitulation . On 5 January 1919 , he surrendered at the Finschhafen District headquarters , marching with his remaining German troops in a column , and wearing his carefully preserved full @-@ dress uniform . He was brought to Rabaul , the Australian headquarters , and on 8 February 1919 , was transferred to Sydney aboard the <unk> ; after a brief internment in the prisoner of war camp at Holsworthy , he was repatriated to Germany . 
 = = Book and honours = = 
 On his arrival home , Detzner received a hero 's welcome . The press likened him to the successful commander of German East Africa , Major General Paul Emil von Lettow @-@ Vorbeck , who tied down British forces in Africa for the duration of the war . Detzner had been promoted to the rank of captain during the war ; upon his return , he was promoted to major . In that year , he wrote Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland , nach dem Stande der <unk> im Jahre 1919 , ( Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland , According to the State of Research in the Year 1919 ) , which was widely read in scientific circles . The claim that the Geographical Society of Berlin honored him with the Nachtigal medal , named after the German explorer Gustav Nachtigal , in 1919 is false ; this misinformation may have been planted by Detzner himself . Nevertheless , the Geographic Society of Hamburg did award him their gold medal in 1921 , the University of Bonn granted him an honorary degree , and the military awarded him the Iron Cross ( 1st Class ) . He received a position in the colonial administration 's archive in Berlin . 
 To satisfy the public curiosity about his adventures , Detzner wrote Four Years among the Cannibals , from 1914 to the Armistice , under the German Flag , in the <unk> Interior of New Guinea . The book brought him fame in Germany and Britain , and he became a sought @-@ after speaker on the lecture circuit . In the 1920s , in addition to several articles and two maps of New Guinea , Detzner published a memoir of his adventures in the Niger valley — In the land of the Dju @-@ Dju : travel experiences in the eastern watershed of the Niger — in 1923 , but it did not achieve the popularity of his previous work . 
 = = = Book reception = = = 
 Detzner 's book was wildly popular among the general population for its incredible tales of stubborn patriotism and its narratives describing the exotic locales of the lost imperial colonies . His descriptions touched a chord in the German imagination : one of their own had explored the colony , walked its paths , seen its mountains and valleys , and met its people . His vivid descriptions brought to life the images Germans had seen on postcards ( such as the one to left ) , newspapers , and in school books . Furthermore , he had defended Germany 's " place in the sun " when others had failed to do so . His book was translated into English , Finnish , Swedish and eventually French . ( See below . ) 
 In a speech at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919 , Detzner claimed that the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian domination and resisted a military recruitment that amounted to slavery , that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia , and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans . The report on Detzner 's speech , transmitted from a news agency in London , caused a small flutter in Australian government circles , but generally was dismissed ; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans . An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source , who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914 – 1915 , received little attention . 
 In the scientific world , several of his descriptive passages generated excitement and curiosity . In early 1914 , he had been surveying a portion of the international boundary in the Upper <unk> River between the German and British protectorates . By late September , he had passed into a different portion of the highlands , where the clay @-@ slate mountains changed into limestone highlands . In this geologic transition , he said , he also found a change in the ethnographic character of the population , whom he described as a " new " people . They were stocky , powerfully built , and long – limbed ; they wore their hair in knots on the centre of their heads , which were otherwise shaven , and painted yellow and black lines across their chests . They also wore grass skirts , so he called them the skirted ones . They used bows and arrows , slings and stone axes . As he pushed west to Mount Joseph , Detzner claimed , he had found the southern hills of the central watershed cut by numerous rivers flowing north to south . He had surmised that there were no insurmountable obstacles between him and the Sepik river . In 1917 , he had travelled through the Ramu valley into the Bismarck range , northwest of the <unk> Mountains , and had continued on that route for 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) . He also described the presence of an indigenous variation of German , called <unk> ( our German ) , in several New Guinean dialects . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 In 1919 , after an account of Detzner 's speech in Berlin to the Geographical Society was published in Australia , an angry Australian wrote anonymously to the editor of The Argus , a Melbourne newspaper , and described what he claimed were Detzner 's lies . " There was no mystery about the disappearance of Captain Detzner and his party " , he claimed . The writer attributed Detzner 's success at staying ahead of the Australians to the perfidy of the German missionaries , who had agreed to remain neutral and in return for such agreement were allowed to continue their mission work . Detzner was a civilian [ emphasis in the original ] surveyor , the writer claimed , not a soldier and he survived on mission station rations supplied by public subscription from the German plantation owners . Furthermore , this writer asserted , Detzner 's movements were so well known to the district officer at Morobe that he was prevented from escaping ; they could have shot him several times , but did not . The writer dismissed Detzner 's claims about Australian recruitment of the natives as " in keeping with his dozens of other lying statements in all cases endeavoring to belittle Englishmen or British officers , in every case pure fabrications and typical scurrilous Hun lies " . 
 While such criticism of Detzner 's adventures might have been dismissed as post @-@ bellum <unk> , in 1929 , Detzner 's assertions came under more serious assault . Two of the German missionaries in the Finschhafen District , Christian Keyser ( also spelled Kayser or <unk> ) and Otto Thiele , claimed Detzner had not spent the war roaming the jungle , one step ahead of the Australians , but had been under the Mission 's protection the entire time . Keyser 's additional accusations were particularly specific : Detzner had appropriated his own scientific observations . Keyser 's claims carried some weight . He had published a dictionary of the <unk> language , and was a reliable expert on New Guinean dialects , and the German @-@ based creole languages that had arisen in New Guinea ; he was also a bona fide explorer and adventurer , having lived from 1899 to 1920 among the mountain peoples of the island . In 1913 , Keyser climbed the 4 @,@ 121 @-@ meter ( 13 @,@ 520 ft ) Saruwaged Massif ; over the course of his 21 years in New Guinea , he had identified hundreds of new plant and animal species , and had maintained a regular correspondence with the German Geographical Society in Berlin . Ernst Mayr , a rising star in ornithology , had heard about Detzner from Australians on a research trip to New Guinea . In Germany , during a meeting with Keyser , they discussed Detzner 's claims , and Mayr lost no time in broadcasting the discrepancy to his scientific contacts in Europe and the United States . 
 More problematically , Detzner had no documentation of his findings . As he explained in his many speeches , although he had kept notebooks with drawings of plants , animals , maps , and people , and journals recounting his day – to – day experiences , some of his notebooks and journals had been destroyed by the Australians as they over – ran his hiding places ; others , which he had buried to keep them from being destroyed , had rotted beyond repair in the jungle humidity . He implied that what remained of his notes had been confiscated when he surrendered . Detzner 's narrative also was rife with contradictions and omissions : Detzner named few villages or streams and stated that the valleys he discovered were thinly populated , whereas they actually contained large populations , at least by New Guinea standards . He also stated that the highest point in the range was 3 @,@ 600 meters ( 11 @,@ 800 ft ) , a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ meter ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) miscalculation , which , for a mapmaker and a surveyor , needed to be explained . 
 Detzner made attempts to explain away specific ambiguities , contradictions , and errors . In 1915 , he said , he lost his surveying instruments while eluding an Australian patrol , which explained why many of his assertions were vague and inconclusive , and his calculations inaccurate . This was true , the Australians did find a box of Detzner 's equipment in the location where the missionary Johann <unk> 's oldest son , Wilhelm , had kept ( or stored ) his small canoe . Although Wilhelm denied helping Detzner and his men , the Australians arrested him . The event coincided with one of Detzner 's narrow escapes from Australian patrols in 1915 and was inadvertently corroborated in 1919 by the angry letter to The Argus 's editor . Some of Detzner 's assertions could be sustained through observable physical evidence : he had reportedly wasted to a mere 40 kilograms ( 88 lb ) while roaming in the bush , which should not have happened , some supporters claimed , if he had indeed been under the protection of Keyser and Thiele . On the other hand , this weight loss could also have been due to his debilitating illness in 1917 . 
 Despite his explanations , the missionaries Thiele and Keyser , whose own autobiography appeared in 1929 , and the widely respected Mayr , who by this time had become the leader of the Whitney South Seas Expeditions , continued to challenge the bulk of Detzner 's scientific " discoveries " . Detzner 's position became increasingly untenable . In 1932 , he admitted that he had mixed fact and fiction in his book , explaining that he had never intended it to be taken as science , but rather at its face @-@ value , as the story of his adventurous years in the jungles of New Guinea . The following year , Detzner resigned from the prestigious Geographical Society of Berlin . 
 I wish to state that my book , Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen , contains a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea . The book in question is a scientific report in part only ; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany at the time of my return . Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all ; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts . 
 After this , he withdrew entirely from public life , although he retained his position in the colonial archive . He lived in <unk> , Berlin , on Auguste @-@ Viktoria @-@ Straße , and later became the director of the Carl @-@ Pfeffer Verlag , a publishing house in Heidelberg . He died there in 1970 , at the age of 88 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The ambiguous wording of Detzner 's resignation from the Geographical Society of Berlin — the use of such phrases as contains misrepresentations , scientific report in part only , primarily fictional , unusual circumstances in Germany , and so on — misled later scholars , many of whom remained unaware of the controversy surrounding his book . Consequently , his work continued to inform the geographical , linguistic , and anthropological investigations of New Guinean culture and geography well into the 1950s and 1960s , much to the dismay of Ernst Mayr , who had been instrumental in discrediting Detzner in the 1920s . 
 Since the mid – 1970s , references to Four Years Among the Cannibals have continued to appear in studies on New Guinea . In the 1990s , Detzner 's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays , who placed Detzner 's work in its contemporary context : Four Years Among the Cannibals , he wrote , " paved the way for me [ to become an ethnographer ] by creating romanticized images that served as a backdrop for more serious readings " . Since then , geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions : " Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his wonderful story ? The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him as one of the great figures in New Guinea history . " Detzner had remained at large for four years , as a fugitive in enemy @-@ held territory : surely , Linke concluded , this was an exceptional feat . No doubt the Australians could have made a more broadly organized attempt to capture him , and probably would have succeeded , but they did not make the effort ; they preferred instead the more convenient " shoot @-@ at @-@ sight " method . " It is impossible " , Linke wrote , " not to admire his [ Detzner 's ] sheer elan , his courage and tenacity . " In 2008 , Detzner 's book was retranslated , reprinted , and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.

 = Tudur Hen = 
 Tudur Hen ( English : Tudur the Elder ) or Tudur ap Goronwy ( died 11 October 1311 ) was a Welsh aristocrat and a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd , Anglesey , North Wales . He was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed who received lands from King Edward I of England . Nonetheless , he backed the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn , but afterwards swore allegiance to both Edward I and his son , Edward of Caernarfon . Tudur Hen was responsible for the restoration of the Franciscan friary at Bangor , Gwynedd , where his body was later placed on 11 October 1311 . 
 = = Ancestry and family = = 
 His father Goronwy ab Ednyfed ( <unk> ) was seneschal to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ( also known as Llywelyn the Last ) , the King of Gwynedd by 1258 , continuing in the role until his death on 12 October 1268 . In that role , Goronwy had followed in the footsteps of his father , Ednyfed Fychan , and by doing so had tied the fortunes of the early House of Tudor to that of Llywelyn . Goronwy led Llywelyn 's military forces , such as in February 1263 when he took them as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords . Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed , alongside Goronwy ab Goronwy ( also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan ) and Hywel ab Goronwy . Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur . He was preceded by his uncle , Tudur ab Ednyfed , who had been in service to the previous Prince of Wales , Dafydd ap Llywelyn . 
 = = Service to the English crown and rebellion = = 
 In September 1278 , lands were granted by King Edward I of England to Tudur and his brothers . The majority of the noble houses in Wales sided with the Welsh forces during the English invasion of Gwynedd , but Edward proclaimed that any who joined him would retain their lands and titles under the English crown . Tudur Hen retained his prestige and lands following the death of Llywelyn in 1282 and the victory of the English . Tudur and his brother Goronwy were two of those lords who backed the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn against the English in 1294 – 95 . Tudur acted as steward to Madog , while Goronwy was in his service . 
 Tudur and Goronwy were two of three men who witnessed the Madog 's charter , known as the <unk> Document , in 1294 which granted lands to <unk> and <unk> to Bleddyn Fychan . Following the failure of the revolt , Tudur was among those lords from North Wales who pledged their loyalty to Edward in person in 1296 , and again to Edward of Caernarfon when he was named Prince of Wales in 1301 . 
 Although Tudur Hen has been historically credited since the 18th century with the construction of the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor , Gwynedd , it has since been discovered that the building pre @-@ dated him . However , since the friary sided with Edward in the two Welsh wars since the original construction , it has been proposed that Tudur had been responsible for re @-@ building the site around 1293 following damage inflicted during that period . He made arrangements for his own interment in the south wall of the site . 
 He acted as an official representative for the English Royal Family in the <unk> territories . Tudur used the English property laws , which he found more advantageous in his position than those used by the Welsh as they allowed for inheritance of lands by a single party . He continued to hold the lands in North Wales and Cardiganshire which he had inherited . Upon his death in 1311 , his holdings passed into the hands of his son Goronwy ap Tudur Hen . He had two further sons , Madog and Hywel . Tudur Hen was take for internment to Bangor priory on 11 October 1311 ; his son , Goronwy , was also placed there on 11 December 1331 following his death . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 One of the earliest works by bard Iolo Goch was based on Tudur Hen , as Iolo may have studied at the Bangor priory . Tudur Hen 's most significant legacy was his name itself . The naming practice of the time in Wales was to attach the father 's surname to the new first name , hence his son being named Goronwy ap Tudur Hen . Goronwy had children , one of which was named Tudur , becoming a second Tudur ap Goronwy . The younger Tudur was noticed by King Edward III of England and was made a knight in his service , and he was the grandfather ( through Maredudd ap Tudur ) to Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur . Owain anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor , and was the grandfather of King Henry VII of England , the founder of the Royal House of Tudor .

 = Barzillai J. Chambers = 
 Barzillai Jefferson Chambers ( December 5 , 1817 – September 16 , 1895 ) was an American surveyor , lawyer , and politician of the Gilded Age . Born in Kentucky , he moved to Texas to join that state 's war for independence against Mexico . Chambers stayed in Texas after its independence and annexation by the United States , earning a living as a surveyor and farmer in Johnson County . In the American Civil War , he served briefly in the Confederate army , then returned to his farming and business interests , becoming part @-@ owner of a bank in his hometown of Cleburne . In the 1870s , Chambers became concerned with farming and monetary issues in politics , eventually joining the nascent Greenback Party in 1877 . He ran unsuccessfully for Vice President on the Greenback ticket with presidential nominee James B. Weaver of Iowa in 1880 . The Greenback nominees finished in a distant third place , receiving only 3 @.@ 3 % of the popular vote and no electoral votes . After the election , Chambers remained active in Greenback politics in Texas until the party 's demise in the late 1880s . He died at his home in Cleburne in 1895 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Barzillai Jefferson Chambers was born in 1817 in Montgomery County , Kentucky , the son of Walker Chambers and Talitha Cumi <unk> Chambers . Chambers lived on his father 's Kentucky farm for the first twenty years of his life . In 1837 , he followed his uncle , Thomas Jefferson Chambers , to Texas . The elder Chambers , who had lived in Texas since 1830 , had raised a regiment to join the Texas Revolution and commissioned his nephew as a captain and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp . After helping his uncle to recruit soldiers in Kentucky , the two departed for Texas but arrived too late to see action . Chambers was discharged from the Texas army in 1838 and remained in the state , becoming a surveyor in the southern part of the state . The next year , he was appointed deputy surveyor for north central Texas , between the Brazos and Trinity rivers . The area had little white settlement at the time , and Chambers " narrowly escaped Indian attacks on several occasions . " 
 Chambers continued to work as a surveyor in the 1840s while also engaging in land speculation . By 1850 , he was promoted to district surveyor ; he had , by then , acquired 10 @,@ 000 acres of land in Navarro and Johnson counties . He devoted some of the land to farming , but also donated some lots to Johnson County for the erection of the county seat , in Cleburne . He became a lawyer in 1860 , but never developed a sizable law practice . Chambers married three times : first in 1852 to Susan Wood , who died the next year ; secondly in 1854 to Emma Montgomery , who died in childbirth the next year ; and finally in 1861 to Harriet <unk> . Chambers had no children who survived infancy with the first two wives , but with his third wife he would have three children : Mary , Patrick , and Isabella . 
 = = Business and political career = = 
 After the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States in 1860 , Chambers , a Democrat , served on two committees in Navarro County that drafted resolutions opposed to Lincoln and racial equality . He supported Texas 's secession from the Union in 1861 and adhesion to the newly formed Confederacy , but , being 44 years old at the subsequent outbreak of the Civil War , did not immediately enlist . Although he was exempted from the Confederacy 's military draft , Chambers thought the exemption unjust , and wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis to protest it . In 1864 , he did enlist for six months in the 1st Regiment of Texas State Troops , but saw no action . After the war , Chambers returned to farming but also became a half @-@ owner of Cleburne 's only bank from 1871 to 1875 . By that time , Chambers was the largest landowner in Johnson County . He also actively promoted the Dallas and Cleburne Railroad , working unsuccessfully to get the railroad to make its stock available to all local citizens . 
 Chambers 's political opinions after the war were at first concerned with government debt . In an 1868 article in the Cleburne Chronicle , Chambers argued against all interest @-@ bearing national debts , and for a general policy of <unk> . Running as a Democrat , he was elected an alderman of Cleburne and was a delegate to Texas 's constitutional convention of 1875 . The proposed constitution that emerged was primarily an attempt to reverse the changes made by Republicans during Reconstruction . Chambers opposed its adoption , not for that reason , but because " while taxation was unequally thrown upon property alone , unqualified suffrage was given to every man " . He also opposed the homestead exemption , " which protect [ s ] the debtor class from the just demands of the creditor class . " Nevertheless , the constitution was adopted by a two @-@ to @-@ one majority . 
 = = Greenback party = = 
 When the Democratic Party 's platform did not endorse his <unk> views in 1876 , Chambers quit the party . The new Greenback Party ( sometimes called the Greenback @-@ Labor Party , ) had not yet begun to organize in Texas , but its positions better suited Chambers and he joined in 1877 . The Greenbackers , in the words of one author , " anticipated by almost fifty years the progressive legislation of the first quarter of the twentieth century . " Their platform advocated an eight @-@ hour work day , safety regulations in factories , and prohibition of child labor . Their most prominent position , however , and the one from which their name was derived , was support for the continued issuance of the greenback dollar . 
 During the Civil War , Congress had authorized " greenbacks , " a new form of fiat money that was redeemable not in gold but in government bonds . The greenbacks had helped to finance the war when the government 's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies . When the crisis had passed , many in both parties , especially in the East , wanted to return the nation 's currency to a gold standard as soon as possible . The Specie Payment Resumption Act , passed in 1875 , ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold @-@ backed currency beginning in 1879 . At the same time , economic depression had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable . Farmers and laborers , especially , clamored for the return of coinage in both gold and silver , believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values . With neither major party willing to endorse inflation , some partisans of loose money joined the new Greenback faction . 
 Chambers rose quickly in the new party 's leadership , serving as a delegate to their state convention in July 1878 . Initially a candidate for state land commissioner , Chambers withdrew his name in August of that year to allow former Republican Jacob <unk> to win a unanimous nomination ; he was nominated instead for a seat in the state legislature . Ten Greenbackers were elected to the legislature that year , but Chambers was not among them . During the campaign , Chambers published a pamphlet attacking the Democratic candidates and calling for Congress to create " a sufficient amount of paper money , making it equal to gold and silver , and full legal tender for all debts " . While it did not help his own election , the pamphlet was widely circulated within the party and raised Chambers 's profile among Greenbackers . 
 = = 1880 election = = 
 By 1879 , the Greenback coalition had splintered , and Chambers became affiliated with the faction most prominent in the South and West , called the " Union Greenback Labor Party , " led by Marcus M. " Brick " Pomeroy . Pomeroy 's faction was more radical and emphasized its independence , suggesting that Eastern Greenbackers were likely to " sell out the party at any time to the Democrats . " Chambers was chosen as a delegate to the Pomeroy faction 's 1880 national convention in St. Louis . The 212 delegates nominated Stephen D. Dillaye of New York for President and Chambers for Vice President . Accepting the nomination , Chambers called for unity between the Greenback factions and restated his belief in the party 's goals , and attacked bankers as " Huns and Vandals . " To further promote his views , he purchased a small newspaper , the Cleburne Avalanche , and spoke at the state convention in Texas in May 1880 . 
 The more Eastern @-@ oriented faction of the Greenbacks , called the " National Greenback Party , " held its convention in Chicago that June , and Chambers attended along with others from the Pomeroy faction , hoping to heal the party split . The two factions resolved their differences and wrote a joint platform . The Greenbackers also agreed to admit forty @-@ four delegates of the Socialist Labor Party . Dillaye stepped aside to allow the nomination of James B. Weaver of Iowa , a Civil War general and Congressman . Chambers was proposed for Vice President by the reunited party , as was Absolom M. West of Mississippi ; Chambers was victorious on the first ballot , by 403 votes to 311 . West moved that the nomination be made unanimous , which it was . 
 Chambers gave speeches on his way back to Texas , castigating the banks and defending the admission of socialists to the convention as " simply a body of men enlisted in the cause of human rights . " In his official acceptance letter , he called for expansion of the currency , immigration restriction to help workingmen compete " with Chinese serf labor , " and the forfeiture of all unfulfilled railroad grants . On July 8 , before reaching home , Chambers fell as he exited his train in <unk> , Texas , and broke two ribs . He was confined to bed for several weeks and considered withdrawing from the race , but decided against it . His efforts , however , were limited by his injuries , and his only contribution to the campaign was to publish his newspaper , renamed the Cleburne Greenbacker . Greenbackers had high hopes for the 1880 election , but were disappointed with the result : Weaver and Chambers won just over 300 @,@ 000 votes ( 3 @.@ 3 % of the popular vote ) and did not carry a single state in the electoral college . 
 = = Post @-@ election life = = 
 Chambers remained active in politics after the 1880 election . He served as chairman of the Texas Greenback Party in 1882 as George Washington Jones received the party 's endorsement for governor . He was unsuccessful , and Chambers worried that the party was becoming " disorganized and disintegrated beyond the hope of a successful rally . " In 1884 , Jones ran again for governor and Chambers broke with him on the question of whether the state should lease public lands or let cattlemen use them without payment ( Chambers favored the former option ) . He also criticized the party 's presidential nominee that year , Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts , for attacking monopolies without offering any suggestions on how to reform them . After the 1884 election , Chambers had little involvement in politics . The Greenback Party fell apart by 1888 , but many of its ideas and members found a home in the People 's Party , which arose in the early 1890s . Chambers made his last foray into politics in 1890 in two letters to the Southern Mercury , a newspaper of the Farmers ' Alliance , in which he again condemned monopolies and corporations , and suggested that all laws creating them be repealed . He was encouraged by the growth of the People 's Party , but old age and ill health kept him from being an active member . Chambers died at his home on September 16 , 1895 , and was buried in Cleburne Memorial Cemetery . 
 = European hare = 
 The European hare ( Lepus europaeus ) , also known as the brown hare , is a species of hare native to Europe and parts of Western Asia and Central Asia . It is a mammal adapted to temperate , open country . It is related to and looks very similar to the European rabbit , which is in the same family but in a different genus . Hares are larger than the European rabbit , have longer ears and hind legs and breed on the ground rather than in a burrow . They rely on speed to escape from predators . 
 Generally nocturnal and shy in nature , hares change their behaviour in the spring , when they can be seen in broad daylight chasing one another around fields and meadows . During this spring frenzy , they can be seen striking one another with their paws ( " boxing " ) . For a long time , this had been thought to be competition between males , but closer observation has revealed it is usually a female hitting a male , either to show she is not yet ready to mate or as a test of his determination . This species has a fairly long breeding season which lasts from January to August . Hares are herbivorous and feed on grasses , herbs , twigs , buds , bark and field crops . Their natural predators include birds of prey , canids and felids . 
 The European hare is listed as being of Least Concern by the IUCN . However it is declining in mainland Europe because of changes in farming practices . The hare has been a traditional symbol of fertility and reproduction in some cultures , and its courtship behaviour in the spring inspired the English idiom mad as a March hare . 
 = = Taxonomy and genetics = = 
 The European hare was first described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1778 . It shares the genus Lepus with other hares and jackrabbits . These animals are distinguished from other leporids by their longer legs , wider nostrils and precocial young . The former two are adaptations for long distance running . Historically , up to 30 subspecies of European hare have been classified , although their status has been variable . These subspecies have been distinguished by differences in pelage colouration , body size , external body measurements , and skull and tooth shape . The Corsican hare , Broom hare and Granada hare were at some points considered to be subspecies of the European hare , however DNA sequencing and morphological analysis has supported them as separate species . 
 There is some debate as to whether the European hare and Cape hare are the same species . A 2005 nuclear gene pool study supported this position . However , a 2006 study of the mtDNA of these same animals concluded they had diverged enough to be considered separate species . A 2008 study claims that in the case of Lepus hares , with their rapid evolution , species designation cannot be based solely on mtDNA but should also include an examination of the nuclear gene pool . It is possible that the genetic differences between the European and Cape hare is due to geographic distance rather than actual divergence . It has been speculated that in the Near East , hare populations are intergrading and experiencing gene flow . Another 2008 study suggests that more research is needed before a conclusion is reached as to whether there is a species complex . As of 2008 , the European hare remains classified as a single species until further data shows otherwise . 
 There appears to be genetic diversity in the European hare in the North Rhine @-@ Westphalia region of Germany . However , it is possible that restricted gene flow could change this within populations that become isolated . Based on molecular phylogenetic studies , the <unk> population in Spain has unique mtDNA in relation to other European populations . 
 = = Description = = 
 The European hare is one of the largest living members of Lagomorpha . Its head and body length can range from 48 to 75 cm ( 19 to 30 in ) with a tail length of 7 to 13 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 to 5 @.@ 1 in ) . The body mass can range from 2 @.@ 5 to 7 kg ( 5 @.@ 5 to 15 @.@ 4 lb ) . As with all leporids , the hare has elongated ears which , in this species , ranges from 9 @.@ 4 to 11 @.@ 0 cm ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 3 in ) from the notch . It also has long hind feet that have a length from 14 to 16 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 3 in ) . The fur colour is grizzled yellow @-@ brown on the back ; rufous on the shoulders , legs , neck and throat ; white on the underside and black on the tail and ear tips . The European hare ’ s fur does not turn completely white in the winter , although the sides of the head and base of the ears do develop white areas . The limb musculature of hares is adapted for high @-@ speed endurance running in open areas . By contrast , cottontail rabbits are built for short bursts of speed in more covered habitats . 
 = = Range and habitat = = 
 European hares are native to much of continental Europe . Their range extends from northern Spain to southern Scandinavia , eastern Europe and northern parts of the Middle East and Central Asia . They have been extending their range into Siberia . They may have been introduced to Britain by the Romans . They have also been introduced , mostly as game animals , to North America ( in Ontario and New York State , and unsuccessfully in Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , and Connecticut ) , Brazil , Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay , Bolivia , Peru , the Falkland Islands , Australia , both islands of New Zealand and the south Pacific coast of Russia . 
 Hares primarily live in open fields with scattered brush for shelter . They are very adaptable and thrive in mixed farmland . According to a study done in the Czech Republic , the mean hare densities were highest at altitudes below 200 metres ( 660 ft ) , 40 to 60 days of annual snow cover , 450 to 700 millimetres ( 18 to 28 in ) of annual precipitation , and a mean annual air temperature of around 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . With regards to climate the study found that hare densities were highest in : " A warm and dry district with mild winter and longer duration of sunshine ; a warm and dry district with mild winter and shorter duration of sunshine ; a warm and moderately dry district with mild winter " . 
 In the United Kingdom , hares are seen most frequently on arable farms , especially those with fallow land , wheat and sugar beet crops . In mainly grass farms their numbers are raised when there are improved pastures , some arable crops and patches of woodland . They are seen less frequently where foxes are abundant or where there are many buzzards . They also seem to be fewer in number in areas with high rabbit populations . Although they are shot as game when they are plentiful , this is a self @-@ limiting activity and is less likely to occur in localities where they are scarce . 
 = = Behaviour and life history = = 
 Hares are primarily nocturnal and spend a third of their time foraging . During daytime , a hare will hide in a depression called a " form " where it is partially hidden . Hares can run at 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) and when confronted by predators they rely on outrunning them in the open . Hares may be preyed on by canids , felids and birds of prey . They are generally thought of as asocial but can be seen in both large and small groups . They do not appear to be territorial , living in shared home ranges of around 300 ha ( 740 acres ) . Hares communicate with each other by a variety of visual signals . To show interest they raise their ears , while lowering the ears warns others to keep away . When challenging a conspecific , a hare will thump its front feet ; the hind feet are used to warn others of a predator . A hare will squeal when hurt or scared and a female will make " guttural " calls to attract her young . 
 = = = Food and foraging = = = 
 European hares are primarily herbivorous . During the summer , they eat grasses , herbs and field crops . Their preference is for wild grasses and weeds but with the intensification of agriculture , they have taken to feeding on crops . During the winter , they eat herbage , twigs , buds and the bark of shrubs and young fruit trees . They have been known to eat their own green , pellet feces to recover proteins and vitamins . Two to three adult hares can eat more food than a single sheep . 
 European hares forage in groups . Group feeding is beneficial as individuals can spend more time feeding knowing that other hares are being vigilant . Nevertheless , the distribution of food affects these benefits . When food is well @-@ spaced , all hares are able to access it . When food is clumped together , only dominant hares can access it . In small gatherings , dominants are more successful in defending food , but as more individuals join in , they must spend more time driving off others . The larger the group , the less time dominant individuals have in which to eat . Meanwhile , the subordinates can access the food while the dominants are distracted . As such , when in groups , all individuals fare worse when food is clumped as opposed to when it is widely spaced . 
 = = = Mating and reproduction = = = 
 European hares have a prolonged breeding season which lasts from January to August . Sexual maturity occurs at seven or eight months for females and six months for males . Females , or does , can be found pregnant in all breeding months and males , or bucks , are fertile all year round except during October and November . After autumn , the resting period for breeding activity , the size and activity of the males ' testes increase , signalling the start of a new reproductive cycle . This continues through December , January and February and the reproductive tract gains back its functionality . Matings start before ovulation with the first pregnancies containing one foetus and pregnancy failures being common . Full reproductive activity begins in March and April , when all the females may become pregnant , the majority with three or more foetuses . 
 Females have six @-@ weekly reproductive cycles and are receptive for only a few hours in one day . Thus competition among local bucks is intense . This phenomenon is known as " March madness " as it observed in March as the nights , the bucks ' preferred time for activity , are shorter and thus forces them to be active in the daytime . In addition to dominants subduing subordinates , the female will fight off her numerous suitors if she is not ready to mate . Fights can be vicious and can leave numerous scars on the ears . Hares will stand upright and attack each other with their paws , a practice known as " boxing " , and this activity is usually between a female and a male and not between males as previously believed . When a doe is ready to mate , she will run across the countryside , starting a chase that will test the fitness of the following males . When only the most dominant male remains , the female will stop and allow copulation . 
 Female fertility continues through May , June and July , however testosterone production decreases in males and sexual behaviour becomes less overt . Litter sizes decrease as the breeding season draws to a close with no pregnancies occurring after August . The testes of males begin to regress and sperm production ends in September . Does give birth in hollow depressions in the ground . An individual female may have three litters in a year with a 41 to 42 day gestation period . The young weigh about 100 grams ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) at birth . The <unk> ( young hares ) are fully furred and are precocial , being ready to leave the nest as soon as they are born , an adaption to the lack of physical protection relative to that afforded by a burrow . A mother will visit the nest to nurse the <unk> for five minutes a day . Young can eat solid food after two weeks and are weaned when they are four weeks old . Hares can live for as long as twelve years .

 The European hare is listed as being of Least Concern by the IUCN as it is considered to be wide @-@ ranging and moderately abundant throughout its geographic distribution . However , population declines have occurred since the 1960s and have possibly been caused by the intensification of agricultural practices . In low population densities , hare are vulnerable to local extinctions . The Bern Convention lists the hare under Appendix III as a protected species . Several countries have placed the species on their Red List as " near threatened " or " threatened " . The hare is considered a pest in some areas and is known to damage crops . They are also hunted as game animals . Additional threats to the hare are the diseases European brown hare syndrome , <unk> , <unk> ( pseudo @-@ tuberculosis ) , <unk> and <unk> , which are the principal sources of mortality . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 In Anglo @-@ Saxon paganism , the hare is associated with reproduction and fertility and is a symbol for the spring goddess <unk> . Its connection with Easter eggs was based on a misconception by the Europeans that lapwings laid their eggs in the homes of hares . Germanic cultures noticed the high activity of hares during the spring and it was believed that their " mating dance " helped the earth grow . This observation would also lead to the popular English idiom mad as a March hare . The hare is a character in some fables , such as The Tortoise and the Hare of Aesop . It also appears in Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll , in which Alice participates in a crazy tea party with the March Hare and the Mad Hatter . 
 = Osteitis fibrosa cystica = 
 Osteitis fibrosa cystica / <unk> <unk> <unk> / , abbreviated OFC , also known as <unk> fibrosa , <unk> fibrosa , and Von Recklinghausen 's disease of bone ( not to be confused with Von Recklinghausen 's disease , neurofibromatosis type I ) , is a skeletal disorder caused by hyperparathyroidism , which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over @-@ active parathyroid glands . This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts , cells that break down bone , in a process known as <unk> bone resorption . The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma , hereditary factors , parathyroid carcinoma , or renal osteodystrophy . <unk> bone resorption releases minerals , including calcium , from the bone into the bloodstream . In addition to elevated blood calcium levels , over @-@ activity of this process results in a loss of bone mass , a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue ( <unk> fibrosis ) , and the formation of cyst @-@ like brown tumors in and around the bone . The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood , and include bone fractures , kidney stones , nausea , moth @-@ eaten appearance in the bones , appetite loss , and weight loss . 
 First described in the nineteenth century , OFC is currently detected through a combination of blood testing , X @-@ rays , and tissue sampling . Before 1950 , around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC , but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods , instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare . Where treatment is required , it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long @-@ term treatment for OFC — depending on its cause and severity , this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Osteitis fibrosa cystica is defined as the classic skeletal manifestation of advanced hyperparathyroidism . Under the ICD @-@ 10 classification system , established by the World Health Organization , OFC is listed under category <unk> , primary hyperparathyroidism . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The major symptoms of OFC are bone pain or tenderness , bone fractures , and skeletal deformities such as bowing of the bones . The underlying hyperparathyroidism may cause kidney stones , nausea , constipation , fatigue and weakness . X @-@ rays may indicate thin bones , fractures , bowing , and cysts . Fractures are most commonly localized in the arms , legs , or spine . 
 The addition of weight loss , appetite loss , vomiting , polyuria , and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms may indicate that OFC is the result of parathyroid carcinoma . Parathyroid carcinoma , an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands , is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual , even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with . Symptoms are also often more severe . Generally , the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer , occurring in approximately 50 % of sufferers , but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Osteitis fibrosa cystica is the result of unchecked hyperparathyroidism , or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands , which results in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood , and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney . Thus , excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels , or hypercalcemia . There are four major causes of primary hyperparathyroidism that result in OFC : 
 Parathyroid <unk> 
 The vast majority of cases of hyperparathyroidism are the result of the random formation of benign , but metabolically active , parathyroid adenoma swellings . These instances comprise approximately 80 – 85 % of all documented cases of hyperparathyroidism . 
 Hereditary factors 
 Approximately 1 in 10 documented cases of hyperparathyroidism are a result of hereditary factors . Disorders such as familial hyperparathyroidism , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( MEN Type 1 ) and hyperparathyroidism @-@ jaw tumor syndrome can , if left unchecked , result in OFC . MEN Type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder and the most common hereditary form of hyperparathyroidism , affecting about 95 % of genetic cases of OFC , and also tends to affect younger patients than other forms . Major mutations which can lead to hyperparathyroidism generally involve the parathyroid hormone receptor , G proteins , or adenylate cyclase . Certain genetic mutations have been linked to a higher rate of parathyroid carcinoma occurrence , specifically mutations to the gene <unk> , which codes for the protein <unk> . 
 Parathyroid carcinoma 
 Parathyroid carcinoma ( cancer of the parathyroid gland ) is the rarest cause of OFC , accounting for about 0 @.@ 5 % of all cases of hyperparathyroidism . OFC onset by parathyroid carcinoma is difficult to diagnose . 
 Renal complications 
 OFC is a common presentation of renal osteodystrophy , which is a term used to refer to the skeletal complications of end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . OFC occurs in approximately 50 % of patients with ESRD . ESRD occurs when the kidneys fail to produce calcitriol , a form of Vitamin D , which assists in the absorption of calcium into the bones . When calcitriol levels decrease , parathyroid hormone levels increase , halting the storage of calcium , and instead triggering its removal from the bones . The concept of renal osteodystrophy is currently included into the broader term chronic kidney disease @-@ mineral and bone disorder ( CKD @-@ <unk> ) . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 The effects of OFC on bone are largely dependent on the duration of the disease and the level of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) produced . PTH is responsible for maintaining a homeostatic calcium concentration in the blood . It activates the parathyroid @-@ hormone related protein receptor located on osteoblasts and osteocytes , both of which are responsible for the building and calcification of bone . Abnormalities affecting the parathyroid glands cause a surplus of PTH , which , in turn , increases the activity and frequency of osteoblasts and osteocytes . Increased PTH levels trigger the release of stored calcium through the dissolution of old bone , as well as the conservation of serum calcium through a cessation in the production of new bone . 
 Generally , the first bones to be affected are the fingers , facial bones , ribs , and pelvis . Long bones , which are longer than they are wide , are also among the first affected . As the disease progresses , any bone may be affected . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 OFC may be diagnosed using a variety of techniques . Muscles in patients afflicted with OFC can either appear unaffected or " bulked up . " If muscular symptoms appear upon the onset of hyperparathyroidism , they are generally sluggish contraction and relaxation of the muscles . Deviation of the trachea ( a condition in which the trachea shifts from its position at the midline of the neck ) , in conjunction with other known symptoms of OFC can point to a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma . 
 Blood tests on patients with OFC generally show high levels of calcium ( normal levels are considered to range between 8 @.@ 5 and 10 @.@ 2 mg / dL , parathyroid hormone ( levels generally above 250 pg / mL , as opposed to the " normal " upper @-@ range value of 65 pg / mL ) , and alkaline phosphatase ( normal range is 20 to 140 IU / L ) . 
 X @-@ rays may also be used to diagnose the disease . Usually , these X @-@ rays will show extremely thin bones , which are often bowed or fractured . However , such symptoms are also associated with other bone diseases , such as osteopenia or osteoporosis . Generally , the first bones to show symptoms via X @-@ ray are the fingers . Furthermore , brown tumors , especially when manifested on facial bones , can be misdiagnosed as cancerous . Radiographs distinctly show bone resorption and X @-@ rays of the skull may depict an image often described as " ground glass " or " salt and pepper " . Dental X @-@ rays may also be abnormal . 
 Cysts may be lined by osteoclasts and sometimes blood pigments , which lend to the notion of " brown tumors . " Such cysts can be identified with nuclear imaging combined with specific tracers , such as <unk> . Identification of muscular degeneration or lack of reflex can occur through clinical testing of deep tendon reflexes , or via <unk> ( an achilles tendon reflex test ) . 
 Fine needle aspiration ( <unk> ) can be used to biopsy bone lesions , once found on an X @-@ ray or other scan . Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery . Conversely , <unk> biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful , as the needle can puncture the tumor , leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells . 
 The brown tumors commonly associated with OFC display many of the same characteristics of osteoclasts . These cells are characteristically benign , feature a dense , granular cytoplasm , and a nucleus that tends to be ovular in shape , enclosing comparatively fine chromatin . <unk> also tend to be smaller than average . 
 = = Management = = 
 = = = Medical = = = 
 Medical management of OFC consists of Vitamin D treatment , generally <unk> or calcitriol , delivered intravenously . Studies have shown that in cases of OFC caused by either end @-@ stage renal disease or primary hyperparathyoidism , this method is successful not only in treating underlying hyperparathyoidism , but also in causing the regression of brown tumors and other symptoms of OFC . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 In especially severe cases of OFC , parathyroidectomy , or the full removal of the parathyroid glands , is the chosen route of treatment . <unk> has been shown to result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors . In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present , surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC . 
 Bone transplants have proven successful in filling the lesions caused by OFC . A report showed that in 8 out of 11 instances where cavities caused by OFC were filled with transplanted bone , the lesion healed and the transplanted bone blended rapidly and seamlessly with the original bone . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Almost all who undergo parathyroidectomy experience increased bone density and repair of the skeleton within weeks . Additionally , patients with OFC who have undergone parathyroidectomy begin to show regression of brown tumors within six months . Following parathyroidectomy , hypocalcaemia is common . This results from a combination of suppressed parathyroid glands due to prolonged <unk> , as well as the need for calcium and phosphate in the mineralization of new bone . 
 Thirty percent of patients with OFC caused by parathyroid carcinoma who undergo surgery see a local recurrence of symptoms . The post @-@ surgical survival rate hovers around seven years , while patients who do not undergo surgery have a survival rate of around five years . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Osteitis fibrosa cystica has long been a rare disease . Today , it appears in only 2 % of individuals diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism , which accounts for 90 % of instances of the disease . Primary hyperparathyroidism is three times as common in individuals with diabetes mellitus . 
 The hospitalization rate for hyperparathyroidism in the United States in 1999 was 8 @.@ 0 out of 100 @,@ 000 . The disease has a definite tendency to affect younger individuals , typically appearing before the age of 40 , with a study in 1922 reporting that 70 % of cases display symptoms before the age of 20 , and 85 % before 35 . Primary hyperparathyoidism , as well as OFC , is more common in Asiatic countries . Before treatment for hyperparathyroidism improved in the 1950s , half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism saw it progress into OFC .
