 Most stations are sited within a few kilometres of a suitable grid connection point . This network needs to be capable of absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity . The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection ; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid , so it can accommodate the output from the plant . 
 = = = Operation and maintenance = = = 
 Once the solar park has been commissioned , the owner usually enters into a contract with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance ( O & M ) . In many cases this may be fulfilled by the original EPC contractor . 
 Solar plants ' reliable solid @-@ state systems require minimal maintenance , compared to rotating machinery for example . A major aspect of the O & M contract will be continuous monitoring of the performance of the plant and all of its primary subsystems , which is normally undertaken remotely . This enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually experienced . It also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance . A small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter or <unk> for each solar panel , which provide individual performance data that can be monitored . For other solar farms , thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non @-@ performing panels for replacement . 
 = = = Power delivery = = = 
 A solar park 's income derives from the sales of electricity to the grid , and so its output is metered in real @-@ time with readings of its energy output provided , typically on a half @-@ hourly basis , for balancing and settlement within the electricity market . 
 Income is affected by the reliability of equipment within the plant and also by the availability of the grid network to which it is exporting . Some connection contracts allow the transmission system operator to constrain the output of a solar park , for example at times of low demand or high availability of other generators . Some countries make statutory provision for priority access to the grid for renewable generators , such as that under the European Renewable Energy Directive . 
 = = Economics and Finance = = 
 In recent years , PV technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency , reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time ( <unk> ) , and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets by 2014 . Photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power . However , prices for PV systems show strong regional variations , much more than solar cells and panels , which tend to be global commodities . In 2013 , utility @-@ scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as China and Germany were significantly lower ( $ 1 @.@ 40 / W ) than in the United States ( $ 3 @.@ 30 / W ) . The IEA explains these discrepancies due to differences in " soft costs " , which include customer acquisition , permitting , inspection and interconnection , installation labor and financing costs . 
 = = = Grid parity = = = 
 Solar generating stations have become progressively cheaper in recent years , and this trend is expected to continue . Meanwhile , traditional electricity generation is becoming progressively more expensive . These trends are expected to lead to a crossover point when the levelised cost of energy from solar parks , historically more expensive , matches the cost of traditional electricity generation . This point is commonly referred to as grid parity . 
 For merchant solar power stations , where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network , the levelised cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price . This point is sometimes called ' wholesale grid parity ' or ' busbar parity ' . 
 Some photovoltaic systems , such as rooftop installations , can supply power directly to an electricity user . In these cases , the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption . This situation is sometimes called ' retail grid parity ' , ' socket parity ' or ' dynamic grid parity ' . Research carried out by UN @-@ Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices , such as Italy , Spain and Australia , and areas using diesel generators , have reached retail grid parity . 
 = = = Incentive mechanisms = = = 
 Because the point of grid parity has not yet been reached in many parts of the world , solar generating stations need some form of financial incentive to compete for the supply of electricity . Many legislatures around the world have introduced such incentives to support the deployment of solar power stations . 
 = = = = Feed @-@ in tariffs = = = = 
 Feed in tariffs are designated prices which must be paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid . These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project . 
 = = = = Renewable portfolio standards and supplier obligations = = = = 
 These standards are obligations on utility companies to source a proportion of their electricity from renewable generators . In most cases , they do not prescribe which technology should be used and the utility is free to select the most appropriate renewable sources . 
 There are some exceptions where solar technologies are allocated a proportion of the RPS in what is sometimes referred to as a ' solar set aside ' . 
 = = = = Loan guarantees and other capital incentives = = = = 
 Some countries and states adopt less targeted financial incentives , available for a wide range of infrastructure investment , such as the US Department of Energy loan guarantee scheme , which stimulated a number of investments in the solar power plant in 2010 and 2011 . 
 = = = = Tax credits and other fiscal incentives = = = = 
 Another form of indirect incentive which has been used to stimulate investment in solar power plant was tax credits available to investors . In some cases the credits were linked to the energy produced by the installations , such as the Production Tax Credits . In other cases the credits were related to the capital investment such as the Investment Tax Credits 
 = = = = International , national and regional programmes = = = = 
 In addition to free market commercial incentives , some countries and regions have specific programs to support the deployment of solar energy installations . 
 The European Union 's Renewables Directive sets targets for increasing levels of deployment of renewable energy in all member states . Each has been required to develop a National Renewable Energy Action Plan showing how these targets would be met , and many of these have specific support measures for solar energy deployment . The directive also allows states to develop projects outside their national boundaries , and this may lead to bilateral programs such as the Helios project . 
 The Clean Development Mechanism of the UNFCCC is an international programme under which solar generating stations in certain qualifying countries can be supported . 
 Additionally many other countries have specific solar energy development programmes . Some examples are India 's <unk> , the Flagship Program in Australia , and similar projects in South Africa and Israel . 
 = = = Financial performance = = = 
 The financial performance of the solar power plant is a function of its income and its costs . 
 The electrical output of a solar park will be related to the solar radiation , the capacity of the plant and its performance ratio . The income derived from this electrical output will come primarily from the sale of the electricity , and any incentive payments such as those under Feed @-@ in Tariffs or other support mechanisms . 
 Electricity prices may vary at different times of day , giving a higher price at times of high demand . This may influence the design of the plant to increase its output at such times . 
 The dominant costs of solar power plants are the capital cost , and therefore any associated financing and depreciation . Though operating costs are typically relatively low , especially as no fuel is required , most operators will want to ensure that adequate operation and maintenance cover is available to maximise the availability of the plant and thereby optimise the income to cost ratio . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The first places to reach grid parity were those with high traditional electricity prices and high levels of solar radiation . Currently , more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility @-@ scale segment . However , the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity . This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility @-@ scale plants , since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground @-@ mounted PV systems are favored . 
 Because of the economic background , large @-@ scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the most consistent , or the most advantageous . Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MWAC was assessed by Wiki @-@ Solar as 36 GW in c . 2 @,@ 300 installations at the end of 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139 GW . The countries which had the most capacity , in descending order , were the United States , China , Germany , India , United Kingdom , Spain , Italy , Canada and South Africa . Activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below . 
 = = = China = = = 
 China was reported in early 2013 to have overtaken Germany as the nation with the most utility @-@ scale solar capacity . Much of this has been supported by the Clean Development Mechanism . The distribution of power plants around the country is quite broad , with the highest concentration in the Gobi desert and connected to the Northwest China Power Grid . 
 = = = Germany = = = 
 The first multi @-@ megawatt plant in Europe was the 4 @.@ 2 MW community @-@ owned project at <unk> , commissioned in 2003 . But it was the revisions to the German feed @-@ in tariffs in 2004 , which gave the strongest impetus to the establishment of utility @-@ scale solar power plants . The first to be completed under this programme was the Leipziger Land solar park developed by <unk> . Several dozen plants were built between 2004 and 2011 , several of which were at the time the largest in the world . The EEG , the law which establishes Germany ’ s feed @-@ in tariffs , provides the legislative basis not just for the compensation levels , but other regulatory factors , such as priority access to the grid . The law was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of agricultural land , since which time most solar parks have been built on so @-@ called ‘ development land ’ , such as former military sites . Partly for this reason , the geographic distribution of photovoltaic power plants in Germany is biased towards the former Eastern Germany . As of February 2012 , Germany had 1 @.@ 1 million photovoltaic power plants ( most are small kW roof mounted ) . 
 = = = India = = = 
 India has been rising up the leading nations for the installation of utility @-@ scale solar capacity . The Charanka Solar Park in Gujarat was opened officially in April 2012 and was at the time the largest group of solar power plants in the world . Geographically the majority of the stations are located in Gujarat and Maharashtra . Rajasthan has successfully been attempting to attract solar development . It and Gujarat share the Thar Desert , along with Pakistan .

 = = = United Kingdom = = = 
 The introduction of Feed @-@ in tariffs in the United Kingdom in 2010 stimulated the first wave of utility @-@ scale projects , with c . 20 plants being completed before tariffs were reduced on 1 August 2011 following the ' Fast Track Review ' . A second wave of installations was undertaken under the UK 's Renewables Obligation , with the total number of plants connected by the end of March 2013 reaching 86 . This is reported to have made the UK Europe 's best market in the first quarter of 2013 . 
 UK projects were originally concentrated in the South West , but have more recently spread across the South of England and into East Anglia and the Midlands . The first solar park in Wales came on stream in 2011 at <unk> , north Pembrokeshire . As of June 2014 there were 18 schemes generating more than 5 MW and 34 in planning or construction in Wales . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 The US deployment of photovoltaic power stations is largely concentrated in southwestern states . The Renewable Portfolio Standards in California and surrounding states provide a particular incentive . The volume of projects under construction in early 2013 has led to the forecast that the US will become the leading market .

During his first term , Rice proposed new regulations on erotic dancers at Glendale nightclubs , garnering strong opposition from local business owners , who formed the " Glendale Tea Party " and elected three members to the city council in 1998 in response to the new regulations . Running for re @-@ election , Rice faced opposition from Tea Party member Mike <unk> , who promoted accusations that Rice used racial slurs and denigrated African @-@ American and Mexican citizens . Rice was also criticized for being absent from Glendale during six months of his term as mayor , while he attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth . However , after an election that saw record campaign spending and record turnout for Glendale , Rice defeated <unk> and was re @-@ elected to a second term in 2000 . 
 As mayor , Rice touted his efforts to lower city property taxes , expand city parks and open space , and open the city 's first pre @-@ school and recreation center .

The race was a top target for the Colorado GOP , who unsuccessfully tried to keep the seat in Republican hands during a year where Republicans lost ground both nationally and in Colorado . 
 During the campaign , Rice was criticized in attack ads for his support , as mayor of Glendale , of the use of Mexican @-@ issued <unk> consular cards as legal forms of identification for use by immigrants . In his campaign , Rice outlined his top legislative priorities as public safety , economic security , and quality of life . Rice was regarded by both conservative and liberal observers as a moderate Democrat , and is a member of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council . 
 Rice was endorsed by the Denver Post and by both union groups ( including the local chapter of the teachers ' union Colorado Education Association , and the Colorado Association of Public Employees , a branch of the Service Employees International Union ) and business interests ( including the Colorado Subcontractors Association and the state Chamber of Commerce , the Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry ) . He was also endorsed by Colorado Conservation Voters and the Colorado Medical Society . 
 Rice ultimately defeated Dunn , earning 53 percent of the vote , and was sworn into office on January 10 , 2007 .

 In the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly , Rice was vice @-@ chairman of the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and a member of the House Transportation and Energy Committee . 
 During the 2007 legislative session , Rice sponsored 16 pieces of legislation , including 11 as the primary sponsor in the House of Representatives . Among the most prominent of his bills was a measure to set up a cold case unit within the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate Colorado 's 1200 unsolved homicides . After passage , Gov. Ritter signed the bill into law . Rice also pursued legislation to cut taxes for businesses by raising the personal property tax exemption . After having passed the state house unanimously , the measure died in a Senate committee . 
 Rice worked with fellow military officer and state senator Steve Ward on several pieces of legislation during his first term in the legislature . Rice sponsored legislation to allow military personnel serving overseas to apply for absentee ballots electronically ; Ward was the Senate sponsor . Following the 2007 session , Rice and Ward called for Colorado to divest state pension funds from companies doing business in Iran . 
 Rice was a key player during House debate on a resolution critical of the ongoing War in Iraq ; he supported amendments to the resolution to remove specific criticism of the 2007 troop surge , but supported the final compromise version , which called for eventual withdrawal from Iraq and passed on a party @-@ line vote . 
 Rice was also the house sponsor of legislation introduced in the Colorado State Senate to make driving without a seat belt a primary offense ; the measure narrowly failed in the House despite Rice 's objections during a heated debate that defeating the bill would " kill kids . " 
 For his voting record during the 2007 legislative session , Rice earned a 4 % rating from the fiscally conservative Colorado Union of Taxpayers and a 100 % rating from the environmentally @-@ oriented Colorado Conservation Voters ; both ratings placed him at opposite end of the Democratic caucus from average Republican ratings . 
 Following the regular session , Rice served on the legislature 's Police Officers ' and Firefighters ' Pension Reform Commission and the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee .

 At the start of the 2008 legislature year , Rice was still in Iraq on his third tour of duty . His absence was acknowledged by lawmakers during their opening speeches , his seat was decorated with yellow ribbons , and his children were invited to lead the Pledge of Allegiance on the first day of the session . During his time in Iraq , Rice met with Colorado Governor Bill Ritter , Congressman Ed Perlmutter , and Congressional candidate Jared Polis during their trips to the country , and also met with U.S. Marine and Colorado state senator Steve Ward , who was stationed in Iraq at the same time . Rice returned to the legislature on January 28 , 2008 , and was received with a standing ovation during the morning roll call . 
 In the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly , Rice sits on the House Transportation and Energy Committee , and is vice @-@ chairman of the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee . During the session , Rice has explored introducing legislation to increase vehicle registration fees in order boost transportation funding , and plans on introducing legislation to make aggravated rape of a child under 12 a capital crime , eligible for the death penalty . Rice also introduced legislation to exempt some school fundraisers from sales tax , a measure which he placed on hold pending consideration of a broader measure by Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg . Rice and Sonnenberg ultimately combined their efforts and integrated the two bills , both of which became law . 
 Rice re @-@ introduced a bill that had passed the House but failed in the Senate the previous year to raise the business personal property tax exemption , after the measure was endorsed by Gov.

 Besides chairing the House Business Affairs Committee during the regular legislative session , in November 2008 , Rice was named vice @-@ chair of a special legislative Committee on Job Creation and Economic Growth , tasked with developing recommendations on bolstering Colorado 's economy before the 2009 legislative session . The committee presented a slate of jobs @-@ related legislation at the start of the 2009 session ; one measure , sponsored by Rice , would offer tax credits to companies that create 20 jobs in urban areas or 10 jobs in rural areas . With Republican Rep. Amy Stephens , Rice also sponsored legislation allowing health insurance providers to offer discounts for participation in wellness programs . At the request of the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies , Rice also sponsored legislation requiring drivers to yield to transit buses re @-@ entering traffic . 
 Towards the end of the session , Rice prominently broke with Democrats to oppose the removal of capital gains tax breaks and to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked @-@ out workers . Rice also sponsored legislation backed by the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce to create a hybrid public @-@ private health insurance system to cover all Colorado residents ; however , these plans were put on hold after proponents of a single payer health care system advanced their competing proposal in the state legislature . 
 Rice was the sponsor of a major transportation funding proposal backed by Gov. Bill Ritter and other Democratic leaders , including Senate sponsor Dan Gibbs . The proposal , labeled " FASTER , " an acronym for Funding Advancement for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery , would yield $ 250 million in funding , aimed primarily at road and bridge repair , by increasing a range of vehicle registration fees . FASTER passed the legislature without the support of Republicans , who objected to the level of fee increases and called for resources besides fees to be used to support transportation ; additional complaints surfaced from both Republican leaders and the public after the fee increases took effect .

 = National anthem of Russia = 
 The State Anthem of the Russian Federation ( Russian : <unk> ́ <unk> гимн <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> , tr . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ) is the name of the official national anthem of Russia . Its musical composition and lyrics were adopted from the State Anthem of the Soviet Union , composed by Alexander Alexandrov , and lyricists Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El @-@ Registan . The Soviet anthem was used from 1944 , replacing " The Internationale " with a more <unk> song . The anthem had no lyrics after 1956 , due to the original lyrics having references to former leader Joseph Stalin . New lyrics were introduced in 1977 by Mikhalkov with lyrics placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism . 
 The Russian SFSR was the only republic of the USSR without its own anthem , although most republics within the federation did have anthems of their own . The lyric @-@ free " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " , composed by Mikhail Glinka , was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia and confirmed in 1993 , after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , by President of Russia , Boris Yeltsin . The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem because of its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions . None of the entries were adopted , resulting in President Vladimir Putin 's restoration of the Soviet anthem , albeit without lyrics . The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics , eventually settling upon a new composition by Mikhalkov ; according to the government , the lyrics were selected to evoke and eulogize the history and traditions of Russia . The new anthem was adopted in late 2000 , and became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union . 
 Public perception of the anthem is mixed among Russians . The anthem reminds some of the best days of Russia and past sacrifices , while it reminds others of the violence that occurred under the rule of Stalin . The Russian government maintains that the anthem is a symbol of the unity of the people , and that it respects the past . A 2009 poll showed that 56 % of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem , and that 25 % liked it . 
 = = Historic anthems = = 
 Before " Molitva <unk> " ( " The Prayer of the Russians " ) was chosen as the national anthem of Imperial Russia in 1816 , various church hymns and military marches were used to honor the country and the Tsars . Songs used include " Grom <unk> , <unk> ! " ( Let the thunder of victory sound ) and " Kol <unk> " ( " How Glorious Is Our Lord " ) . " Molitva <unk> " was adopted around 1816 , and used lyrics by Vasily Zhukovsky set to the music of the British anthem , " God Save the King " . Russia 's anthem was also influenced by the anthems of France and the Netherlands , and by the British patriotic song " Rule , Britannia ! " . 
 In 1833 , Zhukovsky was asked to set lyrics to a musical composition by Prince Alexei Lvov called " The Russian People 's Prayer " . Known more commonly as " God Save the Tsar ! " . It was well received by Nicholas I , who chose the song to be the next anthem of Imperial Russia . The song resembled a hymn , and its musical style was similar to that of other anthems used by European monarchs . " God Save the Tsar ! " was performed for the first time on 8 December 1833 , at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow . It was later played at the Winter Palace on Christmas Day , by order of Nicholas I. Public singing of the anthem began at opera houses in 1834 , but it was not widely known across the Russian Empire until 1837 . 
 " God Save the Tsar ! " was used until the February Revolution , when the Russian monarchy was overthrown . Upon the overthrow , in March 1917 , the " Worker 's Marseillaise " , Pyotr Lavrov 's modification of the French anthem " La Marseillaise " , was used as an unofficial anthem by the Russian Provisional Government . The modifications Lavrov made to " La Marseillaise " included a change in meter from 2 / 2 to 4 / 4 and music harmonization to make it sound more Russian . It was used at governmental meetings , welcoming ceremonies for diplomats and state funerals . 
 After the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government in the 1917 October Revolution , the anthem of international revolutionary socialism , " L <unk> " ( usually known as " The Internationale " in English ) , was adopted as the new anthem . The lyrics had been written by Eugène Pottier , and Pierre <unk> had composed the music in 1871 to honor the creation of the Second Socialist International organization ; in 1902 , Arkadij <unk> <unk> translated Pottier 's lyrics into Russian . <unk> also changed the grammatical tense of the song , to make it more decisive in nature . The first major use of the song was at the funeral of victims of the February Revolution in Petrograd . Lenin also wanted " The Internationale " to be played more often because it was more socialist , and could not be confused with the French anthem ; other persons in the new Soviet government believed " La Marseillaise " to be too bourgeois . " The Internationale " was used as the anthem of Soviet Russia from 1918 , adopted by the newly created Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922 , and was used until 1944 .

 The music of the national anthem , created by Alexander Alexandrov , had previously been incorporated in several hymns and compositions . The music was first used in the Hymn of the Bolshevik Party , created in 1939 . When the Comintern was dissolved in 1943 , the government argued that " The Internationale " , which was historically associated with the Comintern , should be replaced as the National Anthem of the Soviet Union . Alexandrov 's music was chosen as the new anthem by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin after a contest in 1943 . Stalin praised the song for fulfilling what a national anthem should be , though he criticized the song 's orchestration . 
 In response , Alexandrov blamed the problems on Viktor <unk> , who was responsible for orchestrating the entries for the final contest rounds . When writing the Bolshevik party anthem , Alexandrov incorporated pieces from the song " <unk> ' <unk> <unk> " ( " Life Has Become Better " ) , a musical comedy that he composed . This comedy was based on a slogan Stalin first used in 1935 . Over 200 entries were submitted for the anthem contest , including some by famous Soviet composers Dmitri Shostakovich , Aram Khachaturian and Iona <unk> . Later , the rejected joint entry by Khachaturian and Shostakovich became Song of the Red Army , and Khachaturian went on to compose the Anthem of the Armenian SSR . There was also an entry from Boris Alexandrov , the son of Alexander . His rejected entry , " Long Live Our State " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , became a popular patriotic song and was adopted as the anthem of Transnistria . 
 During the 2000 debate on the anthem , Boris <unk> , the leader of the Unity faction in the Duma , noted that the music which Alexandrov wrote for the Soviet anthem was similar to Vasily <unk> 's 1892 overture , " <unk> " . Supporters of the Soviet anthem mentioned this in the various debates held in the Duma on the change of anthem , but there is no evidence that Alexandrov consciously used parts of " <unk> " in his composition . 
 Another musical work has also been discovered , with identical or near @-@ identical music , that long predates Alexandrov 's 1943 involvement with the Anthem of the USSR . A Ukrainian Scouting ( Plast ) anthem from c . 1912 , with music composed by Jurij <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) known as " <unk> <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> - The Plast Oath ) , to lyrics by Plast founder <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) has been noted by Plast members to bear an extremely close or identical resemblance to the later Russian / Soviet anthem . The music and words are found in various Plast handbooks and songbooks , and a performance of this song in 2012 can be viewed on YouTube . The first line reads : " V <unk> <unk> , u <unk> <unk> " - " В <unk> <unk> , у <unk> <unk> " . The <unk> @-@ <unk> anthem actually glorifies the Ukrainian independence movement , which had the support of the Plast organization .

 After selecting the music by Alexandrov for the anthem , Stalin needed new lyrics . He thought that the anthem was short and , because of the Great Patriotic War , that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of Nazi Germany by the Red Army . The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El @-@ Registan were called to Moscow by one of Stalin 's staffers , and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov 's music . They were instructed to keep the verses the same , but to find a way to change the refrains which described " a Country of Soviets " . Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song , that idea was dropped from the version which El @-@ Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight . After a few minor changes to emphasize the Russian Motherland , Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943 , including a line about Stalin " <unk> [ ing ] us to keep the faith with the people " . The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January 1 , 1944 and became official on March 15 , 1944 . 
 After Stalin 's death in 1953 , the Soviet government examined his legacy . The government began the de @-@ Stalinization process , which included downplaying the role of Stalin and moving his corpse from Lenin 's Mausoleum to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis . In addition , the anthem lyrics composed by Mikhalkov and El @-@ Registan were officially scrapped by the Soviet government in 1956 . The anthem was still used by the Soviet government , but without any official lyrics . In private , this anthem became known the " Song Without Words " . Mikhalkov wrote a new set of lyrics in 1970 , but they were not submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet until May 27 , 1977 . The new lyrics , which eliminated any mention of Stalin , were approved on 1 September , and were made official with the printing of the new Soviet Constitution in October 1977 . In the credits for the 1977 lyrics , Mikhalkov was mentioned , but references to El @-@ Registan , who died in 1945 , were dropped for unknown reasons .

 With the impending collapse of the Soviet Union in early 1990 , a new national anthem was needed to help define the reorganized nation and to reject the Soviet past . The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR , Boris Yeltsin , was advised to revive " God Save The Tsar " with modifications to the lyrics . However , he instead selected a piece composed by Mikhail Glinka . The piece , known as " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " , was a wordless piano composition discovered after Glinka 's death . " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " was performed in front of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR on November 23 , 1990 . The song was decreed by the Supreme Soviet to be the new Russian anthem that same day . This anthem was intended to be permanent , which can be seen from the parliamentary draft of the Constitution , approved and drafted by Supreme Soviet , Congress of People 's Deputies and its Constitutional Commission ( with latter formally headed by President of Russia ) . The draft , among other things , reads that : 
 The National Anthem of the Russian Federation is the Patriotic Song composed by Mikhail Glinka . The text of the National Anthem of the Russian Federation shall be endorsed by the federal law 
 But conflict between President and Congress made passage of that draft less likely : the Congress shifted onto more and more rewriting of the 1978 Russian Constitution , while President pushed forward with new draft Constitution , which doesn 't define state symbols . After 1993 Russian constitutional crisis and just one day before the constitutional referendum ( i.e. on December 11 , 1993 ) Yeltsin , then President of the Russian Federation , issued a presidential decree on December 11 , 1993 , retaining " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " the official anthem for Russia . , but this decree was provisional , since the draft Constitution ( which was passed a day later ) explicitly referred this matter to legislation , enacted by parliament . According to Article 70 of the Constitution , state symbols ( which are an anthem , flag and coat of arms ) required further definition by future legislation . As it was a constitutional matter , it had to be passed by a two @-@ thirds majority in the Duma . 
 Between 1994 and 1999 , many votes were called for in the State Duma to retain " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " as the official anthem of Russia . However , it faced stiff opposition from members of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation , who wanted the Soviet anthem restored . Because any anthem had to be approved by a two @-@ thirds supermajority , this disagreement between Duma factions for nearly a decade prevented passage of an anthem . 
 = = = Call for lyrics = = = 
 When " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " was used as the national anthem , it never had official lyrics . The anthem struck a positive chord for some people because it did not contain elements from the Soviet past , and because the public considered Glinka to be a patriot and a true Russian . However , the lack of lyrics doomed " Patrioticheskaya Pesnya " . Various attempts were made to compose lyrics for the anthem , including a contest that allowed any Russian citizen to participate . A committee set up by the government looked at over 6000 entries , and 20 were recorded by an orchestra for a final vote . 
 The eventual winner was Viktor <unk> 's " Be glorious , Russia " ( <unk> , Россия ! ( " <unk> , Rossiya ! ) ) . However , none of the lyrics were officially adopted by Yeltsin or the Russian government . One of the reasons that partially explained the lack of lyrics was the original use of Glinka 's composition : the praise of the Tsar and of the Russian Orthodox Church . Other complaints raised about the song were that it was hard to remember , uninspiring , and musically complicated . It was one of the few national anthems that lacked official lyrics during this period . The only other wordless national anthems in the period from 1990 to 2000 were " My Belarusy " of Belarus ( until 2002 ) , " Marcha Real " of Spain , and " <unk> " of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
 = = Modern adoption = = 
 The anthem debate intensified in October 2000 when Yeltsin 's successor , Vladimir Putin , was approached by Russian athletes who were concerned that they had no words to sing for the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games . Putin brought public attention to the issue and put it before the State Council . CNN also reported that members of the Spartak Moscow football club complained that the wordless anthem " affected their morale and performance " . Two years earlier , during the 1998 World Cup , members of the Russian team commented that the wordless anthem failed to inspire " great patriotic effort " . 
 In a November session of the Federation Council , Putin stated that establishing the national symbols ( anthem , flag and coat of arms ) should be a top priority for the country . Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem , but strongly suggested that new lyrics be written . He did not say how much of the old Soviet lyrics should be retained for the new anthem . Putin submitted the bill " On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation " to the Duma for their consideration on 4 December . The Duma voted 381 – 51 – 1 in favor of adopting Alexandrov 's music as the national anthem on 8 December 2000 . Following the vote , a committee was formed and tasked with exploring lyrics for the national anthem . After receiving over 6 @,@ 000 manuscripts from all sectors of Russian society , the committee selected lyrics by Mikhalkov for the anthem . 
 Before the official adoption of the lyrics , the Kremlin released a section of the anthem , which made a reference to the flag and coat of arms : 
 Its mighty wings spread above us 
 The Russian eagle is hovering high 
 The Fatherland 's tricolor symbol 
 Is leading Russia 's peoples to victory 
 The above lines were omitted from the final version of the lyrics . After the bill was approved by the Federation Council on 20 December , " On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation " was signed into law by President Putin on 25 December , officially making Alexandrov 's music the national anthem of Russia . The law was published two days later in the official government Newspaper of record Rossiyskaya Gazeta . The new anthem was first performed on 30 December , during a ceremony at the Great Kremlin Palace in Moscow at which Mikhalkov 's lyrics were officially made part of the national anthem . 
 Not everyone agreed with the adoption of the new anthem . Yeltsin argued that Putin should not have changed the anthem merely to " follow blindly the mood of the people " . Yeltsin also felt that the restoration of the Soviet anthem was part of a move to reject post @-@ communist reforms that had taken place since Russian independence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union . This was one of Yeltsin 's few public criticisms of Putin . 
 The liberal political party <unk> stated that the re @-@ adoption of the Soviet anthem " deepened the schism in [ Russian ] society " . The Soviet anthem was supported by the Communist Party and by Putin himself . The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990 , the white @-@ blue @-@ red flag and the double @-@ headed eagle coat of arms , were also given legal approval by Putin in December , thus ending the debate over the national symbols . After all of the symbols were adopted , Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia 's past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia 's history . He also stated that , while Russia 's march towards democracy would not be stopped , the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the lives of their mothers and fathers bereft of meaning . It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem 's lyrics ; athletes were only able to hum along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics . 
 = = Public perception = = 
 The Russian national anthem is set to the melody of the Soviet anthem ( used since 1944 ) . As a result , there have been several controversies related to its use . For instance , some — including cellist Mstislav Rostropovich — have vowed not to stand during the anthem . Russian cultural figures and government officials were also troubled by Putin 's restoration of the Soviet anthem . A former adviser to both Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev , the last President of the Soviet Union , stated that , when " Stalin 's hymn " was used as the national anthem of the Soviet Union , horrific crimes took place . 
 At the 2007 funeral of Yeltsin , the Russian anthem was played as his coffin was laid to rest at the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow . While it was common to hear the anthem during state funerals for Soviet civil and military officials , honored citizens of the nation , and Soviet leaders , as was the case for Alexei Kosygin , Leonid Brezhnev , Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko , writing in The Daily Telegraph Boris Berezovsky felt that playing the anthem at Yeltsin 's funeral " abused the man who brought freedom " to the Russian people . The Russian government states that the " solemn music and poetic work " of the anthem , despite its history , is a symbol of unity for the Russian people . Mikhalkov 's words evoke " feelings of patriotism , respect for the history of the country and its system of government . " 
 In a 2009 poll conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia 's flag day ( 22 August ) , 56 % of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem . However , only 39 % could recall the words of the first line of the anthem . This was an increase from 33 % in 2007 . According to the survey , between 34 and 36 % could not identify the anthem 's first line . Overall , only 25 % of respondents said they liked the anthem . In the previous year , the Russian Public Opinion Research Center found out that 56 % of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem , even though only 40 % ( up from 19 % in 2004 ) knew the first words of the anthem . It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words . 
 In September 2009 , a line from the lyrics used during Stalin 's rule reappeared at the Moscow Metro station <unk> @-@ <unk> : " We were raised by Stalin to be true to the people , inspiring us to feats of labour and heroism . " While groups have threatened legal action to reverse the re @-@ addition of this phrase on a stone banner at the vestibule 's rotunda , it was part of the original design of <unk> station and had been removed during de @-@ Stalinization . Most of the commentary surrounding this event focused on the Kremlin 's attempt to " rehabilitate the image " of Stalin by using symbolism sympathetic to or created by him . 
 The Communist Party strongly supported the restoration of Alexandrov 's melody , but some members proposed other changes to the anthem . In March 2010 , Boris Kashin , a CPRF member of the Duma , advocated for the removal of any reference to God in the anthem . Kashin 's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov , a journalist with <unk> @-@ <unk> and an avowed atheist . Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state . Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120 @,@ 000 rubles . The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings . Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law . 
 = = Regulations = = 
 Regulations for the performance of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000 . While a performance of the anthem may include only music , only words , or a combination of both , the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law . Once a performance has been recorded , it may be used for any purpose , such as in a radio or television broadcast . The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions , such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow , or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures . When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades , Defense Minister Anatoliy <unk> stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square , only an orchestra would be used because voices would be swallowed by the echo . 
 The anthem is mandatory at the swearing @-@ in of the President of Russia , for opening and closing sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council , and for official state ceremonies . It is played on television and radio at the beginning and end of the broadcast day . If programming is continuous , the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight . The anthem is also played on New Year 's Eve after a speech by the President . It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad , according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games . When the anthem is played , all headgear must be removed and all those in attendance must face the Russian flag , if it is present . Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays . 
 The anthem is performed in 4 / 4 ( common time ) or in 2 / 4 ( half time ) in the key of C major , and has a tempo of 76 beats per minute . Using either time signature , the anthem must be played in a festive and quick tempo ( Russian : <unk> and <unk> ) . The government has released different notations for orchestras , brass bands and wind bands . 
 According to Russian copyright law , state symbols and signs are not protected by copyright . As such , the anthem 's music and lyrics may be used and modified freely . Although the law calls for the anthem to be performed respectfully and for performers to avoid causing offence , it does not define what constitutes offensive acts or penalties . Standing for the anthem is required by law but the law does not specify a penalty for refusing to stand . 
 On one occasion in the summer of 2004 , President Putin chastised the national football team for their behavior during the playing of the anthem . During the opening ceremonies of the 2004 European Football Championship , the team was caught on camera chewing gum during the Russian anthem . Through Leonid <unk> , then head of the Russian Olympic Committee , Putin told the team to stop chewing gum and to sing the anthem . Gennady Shvets , then the Russian Olympic Committee 's press chief , denied being contacted by the Kremlin but said he was aware of displeasure with the players ' behaviour .

 = Plan 9 from Bell Labs = 
 Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a distributed operating system , originally developed by the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs between the mid @-@ 1980s and 2002 . It takes some of the principles of Unix , developed in the same research group , but extends these to a networked environment with graphics terminals . 
 In Plan 9 , virtually all computing resources , including files , network connections , and peripheral devices , are represented through the file system rather than specialized interfaces . A unified network protocol called 9P ties a network of computers running Plan 9 together , allowing them to share all resources so represented . 
 The name Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a reference to the Ed Wood 1959 cult science fiction Z @-@ movie Plan 9 from Outer Space . Also , Glenda , the Plan 9 Bunny , is presumably a reference to Wood 's film Glen or Glenda . The system continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists . 
 = = History = = 
 Plan 9 from Bell Labs was originally developed , starting mid @-@ 1980s , by members of the Computing Science Research Center at Bell Labs , the same group that originally developed Unix and C. The Plan 9 team was initially led by Rob Pike , Ken Thompson , Dave <unk> and Phil Winterbottom , with support from Dennis Ritchie as head of the Computing Techniques Research Department . Over the years , many notable developers have contributed to the project including Brian <unk> , Tom Duff , Doug McIlroy , Bjarne Stroustrup and Bruce Ellis . 
 Plan 9 replaced Unix as Bell Labs 's primary platform for operating systems research . It explored several changes to the original Unix model that facilitate the use and programming of the system , notably in distributed multi @-@ user environments . After several years of development and internal use , Bell Labs shipped the operating system to universities in 1992 . Three years later , in 1995 , Plan 9 was made available for commercial parties by AT & T via the book publisher Harcourt Brace . With source licenses costing $ 350 , AT & T targeted the embedded systems market rather than the computer market at large ; Ritchie commented that the developers did not expect to do " much displacement " given how established other operating systems had become . 
 By early 1996 , the Plan 9 project had been " put on the back burner " by AT & T in favor of Inferno , intended to be a rival to Sun Microsystems ' Java platform . In the late 1990s , Bell Labs ' new owner Lucent Technologies dropped commercial support for the project and in 2000 , a third release was distributed under an open source license . A fourth release under a new free software license occurred in 2002 . 
 A user and development community , including current and former Bell Labs personnel , produced minor daily releases in form of ISO images . Bell Labs hosted the development . The development source tree is accessible over the 9P and HTTP protocols and is used to update existing installations . In addition to the official components of the OS included in the ISOs , Bell Labs also hosts a repository of externally developed applications and tools . 
 = = Design concepts = = 
 Plan 9 is a distributed operating system , designed to make a network of heterogeneous and geographically separated computers function as a single system . In a typical Plan 9 installation , users work at terminals running the window system <unk> , and they access CPU servers which handle computation @-@ intensive processes . Permanent data storage is provided by additional network hosts acting as file servers and archival storage . 
 Its designers state that : 
 [ t ] he foundations of the system are built on two ideas : a per @-@ process name space and a simple message @-@ oriented file system protocol . 
 The first idea means that , unlike on most operating systems , processes ( running programs ) each have their own view of the namespace , corresponding to what other operating systems call the file system ; a single path name may refer to different resources for different processes . The potential complexity of this setup is controlled by a set of conventional locations for common resources . 
 The second idea means that processes can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files that appear in the other processes ' namespace . The client process 's input / output on such a file becomes inter @-@ process communication between the two processes . This way , Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources . It carries over Unix 's idea of device files to provide access to peripheral devices ( mice , removable media , etc . ) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace , but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace . 
 For example , the original window system , called 8 ½ , exploited these possibilities as follows . Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal by means of three pseudo @-@ files : mouse , which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks , cons , which can be used to perform textual input / output , and bitblt , writing to which enacts graphics operations ( see bit <unk> ) . The window system multiplexes these devices : when creating a new window to run some program in , it first sets up a new namespace in which mouse , cons and bitblt are connected to itself , hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access . The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately , by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input . The program does not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system 's device drivers , or with the window system ; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects . 
 Plan 9 's distributed operation relies on the per @-@ process namespaces as well , allowing client and server processes to communicate across machines in the way just outlined . For example , the cpu command starts a remote session on a compute server . The command exports part of its local namespace , including the user 's terminal 's devices ( mouse , cons , bitblt ) , to the server , so that remote programs can perform input / output using the terminal 's mouse , keyboard and display , combining the effects of remote login and a shared network filesystem . 
 = = = 9P protocol = = = 
 All programs that wish to provide services @-@ as @-@ files to other programs speak a unified protocol , called 9P . Compared to other systems , this reduces the number of custom programming interfaces . 9P is a generic , medium @-@ agnostic , byte @-@ oriented protocol that provides for messages delivered between a server and a client . The protocol is used to refer to and communicate with processes , programs , and data , including both the user interface and the network . With the release of the 4th edition , it was modified and renamed <unk> . 
 Unlike most other operating systems , Plan 9 does not provide special application programming interfaces ( such as Berkeley sockets , X resources or <unk> system calls ) to access devices . Instead , Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file system , so that the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file input / output operations read and write . Consequently , sharing the device across the network can be accomplished by mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine . 
 = = = Union directories and namespaces = = = 
 Plan 9 allows the user to collect the files ( called names ) from different directory trees in a single location . The resulting union directory behaves as the concatenation of the underlying directories ( the order of concatenation can be controlled ) ; if the constituent directories contain files having the same name , a listing of the union directory ( ls or lc ) will simply report duplicate names . Resolution of a single path name is performed top @-@ down : if the directories top and bottom are <unk> into u with top first , then u / name denotes top / name if it exists , bottom / name only if it exists and top / name does not exist , and no file if neither exists . No recursive <unk> of <unk> is performed , so if top / <unk> exists , the files in bottom / <unk> are not accessible through the union . 
 A union directory can be created by using the bind command : 
 In the example above , / arm / bin is mounted at / bin , the contents of / arm / bin replacing the previous contents of / bin . Inferno 's bin directory is then union mounted after / bin , and Alice 's personal bin directory is union mounted before . When a file is requested from / bin , it is first looked for in / <unk> / <unk> / bin , then in / arm / bin , and then finally in / <unk> / inferno / <unk> / arm / bin . 
 The separate @-@ namespaces @-@ for @-@ separate @-@ processes thus replaces the notion of a search path in the shell . Where Unix shells have a list of directories to search for programs when given a command , the Plan 9 shell only looks in the directory / bin ; adding commands is done by binding several directories together to appear as a single / bin . 
 Furthermore , the kernel can keep separate mount tables for each process , and can thus provide each process with its own file system namespace . Processes ' namespaces can be constructed independently , and the user may work simultaneously with programs that have heterogeneous namespaces . <unk> may be used to create an isolated environment similar to <unk> , but in a more secure way . 
 Plan 9 's union directory architecture inspired 4.4BSD and Linux union file system implementations , although the developers of the BSD union mounting facility found the non @-@ recursive merging of directories in Plan 9 " too restrictive for general purpose use " . 
 = = = Special virtual filesystems = = = 
 = = = = / proc = = = = 
 Instead of having system calls specifically for process management , Plan 9 provides the / proc file system . Each process appears as a directory containing information and control files which can be manipulated by the ordinary file IO system calls . 
 The file system approach allows Plan 9 processes to be managed with simple file management tools such as ls and cat ; however , the processes cannot be copied and moved as files . 
 = = = = / net = = = = 
 Plan 9 does not have specialised system calls or <unk> for accessing the networking stack or networking hardware . Instead , the / net file system is used . Network connections are controlled by reading and writing control messages to control files . Sub @-@ directories such as / net / <unk> and / net / <unk> are used as an interface to their respective protocols . 
 = = = Unicode = = = 
 To reduce the complexity of managing character <unk> , Plan 9 uses Unicode throughout the system . The initial Unicode implementation was ISO <unk> . Ken Thompson invented UTF @-@ 8 , which became the native encoding in Plan 9 . The entire system was converted to general use in 1992 . UTF @-@ 8 preserves backwards compatibility with traditional null terminated strings , enabling more reliable information processing and the chaining of multilingual string data with Unix pipes between multiple processes . Using a single UTF @-@ 8 encoding with characters for all cultures and regions eliminates the need for switching between code sets . 
 = = = Combining the design concepts = = = 
 Though interesting on their own , the design concepts of Plan 9 were supposed to be most useful when combined together . For example , to implement a network address translation ( NAT ) server , a union directory can be created , overlaying the router 's / net directory tree with its own / net . Similarly , a virtual private network ( VPN ) can be implemented by overlaying in a union directory a / net hierarchy from a remote gateway , using secured 9P over the public Internet . A union directory with the / net hierarchy and filters can be used to sandbox an <unk> application or to implement a firewall . In the same manner , a distributed computing network can be composed with a union directory of / proc hierarchies from remote hosts , which allows interacting with them as if they are local . 
 When used together , these features allow for assembling a complex distributed computing environment by reusing the existing hierarchical name system . 
 = = Software for Plan 9 = = 
 As a benefit from the system 's design , most tasks in Plan 9 can be accomplished by using ls , cat , <unk> , cp and rm utilities in combination with the rc shell ( the default Plan 9 shell ) . 
 Factotum is an authentication and key management server for Plan 9 . It handles authentication on behalf of other programs such that both secret keys and implementation details need only be known to Factotum . 
 = = = Graphical programs = = = 
 Unlike Unix , Plan 9 was designed with graphics in mind . After booting , a Plan 9 terminal will run the <unk> windowing system , in which the user can create new windows displaying rc . Graphical programs invoked from this shell replace it in its window .

 Plan 9 supports the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , FAT , and Fossil file systems . The last was designed at Bell Labs specifically for Plan 9 and provides snapshot storage capability . It can be used directly with a hard drive or backed with Venti , an archival file system and permanent data storage system . 
 = = = Software development = = = 
 The distribution package for Plan 9 includes special compiler variants and programming languages , and provides a tailored set of libraries along with a windowing user interface system specific to Plan 9 . The bulk of the system is written in a dialect of C ( ANSI C with some extensions and some other features left out ) . The compilers for this language were custom built with portability in mind ; according to their author , they " compile quickly , load slowly , and produce medium quality object code " . 
 A concurrent programming language called Alef was available in the first two editions , but was then dropped for maintenance reasons and replaced by a threading library for C. 
 = = = Unix compatibility = = = 
 Though Plan 9 was supposed to be a further development of Unix concepts , compatibility with preexisting Unix software was never the goal for the project . Many command line utilities of Plan 9 share the names of Unix counterparts , but work differently . 
 Plan 9 can support POSIX applications and can emulate the Berkeley socket interface through the ANSI / POSIX Environment ( APE ) that implements an interface close to ANSI C and POSIX , with some common extensions ( the native Plan 9 C interfaces conform to neither standard ) . It also includes a POSIX @-@ compatible shell . APE 's authors claim to have used it to port the X Window System ( X11 ) to Plan 9 , although they do not ship X11 " because supporting it properly is too big a job " . Some Linux binaries can be used with the help of a " <unk> " ( Linux emulator ) application ; however , it is still a work in progress . Vice versa , the <unk> virtual machine allows a slightly modified Plan 9 kernel to run as a user process in Linux , supporting unmodified Plan 9 programs .

 = = = Comparison to contemporary operating systems = = = 
 In 1991 , Plan 9 's designers compared their system to other early nineties operating systems in terms of size , showing that the source code for a minimal ( " working , albeit not very useful " ) version was less than one @-@ fifth the size of a Mach <unk> without any device drivers ( <unk> or 4622 lines of code for Plan 9 , depending on metric , vs. <unk> lines ) . The complete kernel comprised 18000 lines of code . ( According to a 2006 count , the kernel was then some 150 @,@ 000 lines , but this was compared against more than 4 @.@ 8 million in Linux . ) 
 Within the operating systems research community , as well as the commercial Unix world , other attempts at achieving distributed computing and remote filesystem access were made concurrently with the Plan 9 design effort . These included the Network File System and the associated vnode architecture developed at Sun Microsystems , and more radical departures from the Unix model such as the Sprite OS from UC Berkeley . Sprite developer Welch points out that the <unk> vnode architecture is limited compared to Plan 9 's capabilities in that it does not support remote device access and remote inter @-@ process communication cleanly , even though it could have , had the preexisting UNIX domain sockets ( which " can essentially be used to name user @-@ level servers " ) been integrated with the vnode architecture . 
 One critique of the " everything is a file " , communication @-@ by @-@ textual @-@ message design of Plan 9 pointed out limitations of this paradigm compared to the typed interfaces of Sun 's object @-@ oriented operating system , Spring : 
 Plan 9 constrains everything to look like a file . In most cases the real interface type comprises the protocol of messages that must be written to , and read from , a file descriptor . This is difficult to specify and document , and prohibits any automatic type checking at all , except for file errors at run time . ( ... ) [ A ] path name relative to a process ' implicit root context is the only way to name a service . Binding a name to an object can only be done by giving an existing name for the object , in the same context as the new name . As such , interface references simply cannot be passed between processes , much less across networks . Instead , communication has to rely on conventions , which are prone to error and do not scale . 
 A later retrospective comparison of Plan 9 , Sprite and a third contemporary distributed research operating system , Amoeba , found that 
 the environments they [ Amoeba and Sprite ] build are tightly coupled within the OS , making communication with external services difficult . Such systems suffer from the radical departure from the UNIX model , which also discourages portability of already existing software to the platform ( ... ) . The lack of developers , the very small range of supported hardware and the small , even compared to Plan 9 , user base have also significantly slowed the adoption of those systems ( ... ) . In retrospect , Plan 9 was the only research distributed OS from that time which managed to attract developers and be used in commercial projects long enough to warrant its survival to this day . 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 Plan 9 demonstrated that an integral concept of Unix — that every system interface could be represented as a set of files — could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system . Some features from Plan 9 , like the UTF @-@ 8 character encoding of Unicode , have been implemented in other operating systems . Unix @-@ like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P , Plan 9 's file system , and have adopted features of <unk> , Plan 9 's process creation mechanism . Additionally , in Plan 9 from User Space , several of Plan 9 's applications and tools , including the sam and acme editors , have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity . Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs . The <unk> window manager was inspired by 8 ½ , the older windowing system of Plan 9 ; <unk> is also heavily influenced by Plan 9 . In computer science research , Plan 9 has been used as a grid computing platform and as a vehicle for research into ubiquitous computing without middleware . 
 However , Plan 9 has never approached Unix in popularity , and has been primarily a research tool : 
 [ I ] t looks like Plan 9 failed simply because it fell short of being a compelling enough improvement on Unix to displace its ancestor . Compared to Plan 9 , Unix creaks and <unk> and has obvious rust spots , but it gets the job done well enough to hold its position . There is a lesson here for ambitious system architects : the most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is just good enough . 
 Other factors that contributed to low adoption of Plan 9 include the lack of commercial backup , the low number of end @-@ user applications , and the lack of device drivers . 
 Plan 9 proponents and developers claim that the problems hindering its adoption have been solved , that its original goals as a distributed system , development environment , and research platform have been met , and that it enjoys moderate but growing popularity . Inferno , through its hosted capabilities , has been a vehicle for bringing Plan 9 technologies to other systems as a hosted part of heterogeneous computing grids . 
 Several projects work to extend Plan 9 , including <unk> and <unk> . These forks augment Plan 9 with additional hardware drivers and software , including an improved version of the <unk> e @-@ mail system , the go compiler , Mercurial version control system support , and other programs . Plan 9 was ported to the Raspberry Pi single @-@ board computer . The Harvey project attempts to replace the custom Plan 9 C compiler with GCC , to leverage modern development tools such as GitHub and <unk> and speed up development .

 Inferno is a descendant of Plan 9 , and shares many design concepts and even source code in the kernel , particularly around devices and the Styx / <unk> protocol .

 = Boys ' Club ( Parks and Recreation ) = 
 " Boys ' Club " is the fourth episode of the first season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 30 , 2009 . It was written by Alan Yang and directed by Michael McCullers . In the episode , Leslie tries to integrate herself into the local " boys club " by drinking wine from an illegal gift basket , and gets into trouble as she tries to accept responsibility for her supposed mistake . In a B story , Andy cleans his apartment while Ann is at work . 
 The episode included beer and props from Upland Brewing Company , a real @-@ life company based in Bloomington , Indiana , in an attempt to give Pawnee an authentic Indiana atmosphere . " Boys ' Club " received positive to fair reviews , with some commentators praising the episode for better developing the show 's supporting characters . 
 According to Nielsen Media Research , it was watched by 5 @.@ 28 million households in its original airing , which was consistent with the previous week . " Boys ' Club " and the rest of the first season of Parks and Recreation was released on DVD in the United States on September 8 , 2009 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode opens with Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) and Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) responding to an incident at a park trail , where teenage boys are picking up plastic <unk> of dog droppings and throwing them at each other . Leslie tries to stop them but ends up playing along with the boys and admitting that it is fun . Later , at the Pawnee town hall , a construction company has sent a gift basket with wine and cheese to the parks department , but Leslie locks it away because they are not allowed to accept gifts over $ 25 . Later , she and the others in the department look at a new social @-@ networking site that April ( Aubrey Plaza ) has set up for the pit construction project . The site already has seven friends , including city planner Mark ( Paul Schneider ) , who Leslie is disappointed to see is friends with many scantily clad young women . Leslie and Ann ( Rashida Jones ) see Mark and other city planners drinking beer in the town hall courtyard . Leslie describes it as the exclusive " boys ' club " and proposes that she and Ann crash it . 
 When they come outside , Mark and the others welcome them warmly . Leslie enjoys herself at the party and , when the beer runs out and the party is about to end , she keeps it going by retrieving the wine and cheese from the gift basket . The next morning , she feels guilty and , despite her boss Ron 's ( Nick Offerman ) assurance that " [ i ] t 's not that big a deal , " Leslie issues a public apology to every government official in Pawnee , including a link to the new pit website . Later , however , she learns April has placed a drunken video of herself drinking the rest of the wine on the site , even though she is only 19 . Ron tells Leslie an ethics board has called for a disciplinary hearing with Leslie . Leslie apologizes to the board and defends April , accepting responsibility for the video . As the questions from the board continue , Ron angrily defends Leslie , insisting , " Leslie has never broken a rule in her life , to the point that it 's annoying . " He abruptly ends the meeting and insists they will have to go through him to give Leslie anything more than a slap on the wrist . 
 Later , Leslie learns she will receive a letter in her file , which disappoints her strongly until Mark tells her he has seven in his file , and that most of the guys have at least one . Mark welcomes Leslie " to the team " , which makes her proud . 
 In a B story , Ann 's normally lazy boyfriend Andy ( Chris Pratt ) decides to surprise her by cleaning up their messy house while she is gone . He cleans up the house ( although he throws their garbage into the pit ) . After cleaning it , he bathes himself in a children 's pool in the backyard and plays music on his boombox . Angry neighbor Lawrence steals his boombox , prompting Andy ( who has two broken legs ) to chase the neighbor naked through the streets on his crutches . Later , Ann arrives home and is pleased with Andy 's housework , with Andy telling the documentary crew he expects to get " gently laid " later . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Boys ' Club " was written by Alan Yang and directed by Michael McCullers . McCullers co @-@ wrote two of the Austin Powers films and directed <unk> in the comedy film Baby Mama . The cold open scene , with kids throwing bags of dog feces at Leslie , was added to the episode after the rest had already been filmed , and was directed personally by series co @-@ creator Greg Daniels . The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes . Daniels said of the opening , " There were a lot of people who felt this was not in good taste , but to me , this was one of the most fun things about the show . " The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $ 25 was based on real @-@ life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research . The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage , and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena , California . 
 Like most episodes of Parks and Recreation , a great deal of the scenes in " Boys ' Club " were improvised by the actors . For example , Nick Offerman improvised the line " Put it in an e @-@ mail ? " , which he said when Leslie told him she had a very long story to tell him . Schur thought the line was " my favorite thing in the show " , and they made him say in it every subsequent take during filming . Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review . Dean Holland , Parks and Recreation 's editor , said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season . Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering , after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles , " I feel like I 'm already in the boys ' club . Look at those bitches <unk> ' up after me . " Schur said the line helped develop Leslie 's character in future episodes because " we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler than we had originally thought " . The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode , but was moved to " Boys ' Club " when the producers decided it fit better there . Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode . " Boys ' Club " ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said , " It 's a running joke in the writer 's room that every episode should end with clinking beers . " 
 Photos of Parks and Recreation producers were included among the photos of past city council members on the town hall walls . The photo of Hiscock is the one Leslie said she believes , " No matter what direction I move , he 's always staring at my chest . Mark 's social networking site featured in " Boys ' Club " included the character with a wide range of promiscuous women . The pictures were shot during a photo session during which , according to series co @-@ creator Michael Schur , " We brought in a lot of women and basically said , you 're really trashy . You 're trashy women , and we 're going to take your picture now . " During the courtyard party scenes , a brief clip shows Poehler , Jones and Schneider dancing together . The clip was actually the three actors out @-@ of @-@ character playing around between takes , but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode . 
 Michael Schur , co @-@ creator of Parks and Recreation , said " Boys ' Club " marked an attempt to better develop Andy Dwyer . Schur said , " We definitely wanted to <unk> his character and not make him just a one @-@ dimensional douchebag . " In the episode , Andy plays a tape of himself singing a song called " Ann " , which he wrote as a romantic ballad for her . Chris Pratt actually wrote and performed the song himself for the show , although he said in an interview , " it really wasn 't much " . Pratt actually appeared on set naked while filming the scene in which he chases Lawrence through the streets without clothes on . Schur said the scene was written because Pratt " loves taking his clothes off " . It proved difficult to film the scenes with Pratt bathing in the children 's pool because the bubbles disappeared so quickly that multiple takes were required . The scenes with Andy running naked through the streets with his crutches to get his boombox back were inspired by a real @-@ life experience from the set . During filming , an announcement was made that specialty coffees were available for the cast and crew , and Pratt ran quickly after them with the crutches . Greg Daniels added it to " Boys ' Club " because he found the experience extremely funny . 
 In an attempt to lend authenticity to the fictional Pawnee , Indiana setting , Parks and Recreation producers contacted the Bloomington , Indiana @-@ based Upland Brewing Company and asked them to provide empty beer bottles and labels for the scene with the characters drinking in the town hall courtyard . The company provided props for their beer brand Dragonfly IPA , and Upland officials said their prominent appearances in the episode generated positive publicity for the company : Scott Johnson , marketing operations manager for the brewing company , said , " As soon as it went off , everyone starts calling me and e @-@ mailing me . " They also drink <unk> ginger ale , a soft drink very popular in Indiana . Windell D. Middlebrooks makes a guest appearance as Brian , one of the men attending the during the courtyard party . Middlebrooks was cast simply based on his work on Miller High Life commercials , in which he steals beer from bars that he deems unworthy of it . 
 On the day of the episode 's original American broadcast on April 30 , 2009 , the official NBC Parks and Recreation website launched a duplicate of the Sullivan Street Pit social networking site which was featured in the episode , complete with photos of the pit , the list of " friends " from the show and a link to Mark 's page and his photos with scantily clad women . The pit page , as well as the regular NBC website , also included the actual video of Aubrey Plaza pretending to drink wine and get drunk , as it was featured on the episode . Schur said for those scenes , " We just gave Aubrey a camera and told her to just drink wine and talk to the camera . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The social networking site developed for the pit project is inspired by sites like MySpace and Facebook , which were extremely popular when the episode was first broadcast . Leslie makes a public apology to all female government officials in alphabetical order , starting with Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann , Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( Democrat , Wisconsin ) and Illinois Democratic Rep. Melissa Bean . On her desk , Leslie has framed photos of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor . The apology scene was filmed with the camera on a tripod , something seldom done in the documentary @-@ style series . An online game of Scrabble is visible on the computer screen in Ron 's office during one scene . It is exactly the same Scrabble game he had been playing with Tom in the previous episode , " The Reporter " . While preparing Leslie for her ethics board review , Tom asks if she has ever fantasized about Ron " covered in Powerade " . This is a reference to commercials for the sports drink , in which athletes sweat the multi @-@ colored liquid while working out .

 In its original American broadcast on April 30 , 2009 , " Boys ' Club " was watched by 5 @.@ 28 million households , according to Nielsen Media Research . This rating was consistent with the previous week even as other NBC shows , like the new Southland , saw a drop in ratings . " Boys ' Club " received a 2 @.@ 3 rating / 8 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34 , and a 2 @.@ 3 rating / 7 share among viewers between 18 and 49 . 
 The episode received positive to fair reviews . Alan Sepinwall , television journalist for The Star @-@ Ledger , said " Boys ' Club " was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie , particularly when she spilled the beer bottles ; he also praised Andy 's " naked crutch chase " . Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode gave a little more insight into Leslie 's " aspirations about wanting to be a woman who succeeds in government , which is a step in the right direction " , but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story . Fowler said the best part of the episode was Andy 's subplot , particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade , and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes . Phipps said most of the show 's laughs came from supporting characters Andy , Tom and Ron ; he also particularly praised Ron 's shutdown of Leslie 's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government : " One guy , who sits in a small room at a desk . And the only thing he ’ s allowed to decide is who to nuke . " Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie , who he described as " a fully @-@ realized character instead of a caricature " .

 " Boys ' Club " , along with the five other first season episodes of Parks and Recreation , was released on a one @-@ disc DVD set in the United States on September 8 , 2009 . The DVD included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode , as well as about 30 minutes of deleted scenes . The deleted scenes included on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired . In one of the scenes , Leslie bought a gift basket and returned it to the business that provided the original one , in an attempt at what she called " ethical restitution " . In another scene , Leslie apologized to April for introducing her to alcohol , prompting April to later tell the camera she has had fake IDs in Indiana , North Dakota and Delaware since she was 14 years old . 
 = Lovell Telescope = 
 The Lovell Telescope / <unk> / is a radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory , near Goostrey , Cheshire in the north @-@ west of England . When construction was finished in 1957 , the telescope was the largest steerable dish radio telescope in the world at 76 @.@ 2 m ( 250 ft ) in diameter ; it is now the third largest , after the Green Bank telescope in West Virginia , USA , and the <unk> telescope in Germany . It was originally known as the " 250 ft telescope " or the Radio Telescope at Jodrell Bank , before becoming the Mark I telescope around 1961 when future telescopes ( the Mark II , III , and IV ) were being discussed . It was renamed to the Lovell Telescope in 1987 after Sir Bernard Lovell , and became a Grade I listed building in 1988 . The telescope forms part of the MERLIN and European VLBI Network arrays of radio telescopes . 
 Both Bernard Lovell and Charles Husband were knighted for their roles in creating the telescope . In September 2006 , the telescope won the BBC 's online competition to find the UK 's greatest " Unsung Landmark " . 2007 marked the 50th anniversary of the telescope . 
 If the air is clear enough , the Mark I telescope can be seen from high @-@ rise buildings in Manchester such as the Beetham Tower , and from as far away as the Pennines , Winter Hill in Lancashire , Snowdonia , Beeston Castle in Cheshire , and the Peak District . It can also be seen from the Terminal 1 restaurant area and departure lounges of Manchester Airport .

 = = = Conception and construction of the Mark I = = = 
 Bernard Lovell built the Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank in the late 1940s . This was a 218 ft ( 66 m ) -diameter radio telescope that could only point directly upwards ; the next logical step was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed , as well as for longer integration times . Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it , a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed ; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job . This turned out to be Charles Husband , whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949 . 
 Two bearing assemblies from 15 @-@ inch ( 38 @-@ cm ) gun turrets were bought cheaply in 1950 ; these came from the World War I battleships HMS Revenge and Royal Sovereign , which were being broken up at the time . The bearings became the two main altitude rotator bearings of the telescope , with the appropriate parts of the telescope being designed around them . Husband presented the first drawings of the proposed giant , fully steerable radio telescope in 1950 . After refinements , these plans were detailed in a " Blue Book " , which was presented to the <unk> on 20 March 1951 ; the proposal was approved in March 1952 . 
 Construction began on 3 September 1952 . The foundations for the telescope were completed on 21 May 1953 after being sunk 90 ft ( 27 m ) into the ground. it then took until Mid @-@ March 1954 to get the double railway lines completed due to their required accuracy . The central pivot was delivered to the site on 11 May 1954 , and the final bogie in mid @-@ April 1955 . 
 The telescope bowl was originally going to have a wire mesh surface to observe at wavelengths between 1 and 10 meters ( 3 @.@ 2 and 32 feet ) ; this was changed to a steel surface so that the telescope could observe at the 21 cm ( 8 in ) hydrogen line , which was discovered in 1951 . Also , in February 1954 Lovell and the Air Ministry met to see if funding could be made available for improving the accuracy of the dish so that it could be used on centimetre wavelengths , for research at these wavelengths for the Ministry as well as " other purposes " . Although the funding was not ultimately made available from the Air Ministry , the planning process had already progressed too far and so this improvement was made anyway . 
 The telescope was constructed so that the bowl could be completely inverted . Originally , it was intended to use a movable tower at the base of the telescope to change the receivers at the focus . However , the movable tower was never built , due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus . Instead , receivers were mounted on 50 @-@ foot ( 15 @-@ m ) long steel tubes , which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted . The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube , which could then be connected when the telescope was pointed at the zenith . Associated receiver equipment could then be placed either in the small , swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface ; in rooms at the tops of the two towers ; at the base girders , or in the control building . 
 The telescope moved for the first time on 3 February 1957 : by an inch . It was first moved <unk> under power on 12 June 1957 ; the bowl was tilted under power for the first time on 20 June 1957 . By the end of July the dish surface was completed , and first light was on 2 August 1957 ; the telescope did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160 MHz , with the bowl at the zenith . The telescope was first controlled from the control room on 9 October 1957 , by a purpose @-@ built analogue computer . 
 There were large cost overruns with the telescope 's construction , mainly due to the steeply rising cost of steel at the time the telescope was constructed . The original grant for the telescope 's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government ; this amounted to £ 335 @,@ 000 . The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose ; other money came from private donations . The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope , £ 50 @,@ 000 , was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 ( partly due to the telescope 's early , very public role in space probe tracking ; see below ) , and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories . The final total cost for the telescope was £ 700 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Upgrade to Mark IA = = = 
 Shortly after the telescope was originally completed , Lovell and Husband started contemplating the idea of upgrading the telescope so that it had a more accurate surface , and was controlled by a digital computer . Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co . , and were presented to Lovell in April 1964 . Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967 . The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years , and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963 . The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working ; had they been left in place , then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed . The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA ; the £ 400 @,@ 000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC to upgrade and repair the telescope to the Mark IA . The upgrade was carried out in three phases , phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969 , phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971 . 
 The first phase saw the addition of an inner railway track , which was designed to take a third of the weight of the telescope . The outer railway track , which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years , was relaid in the second phase . Also , four bogies were added on the inner track , along with their steelwork , and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled . 
 The third phase saw the biggest changes ; a new , more accurate bowl surface was constructed in front of the old surface , meaning that the telescope could be used on wavelengths as small as 6 cm , and the central " bicycle wheel " support was added . A new computer control system was also put in place ( reusing the Ferranti Argus 104 computer from the Mark II ) ; fatigue cracks in the cones connecting the bowl to the towers were repaired and the central antenna was lengthened and strengthened . Tragically , in January 1972 the hoist holding two engineers to the central antenna snapped , causing grave injuries to both engineers and resulting in the death of one of them . 
 The Mark IA upgrade was formally completed on 16 July 1974 , when the telescope was handed back to the University of Manchester . Due to increases in the cost of steel during the upgrade , the final amount for the upgrade was £ 664 @,@ 793 @.@ 07 . 
 = = = Later upgrades and repairs = = = 
 The Gale of January 1976 on 2 January , brought winds of around 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) which almost destroyed the telescope . The towers bowed , and one of the bearings connecting the dish to the towers slipped . After an expensive repair , diagonal bracing girders were added to the towers to prevent this happening again . 
 By the 1990s , the telescope surface was becoming badly corroded . In 2001 @-@ 2003 , the telescope was resurfaced , increasing its sensitivity at 5 GHz by a factor of five . A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface , meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5 cm ( compared to 18 cm on the old surface ) . A new drive system was installed , which provides a much higher pointing accuracy . The outer track was relaid , and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers . 
 In 2007 the telescope needed a new drive wheel , as one of the sixty four original wheels had cracked ; in 2008 another new steel tyre was needed after a second wheel cracked . These are the only two wheel changes needed since the telescope started operation in 1957 . 
 The presence ( as at 2010 ) of two breeding pairs of wild peregrine falcons ( nesting one in each of the telescope 's two support towers ) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation ( by droppings fouling , and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings ) that some other radio telescopes suffer from .

 = = = Sputnik and artificial satellites = = = 
 The telescope became operational in the summer of 1957 , just in time for the launch of Sputnik 1 , the world 's first artificial satellite . While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio , the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik 's booster rocket by radar ; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957 . It also located Sputnik 2 's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957 . 
 The telescope also took part in some of the early work on satellite communication . In February and March 1963 , the telescope transmitted signals via the moon and Echo II , a NASA balloon satellite at 750 km ( 466 mi ) altitude , to the <unk> Observatory in the USSR . Some signals were also relayed from the USA to the USSR via Jodrell Bank . 
 = = = The race to the Moon = = = 
 The Lovell Telescope was used to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s . In terms of American space probes , the telescope tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958 , Pioneer 3 in December 1958 , and Pioneer 4 in March 1959 . The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960 , and was also used to send commands to the probe , including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones to turn on the more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles ( 12 @.@ 9 million km ) away . It also received data from Pioneer 5 , and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time . The last signal was picked up from the probe at a distance of 36 @.@ 2 million kilometers on the 26 June 1960 . 
 The telescope also tracked the Soviet moon probes , including <unk> II from 13 to 14 September 1959 as it hit the moon ; this was proven by the telescope by measuring the effect of the moon 's gravity on the probe , and Luna 3 around 4 October 1959 . Also , the telescope tracked Luna 9 in February 1966 , the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon . The telescope listened in on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon 's surface . The photos were sent to the British press - the probe transmitted , likely intentionally to increase chances of reception , in the international format for image transmission by newswire - and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public . 
 The telescope tracked Luna 10 , a Russian satellite put into orbit around the Moon , in April 1966 , and Zond 5 in September 1968 , a Russian probe that was launched at the moon , around which it sling @-@ shotted before returning to Earth . The telescope did not track Apollo 11 , as it was tracking Luna 15 in July 1969 . However , a 50 ft ( 15 m ) telescope at Jodrell Bank was used at the same time to track Apollo 11 .

 The telescope possibly detected signals from Venera 1 , a Russian satellite en route to Venus , in 19 – 20 May 1961 . However , it was not possible to confirm the origin of the signals . A few years later , in December 1962 , the telescope tracked and received data from Mariner 2 . On 18 October 1967 , the telescope received signals from , and tracked , Venera 4 , a Russian probe to Venus .

However , it did not succeed in locating any of them .

 As a stopgap measure while RAF <unk> was being built , the telescope was on standby for " Project <unk> " ( also known by the codewords " Lothario " and " <unk> " ) between April 1962 and September 1963 . During strategic alerts , a ' pulse transmitter , receiver and display equipment ' could be connected to the telescope to scan known Russian launch sites for indications of launches of ICBMs and / or <unk> . During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 , the telescope was discreetly turned towards the Iron Curtain to provide a few minute 's warning of any missiles that might have been launched . 
 = = Scientific observations = = 
 When the telescope was proposed , a series of objectives for the telescope 's observations were set out . These included : 
 Surveys of galactic and extragalactic radio emission 
 Observations of the sun 
 Radar echoes from the planets 
 Investigation of meteor detections 
 Observations of the <unk> 
 Studies of the Aurora 
 <unk> of radio reflections from cosmic ray ionization in the atmosphere 
 However , the actual observations made with the telescope differ from these original objectives , and are outlined in the following sections . 
 = = = Solar system = = = 
 In Autumn 1958 , the telescope was used to bounce " <unk> " off the Moon for a demonstration in Lovell 's third Reith Lecture . The telescope was also used to receive messages bounced off the Moon ( a " <unk> " ) as part of the 50th anniversary First Move festival . In April 1961 , a radar echo from Venus was achieved using the telescope while the planet was at a close approach , confirming measurements of the distance of the planet made by American telescopes . 
 = = = <unk> Hydrogen line = = = 
 The 21 cm Hydrogen line was discovered during the telescope 's construction ; the telescope was subsequently redesigned so that it could observe at that frequency . Using this line emission , hydrogen clouds both in the Milky Way galaxy and in other galaxies can be observed ; for example , the telescope discovered a large cloud around the <unk> and M82 galaxies . The motion of these clouds either towards or away from us either redshifts or blueshifts the line , allowing the velocity to the cloud to be measured . This provides a probe of the internal dynamics of galaxies , and can also provide a measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe . 
 = = = Masers = = = 
 In 1963 , the telescope discovered OH emissions from star @-@ forming regions and giant stars ; the first astronomical masers . OH masers emit on four frequencies around 18 cm ( 7 in ) , which are easily observable on the telescope . As part of MERLIN , the telescope is regularly used to construct maps of maser regions . 
 = = = Pulsars = = = 
 In 1968 , the telescope observed the coordinates of the recently discovered pulsar , confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure . It was also used to make the first detection of polarization of the pulsar 's radiation . This marked the start of a substantial amount of work investigating pulsars at Jodrell , which is still ongoing . In the 30 years following the discovery of pulsars , the telescope discovered over 100 new pulsars ( and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2 / 3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes ) . 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell , or a nearby 42 @-@ foot ( 13 @-@ m ) dish . 
 The telescope was involved in the discovery of millisecond pulsars , and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986 — a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 globular cluster . In September 2006 , the results of three years of observing a double pulsar , PSR <unk> @-@ 3039 , with the Lovell telescope , as well as with the Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes , were announced — confirming that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99 @.@ 5 % . 
 = = = Gravitational lensing = = = 
 Between 1972 and 1973 , the telescope was used for " a detailed survey of the radio sources in a limited area of the sky … up to the sensitivity limit of the instrument " . Among the objects catalogued was the first gravitational lens , which was confirmed optically in 1979 after its position was found to coincide with a pair of faint blue stars by using the Mark I as an interferometer with the Mark II . The telescope was also involved in the detection of the first Einstein ring in 1998 , in conjunction with observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope . 
 = = = Quasars and Interferometry = = = 
 The early investigation into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of interferometry techniques in the 1950s ; the Lovell telescope had an advantage due to its large collecting area , meaning that high sensitivity interferometer measurements can be made relatively quickly using it . As a result , the telescope featured heavily in the discovery of quasars . 
 Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started before the Lovell telescope was constructed , using the Transit Telescope with a 35 square meter broadside array to determine the size of radio @-@ loud nebulae . Once construction of the Lovell telescope was complete , the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer . This was then used to determine the 2D shape of quasars on the sky . In the summer of 1961 , a 25 @-@ foot ( 8 @-@ m ) diameter paraboloid telescope was constructed ( it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar ) . This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I , with a resolution of 0 @.@ 3 arcseconds , to determine the sizes of some high @-@ redshift ( z ~ 0 @.@ 86 ) quasars . 
 The Mark II telescope once constructed was also used as an interferometer with the Lovell telescope . This has a baseline of 425 m ( 1 @,@ 394 ft ) ( meaning that it can synthesize a telescope with 425 m diameter ) , giving it a resolution of around 0 @.@ 5 arcminutes . This telescope pair has been used to carry out survey work , and to determine the positions of faint radio objects . Also , one of the drivers behind the construction of the Mark III was to use it as an interferometer with the Mark I to carry out a survey of radio sources . 
 The telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968 , with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada . It was first used as an interferometer with the Arecibo radio telescope in 1969 . 
 In 1980 , it was used as part of the new MERLIN array with a series of smaller radio telescopes controlled from Jodrell Bank . With baselines of up to 217 km ( 135 mi ) , this gave a resolution around 0 @.@ 05 arcminutes . An upgraded version of this became a national facility in 1992 . It has also been used in Very Long Baseline Interferometry , with telescopes across Europe ( the European VLBI Network ) , giving a resolution of around 0 @.@ 001 arcseconds . Around half of the telescope 's observing time is now spent doing interferometry with other telescopes . It is planned that the telescope will work as part of an interferometer with the <unk> ( Russian ) and VLBI Space Observatory Programme ( Japanese ) orbital radio satellites , providing yet larger baselines and higher resolutions .

 The telescope was used as a follow @-@ up instrument for possible SETI detections made at Arecibo between 1998 and the end of 2003 . No signals were detected . In February 2005 , astronomers using the Lovell Telescope discovered the galaxy <unk> that appears to be made almost entirely of dark matter .

 A 1 : 200 scale model of the telescope , made in 1961 , resides in the Science Museum , London . 
 In 1962 , the telescope was mentioned in a sci @-@ fi novel A for Andromeda , by Fred Hoyle and John Elliot . 
 The 1981 Doctor Who episode Logopolis , which was filmed at <unk> Park , used a model of the Lovell Telescope as the Pharos Project , from which the Doctor played by Tom Baker fell and regenerated . The model was based on the Mark I telescope , but it also featured some modifications from the Mark IA telescope such as the rim around the edge of the dish . 
 Actress Sophie Aldred portrayed the Seventh Doctor 's companion Ace McShane , standing on both the superstructure and dish in the 1990 Doctor Who educational special , " Search Out Science : Search Out Space " . 
 In 1992 , the telescope was featured on the cover of Sub Sub 's " Space Face " single . 
 The telescope also made a brief appearance in the film version of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy in 2005 . 
 Three bands have shot music videos in the bowl of the telescope : D : Ream in 1995 ( Party Up the World ) , Placebo in 2003 ( " The Bitter End " ) , and Public Service Broadcasting in 2015 ( " Sputnik " ) . Long shots of the telescope feature in the music video of Secret Messages by ELO . 
 The Royal Mail depicted the telescope as " J for Jodrell Bank " in their alphabetical landmarks stamp series ; it has also previously featured on stamps from Haiti , Hungary , Ascension Island , Barbuda , Liechtenstein and Tanzania .

 The Ingenuity Gap is a non @-@ fiction book by Canadian academic Thomas Homer @-@ Dixon . It was written over the course of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf . The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is not keeping pace . Homer @-@ Dixon focuses upon complexities , unexpected non @-@ linear results , and emergent properties . He takes an inter @-@ disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology , economics , history , and ecology . 
 After Robert D. Kaplan referenced Homer @-@ Dixon 's work in the 1994 The Atlantic Monthly article , " The Coming Anarchy " , Homer @-@ Dixon was offered a book deal . He spent the next half decade preparing until it was finally published in 2000 in North America and the United Kingdom . While it spent three weeks at # 1 on a Canadian best @-@ seller list , it did not sell many copies in the United States . Critics were pleased with Homer @-@ Dixon 's scholarship , straightforward presentation , and the book 's breadth but some found the writing to have a self @-@ indulgent quality . Homer @-@ Dixon was awarded the Governor General 's Award for English language non @-@ fiction in 2001 and the book went on to be translated into French and Spanish . 
 = = Background = = 
 Author Thomas Homer @-@ Dixon was a 44 @-@ year @-@ old academic and director at the University of Toronto 's Peace and Conflict Studies program at the time of publication . While the book took eight years to write , Homer @-@ Dixon had been developing the ideas behind it for most of his career . As a youth , an interest in current events was fostered by his parents and led him to study causes of human violence at university . He graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts and , in 1989 , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a doctorate in Political science . He accepted the director position at the Peace and Conflict Studies program in 1990 . Homer @-@ Dixon and his theories were featured in an article written by Robert D. Kaplan , in the February 1994 edition of The Atlantic Monthly , entitled " The Coming Anarchy " . The article made him into an emerging academic celebrity and resulted in several book deal offers . By 1997 Homer @-@ Dixon , working out of his home office , had accumulated more than 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of paper and was overwhelmed by the project , stating , " I 'm living the problem I 'm describing . " In 1999 , Homer @-@ Dixon and Princeton University Press published Environment , Scarcity , and Violence containing Homer @-@ Dixon 's research on resource scarcity leading to violence . For The Ingenuity Gap , he re @-@ organized the framework along three strands , thematic , geographical , and metaphoric , and structured it like a travelogue from which he could launch examples . 
 = = Content = = 
 Homer @-@ Dixon begins by presenting his personal and academic background that led to the drafting of this book . He establishes that the nature of problems are becoming overly burdensome , including providing resources for exponentially growing populations , managing international environmental impacts , and creating a secure global economic market . Modern problems often contain numerous factors that interact to create hidden complexities and non @-@ linear results . The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis is used to illustrate a system in which professed experts had confidence in but internal and external factors compounded upon each other to create a sudden , unexpected drop . The delusion of control , or the assumption that experts were in control , led to overconfidence in an economic system that was not well understood . Homer @-@ Dixon finds that the experts are just as susceptible to <unk> as non @-@ experts and that they have boundless capacity for hindsight rationalization of unexpected movements . 
 As older problems are solved , more complexities are being introduced , like adding additional parts to an engine . Interaction of these new parts , or niches , create emergent properties , like time @-@ saving office devices ( e.g. email , mobile computers , etc . ) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and increase the amount of time spent on such duties . Homer @-@ Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity . However , this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created , like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy . Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system 's complexity . Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence . 
 Homer @-@ Dixon explains how his theory was influenced by endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital . He distinguishes his stance from Neo @-@ <unk> which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem . Several problems in advancing basic science are identified : human cognitive limits , intrinsic complexity of field , limits of scientific institutions , and social and cultural values regarding science .

 The Ingenuity Gap is a popular science book . Homer @-@ Dixon takes an inter @-@ disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology , economics , history , biology , and ecology . The narrative is structured as a travelogue as the author travels to meet experts and construct his theory . His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research . Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor . He includes anecdotes and social commentary .

 The book was published in September 2000 as a hardcover , and Homer @-@ Dixon shortly after began a 10 @-@ city tour across Canada with stops in Toronto , Ottawa , Kingston , Hamilton , London , Winnipeg , Calgary , Edmonton , Vancouver , and Victoria , amongst several other smaller venues . Promotional events were also held in the United States and England . It was published by Knopf in North America and by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom . An excerpt was published in the October issue of Report on Business Magazine . In the Canadian market , the book spent seven weeks on the Maclean 's nonfiction best sellers ' list , including three weeks at the # 1 spot . It did not sell well in the United States . Homer @-@ Dixon was awarded the 2001 Governor General 's Award for English language non @-@ fiction for the book . The trade paperback was released a year after the hardcover edition . It was translated into French and published in 2002 by Éditions du Boréal . A Spanish version was published by <unk> in 2003 . Homer @-@ Dixon went on to write a similar book , The Upside of Down : Catastrophe , Creativity , and the Renewal of Civilization , in which he elaborates upon the idea that societies are becoming less able to cope with problems , like global warming or population imbalances , as complexities compound each other and the readily available resources , like fossil fuels , are rapidly consumed . 
 The book 's scholarship was very well received by critics . The research behind the book was called impressive for its breadth , and its presentation was said to be straightforward and thought @-@ provoking . Critics called Homer @-@ Dixon 's writing clear , accessible , and engaging . In his review in the Quill & Quire , Mark <unk> wrote " [ d ] espite the book 's serious import and prodigious endnotes , The Ingenuity Gap is a surprisingly engaging and even exciting read . Homer @-@ Dixon spins parables masterfully , using comprehensible examples to represent the almost incomprehensible complexity of our social system . " The Library Journal highly recommended it for academic and general public libraries . Several critics were disappointed by the lack of recommendations to address the problems he raises . The reviewers for Books in Canada , The Canadian Geographer , and the National Post found Homer @-@ Dixon 's writing self @-@ indulgent because it overly details his travels and experiences , and because of his overly authoritative tone that compliments people that agree with him and shows little consideration of differing perspectives . 
 = Report of 1800 = 
 The Report of 1800 was a resolution drafted by James Madison arguing for the sovereignty of the individual states under the United States Constitution and against the Alien and Sedition Acts . Adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in January 1800 , the Report amends arguments from the 1798 Virginia Resolutions and attempts to resolve contemporary criticisms against the Resolutions . The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the 1817 Bonus Bill veto message by Madison , who has come to be regarded as the " Father of the Constitution . " 
 The arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832 , when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state . Madison rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice . Whether Madison 's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement , and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period , are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature . 
 = = Background = = 
 Madison , a member of the Democratic @-@ Republican Party , was elected to the Democratic @-@ Republican @-@ dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799 . A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly 's 1798 Virginia Resolutions , of which Madison had been the draftsman . The Resolutions , usually discussed together with Thomas Jefferson 's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions , were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist @-@ dominated national government . The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts , four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will , required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens , and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials . Democratic @-@ Republicans were outraged by the legislation , and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures . 
 The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures . Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval , with the other four states taking no action . No other state endorsed the Resolutions . The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly , led in the effort by state @-@ sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline , had put a state @-@ sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison 's hopes . These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional , and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary . The Federalists accused the Democratic @-@ Republicans of seeking disunion , even contemplating violence . At the time , some leading Virginia Democratic @-@ Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles ( in public ) and Taylor ( in private ) actually were contemplating disunion , and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond , so there was some truth to the charge . 
 Jefferson , the leader of the Democratic @-@ Republican Party and then – Vice President , wrote to Madison in August 1799 outlining a campaign to strengthen public support for the principles expressed in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 ( commonly referred to as " the principles of ' 98 " ) : 
 That the principles already advanced by Virginia & Kentucky are not to be yielded in silence , I presume we all agree . I should propose a declaration of Resolution by their legislatures on this plan . 1st . Answer the reasonings of such of the states as have ventured in the field of reason , & that of the Committee of Congress . ... 2 . Make a firm protestation against the principle & the precedent ; and a reservation of the rights resulting to us from these palpable violations of the constitutional compact by the Federal government , ... 3 . Express in affectionate and conciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister @-@ states , and to the instrument & principles by which we are united ; … fully confident that the good sense of the American people and their attachment to rally with us round the true principle of our federal compact . But determined , were we to be disappointed in this , to sever ourselves from that union we so much value , rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved , & in which alone we see liberty , safety & happiness . 
 In response to this letter , Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello during the first week of September . Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union , which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above . At the very least , Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic @-@ Republicans . Madison won over Jefferson , who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that : " From [ this position ] I retreat readily , not only in deference to [ Madison 's ] judgment but because as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations , so these , when they occur , will be cause enough of themselves . " Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon , examining Jefferson 's later writing , conclude that Madison had a significant role " in softening Jefferson 's more extreme views . " 
 Jefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at Montpelier on his way to Philadelphia , the national capital , for the winter session of the United States Congress . However , James Monroe , who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year , visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison , since another meeting between two of the most important Democratic @-@ Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment . The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison . Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a November 26 letter to Madison in which he identified " protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution " as one of the four primary elements of the Democratic @-@ Republican Party plan . 
 = = Production and passage = = 
 The Assembly session began in early December . Once at Richmond , Madison began drafting the Report , though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery . On December 23 , Madison moved for the creation of a special seven @-@ member committee with himself as chairman to respond to " certain answers from several of the states , relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session . " The committee members were Madison , John Taylor , William Branch Giles , George Keith Taylor , John Wise , John Mercer , and William Daniel . The next day , Christmas Eve , the committee produced a first version of the Report . The measure came before the House of Delegates , the lower house of the General Assembly , on January 2 . 
 Though certain to pass due to the Democratic @-@ Republican majority , which had recently been solidified by the election of a Democratic @-@ Republican clerk and speaker of the House , the Report was debated for five days . The main point of contention was the meaning of the third of the Virginia Resolutions : 
 this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare , that it views the powers of the federal government , as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties ; ... and that in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by said compact , the states who are parties thereto have the right … to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil … the authorities , rights , and liberties appertaining to them . 
 This resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions . Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact . The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when the Virginians claimed that the " states " were parties to the federal Constitution , the referent of the word " state " was the sovereign people of the particular state . Thus , to say that " the state of Virginia ratified the Constitution " was to say that the sovereign people of Virginia ratified the Constitution . The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40 . At some point in the next two weeks , it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6 . 
 The Report was received warmly by Virginia Democratic @-@ Republicans . The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state , but there was not much public response to the Report , and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 ( which was , nevertheless , a major victory for the Democratic @-@ Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies ) . Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions , and in other states there was very little public comment . Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic @-@ Republican members of Congress departing for their home states , and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce . Despite Jefferson 's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison 's work , the national reaction was tepid . Though it had little impact on the immediate election , Madison 's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states ' rights in general , particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy . 
 = = Argument = = 
 The general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles expressed in the Virginia Resolutions . The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures . Madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that the Acts violated the constitution . Laying into the Acts in his Report , Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits . The Alien Act granted the President the <unk> power of deporting friendly aliens . Contrary to the Sedition Act , the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack , beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen ; indeed , such special intervention against the press was " expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution . " As well , Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional . 
 To remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts , Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech . Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to " a protection of those who administer the government , if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people , against being exposed to it . " Freedom of the press was necessary , because " chequered as it is with abuses , the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression . " The Report supported a strict interpretation of the First Amendment . While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press , but implying that such power existed , Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press . 
 More generally , the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states , for which it is best known . The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact , and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power . This doctrine is known as the compact theory . It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic @-@ Republicans as leaning toward secession ; in the amended Report the line is moderated , with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people ( and therefore , one reads in , not the state legislatures alone ) which possess this power . Either formulation would help the Democratic @-@ Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary , both of which were dominated by Federalists . 
 In defense of Virginia Democratic @-@ Republicans and the Resolutions , Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory , the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests , which states were surely entitled to produce . Madison indicated that a declaration of unconstitutionality would be an expression of opinion , with no legal force . The purpose of such a declaration , said Madison , was to mobilize public opinion . Madison indicated that the power to make binding constitutional determinations remained in the federal courts : 
 It has been said , that it belongs to the judiciary of the United States , and not the state legislatures , to declare the meaning of the Federal Constitution . ... [ T ] he declarations of [ the citizens or the state legislature ] , whether affirming or denying the constitutionality of measures of the Federal Government ... are expressions of opinion , unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion , by exciting reflection . The expositions of the judiciary , on the other hand , are carried into immediate effect by force . The former may lead to a change in the legislative expression of the general will ; possibly to a change in the opinion of the judiciary ; the latter enforces the general will , whilst that will and that opinion continue unchanged . 
 Madison argued that a state , after declaring a federal law unconstitutional , could take action by communicating with other states , attempting to enlist their support , petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question , introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress , or calling a constitutional convention . Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable . By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion , Madison tried to make clear that the Democratic @-@ Republicans were not moving toward disunion . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Democratic @-@ Republican principles . Spencer Roane described it as " the Magna Charta on which the republicans settled down , after the great struggle in the year 1799 . " Henry Clay said on the floor of the House of Representatives that it was from the Report of 1800 , above other documents , that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation . H. Jefferson Powell , a modern jurist , identifies three persistent themes of Democratic @-@ Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report : ( 1 ) a textual approach to the Constitution , ( 2 ) the compact theory , and ( 3 ) that caution , not trust , should characterize our approach to those who hold political power . 
 In more recent years , the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment . Multiple Supreme Court decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers ' ideas on free speech . In the 1957 Roth v. United States opinion by William Brennan , Madison 's Report is cited as evidence that " the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well @-@ being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth . " Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include Thornhill v. Alabama ( 1940 ) and Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC ( 2000 ) . 
 In modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states ' rights with regard to federalism and republicanism . According to Kevin <unk> , the Report , together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions , forms a foundation for the " radical southern states ' rights tradition . " However , Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro @-@ nullification Southerners . The Report of 1800 , Madison argued , did not say the government was a compact of the individual states , as the pro @-@ nullification elements suggested . Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of " the people in each of the States , acting in their highest sovereign capacity . " The state governments themselves , no less than the federal judiciary , possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance . Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not . 
 = Pericles = 
 Pericles ( / <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ̂ ːs ] in Classical Attic ; c . 495 – 429 BC ) was arguably the most prominent and influential Greek statesman , orator and general of Athens during the Golden Age — specifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars . He was descended , through his mother , from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family . 
 Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that Thucydides , a contemporary historian , acclaimed him as " the first citizen of Athens " . Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire , and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War . The period during which he led Athens , roughly from 461 to 429 BC , is sometimes known as the " Age of Pericles " , though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars , or as late as the next century . 
 Pericles promoted the arts and literature ; it is principally through his efforts that Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world . He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis ( including the Parthenon ) . This project beautified and protected the city , exhibited its glory , and gave work to the people . Pericles also fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that critics call him a populist . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Pericles was born c . 495 BC , in Athens , Greece . He was the son of the politician Xanthippus , who , though ostracized in 485 – 484 BC , returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale just five years later . Pericles ' mother , Agariste , a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae , and her familial connections played a crucial role in <unk> Xanthippus ' political career . Agariste was the great @-@ granddaughter of the tyrant of Sicyon , Cleisthenes , and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes . 
 According to Herodotus and Plutarch , Agariste dreamed , a few nights before Pericles ' birth , that she had borne a lion . Interestingly , legends say that Philip II of Macedon had a similar dream before the birth of his son , Alexander the Great . One interpretation of the dream treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness , but the story may also allude to the unusually large size of Pericles ' skull , which became a popular target of contemporary comedians ( who called him " Squill @-@ head " , after the Squill or Sea @-@ Onion ) . Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet , this is not the case ; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as strategos ( general ) . 
 Pericles belonged to the tribe of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . His early years were quiet ; the introverted young Pericles avoided public appearances , instead preferring to devote his time to his studies . 
 His family 's nobility and wealth allowed him to fully pursue his inclination toward education . He learned music from the masters of the time ( Damon or <unk> could have been his teacher ) and he is considered to have been the first politician to attribute importance to philosophy . He enjoyed the company of the philosophers Protagoras , Zeno of Elea , and Anaxagoras . Anaxagoras , in particular , became a close friend and influenced him greatly . 
 Pericles ' manner of thought and rhetorical charisma may have been in part products of Anaxagoras ' emphasis on emotional calm in the face of trouble and skepticism about divine phenomena . His proverbial calmness and self @-@ control are also often regarded as products of Anaxagoras ' influence .

 In the spring of 472 BC , Pericles presented The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy , demonstrating that he was one of the wealthier men of Athens . Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles ' selection of this play , which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles ' famous victory at Salamis , shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon , whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards . 
 Plutarch says that Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years . If this was so , Pericles must have taken up a position of leadership by the early 460s <unk> in his early or mid @-@ thirties . Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and to present himself as a model for his fellow citizens . For example , he would often avoid banquets , trying to be frugal . 
 In 463 BC , Pericles was the leading prosecutor of Cimon , the leader of the conservative faction who was accused of neglecting Athens ' vital interests in Macedon . Although Cimon was acquitted , this confrontation proved that Pericles ' major political opponent was vulnerable . 
 = = = <unk> Cimon = = = 
 Around 461 BC , the leadership of the democratic party decided it was time to take aim at the Areopagus , a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy , which had once been the most powerful body in the state . The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles , Ephialtes , proposed a reduction of the Areopagus ' powers . The Ecclesia ( the Athenian Assembly ) adopted Ephialtes ' proposal without opposition . This reform signaled the beginning of a new era of " radical democracy " . 
 The democratic party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics , and Pericles seemed willing to follow a populist policy in order to cajole the public . According to Aristotle , Pericles ' stance can be explained by the fact that his principal political opponent , Cimon , was both rich and generous , and was able to gain public favor by lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune . The historian Loren J. Samons II argues , however , that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means , had he so chosen . 
 In 461 BC , Pericles achieved the political elimination of this opponent using ostracism . The accusation was that Cimon betrayed his city by aiding Sparta . 
 After Cimon 's ostracism , Pericles continued to promote a populist social policy . He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying , with the state covering the cost of their admission . With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458 – 457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the <unk> ( the supreme court of Athens ) some time just after 454 BC . His most controversial measure , however , was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides . 
 Such measures impelled Pericles ' critics to hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy . Constantine Paparrigopoulos , a major modern Greek historian , argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions . Hence , he enacted legislation granting the lower classes access to the political system and the public offices , from which they had previously been barred . 
 According to Samons , Pericles believed that it was necessary to raise the demos , in which he saw an untapped source of Athenian power and the crucial element of Athenian military dominance . ( The fleet , backbone of Athenian power since the days of Themistocles , was manned almost entirely by members of the lower classes . ) 
 Cimon , on the other hand , apparently believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed . He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles ' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism . According to Paparrigopoulos , history vindicated Cimon , because Athens , after Pericles ' death , sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy . Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city , whose glory perished as a result of Pericles ' populist policies . 
 According to another historian , Justin Daniel King , radical democracy benefited people individually , but harmed the state . On the other hand , Donald Kagan asserts that the democratic measures Pericles put into effect provided the basis for an unassailable political strength . After all , Cimon finally accepted the new democracy and did not oppose the citizenship law , after he returned from exile in 451 BC . 
 = = = Leading Athens = = = 
 Ephialtes ' murder in 461 BC paved the way for Pericles to consolidate his authority . Without opposition after the expulsion of Cimon , the unchallengeable leader of the democratic party became the unchallengeable ruler of Athens . He remained in power until his death in 429 BC . 
 = = = = First Peloponnesian War = = = = 
 Pericles made his first military excursions during the First Peloponnesian War , which was caused in part by Athens ' alliance with Megara and Argos and the subsequent reaction of Sparta . In 454 BC he attacked Sicyon and Acarnania . He then unsuccessfully tried to conquer <unk> on the Corinthian gulf , before returning to Athens . In 451 BC , Cimon returned from exile and negotiated a five years ' truce with Sparta after a proposal of Pericles , an event which indicates a shift in Pericles ' political strategy . Pericles may have realized the importance of Cimon 's contribution during the ongoing conflicts against the Peloponnesians and the Persians . Anthony J. <unk> argues , however , that Pericles ' alleged change of position was invented by ancient writers to support " a tendentious view of Pericles ' <unk> " . 
 Plutarch states that Cimon struck a power @-@ sharing deal with his opponents , according to which Pericles would carry through the interior affairs and Cimon would be the leader of the Athenian army , campaigning abroad . If it was actually made , this bargain would constitute a concession on Pericles ' part that he was not a great strategist . Kagan believes that Cimon adapted himself to the new conditions and promoted a political marriage between Periclean liberals and <unk> conservatives . 
 In the mid @-@ 450s the Athenians launched an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia , which led to a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the Nile Delta . The campaign culminated in disaster ; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed . In 451 – 450 BC the Athenians sent troops to Cyprus . Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis @-@ in @-@ Cyprus , but died of disease in 449 BC . Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus , although some researchers , such as Karl Julius <unk> , argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon 's policy . 
 Complicating the account of this period is the issue of the Peace of Callias , which allegedly ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians . The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed , and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous . Ernst <unk> believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC ( making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace ) , and renegotiated at the conclusion of the campaign in Cyprus , taking force again by 449 – 448 BC . 
 John Fine , on the other hand , suggests that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450 – 449 BC , due to Pericles ' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens ' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean . Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias , a brother @-@ in @-@ law of Cimon , as a symbol of unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements . 
 In the spring of 449 BC , Pericles proposed the Congress Decree , which led to a meeting ( " Congress " ) of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians . The Congress failed because of Sparta 's stance , but Pericles ' intentions remain unclear . Some historians think that he wanted to prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities ; others think he wanted to assert Athenian pre @-@ eminence . According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the Delian League and for the collection of " <unk> " ( taxes ) . 
 During the Second Sacred War Pericles led the Athenian army against Delphi and reinstated Phocis in its sovereign rights on the oracle . In 447 BC Pericles engaged in his most admired excursion , the expulsion of barbarians from the Thracian peninsula of Gallipoli , in order to establish Athenian colonists in the region . At this time , however , Athens was seriously challenged by a number of revolts among its subjects . In 447 BC the oligarchs of Thebes conspired against the democratic faction . The Athenians demanded their immediate surrender , but after the Battle of Coronea , Pericles was forced to concede the loss of Boeotia in order to recover the prisoners taken in that battle . With Boeotia in hostile hands , Phocis and Locris became untenable and quickly fell under the control of hostile oligarchs . 
 In 446 BC , a more dangerous uprising erupted . Euboea and Megara revolted . Pericles crossed over to Euboea with his troops , but was forced to return when the Spartan army invaded Attica . Through bribery and negotiations , Pericles defused the imminent threat , and the Spartans returned home . When Pericles was later audited for the handling of public money , an expenditure of 10 talents was not sufficiently justified , since the official documents just referred that the money was spent for a " very serious purpose " . Nonetheless , the " serious purpose " ( namely the bribery ) was so obvious to the auditors that they approved the expenditure without official meddling and without even investigating the mystery . 
 After the Spartan threat had been removed , Pericles crossed back to Euboea to crush the revolt there . He then punished the landowners of Chalcis , who lost their properties . The residents of Histiaea , meanwhile , who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme , were uprooted and replaced by 2 @,@ 000 Athenian settlers . The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years ' Peace ( winter of 446 – 445 BC ) , in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460 BC , and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt to win over the other state 's allies . 
 = = = = Final battle with the conservatives = = = = 
 In 444 BC , the conservative and the democratic factions confronted each other in a fierce struggle . The ambitious new leader of the conservatives , Thucydides ( not to be confused with the historian of the same name ) , accused Pericles of profligacy , criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan . Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regrading these charges in his favor . However , when Pericles took the floor , his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive . Finally , Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property , with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name . His stance was greeted with applause , and Thucydides was soundly , if unexpectedly , defeated . In 442 BC , the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena . 
 = = = = Athens ' rule over its alliance = = = = 
 Pericles wanted to stabilize Athens ' dominance over its alliance and to enforce its pre @-@ eminence in Greece . The process by which the Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles ' time , as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league 's fleet , but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles . 
 The final steps in the shift to empire may have been triggered by Athens ' defeat in Egypt , which challenged the city 's dominance in the Aegean and led to the revolt of several allies , such as Miletus and Erythrae . Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies , or as a pretext to gain control of the League 's finances , Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454 – 453 BC . 
 By 450 – 449 BC the revolts in Miletus and Erythrae were quelled and Athens restored its rule over its allies . Around 447 BC <unk> proposed the Coinage Decree , which imposed Athenian silver coinage , weights and measures on all of the allies . According to one of the decree 's most stringent provisions , surplus from a minting operation was to go into a special fund , and anyone proposing to use it otherwise was subject to the death penalty . 
 It was from the alliance 's treasury that Pericles drew the funds necessary to enable his ambitious building plan , centered on the " Periclean Acropolis " , which included the Propylaea , the Parthenon and the golden statue of Athena , sculpted by Pericles ' friend , Phidias . In 449 BC Pericles proposed a decree allowing the use of 9 @,@ 000 talents to finance the major rebuilding program of Athenian temples . Angelos Vlachos , a Greek Academician , points out the utilization of the alliance 's treasury , initiated and executed by Pericles , as one of the largest <unk> in human history ; this misappropriation financed , however , some of the most marvellous artistic creations of the ancient world . 
 = = = = Samian War = = = = 
 The Samian War was one of the last significant military events before the Peloponnesian War . After Thucydides ' ostracism , Pericles was re @-@ elected yearly to the generalship , the only office he ever officially occupied , although his influence was so great as to make him the de facto ruler of the state . In 440 BC Samos went to war against Miletus over control of Priene , an ancient city of Ionia on the foot @-@ hills of Mycale . <unk> in the war , the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians . 
 When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration in Athens , the Samians refused . In response , Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos , " alleging against its people that , although they were ordered to break off their war against the Milesians , they were not complying " . 
 In a naval battle the Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals defeated the forces of Samos and imposed on the island an Athenian administration . When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule , Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months , which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors . Pericles then quelled a revolt in Byzantium and , when he returned to Athens , gave a funeral oration to honor the soldiers who died in the expedition . 
 Between 438 – 436 BC Pericles led Athens ' fleet in Pontus and established friendly relations with the Greek cities of the region . Pericles focused also on internal projects , such as the fortification of Athens ( the building of the " middle wall " about 440 BC ) , and on the creation of new <unk> , such as Andros , Naxos and Thurii ( 444 BC ) as well as Amphipolis ( 437 – 436 BC ) . 
 = = = = Personal attacks = = = = 
 Pericles and his friends were never immune from attack , as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule . Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War , Pericles and two of his closest associates , Phidias and his companion , Aspasia , faced a series of personal and judicial attacks . 
 Phidias , who had been in charge of all building projects , was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety , because , when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena , he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man , and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon . 
 Aspasia , who was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser , was accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles ' perversions . The accusations against her were probably nothing more than unproven slanders , but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles . Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles , his friend , Phidias , died in prison and another friend of his , Anaxagoras , was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs . 
 Beyond these initial prosecutions , the ecclesia attacked Pericles himself by asking him to justify his ostensible profligacy with , and maladministration of , public money . According to Plutarch , Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial that he did not let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians . <unk> also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home . Thus , at the start of the Peloponnesian War , Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre @-@ eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade . 
 = = Peloponnesian War = = 
 The causes of the Peloponnesian War have been much debated , but many ancient historians lay the blame on Pericles and Athens . Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war , scrambling to implement their belligerent tactics " with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife " . Thucydides hints at the same thing , believing the reason for the war was Sparta 's fear of Athenian power and growth . However , as he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles , Thucydides has been criticized for bias towards Sparta . 
 = = = Prelude to the war = = = 
 Pericles was convinced that the war against Sparta , which could not conceal its envy of Athens ' pre @-@ eminence , was inevitable if unfortunate . Therefore , he did not hesitate to send troops to Corcyra to reinforce the <unk> fleet , which was fighting against Corinth . In 433 BC the enemy fleets confronted each other at the Battle of <unk> and a year later the Athenians fought Corinthian colonists at the Battle of Potidaea ; these two events contributed greatly to Corinth 's lasting hatred of Athens . During the same period , Pericles proposed the Megarian Decree , which resembled a modern trade embargo . According to the provisions of the decree , Megarian merchants were excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire . This ban strangled the Megarian economy and strained the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta , which was allied with Megara . According to George Cawkwell , a <unk> in ancient history , with this decree Pericles breached the Thirty Years ' Peace " but , perhaps , not without the semblance of an excuse " . The Athenians ' justification was that the <unk> had cultivated the sacred land consecrated to Demeter and had given refuge to runaway slaves , a behavior which the Athenians considered to be impious . 
 After consultations with its allies , Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions , such as the immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree , threatening war if the demands were not met . The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people ; this event , indeed , would come about a few years later . At that time , the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles ' instructions . In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth , Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents ' demands , since they were militarily stronger . Pericles was not prepared to make unilateral concessions , believing that " if Athens conceded on that issue , then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands " . Consequently , Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a quid pro quo . In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree , the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory ( <unk> ) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities , a request implying that Sparta 's hegemony was also ruthless . The terms were rejected by the Spartans , and with neither side willing to back down , the two cities prepared for war . According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos , professors of strategic studies and international politics , " rather than to submit to coercive demands , Pericles chose war " . Another consideration that may well have influenced Pericles ' stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed itself weak . 
 = = = First year of the war ( 431 BC ) = = = 
 In 431 BC , while peace already was precarious , Archidamus II , Sparta 's king , sent a new delegation to Athens , demanding that the Athenians submit to Sparta 's demands . This deputation was not allowed to enter Athens , as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions . The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth , and , citing this as a hostile action , the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries . With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined , Archidamus invaded Attica , but found no Athenians there ; Pericles , aware that Sparta 's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory , had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens . 
 No definite record exists of how exactly Pericles managed to convince the residents of Attica to agree to move into the crowded urban areas . For most , the move meant abandoning their land and ancestral shrines and completely changing their lifestyle . Therefore , although they agreed to leave , many rural residents were far from happy with Pericles ' decision . Pericles also gave his compatriots some advice on their present affairs and reassured them that , if the enemy did not plunder his farms , he would offer his property to the city . This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus , who was a friend of his , might pass by his estate without ravaging it , either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents . 
 In any case , seeing the pillage of their farms , the Athenians were outraged , and they soon began to indirectly express their discontent towards their leader , who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war . Even when in the face of mounting pressure , Pericles did not give in to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy . He also avoided convening the ecclesia , fearing that the populace , outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms , might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field . As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents , the " <unk> " , Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling ; rather , the respect in which Pericles was held by the <unk> was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished . While the Spartan army remained in Attica , Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the Peloponnese and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city . When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end , Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1 @,@ 000 talents and 100 ships , in case Athens was attacked by naval forces . According to the most stringent provision of the decree , even proposing a different use of the money or ships would entail the penalty of death . During the autumn of 431 BC , Pericles led the Athenian forces that invaded Megara and a few months later ( winter of 431 – 430 BC ) he delivered his monumental and emotional Funeral Oration , honoring the Athenians who died for their city . 
 = = = Last military operations and death = = = 
 In 430 BC , the army of Sparta looted Attica for a second time , but Pericles was not daunted and refused to revise his initial strategy . Unwilling to engage the Spartan army in battle , he again led a naval expedition to plunder the coasts of the Peloponnese , this time taking 100 Athenian ships with him . According to Plutarch , just before the sailing of the ships an eclipse of the sun frightened the crews , but Pericles used the astronomical knowledge he had acquired from Anaxagoras to calm them . In the summer of the same year an epidemic broke out and devastated the Athenians . The exact identity of the disease is uncertain , typhus or typhoid fever are suspected , but this has been the source of much debate . In any case , the city 's plight , caused by the epidemic , triggered a new wave of public uproar , and Pericles was forced to defend himself in an emotional final speech , a rendition of which is presented by Thucydides . This is considered to be a monumental oration , revealing Pericles ' virtues but also his bitterness towards his compatriots ' ingratitude . Temporarily , he managed to tame the people 's resentment and to ride out the storm , but his internal enemies ' final bid to undermine him came off ; they managed to deprive him of the generalship and to fine him at an amount estimated between 15 and 50 talents . Ancient sources mention Cleon , a rising and dynamic protagonist of the Athenian political scene during the war , as the public prosecutor in Pericles ' trial . 
 Nevertheless , within just a year , in 429 BC , the Athenians not only forgave Pericles but also re @-@ elected him as strategos . He was reinstated in command of the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC , having once again under his control the levers of power . In that year , however , Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife , Paralus and Xanthippus , in the epidemic . His morale undermined , he burst into tears and not even Aspasia 's companionship could console him . He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC . 
 Just before his death , Pericles ' friends were concentrated around his bed , enumerating his virtues during peace and underscoring his nine war trophies . Pericles , though moribund , heard them and interrupted them , pointing out that they forgot to mention his fairest and greatest title to their admiration ; " for " , said he , " no living Athenian ever put on mourning because of me " . Pericles lived during the first two and a half years of the Peloponnesian War and , according to Thucydides , his death was a disaster for Athens , since his successors were inferior to him ; they preferred to incite all the bad habits of the rabble and followed an unstable policy , endeavoring to be popular rather than useful . With these bitter comments , Thucydides not only laments the loss of a man he admired , but he also heralds the flickering of Athens ' unique glory and grandeur .

 = = Personal life = = 
 Pericles , following Athenian custom , was first married to one of his closest relatives , with whom he had two sons , Paralus and Xanthippus , but around 445 BC , Pericles divorced his wife . He offered her to another husband , with the agreement of her male relatives . The name of his first wife is not known ; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus , before being married to Pericles , and the mother of Callias from this first marriage . 
 The woman whom he really adored was Aspasia of Miletus . She became Pericles ' mistress and they began to live together as if they were married . This relationship aroused many reactions and even Pericles ' own son , Xanthippus , who had political ambitions , did not hesitate to slander his father . Nonetheless , these persecutions did not undermine Pericles ' morale , although he had to burst into tears in order to protect his beloved Aspasia when she was accused of corrupting Athenian society . His greatest personal tragedy was the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons , Xanthippus and Paralus , all affected by the epidemic , a calamity he never managed to overcome . Just before his death , the Athenians allowed a change in the law of 451 BC that made his half @-@ Athenian son with Aspasia , Pericles the Younger , a citizen and legitimate heir , a decision all the more striking in consideration that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides .

 Pericles marked a whole era and inspired conflicting judgments about his significant decisions . The fact that he was at the same time a vigorous statesman , general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions . 
 = = = Political leadership = = = 
 Some contemporary scholars call Pericles a populist , a demagogue and a hawk , while other scholars admire his charismatic leadership . According to Plutarch , after assuming the leadership of Athens , " he was no longer the same man as before , nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes " . It is told that when his political opponent , Thucydides , was asked by Sparta 's king , Archidamus , whether he or Pericles was the better fighter , Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better , because even when he was defeated , he managed to convince the audience that he had won . In matters of character , Pericles was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians , since " he kept himself untainted by corruption , although he was not altogether indifferent to money @-@ making " . 
 Thucydides , an admirer of Pericles , maintains that Athens was " in name a democracy but , in fact , governed by its first citizen " . Through this comment , the historian illustrates what he perceives as Pericles ' charisma to lead , convince and , sometimes , to manipulate . Although Thucydides mentions the fining of Pericles , he does not mention the accusations against Pericles but instead focuses on Pericles ' integrity . On the other hand , in one of his dialogues , Plato rejects the glorification of Pericles and quote as saying : " as I know , Pericles made the Athenians slothful , garrulous and avaricious , by starting the system of public fees " . Plutarch mentions other criticism of Pericles ' leadership : " many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands , festival @-@ grants , and distributions of fees for public services , thereby falling into bad habits , and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures , instead of frugal and self @-@ sufficing " . 
 Thucydides argues that Pericles " was not carried away by the people , but he was the one guiding the people " . His judgement is not unquestioned ; some 20th @-@ century critics , such as Malcolm F. McGregor and John S. Morrison , proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors , or the people themselves . According to King , by increasing the power of the people , the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader . During the Peloponnesian War , Pericles ' dependence on popular support to govern was obvious . 
 = = = Military achievements = = = 
 For more than 20 years Pericles led many expeditions , mainly naval ones . Being always cautious , he never undertook of his own accord a battle involving much uncertainty and peril and he did not accede to the " vain impulses of the citizens " . He based his military policy on Themistocles ' principle that Athens ' predominance depends on its superior naval power and believed that the Peloponnesians were near @-@ invincible on land . Pericles also tried to minimize the advantages of Sparta by rebuilding the walls of Athens , which , it has been suggested , radically altered the use of force in Greek international relations . 
 During the Peloponnesian War , Pericles initiated a defensive " grand strategy " whose aim was the exhaustion of the enemy and the preservation of the status quo . According to Platias and Koliopoulos , Athens as the strongest party did not have to beat Sparta in military terms and " chose to foil the Spartan plan for victory " . The two basic principles of the " Periclean Grand Strategy " were the rejection of appeasement ( in accordance with which he urged the Athenians not to revoke the Megarian Decree ) and the avoidance of overextension . According to Kagan , Pericles ' vehement insistence that there should be no diversionary expeditions may well have resulted from the bitter memory of the Egyptian campaign , which he had allegedly supported . His strategy is said to have been " inherently unpopular " , but Pericles managed to persuade the Athenian public to follow it . It is for that reason that Hans Delbrück called him one of the greatest statesmen and military leaders in history . Although his countrymen engaged in several aggressive actions soon after his death , Platias and Koliopoulos argue that the Athenians remained true to the larger Periclean strategy of seeking to preserve , not expand , the empire , and did not depart from it until the Sicilian Expedition . For his part , Ben X. de Wet concludes his strategy would have succeeded had he lived longer . 
 Critics of Pericles ' strategy , however , have been just as numerous as its supporters . A common criticism is that Pericles was always a better politician and orator than strategist . Donald Kagan called the Periclean strategy " a form of wishful thinking that failed " , Barry S. Strauss and Josiah Ober have stated that " as strategist he was a failure and deserves a share of the blame for Athens ' great defeat " , and Victor Davis Hanson believes that Pericles had not worked out a clear strategy for an effective offensive action that could possibly force Thebes or Sparta to stop the war . Kagan criticizes the Periclean strategy on four counts : first that by rejecting minor concessions it brought about war ; second , that it was unforeseen by the enemy and hence lacked credibility ; third , that it was too feeble to exploit any opportunities ; and fourth , that it depended on Pericles for its execution and thus was bound to be abandoned after his death . Kagan estimates Pericles ' expenditure on his military strategy in the Peloponnesian War to be about 2 @,@ 000 talents annually , and based on this figure concludes that he would only have enough money to keep the war going for three years . He asserts that since Pericles must have known about these limitations he probably planned for a much shorter war . Others , such as Donald W. Knight , conclude that the strategy was too defensive and would not succeed . 
 On the other hand , Platias and Koliopoulos reject these criticisms and state that " the Athenians lost the war only when they dramatically reversed the Periclean grand strategy that explicitly disdained further conquests " . Hanson stresses that the Periclean strategy was not innovative , but could lead to a stagnancy in favor of Athens . It is a popular conclusion that those succeeding him lacked his abilities and character . 
 = = = Oratorical skill = = = 
 Modern commentators of Thucydides , with other modern historians and writers , take varying stances on the issue of how much of the speeches of Pericles , as given by this historian , do actually represent Pericles ' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides . Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations , no historians are able to answer this with certainty ; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and , thereby , it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts . 
 Although Pericles was a main source of his inspiration , some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic literary style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides ' own cold and analytical writing style . This might , however , be the result of the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography . That is to say , Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes . 
 Ioannis Kakridis and Arnold Gomme were two scholars who debated the originality of Pericles ’ oratory and last speech . Kakridis believes that Thucydides altered Pericles words . Some of his strongest arguments included in the Introduction of the speech , ( <unk> ) . Kakridis proposes that it is impossible to imagine Pericles deviating away from the expected funeral orator addressing the mourning audience of 430 after the Peloponnesian war . The two groups addressed were the ones who were prepared to believe him when he praised the dead , and the ones who did not . Gomme rejects Kakridis position , defending the fact that " Nobody of men has ever been so conscious of envy and its workings as the Greeks , and that the Greeks and Thucydides in particular had a passion for covering all ground in their generalizations , not always <unk> . " . 
 Kagan states that Pericles adopted " an elevated mode of speech , free from the vulgar and <unk> tricks of mob @-@ orators " and , according to Diodorus Siculus , he " excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory " . According to Plutarch , he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches , unlike the passionate Demosthenes , and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner . The biographer points out , however , that the poet Ion reported that Pericles ' speaking style was " a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address , and that into his haughtiness there entered a good deal of disdain and contempt for others " . 
 Gorgias , in Plato 's homonymous dialogue , uses Pericles as an example of powerful oratory . In Menexenus , however , Socrates ( through Plato ) casts aspersions on Pericles ' rhetorical fame , claiming ironically that , since Pericles was educated by Aspasia , a trainer of many orators , he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon . He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries ' veneration of Pericles . 
 Sir Richard C. Jebb concludes that " unique as an Athenian statesman , Pericles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator ; first , because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained ; secondly , because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians " . 
 Ancient Greek writers call Pericles " Olympian " and extol his talents ; referring to him " thundering and lightening and exciting Greece " and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating . According to Quintilian , Pericles would always prepare assiduously for his orations and , before going on the rostrum , he would always pray to the Gods , so as not to utter any improper word . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Pericles ' most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of the Golden Age , most of which survive to this day . The Acropolis , though in ruins , still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens . Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are " sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world " . 
 In politics , Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles ' legacy is Athenian imperialism , which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state . The promotion of such an arrogant imperialism is said to have ruined Athens . Pericles and his " expansionary " policies have been at the center of arguments promoting democracy in oppressed countries . 
 Other analysts maintain an Athenian humanism illustrated in the Golden Age . The freedom of expression is regarded as the lasting legacy deriving from this period . Pericles is lauded as " the ideal type of the perfect statesman in ancient Greece " and his Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride . 
 = <unk> stingaree = 
 The crossback stingaree or banded stingaree ( Urolophus cruciatus ) is a species of stingray in the family Urolophidae . It is endemic to southeastern Australia , mainly off Victoria and Tasmania but also marginally to New South Wales and South Australia .. This bottom @-@ dwelling fish generally inhabits sand and reef habitats deeper than 100 m ( 330 ft ) off Victoria , and muddy habitats in shallow bays and estuaries off Tasmania . <unk> its name , the crossback stingaree has a distinctive dark pattern on its back , consisting of a midline stripe that is crossed by three transverse bars . It has an oval pectoral fin disc with a blunt snout and a skirt @-@ shaped curtain of skin between the nostrils . Its tail is short with no skin fold along the sides , and a deep , leaf @-@ shaped caudal fin . The youngest rays may have a small dorsal fin in front of the stinging tail spine . This species reaches 50 cm ( 20 in ) in length . 
 During the day the crossback stingaree is usually inactive and can be found partially or completely buried in sand on the sea floor . It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans , polychaete worms and other small invertebrates on the seafloor . Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods , amphipods and shrimps . 
 The species is aplacental viviparous , with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother . Females bear litters of up to four pups every other year , after a gestation period of at least six months . This species is closely related to , and may hybridize with , the yellowback stingaree ( U. <unk> ) . The venomous sting of the crossback stingaree is potentially injurious to humans . This common species is seldom caught by commercial fisheries other than in the northernmost extent of its range . Thus , its population is largely secure and the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it under Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 French naturalist Bernard Lacépède originally described the crossback stingaree as Raja cruciata , in an 1804 volume of the scientific journal Annales du Muséum d 'Histoire Naturelle Paris . The specific epithet means " cross @-@ like " in Latin , referring to the distinctive markings on its back . The origin of the type specimen was given simply as New Holland ( Australia ) . In their 1838 – 41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen , German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle placed this species in the newly created genus Urolophus . 
 The Victorian and Tasmanian subpopulations of the crossback stingaree differ markedly in habitat preferences and merit further taxonomic investigation , according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . This ray is closely related to the yellowback stingaree ( U. <unk> ) . In addition to morphological similarities , the two may also hybridize ( see below ) and , in a 2007 study of 388 fishes by Robert Ward and Bronwyn Holmes , were the only species that could not be distinguished on the basis of their cytochrome c gene sequences , attesting to a close evolutionary relationship . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The distribution of the crossback stingaree mainly encompasses the coastal waters of Victoria and Tasmania , where it is quite abundant ; it ranges as far east as Jervis Bay in New South Wales , and as far west as <unk> in South Australia . Bottom @-@ dwelling in nature , this species has been reported from the intertidal zone to a depth of 210 m ( 690 ft ) on the upper continental slope . Rays of the Victorian subpopulation prefer sandy flats and rocky reefs and are seldom seen in less than 25 m ( 82 ft ) of water , occurring most commonly at depths greater than 100 m ( 330 ft ) . By contrast , rays of the Tasmanian subpopulation are usually found over muddy bottoms in very shallow bays and large estuaries , occasionally penetrating into brackish water . 
 = = Description = = 
 The crossback stingaree 's pectoral fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape , with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging at a very obtuse angle . The snout is fleshy and blunt , generally not protruding from the disc . The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop @-@ shaped spiracles , which have rounded to angular posterior rims . The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back . Between the nostrils is a skirt @-@ shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin . The mouth is small and strongly arched , containing 3 – 6 papillae ( nipple @-@ like structures ) on the floor and an additional patch of papillae is present on the outside of the lower jaw . Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases , and are arranged in a quincunx pattern . The five pairs of gill slits are short . The pelvic fins are small , with rounded margins . 
 The rather short tail measures 63 – 84 % of the disc 's length and is a flattened oval in cross @-@ section , without lateral skin folds . A single serrated , stinging spine is positioned on top , about halfway along the tail 's length . In newborns , the sting is preceded by a small dorsal fin ; the fin is lost with age , though it may be evidenced by a small ridge or scar . At the end of the tail is a very short , deep , leaf @-@ shaped caudal fin . The skin is entirely devoid of dermal denticles . The crossback stingaree is grayish to yellowish brown above with a pattern of dark markings , including a stripe running along the midline and crossed by three transverse bars : one near the eyes , one over the gill region , and one over the center of the disc . The pattern is strongest in rays from the southern portion of its range . A few dark brown or black individuals have been recorded . The underside is off @-@ white , sometimes becoming slightly darker at the disc margin . The caudal fin is more grayish than the body , and there may be dusky blotches on the tail . This species attains a maximum known length of 50 cm ( 20 in ) . Females generally grow larger than males . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Generally nocturnal , the crossback stingaree spends long stretches of the day lying motionless on the sea floor , partially or completely buried in sediment . It has been known to form groups of varying size , sometimes mixing with other stingaree species . This ray is a generalist predator that forages for small organisms on or buried in the bottom . Off Victoria , over three @-@ quarters of prey consumed are crustaceans , of which isopods ( particularly <unk> <unk> and N. <unk> ) comprise the majority and amphipods and decapods the remainder . Polychaete worms are also eaten in significant quantities , while priapulids and the burrowing squid Euprymna <unk> are infrequently taken . Young rays under 30 cm ( 12 in ) across feed mainly on smaller isopods , amphipods , and shrimps ; with age a progressively greater diversity of larger prey , such as penaeid prawns , priapulids , and polychaetes , are incorporated into its diet . 
 The broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ) is known to prey on the crossback stingaree . When threatened , this ray raises its tail <unk> above its body in a scorpion @-@ like fashion . Parasites documented from this species include a tapeworm in the genus Acanthobothrium , and the monogenean <unk> urolophi . Like other stingrays , the crossback stingaree is aplacental viviparous : when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , their mother provisions them with nutrient @-@ rich histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) through specialized extensions of the uterine epithelium called " trophonemata " . Females produce litters of 1 – 4 pups every other year . Embryonic development proceeds rapidly over a six @-@ month period , though the total gestation period may be much longer if there is a period of dormancy for the eggs after fertilization , as has been reported in other stingarees . Off Tasmania , large estuaries such as at the mouth of the River Derwent serve as nursery areas . 
 Different authors have variously reported the birth length at between 10 and 15 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 and 5 @.@ 9 in ) , and the maturation length at between 20 and 32 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 and 12 @.@ 6 in ) , with females usually maturing at a slightly larger size than males . This range of sizes may reflect life history differences in crossback stingarees across different parts of its range . Both sexes mature at around six years of age , and can live to at least 11 years . The crossback stingaree may hybridize naturally with the closely related yellowback stingaree off southern New South Wales , where the distributions of the two species overlap and apparent hybrid offspring with intermediate color patterns have been found . If true , this would represent one of the few known cases of hybridization among cartilaginous fishes . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The crossback stingaree can inflict an excruciating injury on an unwary human with its venomous sting , that may require surgical intervention if the serrated tip of the sting breaks off inside the wound . The base of its tail is highly flexible , allowing it to strike a person touching any part of its body . In the 19th century , the hazard posed by this species led to persecution by fishery workers in the form of " spiking " , in which a metal spike is used to pierce the ray 's cranium and remove it from the net . The IUCN has listed the crossback stingaree under Least Concern , as it is exposed to minimal fishing activity in the Bass Strait and off western Tasmania , which constitute most of its distribution . The impact of Tasmanian inshore fisheries is unquantified but unlikely to be severe . Off New South Wales , it is caught incidentally in otter trawls and gillnets used by the Southern and Eastern <unk> and Shark Fishery ( <unk> ) . Captured rays likely experience high mortality , and also tend to abort any unborn young . While the <unk> has caused an overall decline in deepwater stingarees within its area of operations , it only affects a small portion of this species ' range . 
 = State Route 74 ( New York – Vermont ) = 
 New York State Route 74 ( NY 74 ) and Vermont Route 74 ( VT 74 ) are adjoining state highways in the northeastern United States , connected by one of the last remaining cable ferries in North America . Together they extend for 35 miles ( 56 km ) through Essex County , New York , and Addison County , Vermont . NY 74 begins at exit 28 off Interstate 87 ( I @-@ 87 ) in the hamlet of Severance in the Adirondack Mountains region of the northern part of New York State . It extends 20 @.@ 44 miles ( 32 @.@ 89 km ) to the western shore of Lake Champlain in Ticonderoga . There , the seasonal Fort Ticonderoga – Larrabees Point Ferry carries cars across the state border into Vermont , where VT 74 starts at the lake 's eastern shore and terminates 13 @.@ 26 miles ( 21 @.@ 34 km ) later at a junction with VT 30 in the town of Cornwall . 
 NY 74 is a descendant of the historic Ticonderoga and Schroon Turnpike , which was a privately owned highway chartered in 1832 , and segments of NY 74 follow the alignment of the original 19th @-@ century turnpike . The connecting ferry route predates both NY 74 and VT 74 and began operation in 1759 on an informal basis . The ferry operation formalized at the close of the 18th century and upgraded to a cable system in 1946 . 
 Due to extensive changes in designations in both states during the 20th century , the entire length of the present highway consists of renamed segments from other highways . The New York portion of the cross @-@ state Route 74 west of Ticonderoga was designated as part of NY 73 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , while the Vermont section carried several different designations from the 1920s to the late 1930s , when it became solely part of Vermont Route F @-@ 9 . NY 73 was extended east to Lake Champlain in the 1950s — replacing New York State Route 347 — and VT F @-@ 9 was split into VT 73 and VT 74 shortly afterward . The Schroon – Ticonderoga highway was redesignated as NY 74 c . 1973 after NY 73 was cut back to its current eastern terminus in Elizabethtown . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = NY 74 = = = 
 NY 74 originates at exit 28 of the Adirondack Northway ( I @-@ 87 ) in the town of Schroon . The starting interchange is located near local landmark Severance Hill , which reaches an altitude of 1 @,@ 600 feet ( 490 m ) . NY 74 intersects with the north – south U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) shortly after the northbound ramps of the Adirondack Northway . It then meets Stowell Road just before crossing the Schroon River . The highway meets a few local road intersections just south of <unk> Hill before encountering Paradox Lake . NY 74 runs mostly parallel to the lake and intersects with a local campground entrance road as it continues eastward from Schroon . 
 <unk> Pond is a small landmark located beyond a few mountains and hills on the southern side of NY 74 near the end of Paradox Lake . <unk> Pond , by state law , is a water body that cannot be used for <unk> . This was designated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation . Shortly afterward , NY 74 passes <unk> Pond and enters the hamlet of Paradox . After leaving Paradox , NY 74 turns to the southeast along the base of Skiff Mountain . The highway then approaches a creek that flows into Eagle Lake . NY 74 crosses over Eagle Lake and runs along the base of Eagle Cliff and the shores of the lake . After leaving Eagle Lake , the highway intersects with County Route 2 ( CR 2 ) , the first numbered highway that NY 74 encounters after US 9 . 
 This stretch of NY 74 skirts the base of Keeney Mountain , which peaks at 1 @,@ 400 feet ( 430 m ) . NY 74 then intersects with CR 56 , which parallels the main route to the south . CR 56 merges back with NY 74 , which leaves the mountainous region for the hamlet of Ticonderoga . NY 74 intersects with NY 9N and NY 22 in the hamlet ; the latter of the two highways becomes concurrent with NY 74 . NY 22 and NY 74 continue to the east , heading around the outskirts of Ticonderoga . NY 74 intersects with CR 49 before NY 74 turns to the southeast . NY 22 and NY 74 head southward toward the center of Ticonderoga . At the intersection with Montcalm Street , NY 74 turns eastward off NY 22 , which heads southward for Washington County . 
 NY 74 crosses local roads as it continues eastward toward Lake Champlain . The highway passes the entrance to Fort Ticonderoga and the Ticonderoga Amtrak station . The New York portion of NY 74 terminates at a ferry landing by Lake Champlain at the state border . 
 = = = Fort Ticonderoga – Larrabees Point Ferry = = = 
 The Fort Ticonderoga – Larrabees Point Ferry is the oldest and southernmost ferry on Lake Champlain . Its cable system consists of two 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 8 cm ) steel cables in parallel alignment . The current ferry barge , in operation since 1959 , is powered by a sixteen @-@ ton tugboat built in 1979 that can hold up to 18 cars . The seasonal ferry is half a mile long and operates from May through October . The seven @-@ minute passage operates during daylight hours . 
 = = = VT 74 = = = 
 After crossing the state line via the Fort Ticonderoga – Larrabees Point Ferry , VT 74 begins its track into Vermont . The highway heads a short distance to the north , passing a thinly populated area in Shoreham , as intermittent forest yields to fields and farmlands . After 0 @.@ 49 miles ( 0 @.@ 79 km ) from the border , VT 74 intersects with VT 73 before encountering Barnum Hill Road . Near the Barnum Hill intersection , VT 74 passes developed areas and bends more toward the north . VT 74 then turns to the northeast at Smith Street and enters a patch of forest . Afterward VT 74 climbs a hill and intersects with Harrington Hill Road where it turns northward once again . 
 Fields and forests surround this thinly populated stretch of highway . At the intersection with Blue Harbor Road , VT 74 turns to the east and heads toward downtown Shoreham . Within central Shoreham , VT 74 is known as Main Street and has a short concurrency with VT 22A . As VT 74 leaves the densely populated portion of Shoreham , the concurrency ends and VT 74 takes an eastward turn toward Cornwall . 
 As VT 74 returns to the rural countryside it bends toward the northeast for most of the distance to Cornwall . Through this stretch the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland . VT 74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road . A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT 74 shortly afterward . VT 74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall , intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas . At Clark Road in Cornwall , VT 74 turns to the northeast once again , passing through more forests before terminating at VT 30 in Cornwall .

 = = = Schroon and its early highways = = = 
 Settlers of European descent began to populate the region near modern Schroon around 1797 . The area 's first municipality was the town of Crown Point , which originally included considerable portions of thinly populated land that later developed into separate townships . The first of these divisions occurred on March 20 , 1804 with the establishment of the town of Schroon . Minerva split from Crown Point in March 1817 , before another municipal reorganization in 1840 implemented further reductions to the land area of Crown Point . During this period two thoroughfares served the area that correspond to parts of modern NY 74 and US 9 . One of these old state roads traversed the route covered by the current alignment of NY 74 from Schroon to Ticonderoga . 
 = = = Ticonderoga and Schroon Turnpike = = = 
 The entire length of NY 74 from Ticonderoga to Schroon covers the same route as the 19th century Ticonderoga and Schroon Turnpike . The turnpike , chartered in April 1832 , was built to a stretch of highway from the two towns . Two toll gates were erected specifically for use on the highway , and the charter allowed for additional toll gates at a spacing of approximately one for every ten miles of completed highway . The turnpike management raised funds by selling 600 shares valued at $ 25 ( equivalent to $ 593 in 2016 ) each . $ 20 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 474 @,@ 067 in 2016 ) was also set aside for properties along the highway .

 In 1913 , the New York State Legislature designated most of modern NY 74 as Route 22 @-@ b , an unsigned legislative route . It ran for 17 @.@ 06 miles ( 27 @.@ 46 km ) from Route 22 ( now US 9 ) in Schroon to the western edge of the then @-@ village of Ticonderoga . On March 1 , 1921 , Route 22 @-@ b became part of Route 48 , a new route created as part of a partial renumbering of New York 's legislative route system . In 1924 , when state highways were first publicly signed with route numbers , the highway from Schroon to Ticonderoga remained unnumbered . During the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the segment of modern NY 74 between US 9 in Schroon and NY 22 in Ticonderoga was designated as part of NY 73 , a route extending from NY 28N in Tahawus to Ticonderoga . NY 73 followed the Blue Ridge Road from Tahawus to North Hudson and had an overlap with US 9 from North Hudson to Schroon . 
 The portion of NY 73 between Tahawus and North Hudson was removed from the state highway system c . 1936 . As a result , NY 73 was truncated to a new western terminus at US 9 in Schroon , eliminating the concurrency with US 9 . The Blue Ridge Road is now designated as CR 84 from NY 28N in <unk> to the Adirondack Northway in North Hudson , and as NY 910K , a short unsigned reference route , from the Northway to US 9 . 
 On the Vermont side , the road connecting Larrabees Point to the main north – south highways in the area was designated as VT F @-@ 9 by 1926 . VT F @-@ 9 began at the ferry landing at Larrabees Point and continued northeast to Shoreham Center , where it briefly overlapped with then @-@ VT 30A ( modern VT 22A ) . Past VT 30A , VT F @-@ 9 continued east along what are now town highways through Whiting to Leicester , where it ended at a junction with US 7 . At the time , modern VT 74 between Shoreham and Cornwall centers was known as VT F @-@ 9A while what is now VT 73 from Larrabees Point to Brown Lane north of the town center of Orwell was part of VT F @-@ 10A . 
 = = = Changes from 1933 onward = = = 
 By 1933 , the highway linking NY 22 in Ticonderoga to the ferry for Larrabees Point became part of NY 8 . NY 8 was realigned c . 1934 to follow NY 22 north from Ticonderoga to Crown Point , where it left NY 22 to follow NY 347 ( modern NY 185 ) to the Champlain Bridge . The NY 347 designation was reassigned to NY 8 's former routing between NY 22 and the ferry landing east of Ticonderoga . 
 VT F @-@ 9 , meanwhile , was extended southward to Orwell over VT F @-@ 10A by 1938 . Like VT F @-@ 10A , it initially bypassed Orwell to the north on Brown Lane ; however , it was realigned in the late 1930s to follow modern VT 73 into Orwell . Around the same time , VT F @-@ 9 was realigned east of Shoreham to follow VT F @-@ 9A northeast to Cornwall . The VT F @-@ 9A designation was eliminated while the former routing of VT F @-@ 9 between Shoreham and Leicester became unnumbered . In the early 1950s , New York extended NY 73 east to the ferry landing by way of NY 347 and Wicker and Montcalm Streets . Vermont renumbered the Larrabees Point – Orwell section of VT F @-@ 9 to VT 73 in the mid @-@ 1950s in order to match the New York route number . At the same time , the Larrabees Point – Cornwall section of VT F @-@ 9 was renumbered by Vermont to VT 74 . 
 NY 73 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Underwood c . 1973 , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US 9 , while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY 74 , matching the other Vermont route number that ends in Larrabees Point . The already existing NY 74 in Chautauqua County ( in the Jamestown area ) was renumbered to NY 474 as a result . The opening of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY 74 from US 9 to I @-@ 87 . By 1981 , NY 74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga , on a concurrency with NY 22 . The highway has remained the same since that date . 
 The New York State Department of Transportation has announced a project to repave NY 74 from Chilson to Paradox .

 According to its website , the ferry operated informally from 1759 and in an organized way from 1799 . The earliest ferries are believed to have been rowboats or canoes ; " a double @-@ ended sailing scow was in service by 1800 . This vessel was about 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) long , with a mainsail that would swing completely around the mast to provide a simple means of reversing course . " 
 Ferry size continued to increase with traffic until the system upgraded to a cable guidance system in 1946 . John S. Larrabee of Vermont established the first regular ferry at the location in the late 18th century . The Vermont State Legislature approved a franchise for a ferry from Larrabees Point to Ticonderoga in 1907 , to the Shoreham and Ticonderoga Ferry Company . The New York State Legislature granted the ferry a franchise in 1918 .

 Forrest Gump is a 1994 American epic romantic @-@ comedy @-@ drama film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom . The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks , Robin Wright , Gary Sinise , Mykelti Williamson , and Sally Field . The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump , a slow @-@ witted but kind @-@ hearted , good @-@ natured and athletically prodigious man from Alabama who witnesses , and in some cases influences , some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States ; more specifically , the period between Forrest 's birth in 1944 and 1982 . The film differs substantially from Winston Groom 's novel , including Gump 's personality and several events that were depicted .

Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the protagonist into archived footage and to develop other scenes . A comprehensive soundtrack was featured in the film , using music intended to pinpoint specific time periods portrayed on screen . Its commercial release made it a top @-@ selling soundtrack , selling over twelve million copies worldwide . 
 Released in the United States on July 6 , 1994 , Forrest Gump became a commercial success as the top grossing film in North America released in that year , being the first major success for Paramount Pictures since the studio 's sale to Viacom , earning over US $ 677 million worldwide during its theatrical run .

 = = Plot = = 
 In 1981 , Forrest Gump ( Tom Hanks ) sits at a bus stop in Savannah , Georgia as a feather floats down toward him , which he then picks up and begins telling his life story to strangers who sit next to him , beginning with his childhood in the town of Greenbow , Alabama during the 1950s . As a child , Forrest had to wear leg braces for which he was often ridiculed . He was raised by a single mother ( Sally Field ) who ran a boarding house for travelers .

 On his first day of school , Forrest meets Jenny Curran , who becomes his best friend . He learns that Jenny 's mother had died when she was very young and her father is an alcoholic . Forrest 's recounting implies that Jenny 's father had been sexually abusive towards her . Jenny encourages Forrest to run away when he gets bullied by a group of older boys , and he struggles to outrun them until his leg braces fall off and he is able to run at very high speed . Years later , while fleeing from the same group of bullies , he runs onto the football field during a game and catches the attention of University of Alabama Coach Bear Bryant , which gets him into college on a football scholarship . 
 After his college graduation , he enlists in the army , where he manages to excel at drill exercises and befriends fellow recruit Benjamin Buford Blue , nicknamed Bubba ( Mykelti Williamson ) , who convinces Gump to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over .

At an anti @-@ war rally in Washington , Forrest reunites with Jenny , who has joined the Hippie movement after being expelled from college over topless photos of herself and has experimented with drugs . 
 While recovering from his wounds , Forrest discovers an uncanny ability for ping @-@ pong , eventually gaining popularity and rising to celebrity status , later playing ping @-@ pong competitively against Chinese teams in ping @-@ pong diplomacy . He runs into Lieutenant Dan , now in a wheelchair , who has become an embittered drunk and receives Disability pension . Forrest moves in with Dan and they spend the holidays together , with Forrest explaining his and Bubba 's plan to go into the shrimping business and his own intentions to fulfill Bubba 's dream . 
 After being discharged from the Army , Gump returns to Alabama and endorses a company that makes ping @-@ pong paddles , earning himself US $ 25 @,@ 000 , which he uses to buy a shrimping boat , fulfilling his promise to Bubba . Lieutenant Dan joins Gump , and although they initially have little success , after Hurricane Carmen they are the only boat in the area left standing and they begin to pull in huge amounts of shrimp . They use their income to buy an entire fleet of shrimp boats . Lieutenant Dan invests the money in Apple and they are financially secure for the rest of their lives . Forrest returns home when his mother falls terminally ill and stays with her until her death .

 In present @-@ day , Gump reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny , who is now living in Savannah and had seen him on TV during his running and invited him to visit her . Once reunited with Jenny , he discovers she has a young son named Forrest , and that Gump himself is the father . Jenny reveals she is suffering from an unknown virus ( possibly HIV , though this is never specified ) . She asks to marry him and he accepts . Forrest and Jenny return to Greenbow with Forrest Jr and are married . Forrest cares for Jenny during her illness . Jenny eventually dies and Forrest becomes a devoted father to Forrest Jr .

 = = Cast = = 
 Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump : Though at an early age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75 , he has an endearing character and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties , character traits which bring him into many life @-@ changing situations . Along the way , he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life . Tom 's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across America . Tom 's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest ( Michael Conner Humphreys ) sit next to her . John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role , and admits passing on the role was a mistake . Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role . Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after an hour and a half of reading the script . He initially wanted to ease Forrest 's pronounced Southern accent , but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel . Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate . Michael Conner Humphreys portrayed the young Forrest Gump . Hanks revealed in interviews that after hearing Michael 's unique accented drawl , he incorporated it into the older character 's accent . Winston Groom , who wrote the original novel , describes the film as having taken the " rough edges " off of the character , and envisioned him being played by John Goodman . 
 Robin Wright as Jenny Curran : Forrest 's childhood friend whom he immediately falls in love with and never stops loving throughout his life . A victim of child sexual abuse at the hands of her bitterly widowed father , Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest , leading a self @-@ destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in the 1960s and the 1970s / 1980s drug culture . She re @-@ enters Forrest 's life at various times in adulthood . Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah , Georgia , where she lives in an apartment with her ( and Forrest 's ) son , Forrest Jr . They eventually get married , but soon afterwards she dies of an unspecified illness caused by a kind of virus . Her illness is implied to be HIV / AIDS ; however , Hepatitis C is also a strong possibility as Forrest Sr. was never portrayed as contracting any illness ( and although either would 've had a chance to have been passed to Forrest Jr. through childbirth , he too does not fall ill ) and the Hepatitis C virus was not discovered until 1989 – long after Jenny 's death . Hanna R. Hall portrayed the young Jenny . 
 Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan Taylor : Forrest and Bubba Blue 's platoon leader during the Vietnam War , whose ancestors have died in every American war and regards it as his destiny to do the same . After losing his legs in an ambush and being rescued against his will by Forrest , he is initially bitter and antagonistic towards Forrest for leaving him a " cripple " and denying him his family 's destiny , falling into a deep depression . He later serves as Forrest 's first mate at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company , gives most of the orders , and regains his will to live . He ultimately forgives and thanks Forrest for saving his life . By the end of the film , he is engaged to be married and is sporting " magic legs " – titanium alloy prosthetics which allow him to walk again . 
 Mykelti Williamson as Benjamin Buford " Bubba " Blue : Bubba is Forrest 's friend whom he meets upon joining the Army . Bubba was originally supposed to be the senior partner in the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company , but due to his death in Vietnam , their platoon leader , Dan Taylor , took his place . The company posthumously carried his name . Forrest and Dan later gave Bubba 's mother Bubba 's share of the business . Throughout filming , Williamson wore a lip attachment to create Bubba 's protruding lip . David Alan Grier , Ice Cube and Dave Chappelle were all offered the role but turned it down . Chappelle said he believed the film would be unsuccessful , and also acknowledged that he regrets not taking the role . 
 Sally Field as Mrs. Gump : Forrest 's devoted mother , who raises him after his father abandons them . Field reflected on the character , " She 's a woman who loves her son unconditionally . … A lot of her dialogue sounds like slogans , and that 's just what she intends . " 
 Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump , Jr . : Forrest and Jenny 's son . Osment was cast in the film after the casting director had noticed him in a Pizza Hut commercial . 
 Peter Dobson as Elvis : A house guest Forrest encounters . Although Kurt Russell was uncredited , he provided the voice over for Elvis in the scene where Elvis meets Forrest . 
 Dick Cavett as himself : Cavett played the 1970s version of himself , with makeup applied to make him appear younger . Consequently , Cavett is the only well @-@ known figure in the film to play a cameo role rather than be represented through the use of archival footage like John Lennon or President John F. Kennedy

 The film is based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom . Both center on the character of Forrest Gump . However , the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel , before skipping ahead to the end of the novel with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest , Jr . In addition to skipping some parts of the novel , the film adds several aspects to Gump 's life that do not occur in the novel , such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States . 
 Gump 's core character and personality are also changed from the novel ; among other things his film character is less of an autistic savant — in the novel , while playing football at the university , he fails craft and gym , but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements . The novel also features Gump as an astronaut , a professional wrestler , and a chess player . 
 Two directors were offered the opportunity to direct the film before Robert Zemeckis was selected . Terry Gilliam turned down the offer . Barry Sonnenfeld was attached to the film , but left to direct Addams Family Values . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began in August 1993 and ended in December of that year . Although most of the film is set in Alabama , filming took place mainly in and around Beaufort , South Carolina , as well as parts of coastal Virginia and North Carolina , including a running shot on the Blue Ridge Parkway . Downtown portions of the fictional town of Greenbow were filmed in <unk> , South Carolina . The scene of Forrest running through Vietnam while under fire was filmed on Fripp Island , South Carolina . Additional filming took place on the Biltmore Estate in Asheville , North Carolina , and along the Blue Ridge Parkway near Boone , North Carolina . The most notable place was Grandfather Mountain where a part of the road is named " Forrest Gump Curve " . The Gump family home set was built along the Combahee River near <unk> , South Carolina , and the nearby land was used to film Curran 's home as well as some of the Vietnam scenes . Over 20 palmetto trees were planted to improve the Vietnam scenes . Forrest Gump narrated his life 's story in Chippewa Square in Savannah , Georgia as he sat at a bus stop bench . There were other scenes filmed in and around the Savannah area as well , including a running shot on the Richard V. Woods Memorial Bridge in Beaufort while he was being interviewed by the press , and on West Bay Street in Savannah . Most of the college campus scenes were filmed in Los Angeles at the University of Southern California . The lighthouse that Forrest runs across to reach the Atlantic Ocean the first time is the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Port Clyde , Maine . Additional scenes were filmed in Arizona , Utah 's Monument Valley , and Montana 's Glacier National Park . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 Ken Ralston and his team at Industrial Light & Magic were responsible for the film 's visual effects . Using CGI techniques , it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands . Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage . To record the voices of the historical figures , voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip @-@ syncing for the new dialogue . Archival footage was used and with the help of such techniques as chroma key , image warping , morphing , and rotoscoping , Hanks was integrated into it . 
 In one Vietnam War scene , Gump carries Bubba away from an incoming napalm attack . To create the effect , stunt actors were initially used for compositing purposes . Then , Hanks and Williamson were filmed , with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him . The explosion was then filmed , and the actors were digitally added to appear just in front of the explosions . The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI . 
 The CGI removal of actor Gary Sinise 's legs , after his character had them amputated , was achieved by wrapping his legs with a blue fabric , which later facilitated the work of the " roto @-@ paint " team to paint out his legs from every single frame . At one point , while hoisting himself into his wheelchair , his legs are used for support . 
 The scene where Forrest spots Jenny at a peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool in Washington , D.C. , required visual effects to create the large crowd of people . Over two days of filming , approximately 1 @,@ 500 extras were used . At each successive take , the extras were rearranged and moved into a different quadrant away from the camera . With the help of computers , the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people .

 The film received generally positive reviews . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72 % of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 83 reviews . At the website Metacritic , the film earned a rating of 82 / 100 based on 19 reviews by mainstream critics . CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare " A + " grade . 
 The story was commended by several critics . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times wrote , " I 've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before , and for that matter I 've never seen a movie quite like ' Forrest Gump . ' Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is , but let me try . It 's a comedy , I guess . Or maybe a drama . Or a dream . The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction ... The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness , in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths ... What a magical movie . " Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film " has been very well worked out on all levels , and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate , even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop . " The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers . Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film " Warm , wise , and wearisome as hell . " Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film " reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual @-@ reality theme park : a baby @-@ boomer version of Disney 's America . " 
 Critics have compared Gump with various characters and people including Huckleberry Finn , Bill Clinton , and Ronald Reagan . Peter <unk> writes that Gump acts as a " social mediator and as an agent of redemption in divided times " . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Gump " everything we admire in the American character – honest , brave , and loyal with a heart of gold . " The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a " hollow man " who is " self @-@ congratulatory in his blissful ignorance , warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing . " Marc Vincenti of Palo Alto Weekly called the character " a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face , thoughtfully licking his fingers . " Bruce Kawin and Gerald Mast 's textbook on film history notes that Forrest Gump 's dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented a blank slate by which the Baby Boomer generation projected their memories of those events . 
 The film is commonly seen as a polarizing one for audiences , with Entertainment Weekly writing in 2004 , " Nearly a decade after it earned <unk> and swept the Oscars , Robert Zemeckis 's ode to 20th @-@ century America still represents one of cinema 's most clearly drawn lines in the sand . One half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama , while everyone else raves that it 's sweet as a box of chocolates . "

 Winston Groom was paid $ 350 @,@ 000 for the screenplay rights to his novel Forrest Gump and was contracted for a 3 percent share of the film 's net profits . However , Paramount and the film 's producers did not pay him , using Hollywood accounting to posit that the blockbuster film lost money .

Additionally , Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film 's six Oscar @-@ winner speeches .

 Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film . Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather : " Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being ? Forrest Gump 's impaired intellect ? The randomness of experience ? " Hanks interpreted the feather as : " Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that 's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in . Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet . It has theological implications that are really huge . " Sally Field compared the feather to fate , saying : " It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there . Was it planned or was it just perchance ? " Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting : " It can mean so many things to so many different people . " 
 = = = Political interpretations = = = 
 In Tom Hanks ' words , " The film is non @-@ political and thus non @-@ judgmental . " Nevertheless , in 1994 , CNN 's Crossfire debated whether the film promoted conservative values or was an indictment of the counterculture movement of the 1960s . Thomas Byers , in a Modern Fiction Studies article , called the film " an aggressively conservative film " . 
 It has been noted that while Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle , Jenny 's life is full of countercultural embrace , complete with drug usage , promiscuity , and antiwar rallies , and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation . Jennifer Hyland Wang argued in a Cinema Journal article that Jenny 's death to an unnamed virus " ... symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade [ 1960s ] . " She also notes the film 's screenwriter , Eric Roth , when developing the screenplay from the novel , had " ... transferred all of Gump 's flaws and most of the excesses committed by Americans in the 1960s and 1970s to her [ Jenny ] . " 
 Other commentators believe the film forecast the 1994 Republican Revolution and used the image of Forrest Gump to promote movement leader Newt Gingrich 's traditional , conservative values . Jennifer Hyland Wang observes the film idealizes the 1950s , as made evident by the lack of " whites only " signs in Gump 's southern childhood , and " revisions " the 1960s as a period of social conflict and confusion . She argues this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism . As viewed by political scientist Joe <unk> , this film is " one of the best films of all time " . Wang argued the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a " traditional version of recent history " to gear voters towards their ideology for the congressional elections . In addition , presidential candidate Bob Dole cited the film 's message in influencing his campaign due to its " ... message that has made [ the film ] one of Hollywood 's all @-@ time greatest box office hits : no matter how great the adversity , the American Dream is within everybody 's reach . " 
 In 1995 , National Review included Forrest Gump in its list of the " Best 100 Conservative Movies " of all time . Then , in 2009 , the magazine ranked the film number four on its 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years list . " Tom Hanks plays the title character , an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s . The love of his life , wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn , chooses a different path ; she becomes a drug @-@ addled hippie , with disastrous results . " 
 James Burton , a communication arts professor at Salisbury University , argued that conservatives claimed Forrest Gump as their own due less to the content of the film and more to the historical and cultural context of 1994 . Burton claimed the film 's content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s , which emphasized family values and " American values " — values epitomized in the successful book Hollywood vs. America . He claimed this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film , which allowed for many different political interpretations . 
 Burton points out that many conservative critics and magazines ( John Simon , James Bowman , the World Report ) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non @-@ political elements . Only after the popularity of the film was well @-@ established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values . Burton implies the liberal @-@ left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film , had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values . Instead , the liberal @-@ left focused on what the film omitted , such as the feminist and civil rights movements . 
 Some commentators see the conservative readings of Forrest Gump as <unk> of the death of irony in American culture . Vivian <unk> notes that the film 's humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience 's historical ( self- ) consciousness .

 The 32 @-@ song soundtrack from the film was released on July 6 , 1994 . With the exception of a lengthy suite from Alan Silvestri 's score , all the songs are previously released ; the soundtrack includes songs from Elvis Presley , Fleetwood Mac , Creedence Clearwater Revival , Aretha Franklin , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Three Dog Night , The Byrds , The Doors , The Mamas & the Papas , The Doobie Brothers , Simon & Garfunkel , Bob Seger , and Buffalo Springfield among others . Music producer Joel Sill reflected on compiling the soundtrack : " We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods , yet we didn 't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically . " The two @-@ disc album has a variety of music from the 1950s – 1980s performed by American artists . According to Sills , this was due to Zemeckis ' request , " All the material in there is American . Bob ( Zemeckis ) felt strongly about it . He felt that Forrest wouldn 't buy anything but American . " 
 The soundtrack reached a peak of number 2 on the Billboard album chart . The soundtrack went on to sell twelve million copies , and is one of the top selling albums in the United States . The score for the film was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri and released on August 2 , 1994 . 
 = = Proposed sequel = = 
 The screenplay for the sequel was written by Eric Roth in 2001 . It is based on the original novel 's sequel , Gump and Co. written by Winston Groom in 1995 . Roth 's script begins with Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for his son to return from school . After the September 11 attacks , Roth , Zemeckis , and Hanks decided the story was no longer " relevant . " In March 2007 , however , it was reported Paramount producers took another look at the screenplay . 
 On the very first page of the sequel novel , Forrest Gump tells readers " Don 't never let nobody make a movie of your life 's story , " though " Whether they get it right or wrong , it doesn 't matter .

 = Hemigrapsus estellinensis = 
 Hemigrapsus estellinensis is an extinct species of crab , formerly endemic to the Texas Panhandle . It was discovered by Gordon C. Creel in 1962 and was probably already extinct before his description was published in 1964 , after the Estelline Salt Springs where it lived were contained by the United States Army . H. estellinensis is closely related to species from the Pacific Ocean such as Hemigrapsus oregonensis , but lived 500 mi ( 800 km ) inland in a hypersaline spring . It differed from its relatives by the pattern of spots on its back , and by the relative sizes of its limbs . 
 = = Description = = 
 H. estellinensis has a rectangular carapace with almost parallel sides . Males have a carapace length of up to 18 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 73 in ) and a carapace width of up to 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) , while females have a carapace up to 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) long and 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) wide . The front corners of the carapace are developed into three strong teeth on each side . 
 The chief difference between H. estellinensis and other species in the genus is the extensive pattern of rust @-@ red spots on the animal 's " drab green " carapace . H. estellinensis also has a pair of conspicuous white spots near the ends of the H – shaped indentation on the animal 's back , and another spot between each of those spots and the lateral margin of the carapace . The legs are marked with larger spots than the carapace , and both the chelipeds and the walking legs are shorter than in other species . There are no spots on the animal 's underside , including the abdomen . In males , the chelipeds bear a hairy patch containing chemoreceptors on the ventral side of the claw . 
 Creel collected 6 males and ten females ; one of the males is the holotype and all the others are paratypes . All sixteen are held in the National Museum of Natural History as specimens USNM <unk> and USNM <unk> . A few living specimens were taken to Wayland College ( now Wayland Baptist University ) , but died within 17 hours for unknown reasons . Two of the females laid eggs before dying , one laying 3 @,@ 000 and the other 8 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 H. estellinensis lived in Estelline Salt Springs east of the town of Estelline in Hall County , Texas , 500 miles ( 800 km ) from the nearest ocean . Before its extinction , it was the only troglobitic crab in the contiguous United States . Its occurrence so far from the ocean has been described as " curious " , and the species was " probably a Pleistocene relic " . 
 The springs originally produced water with a salinity of 43 ‰ that fed the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River . The salinity derives from Permian red beds , and has a strong structuring effect on the Red River 's biota . It had a flow of approximately 3 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 11 @,@ 000 l ; 2 @,@ 500 imp gal ) per minute , and the pool was 65 ft ( 20 m ) wide at the surface , which was at an altitude of 1 @,@ 742 @.@ 5 feet ( 531 @.@ 1 m ) above sea level . At a depth of 25 ft ( 8 m ) , it was only 20 ft ( 6 m ) wide , and then widened slightly down to a depth of 120 ft ( 37 m ) . Below that , an opening 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) wide led into a cavern completely filled with water . 
 The United States Army Corps of Engineers built a dike around the Estelline Salt Springs in January 1964 , which has reduced the chloride load on the Red River by 240 tonnes ( 530 @,@ 000 lb ) per day . Before it was contained , the spring had a rich biota , comprising the cyanobacteria <unk> and <unk> , the green algae Ulva <unk> and U. intestinalis , twenty species of diatom , many invertebrates – including a species of barnacle – and a single fish species , <unk> <unk> . The springs have since increased in salinity , and many species have been driven to extinction , including H. estellinensis and the undescribed barnacle . As early as December 1962 , attempts to find further living individuals of H. estellinensis were unsuccessful , and it was probably extinct before Creel 's description was published in 1964 . 
 The closest relative of H. estellinensis is the shore crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis , which lives along the coast of the Pacific Ocean . The entire genus is restricted to the Pacific Ocean , except for Hemigrapsus affinis which lives along the Atlantic coasts of South America , from Cape San Roque ( Rio Grande do Norte state , Brazil ) to the Gulf of San Matías ( Patagonia , Argentina ) , and population of Hemigrapsus sanguineus which have been introduced from the species ' native range in East Asia to the Atlantic coast of the United States from Portland , Maine to North Carolina , and to the English Channel and North Sea . 
 = Helvella acetabulum = 
 Helvella acetabulum is a species of fungus in the family Helvellaceae , order Pezizales . This relatively large cup @-@ shaped fungus is characterized by a tan fruit body with prominent branching ribs resembling a cabbage leaf ; for this reason it is commonly known as the cabbage leaf Helvella . Other colloquial names include the vinegar cup and the brown ribbed elfin cup . The fruit bodies reaches dimensions of 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) by 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) tall . It is found in Asia , Europe , and North America , where it grows in sandy soils , under both coniferous and deciduous trees . Although it may be considered edible , the fungus is not recommended for consumption unless cooked thoroughly , as it contains the toxin gyromitrin . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The fungus was first named as Peziza acetabulum by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum . It was given its current name by French mycologist Lucien Quélet in 1874 . Other genera to which the species has been transferred include Macroscyphus by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821 , <unk> by Joachim Christian Timm in 1788 , and Paxina by Otto Kuntze in 1891 ; the binomials resulting from these transfers are synonyms . Additional synonyms include <unk> sulcata ( Pers . ) Fuckel , <unk> vulgaris Fuckel , Paxina sulcata ( Pers . ) Kuntze , and Peziza sulcata Pers . 
 The specific epithet acetabulum means " little vinegar cup " , and was the Latin word for a small vessel used for storing vinegar ( see acetabulum ) . Common names include the " cabbage leaf Helvella " , the " vinegar cup " , the " ribbed @-@ stalk cup " , and the " brown ribbed elfin cup " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Helvella acetabulum has a deeply cup @-@ shaped fruit body ( technically an apothecium ) that is up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter , and 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) deep . The inner spore @-@ bearing surface , the hymenium , is brown , and may be smooth or slightly wavy ; the exterior surface is cream @-@ colored , and is covered with minute " hairs " . The ribs start from the cream @-@ colored stem and extend almost to the edge of the fruit body . The stem is typically 1 to 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) tall by 1 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The odor and taste of this mushroom are not distinctive . 
 The spores are smooth , elliptical , translucent ( hyaline ) , and contain a single central oil droplet ; they have dimensions of 18 – 20 by 12 – 14 µm . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the asci , are 350 – 400 by 15 – 20 µm , are operculate — meaning they have an apical " lid " that releases the spores . The tips of the asci are inamyloid , so they do not adsorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The paraphyses are club @-@ shaped , and have a pale brown color , with tips that are up to 10 µm thick . 
 Although the edibility of the fruit bodies is often listed as " unknown " , consumption of this fungus is not recommended as similar species in the family Helvellaceae contain the toxin gyromitrin . <unk> is heat sensitive , and is broken down by cooking . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Helvella <unk> has a roughly similar form and appearance , but the ribbing in that species does not extend up the margin as does H. acetabulum . H. <unk> has ribs that extend halfway up the sides of the fruit body , but the color of the cup is pale to dark gray rather than cream . The fruit bodies also resemble those of H. <unk> , but the latter species is distinguished by its grayish to grayish @-@ brown hymenium ; like H. acetabulum , it has ribs that extend to most of the outside of the fruit body . There are sometimes intermediate forms between the two species , making them difficult to distinguish . H. robusta is also similar to H. acetabulum , but has a lighter @-@ colored hymenium , a robust stem , and the margin of the fruit body is often bent over the stem at maturity . In contrast , H. acetabulum never has the edge of the fruit body bent over the stem , and the stem is " indistinct or prominent , but never robust " .
