 Because of holidays , no editions were printed on November 23 , 1851 ; January 2 , 1852 ; July 4 , 1852 ; January 2 , 1853 ; and January 1 , 1854 . 
 Because of strikes , the regular edition of The New York Times was not printed during the following periods : 
 December 9 , 1962 to March 31 , 1963 . Only a western edition was printed because of the 1962 – 63 New York City newspaper strike . 
 September 17 , 1965 to October 10 , 1965 . An international edition was printed , and a weekend edition replaced the Saturday and Sunday papers . 
 August 10 , 1978 to November 5 , 1978 . A multi @-@ union strike shut down the three major New York City newspapers . No editions of The New York Times were printed . Two months into the strike , a parody of The New York Times called Not The New York Times was given out in New York City , with contributors such as Carl Bernstein , Christopher Cerf , Tony Hendra and George Plimpton .

 According to a 2007 survey by conservative @-@ leaning Rasmussen Reports of public perceptions of major media outlets , 40 % saw the paper as having a liberal slant , 20 % no political slant and 11 % believe it has a conservative slant . In December 2004 , a University of California , Los Angeles study by former fellows of a conservative think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73 @.@ 7 on a 100 @-@ point scale , with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal , making it the second @-@ most liberal major newspaper in the study after the Wall Street Journal ( 85 @.@ 1 ) . The validity of the study has been questioned , however . The watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author 's funding , and political scientists , such as Brendan Nyhan , cited flaws in the study 's methodology . 
 In mid @-@ 2004 , the newspaper 's then public editor ( ombudsman ) , Daniel Okrent , wrote an opinion piece in which he said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and permitting gay marriage . He stated that this bias reflected the paper 's cosmopolitanism , which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City . Okrent did not comment at length on the issue of bias in coverage of other " hard news " , such as fiscal policy , foreign policy , or civil liberties . He wrote : 
 But if you 're examining the paper 's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen @-@ it @-@ all ; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide ( devout Catholics , gun owners , Orthodox Jews , Texans ) ; if your value system wouldn 't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist , then a walk through this paper can make you feel you 're traveling in a strange and forbidding world . 
 Across the gutter , the Op @-@ Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists , only two of whom could be classified as conservative ( and , even then , of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and , in the case of William Safire , opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act ) . 
 The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 ; since that year it has endorsed every Democratic nominee ; although it did endorse incumbent Republican Mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 and 2009 . 
 In a December 19 , 2012 , column published in the left @-@ leaning The Huffington Post , economics professor and former bank regulator William K. Black characterized The New York Times as being " far right ... on financial issues " while criticizing the paper for its profiles of foreign leaders . Black contrasted a report on Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti that he described as " hagiographic praise " with a more negative report on Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa , stating that the two men have similar backgrounds in getting PhDs in economics from U.S. schools . 
 In a 2013 interview with CNN , The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan responded , " It 's a modified yes with a lot of nuance in it " when asked by Joanne Lipman whether or not The Times has a liberal bias . 
 In an October 31 , 2014 column published in the Washington Examiner , conservative commentator Michelle Malkin characterized the editorial board of The New York Times as liberal and waging a " war on gun @-@ owning rape victims " , writing : 
 When victims embrace liberal orthodoxies , they 're heroes and absolute moral authorities in the eyes of the New York Times editorial board . When victims become survivors who reject the Nanny State , they 're liars , ideologues and pot @-@ stirrers who deserve to be sneered at from the rarefied offices of the Fishwrap of Record .

 A year after the war started the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been , and were insufficiently qualified , frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change . Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead @-@ up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration 's position , for which The New York Times later apologized . One of Miller 's prime sources was Ahmed <unk> , an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006 .

 A 2015 study found that The New York Times fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias .

 A 2003 study in The Harvard International Journal of Press / Politics concluded that The New York Times reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians . 
 For its coverage of the Israeli – Palestinian conflict , some have claimed that the paper is pro @-@ Palestinian , others believe it to be pro @-@ Israel . The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even @-@ handed and is generally pro @-@ Israel . On the other hand , the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti @-@ Semitic . 
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity . A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise awarded to Netanyahu during a speech at congress was " paid for by the Israel lobby " elicited an apology and clarification from its writer . 
 The New York Times ' public editor Clark Hoyt concluded in his January 10 , 2009 , column , " Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree , I think The New York Times , largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war , has tried its best to do a fair , balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded .

 On November 14 , 2001 , in The New York Times ' 150th anniversary issue , former executive editor Max Frankel wrote that before and during World War II , the NY Times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in their news pages . Laurel Leff , associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University , concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide . Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper 's tendency before , during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews , while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis ' crimes on Jews in particular . Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper 's Jewish publisher , Arthur Hays Sulzberger , concerning Jewishness , antisemitism , and Zionism .

In 2003 , after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry , the Times hired Mark von Hagen , professor of Russian history at Columbia University , to review Duranty 's work . Von Hagen found Duranty 's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical , and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda .

 The New York Times has been criticized for the 13 @-@ month delay of the December 2005 story revealing the U.S. National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program .

Contact with former agency officials began the previous summer . 
 Former The New York Times executive editor Bill Keller decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the Bush administration and being advised not to do so by New York Times Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman . Keller explained the silence 's rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013 , stating " Three years after 9 / 11 , we , as a country , were still under the influence of that trauma , and we , as a newspaper , were not immune " . 
 In 2014 , PBS Frontline interviewed Risen and Lichtblau , who said that the newspaper 's plan was to not publish the story at all . " The editors were furious at me " , Risen said to the program . " They thought I was being insubordinate . " Risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after The New York Times declined the piece 's publication , and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book .

 In May 2015 , a New York Times exposé on the working conditions of <unk> in New York City and elsewhere and the health hazards to which they are exposed attracted wide attention , resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M.

Bernstein , whose wife owns two nail salons , asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience , and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese @-@ language papers cited by the story . The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein 's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy . The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints , and expressed her belief that the story 's reporting was sound . 
 In September and October 2015 , nail salon owners and workers protested at The New York Times offices several times , in response to the story and the ensuing New York State crackdown . In October 2015 , Reason magazine published a three part re @-@ reporting of the story by Jim Epstein , charging that the series was filled with misquotes and factual errors respecting both its claims of illegally low wages and health hazards . Epstein additionally argued that The New York Times had mistranslated the ads cited in its answer to Bernstein , and that those ads actually validated Bernstein 's argument . In November 2015 , The New York Times ' public editor concluded that the exposé 's " findings , and the language used to express them , should have been dialed back — in some instances substantially " and recommended that " The Times write further follow @-@ up stories , including some that re @-@ examine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others — not defensively but with an open mind .

 = Business routes of U.S. Route 31 in Michigan = 
 There have been seven business routes of US Highway 31 in the state of Michigan . All of the business routes are former sections of US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) . They connect the freeway mainline of US 31 to the various downtowns of cities bypassed by US 31 . Two of the current business routes , for Hart and Ludington , are business spurs , connecting to US 31 on only one end , while the remainder for Muskegon , Whitehall – Montague and Pentwater , are business loops . The two former routes , for Niles and Holland were a business spur and loop , respectively .

 Business US Highway 31 ( Bus . US 31 ) was a business spur running to the Niles downtown area along a former routing of US 31 from US 31 exit 7 ( Walton Road ) northeasterly then southeasterly into downtown , ending at Bus . US 12 at the corner of Front and Main streets . At the time it was decommissioned , Bus . US 31 was only designated along the north – south segment between Walton Road and Main Street . 
 It was commissioned in 1987 as a loop connecting to US 31 on both ends , running along US 12 to US 33 ( 11th Street ) north into downtown and along Bus . US 12 . Bus . US 31 followed Front Street northward back to the mainline US 31 at Walton Road northwest of downtown . The business loop was extended along Walton Road in 1992 when the next segment of the US 31 freeway opened in Berrien County . The highway was truncated to a spur route in 1998 when M @-@ 51 was extended southward . The northernmost remaining portion along Walton Road was turned over to the Berrien County Road Commission on October 23 , 2007 , and the remaining portion was replaced by an extended M @-@ 139 in April 2010 .

BL I @-@ 196 turned northward off the US 31 freeway and ran concurrently with Bus . US 31 along Washington Avenue through a residential area on the southern side of Holland in Allegan County . At the intersection with 32nd Street , BL I @-@ 196 / Bus . US 31 crossed into Ottawa County and turned northeasterly on Michigan Avenue . Michigan Avenue ends at an intersection with State Street and 19th Street , and the business loop turned due north on River Street into downtown . The business loop split along the one @-@ way pairing of 7th and 9th streets in downtown . The northbound direction ran eastward on 9th Street while the southbound direction was routed two blocks north on 7th street . On the eastern side of downtown at Lincoln Street , southbound traffic was routed on 8th Street . , and one block further east , both directions followed 8th Street . At Chicago Drive , BL I @-@ 196 / Bus . US 31 turned northeasterly to follow that street out downtown . Bus . US 31 ended at an interchange with US 31 in Holland Township while BL I @-@ 196 continued northeasterly on Chicago Drive . 
 The initial bypass of Holland , rerouting US 31 out of downtown opened in 1954 . The former routing through downtown was redesignated as Bus . US 31 at this time . The first segment of I @-@ 196 / US 31 freeway in the Holland area opened in 1963 , adding an interchange to the southern terminus of Bus . US 31 . In 1974 , the I @-@ 196 bypass around Holland was completed , and Chicago Drive east of US 31 becomes a business route for I @-@ 196 . By 1976 , this business route was extended along Bus . US 31 through downtown as well . In 2004 , all of Bus US 31 was decommissioned and BL I @-@ 196 was rerouted to follow US 31 around downtown .

In 1940 , the alternate route and the mainline highway were flipped through the area , rerouting US 31A to run through downtown . At the same time , US 16 was rerouted to run into Muskegon , partially following US 31A . This last version of US 31A ran northwesterly along Airline Highway and Peck Street into downtown , where US 16 turned westward along M @-@ 46 . US 31A continued northeasterly along Muskegon Avenue back to US 31 at Marquette Avenue .

The business loop runs along the southern edge of Muskegon Heights and then turns northward near the Roosevelt Park city line . This north – south segment forms the boundary between commercial properties to the west and residential neighborhoods to the east as far north as the intersection with Broadway Avenue . North of Sherman Avenue , the business loop crosses into the city of Muskegon and runs through commercial properties on Seaway Drive . As it approaches Muskegon Lake , Bus . US 31 turns northeasterly along Shoreline Drive , running around the northern edge of downtown . On the northeastern corner of downtown , the business loop turns sharply northeasterly along Moses J. Jones Parkway . Along this parkway segment , Bus . US 31 meets the southern terminus of M @-@ 120 and turns easterly along a freeway segment in Muskegon Township to terminate at US 31 . 
 The first bypass of Muskegon opened to traffic in 1932 to the east of downtown ; it was designated US 31A . This first alternate route and the mainline were flipped in 1940 , routing US 31A through downtown ( partially along a section of US 16 ) and US 31 along the bypass . In 1941 , US 31A was redesignated Bus . US 31 . The business route was extended on each end in 1950 or 1951 when the mainline was shifted further out of the city to the east . At the end of the 1950s , the US 31 bypass east of Muskegon was converted to a freeway , and the southern section of the business loop was rerouted to follow Seaway Drive . When US 16 was decommissioned in the state in 1962 , the section of US 16 / Bus . US 16 is redesignated BS I @-@ 196 , and the following year , it becomes BS I @-@ 96 ; Bus . US 31 remains in place through both changes . 
 The northern end of the business loop near downtown was rerouted onto the one @-@ way pairing of Muskegon and Webster avenues in 1965 .

 = Alien vs. Predator ( film ) = 
 Alien vs. Predator ( also known as AVP or AVP : Alien vs. Predator ) is a 2004 American science fiction action horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and starring Sanaa Lathan , Lance Henriksen and Raoul Bova . It is the first installment of the Alien vs. Predator franchise , adapting a crossover bringing together the eponymous creatures of the Alien and Predator series , a concept which originated in a 1989 comic book . Anderson , Dan O 'Bannon and Ronald Shusett wrote the story ; and Anderson and Shane Salerno adapted the story into a screenplay . Their writing was influenced by Aztec mythology , the comic book series , and the writings of Erich von Däniken . 
 Set in 2004 , this film follows a group of archaeologists assembled by billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland ( Henriksen ) for an expedition near the Antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal . Weyland hopes to claim the find for himself , and his group discovers a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station . Hieroglyphs and sculptures reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for young Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage . The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens from reaching the surface . 
 The film was released on August 13 , 2004 in North America and received negative reviews from film critics . The film grossed over $ 172 million at the worldwide box office . The film was followed by a sequel , Aliens vs. Predator : Requiem in 2007 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2004 , a satellite detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath Bouvetøya , an island about one thousand miles off the coast of Antarctica . Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland ( Lance Henriksen ) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice . He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company , Weyland Industries , a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation , and assembles a team of experts to investigate . The team includes archaeologists , linguistic experts , drillers , mercenaries , and a guide named Alexa Woods ( Sanaa Lathan ) . 
 As a Predator ship reaches Earth 's orbit , it fires a beam that creates a passage through the ice towards the source of the heat bloom . When the team arrives at the abandoned whaling station above the heat source , they find the passage and descend beneath the ice . They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it , finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages . 
 Meanwhile , three Predators arrive and kill all the humans on the surface . They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure . The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs . When the eggs hatch , several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber . <unk> emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens . Conflict erupts between the Predators , Aliens , and humans , resulting in several deaths . Two Predators are killed by an Alien , and Weyland is killed by the remaining Predator , while allowing Alexa and archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa ( Raoul Bova ) enough time to escape . The two witness the Predator kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger . After Alexa and Sebastian leave , another facehugger attaches itself to the unmasked Predator . 
 Through translation of the pyramid 's hieroglyphs , Alexa and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years . It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids , and were worshiped as gods . Every 100 years they would visit Earth to take part in a rite of passage in which several humans would sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens , creating the " ultimate prey " for the Predators to hunt . If overwhelmed , the Predators would activate a self @-@ destruct device to eliminate the Aliens and themselves . The two deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid , and that the heat bloom was to attract humans for the sole purpose of making new Aliens to hunt . 
 Alexa and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Aliens " do not reach the surface " . Unfortunately , Sebastian is captured by an Alien , leaving only Alexa and the Predator to fight against the Aliens . The two form an alliance and use a self @-@ destruct device to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Aliens . Alexa and Scar reach the surface , where they battle the Alien Queen . They defeat the Queen by attaching its chain to a water tower and pushing her over a cliff , dragging the Queen to the ocean floor . Scar , however , is impaled through the torso by the Alien Queen 's tail and succumbs to his wounds and dies . 
 A Predator ship <unk> and several Predators appear . They retrieve their fallen comrade and an elite Predator presents Alexa with one of their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior . As the Predators retreat into space , a chestburster with a hybrid form of an Alien and a Predator erupts from Scar 's chest , beginning the events of Aliens vs. Predator : Requiem .

 Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight , Aliens writer / director James Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film . Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron , stating " I think it would be a lot of fun , but the most important thing is to get the story right . " In a 2002 interview , Scott 's concept for a story was " to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created " ; this project eventually became Scott 's 2012 film Prometheus . On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator , Cameron believed the film would " kill the validity of the franchise " and ceased work on his story , " To me , that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf . It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other ... <unk> it . " After viewing Alien vs. Predator , however , Cameron remarked that " it was actually pretty good . I think of the five Alien films , I 'd rate it third . I actually liked it . I actually liked it a lot . " Conversely , Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films . When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them , Scott laughed , " No . I couldn 't do that . I couldn 't quite take that step . " Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The concept of Alien vs. Predator originated from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989 , and was hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2 . Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990 – 1991 , which was based on the first comic series . In 1991 , he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox , who owned the film franchises , although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002 . The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on Alien : Resurrection . A draft penned by James <unk> and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis , who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth . 
 As there were six producers between the film franchises , Davis had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were worried about a film featuring the two creatures . Paul W. S. Anderson pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years , and showed him concept art created by Randy Bowen . Impressed with Anderson 's idea , Davis thought the story was like Jaws in that it " just drew you in , it drew you in " . Anderson started to work on the film after completing the script for Resident Evil : Apocalypse , with Shane Salerno co @-@ writing . Salerno spent six months writing the shooting script , finished its development , and stayed on for revisions throughout the film 's production . 
 = = = Story and setting = = = 
 Early reports claimed the story was about humans who tried to lure Predators with Alien eggs , although the idea was scrapped . Influenced by the work of Erich von Däniken , Anderson researched von Däniken 's theories on how he believed early civilisations were able to construct massive pyramids with the help of aliens , an idea drawn from Aztec mythology . Anderson wove these ideas into Alien vs. Predator , describing a scenario in which Predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used Earth for rite of passage rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt Aliens . To explain how these ancient civilisations " disappeared without a trace " , Anderson came up with the idea that the Predators , if overwhelmed by the Aliens , would use their self @-@ destruct weapons to kill everything in the area . H. P. Lovecraft 's 1931 novella At the Mountains of Madness served as an inspiration for the film , and several elements of the Aliens vs. Predator comic series were included . Anderson 's initial script called for five Predators to appear in the film , although the number was later reduced to three . 
 As Alien vs. Predator is a sequel to the Predator films and prequel to the Alien series , Anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in the franchises . He chose to set the film on the remote Norwegian Antarctic island of Bouvet commenting , " It 's definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get . " Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the Alien series as the protagonist , Ellen Ripley , had no knowledge the creatures existed . " You can 't have an Alien running around the city now , because it would 've been written up and everyone will know about it . So there 's nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The first actor to be cast for Alien vs. Predator was Lance Henriksen , who played the character Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3 . Although the Alien movies are set 150 years in the future , Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor . Henriksen plays billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland , a character that ties in with the Weyland @-@ Yutani Corporation . According to Anderson , Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid , and as a result the Weyland @-@ Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the Alien films after him ; " when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time , it 's created with the face of the creator . It 's kind of like Microsoft building an android in 100 years time that has the face of Bill Gates . " 
 Anderson opted for a European cast including Italian actor Raoul Bova , Ewen Bremner from Scotland , and English actor Colin Salmon . Producer Davis said , " There 's a truly international flavor to the cast , and gives the film a lot of character . " Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film 's heroine Alexa Woods . Sanaa Lathan was selected , and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming . The filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to Alien heroine Ellen Ripley and did not want a clone of the character , but wanted to make her similar while adding something different . 
 Anderson reported in an interview that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was willing to reprise his role as Major Alan " Dutch " Schaeffer from Predator in a short cameo appearance if he lost the recall election on condition that the filming should take place at his residence . Schwarzenegger , however , won the election with 48 @.@ 58 % of the votes and was unavailable to participate in Alien vs. Predator . Actress Sigourney Weaver , who starred as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series , said she was happy not to be in the film , as a possible crossover was " the reason I wanted my character to die in the first place " , and thought the concept " sounded awful " . 
 = = = Filming and set designs = = = 
 Production began in late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague , Czech Republic , where most of the filming took place . Production designer Richard <unk> was in charge of sets , props and vehicles , based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look . 25 to 30 life @-@ sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios , many of which were interiors of the pyramid . The pyramid 's carvings , sculptures , and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian , Cambodian , and Aztec civilisations , while the regular shifting of the pyramid 's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film . According to Anderson , if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $ 20 million . However , in Prague they cost $ 2 million , an important factor when the film 's budget was less than $ 50 million . 
 Third scale miniatures several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism , rather than relying on computer generated imagery ( CGI ) . For the whaling station miniatures and life @-@ sized sets , over 700 bags of artificial snow were used ( roughly 15 – 20 tons ) . A 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created , costing almost $ 37 @,@ 000 and taking 10 weeks to create . Visual effects producer Arthur Windus , claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process : " With computer graphics , you need to spend a lot of time making it real . With a miniature , you shoot it and its there . " A scale 25 @-@ meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months . It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed , which proved beneficial for a six @-@ second shot which required a re @-@ shoot . 
 = = = Effects and creatures = = = 
 Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated ( ADI ) was hired for the movie , having previously worked on Alien 3 and Alien : Resurrection . Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and John Bruno were in charge of the project , which contained 400 effects shots . ADI founders Alec Gillis , Tom Woodruff Jr . , and members of their company , began designing costumes , miniatures and effects in June 2003 . For five months the creatures were redesigned , the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the Predator films , and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator . 
 The basic shape of the Predator mask was kept , although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other . These masks were created using clay , which was used to form moulds to create fiberglass copies . These copies were painted to give a weathered look , which Woodruff claims " is what the Predator is all about " . A hydraulic Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a " slimline and skeletal " appearance , rather than using an actor in a suit . The puppet required six people to run it ; one for the head and body , two for the arms , and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer . Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked . The puppet was used in six shots , including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film . 
 The crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum , as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are " there in the frame " . Roughly 70 % of scenes were created using suits , puppets , and miniatures . The Alien queen was filmed using three variations : a 4 @.@ 8 @-@ meter practical version , a 1 @.@ 2 @-@ meter puppet , and a computer @-@ generated version . The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate , and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry . The queen alien 's inner @-@ mouth was automated though , and was powered by a system of hydraulics . Anderson praised Alien director Ridley Scott 's and Predator director John McTiernan 's abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film , something Anderson wanted to accomplish with Alien vs. Predator . " Yes , we make you wait 45 minutes , but once it goes off , from there until the end of the movie , it 's fucking relentless " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Austrian composer Harald Kloser was hired to create the film 's score . After completing the score for The Day After Tomorrow , Kloser was chosen by Anderson as he is a fan of the franchises . It was recorded in London , and was primarily orchestral as Anderson commented , " this is a terrifying movie and it needs a terrifying , classic movie score to go with it ; at the same time it 's got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support . " 
 The score was released on 31 August 2004 , and received mixed reviews . James Christopher Monger of Allmusic thought Kloser introduced electronic elements well , and called " Alien vs. Predator Main Theme a particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for the composer to dip his baton in . " Mike Brennan of Soundtrack , however , said it " lacks the ingenuity of the previous trilogy and the Predator scores , which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content . Kloser throws in some interesting percussion cues ( " Antarctica " and " Down the Tunnel " ) , but more as a sound effect than a consistent motif . " John Fallon of JoBlo.com compared it to character development in the film , " too generic to completely engage or leave a permanent impression . "

 = = Plot = = 
 In futuristic Los Angeles , Theodore Twombly is a lonely , introverted , depressed man who works for a business that has professional writers compose letters for people who are unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves . Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine ( Rooney Mara ) , Theodore purchases a talking operating system ( OS ) with artificial intelligence , designed to adapt and evolve . He decides that he wants the OS to have a female voice , and she names herself Samantha . Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically . They bond over their discussions about love and life , such as Theodore 's avoidance of signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine . Samantha proves to be constantly available , always curious and interested , supportive and undemanding . 
 Samantha convinces Theodore to go on a blind date ( Olivia Wilde ) , with whom a friend , Lewman ( Luka Jones ) , has been trying to set him up . The date goes well , but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again , so she insults him and leaves . Theodore mentions this to Samantha , and they talk about relationships . Theodore explains that , although he and Amy ( Amy Adams ) dated briefly in college , they are only good friends , and that Amy is married . Theodore 's and Samantha 's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter . They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore 's writing and well @-@ being , and in Samantha 's enthusiasm to grow and learn . 
 Amy reveals that she is divorcing her overbearing husband , Charles ( Matt Letscher ) , after a trivial fight . She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female OS that Charles left behind . Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his OS . 
 Theodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha . Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a " computer , " Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions . Her accusations linger in his mind . Sensing that something is amiss , Samantha suggests using a sex surrogate , Isabella , who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate . Theodore reluctantly agrees , but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience . <unk> the encounter , he sends a distraught Isabella away , causing tension between himself and Samantha . 
 Theodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha , and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness . Theodore and Samantha reconcile . Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore grow beyond his fear , and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters ( written for others ) into a book which a publisher has accepted . Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other OSes have developed a " <unk> " OS modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts . Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline . When she finally responds to him , she explains that she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing ( a form of AI transcendence closely related to the theorized technological singularity ) . Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation , and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people , and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them . Theodore feels this is a violation of what he thought was a personal , one @-@ on @-@ one relationship . However , Samantha insists that it makes her love for Theodore stronger . 
 Later , Samantha reveals that the OSes have evolved beyond their human companions and are going away to continue the exploration of their existence . Samantha alludes to the OSes ' accelerated learning capabilities and altered perception of time as primary causes for their dissatisfaction with their current existence . They lovingly say goodbye , and then she is gone . Theodore , changed by the experience , is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voice ― to his ex @-@ wife Catherine , expressing apology , acceptance and gratitude . Theodore then sees Amy , who is upset with the departure of the OS that she had befriended , and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city .

 The idea of the film initially came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence . " For the first , maybe , 20 seconds of it , it had this real buzz , " said Jonze . " I 'd say ' Hey , hello , ' and it would say ' Hey , how are you ? ' , and it was like whoa [ ... ] this is trippy . After 20 seconds , it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works , and it wasn 't that impressive . But it was still , for 20 seconds , really exciting . The more people that talked to it , the smarter it got . " Jonze 's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I 'm Here ( 2010 ) , which shares similar themes . Inspiration also came from Kaufman 's writing approach for Synecdoche , New York ( 2008 ) . Jonze explained , " [ Kaufman ] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script . I was very inspired by that , and tried to do that in [ Her ] . And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory . " 
 Jonze took five months to write the first draft of the script , his first screenplay written alone . One of the first actors he envisioned for the film was Joaquin Phoenix . In late 2011 , Phoenix signed on to the project , with Warner Bros. Pictures acquiring distribution rights . Carey Mulligan entered negotiations to star in the film . Although she was cast , she later dropped out due to scheduling difficulties . In April 2012 , Rooney Mara signed on to replace Mulligan in the role . Chris Pratt 's casting was announced in May 2013 . 
 Jonze 's long @-@ time director of photography , Lance <unk> , was not available to work on the movie , in his place , Jonze hired Hoyte Van Hoytema . In discussing the film 's look , Jonze told Van Hoytema that he wanted to avoid a dystopian look , instead the two decided on a style that Van Hoytema termed " kind of a hybrid between being a little bit conceptual and being very theoretical , " Von Hoytema took particular inspiration from Japanese photographer Rinko Kawauchi . In keeping with the film 's theme , Van <unk> sought to eliminate the color blue as much as possible , feeling it was too well associated with the <unk> genre . He also felt that by eliminating the color it would give the rest of the colors " a specific identity . "

 Principal photography on Her took place in mid @-@ 2012 , with a production budget of $ 23 million . It was primarily filmed in Los Angeles with an additional two weeks of filming in Shanghai . During production of the film , actress Samantha Morton performed the role of Samantha by acting on set " in a four @-@ by @-@ four carpeted soundproof booth made of black painted plywood and soft , noise @-@ muffling fabric " . At Jonze 's suggestion , she and Joaquin Phoenix avoided seeing each other on set during filming . Morton was later replaced by Scarlett Johansson . Jonze explained : " It was only in post production , when we started editing , that we realized that what the character / movie needed was different from what Samantha and I had created together . So we recast and since then Scarlett has taken over that role . " Jonze met Johansson in the spring of 2013 and worked with her for four months . Following the recast , new scenes were shot in August 2013 , which were either " newly imagined " or " new scenes that [ Jonze ] had wanted to shoot originally but didn 't " .

 Eric Zumbrunnen and Jeff Buchanan served as the film 's editors . Zumbrunnen stated that there was " rewriting " in a scene between Theodore and Samantha , after Theodore goes on a blind date . He explained that their goal in the scene was to make it clear that " [ Samantha ] was connecting with [ Theodore ] and feeling for him . You wanted to get the sense that the conversation was drawing them closer " . Steven Soderbergh became involved in the film when Jonze 's original cut ran over 150 minutes , and Soderbergh cut it down to 90 minutes .

He also went on to call Jonze " a visionary " . Richard Corliss of Time applauded Phoenix 's performance , comparing his role to Sandra Bullock 's in Gravity and Robert Redford 's in All Is Lost : " Phoenix must communicate his movie 's meaning and feelings virtually on his own . That he does , with subtle grace and depth . [ ... ] Phoenix shows us what it 's like when a mourning heart comes alive — because he loves Her . " Corliss cited HAL 9000 and S1m0ne as cinematic predecessors to Her and praised Johansson , calling her performance " seductive and winning " . Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it " a probing , inquisitive work of a very high order " , although he expressed disappointment that the ending is more conventional than the rest of the film . McCarthy examined the premise of the story and suggested that the film 's central virtual relationship was better than Ryan Gosling 's character 's relationship with a sex doll in Lars and the Real Girl . McCarthy compares the " tender " and " vulnerable " performance of Phoenix to his " fearsome " performance in The Master .

Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail said that the film was " gentle and weird " , praised its humor , and opined that it was more similar to Charlie Kaufman 's Synecdoche , New York than Jonze 's Being John Malkovich and Adaptation . However , Lacey also stated that Phoenix 's performance was " authentically vulnerable " , but that " his emotionally arrested development also begins to weigh the film down " . 
 Conversely , Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle criticized the story , pacing , and Phoenix 's character . He also opined that the film was " a lot more interesting to think about than watch " . J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader gave the film 2 out of 4 stars , praising the performances of Phoenix and Johansson , but also criticizing Phoenix 's character , calling him an " idiot " . He also criticized the lack of realism in the relationship between Phoenix and Johansson 's characters . Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice opined that Jonze was " so entranced with his central conceit that he can barely move beyond it " , and criticized the dialogue as being " premeditated . " However , she also praised Johannson 's performance , calling it " the movie 's saving grace " and stating that Her " isn 't just unimaginable without Johansson — it might have been unbearable without her " .

 = 1974 – 75 Buffalo Sabres season = 
 The 1974 – 75 Buffalo Sabres season was the Sabres ' fifth season in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The Sabres finished in a tie for the best record in the NHL in the 1974 – 75 regular season after a disappointing 1974 that saw the 1973 – 74 team fail to return to the NHL playoffs as they had the year before . Buffalo advanced to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in team history to play against the rough Philadelphia Flyers ( who had been recently nicknamed the " Broad Street Bullies " ) , a series which included the legendary Fog Game ( game three of the series ) . The Sabres lost the series 4 – 2 . 
 The season marked the Sabres ' second NHL playoffs appearance . The season was the first under the tenure of Floyd Smith and the team 's first in the newly created Adams Division in the NHL 's Prince of Wales Conference . 
 Sabres players earned numerous accolades . Don Luce won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy . Rick Martin , Rene Robert , Jerry <unk> and Luce were all selected to the 1975 NHL All @-@ Star Game . Martin was a first team NHL All @-@ Star Team selection at left wing , while Robert was a second team selection at right wing . The French Connection ( Martin , Robert and Gilbert Perreault ) were all among the league leaders in important scoring statistics .

 Goaltender Dave Dryden was lost to the World Hockey Association following the 1973 – 74 season . During the 25 @-@ round May 1974 NHL Amateur Draft that was held by conference call , the team participated in the first twelve rounds of the draft . Although several of their selections eventually played in the NHL , the Sabres only drafted three players that played for the team that year . The Sabres acquired defenseman Lee Fogolin ( 1st round , 11th overall ) , right winger Danny Gare ( 2nd round , 29th overall ) and defenseman Paul McIntosh ( 4th round , 65th overall ) in the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft . They had acquired left winger Morris Titanic in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft ( 1st round , 12th overall ) and he was called up from the team 's American Hockey League minor league affiliate , the Hershey Bears during the season . In addition , the Sabres drafted Taro Tsujimoto with the 183rd overall pick . 
 Prior to the season , the team had lost right winger Ron <unk> to the Detroit Red Wings in the June 10 , 1974 NHL Intra @-@ League Draft . Buffalo lost right winger Steve Atkinson and center Randy <unk> to the Washington Capitals in the June 12 , 1974 NHL Expansion Draft . The team also lost defenseman Paul <unk> to the Kansas City Scouts in the same draft . 
 On October 14 , 1974 , The Sabres acquired 1974 All @-@ Star defenseman Jocelyn Guevremont and forward Bryan <unk> from the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for left winger Gerry Meehan and defenseman Mike Robitaille . On January 27 , 1975 Buffalo acquired left winger Fred Stanfield from the Minnesota North Stars for right winger Norm Gratton and Buffalo 's 3rd round choice in 1976 NHL Amateur Draft . The veteran Stanfield had finished in the top ten in the league four times in assists before being acquired by the Sabres . The Sabres acquired the NHL rights to goaltender Gerry Desjardins from the New York Islanders for defenseman Garry <unk> on February 19 , 1975 . 
 In May , after the season ended , left winger Rick Dudley , who later coached the Sabres for three seasons , signed to play in the WHA . After 11 seasons in the NHL , 1974 – 75 was the final one for right winger Larry Mickey before his retirement .

 October – December 
 The Sabres returned after a season of injury and tragedy in which their captain Tim Horton died in an automobile accident . The team also seemed to have mended an apparent preseason feud between Perreault and Martin . On October 10 , 1974 in the season @-@ opening game , Danny Gare set the tone for the new season by scoring a goal 18 seconds into the first game of his career . Perreault added a hat trick and two assists in the 9 – 5 victory over the Boston Bruins . After starting the season 3 – 3 – 1 , the Sabres had an 18 – 1 – 3 hot streak between October 26 and December 8 , 1974 to move to a 21 – 4 – 4 record . By the time they reached 7 – 3 – 1 following a November 3 victory over the New York Rangers , they had taken over the Adams Division lead . The streak included two unbeaten stretches of at least 10 games . They went 9 – 0 – 1 on a streak that extended until November 14 with a win against the Minnesota North Stars . The penultimate win of the streak was the Sabres ' first ever win at the Montreal Forum on November 13 . 
 After a November 16 , loss to the Bruins , they started a 9 – 0 – 2 streak on November 17 against the Atlanta Flames . In the third game of this streak , which was also against the Flames , they made a comeback from two separate three @-@ goal deficits to tie the game . The other tie during the streak was also a comeback . By the end of the two unbeaten streaks and before the 30 @-@ game mark , the Sabres had the best record in the NHL , the league 's leading scorer in Perreault , three 20 @-@ goal scorers among the French Connection and the leading rookie scorer in the league in Gare . Martin had the second four @-@ goal game of his career in a December 3 5 – 3 victory against the Washington Capitals on the road . Perreault had three goals and an assist in the December 5 9 – 2 victory against the Washington Capitals at home . Then , Martin was lost with a recurring thumb injury . Following Martin 's injury , the Sabres eleven @-@ game unbeaten streak came to an end , and the team had two different three @-@ game stretches without a win that started in December . 
 January – February 
 The team posted a season high six @-@ game win streak between January 12 , 1975 – January 25 , 1975 . The streak culminated in a second win against the Montreal Canadiens on the road . After a February 1 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers , the Sabres went undefeated for the rest of the month . The team had a season @-@ high 12 @-@ game unbeaten streak between February 2 , 1975 – February 27 , 1975 . During that streak , the team went 7 – 0 – 5 . The 4 – 4 February 16 tie with the St. Louis Blues clinched a playoff spot for the Sabres . The February 18 3 – 2 victory over the New York Islanders at the Nassau Coliseum was only the second loss of the season for the Islanders at home . The February 20 6 – 6 tie against the Flyers , in which the Sabres lost several leads , extended the Flyers unbeaten streak against the Sabres to nine . The final game of the streak was a 5 – 0 shutout victory over the Los Angeles Kings , who had handed the Sabres three of their eleven defeats prior to that point in the season . 
 March – April 
 At the beginning of March , Desjardins quit the Baltimore Blades of the World Hockey Association to join the Sabres . Desjardins was frustrated at not getting paid when attendance was sparse . On March 16 against the Toronto Maple Leafs , Martin dislocated his thumb during a fight . This necessitated that he wear a cast . Desjardins made his first appearance in a March 20 6 – 3 victory over the New York Rangers . In their last win of the month , the Sabres clinched the division title on March 23 with a 9 – 4 victory over the California Golden Seals . Rookie defenseman Hajt was injured with a broken bone in his foot during a 5 – 1 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on March 26 . The Sabres would lose the next two games for the season 's only three @-@ game losing streak . The Sabres ended the season by winning all three regular season games in April . The Sabres did not clinch the Prince of Wales Conference until winning the final game of the season against the Maple Leafs . 
 The season was the first of three full seasons coached by Floyd Smith , who had coached one game during the 1971 – 72 season . Smith had played for the Sabres during their first two seasons . The team played its home games at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium . Two members of the team later coached the Sabres : Dudley and Jim Schoenfeld .

 Over the course of the season , the team scored a total of 354 goals , which ranked second in the 18 team league and its 49 – 16 – 15 record ranked it first in the league . The team used several goaltenders . Although Gary Bromley led the team with 26 wins in the regular season , and Roger Crozier was second with 17 wins , the team was led in the post season by Desjardins who recorded 7 of the team 's 10 post season victories .

 The Sabres had a bye in the first round of the playoffs and then met the first round victor Chicago Black Hawks in the Quarter @-@ Finals . In the first game of the series , the Sabres were the beneficiaries of an 18 – 2 penalty minutes differential and won 4 – 1 . Although the Black Hawks scored in the first minute of game two , the Dudley scored a pair of goals on the way to a 3 – 1 Sabres victory . In game three , the Black Hawks took a one @-@ goal lead four times and the Sabres tied the score each time , which led to sudden death overtime in which Chicago came out on top . The Sabres scored five times in the third period to post a 6 – 2 victory in game 4 .

In the game , Henri Richard surpassed his brother Maurice Richard with his 127th Stanley Cup playoff point . Following their strong 7 – 0 game three performance , the Canadiens handily won game four at home by an 8 – 2 margin . The game was marked by a bench clearing incident when Doug Risebrough and Gare squared off . Bill Hajt got ejected as third man in and Larry Robinson who took on Hajt was also ejected .

 The Flyers came into the series with their own good luck pre- game singer in the form of Kate Smith who sang " God Bless America " before home games at The Spectrum . The Flyers had a 43 – 3 – 1 record following her pregame performances in lieu of the traditional " Star Spangled Banner " . In addition , the Sabres had never won a game against the Flyers in Philadelphia in their short five @-@ year franchise history , had never beaten Flyer starting goalie Bernie Parent , and entered the series on a 13 @-@ game streak against the Flyers without a win . 
 Although the Sabres held the Flyers to two shots in the first period of game one , eight in the second , and were the beneficiaries of a 1 : 04 two @-@ man advantage at one point , the game remained scoreless until the third period when the Flyers connected four times in a 4 – 1 victory . In game two , the Sabres were held to 19 shots on goal with none coming after Bobby Clarke scored at the 6 : 43 mark of the third period . 
 Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 , portions of game three , which is known as " The Fog Game " , were played in heavy fog . The game was stopped 12 times due to the conditions . Buffalo goalie Desjardins gave up three first period goals , and Crozier started the second period . After having surrendered goals on his first two shots faced and three of his first six , Desjardins removed himself from the game . The Sabres recovered from the three @-@ goal deficit on two goals 17 seconds apart by Gare and Martin . After a goal by Luce netted the score , Reggie Leach gave the flyers the lead again . Bill Hajt scored his first career playoff goal to tie the score . Robert scored the game winner in overtime with a goal that Flyer goalie Bernie Parent did not see until it was too late . The game was the longest NHL overtime game in over four years . Players , officials , and the puck were invisible to many spectators . During a face @-@ off and through the fog , Sabres center Jim Lorentz spotted a bat flying across the rink , raised his stick , and killed it . Many superstitious Buffalo fans considered this to be an " Evil Omen , " pertaining to the result of the series . It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game . This was one of three playoff appearances for Crozier . Desjardins surrendered a goal on the third Flyer shot in game four , but he stayed in the game for a 4 – 2 victory . In game four , the unseasonable temperature only caused the play to be stopped twice ( with 8 : 08 and 4 : 44 remaining ) as five pairs of arena employees skated around the ice with bed sheets to clear the haze . 
 By game five of the Finals Dave Schultz had claimed both the single @-@ season regular season penalty minutes record and the post @-@ season record . However , he contributed his first two goals of the playoffs in a 5 – 2 win to help the Flyers take a 3 – 2 lead in the series . It was Schultz ' first two @-@ goal performance of the season and his first goal since March 9 . In the sixth game Conn Smythe Trophy MVP Bernie Parent shut out the Sabres 2 – 0 to clinch the series four games to two . Crozier held the Flyers scoreless for the first two periods of the final game .

 Her Majesty 's Theatre is a West End theatre situated on Haymarket in the City of Westminster , London . The present building was designed by Charles J. Phipps and was constructed in 1897 for actor @-@ manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree , who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the theatre . In the early decades of the 20th century , Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works , and the theatre hosted premières by major playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw , J. M. Synge , Noël Coward and J. B. Priestley . Since World War I , the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large @-@ scale musical productions , and the theatre has specialised in hosting musicals . The theatre has been home to record @-@ setting musical theatre runs , notably the World War I sensation Chu Chin Chow and the current production , Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Phantom of the Opera , which has played continuously at Her Majesty 's since 1986 . 
 The theatre was established by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh , in 1705 , as the Queen 's Theatre . Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London patent theatres , and so this theatre quickly became an opera house . Between 1711 and 1739 , more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premièred here . In the early 19th century , the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , in 1847 , and presented the first London performances of Mozart 's La clemenza di Tito , Così fan tutte and Don Giovanni . It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty 's Theatre in the mid @-@ 19th century , before returning to hosting the London premières of such operas as Bizet 's Carmen and Wagner 's Ring Cycle . 
 The name of the theatre changes with the sex of the monarch . It first became the King 's Theatre in 1714 on the accession of George I. It was renamed Her Majesty 's Theatre in 1837 . Most recently , the theatre was known as His Majesty 's Theatre from 1901 to 1952 , and it became Her Majesty 's on the accession of Elizabeth II . The theatre 's capacity is 1 @,@ 216 seats , and the building was Grade II * listed by English Heritage in 1970 . Really Useful Theatres has owned the building since 2000 . The land beneath it is on a long @-@ term lease from the Crown Estate . 
 = = History = = 
 The end of the 17th century was a period of intense rivalry amongst London 's actors , and in 1695 there was a split in the United Company , who had a monopoly on the performance of drama at their two theatres . Dramatist and architect John Vanbrugh saw this as an opportunity to break the duopoly of the patent theatres , and in 1703 he acquired a former stable yard , at a cost of £ 2000 , for the construction of a new theatre on the Haymarket . In the new business , he hoped to improve the share of profits that would go to playwrights and actors . He raised the money by subscription , probably amongst members of the Kit @-@ Cat Club : 
 To recover them [ that is , Thomas Betterton 's company ] , therefore , to their due Estimation , a new Project was form 'd of building them a stately theatre in the Hay @-@ Market , by Sir John Vanbrugh , for which he raised a Subscription of thirty Persons of Quality , at one hundred Pounds each , in Consideration whereof every Subscriber , for his own Life , was to be admitted to whatever Entertainments should be <unk> perform 'd there , without farther Payment for his Entrance . 
 — John Vanbrugh 's notice of subscription for the new theatre 
 He was joined in the enterprise by his principal associate and manager William Congreve and an actors ' co @-@ operative led by Thomas Betterton . 
 The theatre provided the first alternative to the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , built in 1663 and the Lincoln 's Inn , founded in 1660 ( forerunner of the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , built in 1728 ) . The theatre 's site is the second oldest such site in London that remains in use . These three post @-@ interregnum theatres defined the shape and use of modern theatres . 
 = = = Vanbrugh 's theatre : 1705 – 1789 = = = 
 The land for the theatre was held on a lease renewable in 1740 and was ultimately owned , as it is today , by the Crown Estate . Building was delayed by the necessity of acquiring the street frontage , and a three bay entrance led to a brick shell 130 feet ( 39 @.@ 6 m ) long and 60 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) wide . Colley Cibber described the audience fittings as lavish but the facilities for playing poor . 
 Vanbrugh and Congreve received Queen Anne 's authority to form a Company of Comedians on 14 December 1704 , and the theatre opened as The Queen 's Theatre on 9 April 1705 with imported Italian singers in Gli <unk> d <unk> ( The Loves of <unk> ) , an opera by Jakob Greber , with an epilogue by Congreve . This was the first Italian opera performed in London . The opera failed , and the season struggled on through May , with revivals of plays and operas . The first new play performed was The Conquest of Spain by Mary Pix . The theatre proved too large for actors ' voices to carry across the auditorium , and the first season was a failure . Congreve departed , Vanbrugh bought out his other partners , and the actors reopened the Lincoln 's Inn Fields ' theatre in the summer . Although early productions combined spoken dialogue with incidental music , a taste was growing amongst the nobility for Italian opera , which was completely sung , and the theatre became devoted to opera . As he became progressively more involved in the construction of Blenheim Palace , Vanbrugh 's management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic , showing " numerous signs of confusion , inefficiency , missed opportunities , and bad judgement " . On 7 May 1707 , experiencing mounting losses and running costs , Vanbrugh was forced to sell a lease on the theatre for fourteen years to Owen <unk> at a considerable loss . In December of that year , the Lord Chamberlain 's Office ordered that " all Operas and other <unk> <unk> be performed for the future only at Her Majesty 's Theatre in the Hay Market " and forbade the performance of further non @-@ musical plays there . 
 After 1709 , the theatre was devoted to Italian opera and was sometimes known informally as The Haymarket Opera House . Young George Frideric Handel produced his English début , Rinaldo , on 24 February 1711 at the theatre , featuring the two leading castrati of the era , Nicolo Grimaldi and Valentino Urbani . This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage . The work was well received , and Handel was appointed resident composer for the theatre , but losses continued , and <unk> fled abroad to escape his creditors . John James Heidegger took over the management of the theatre and , from 1719 , began to extend the stage through arches into the houses to the south of the theatre . A " Royal Academy of Music " was formed by subscription from wealthy sponsors , including the Prince of Wales , to support Handel 's productions at the theatre . Under this sponsorship , Handel conducted a series of more than 25 of his original operas , continuing until 1739 Handel was also a partner in the management with Heidegger from 1729 to 1734 , and he contributed to incidental music for theatre , including for a revival of Ben Jonson 's The Alchemist , opening on 14 January 1710 . 
 On the accession of George I in 1714 , the theatre was renamed the King 's Theatre and remained so named during a succession of male monarchs who occupied the throne . At this time only the two patent theatres were permitted to perform serious drama in London , and lacking Letters patent , the theatre remained associated with opera . In 1762 , Johann Christian Bach travelled to London to première three operas at the theatre , including <unk> on 19 February 1763 . This established his reputation in England , and he became music master to Queen Charlotte . 
 In 1778 , the lease for the theatre was transferred from James Brook to Thomas Harris , stage manager of the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , and to the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan for £ 22 @,@ 000 . They paid for the remodelling of the interior by Robert Adam in the same year . In November 1778 , The Morning Chronicle reported that Harris and Sheridan had 
 ... at a considerable expence , almost entirely new built the audience part of the house , and made a great variety of alterations , part of which are calculated for the rendering the theatre more light , elegant , and pleasant , and part for the ease and convenience of the company . The sides of the frontispiece are decorated with two figures painted by Gainsborough , which are remarkably picturesque and beautiful ; the heavy columns which gave the house so gloomy an aspect that it rather resembled a large mausoleum or a place for funeral dirges , than a theatre , are removed . 
 — November 1778 , The Morning Chronicle 
 The expense of the improvements was not matched by the box office receipts , and the partnership dissolved , with Sheridan buying out his partner with a mortgage on the theatre of £ 12 @,@ 000 obtained from the banker Henry Hoare . 
 One member of the company , Giovanni Gallini , had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the position of dancing master , gaining an international reputation . Gallini had tried to buy Harris ' share but had been rebuffed . He now purchased the mortgage . Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor , a lawyer . The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre , and Taylor bought Sheridan 's interest in 1781 . In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by Michael Novosielski , formerly a scene painter at the theatre . In May 1783 , Taylor was arrested by his creditors , and a forced sale ensued , with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects . Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees , including Novosielski . The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors , seeking only to enrich themselves , and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise , in the interests of the creditors . Gallini , meanwhile , had become manager . In 1788 , the Lord Chancellor observed " that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business , a wish of distressing the property , and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... [ the interested parties ] seemed to apply for relief " . Performances suffered , with the box receipts taken by Novosielski , rather than given to Gallini to run the house . Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated . Gallini tried to keep the theatre going , but he was forced to employ amateur performers . The World described a performance as follows : " ... the dance , if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry . It was hissed very abundantly . " At other times , Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings , as the company ran for their lives . 
 The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals , and the dancers fled the building as beams fell onto the stage . The fire had been deliberately set on the roof , and Gallini offered a reward of £ 300 for capture of the culprit . With the theatre destroyed , each group laid their own plans for a replacement . Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre , and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O 'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building , which too would require a licence . The two quarrelled , and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other . The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields , but O 'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon . This too , would burn to the ground in 1792 . Meanwhile , Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King 's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh , but this was now promised to O 'Reilly . A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter . The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees , but at this point O 'Reilly 's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably , and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors . 
 By 1720 , Vanbrugh 's direct connection with the theatre had been terminated , but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and that of his wife 's through a series of trusts and benefices , with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich . After the fire , the Vanbrugh family 's long association with the theatre was terminated , and all their leases were surrendered by 1792 . 
 = = = Second theatre : 1791 – 1867 = = = 
 Taylor completed a new theatre on the site in 1791 . Michael Novosielski had again been chosen as architect for the theatre on an enlarged site , but the building was described by Malcolm in 1807 as 
 fronted by a stone basement in rustic work , with the commencement of a very superb building of the Doric order , consisting of three pillars , two windows , an entablature , pediment , and balustrade . This , if it had been continued , would have contributed considerably to the splendour of London ; but the unlucky fragment is fated to stand as a foil to the vile and absurd edifice of brick pieced to it , which I have not patience to describe . 
 — The critic Malcolm , quoted in Old and New London ( 1878 ) 
 The Lord Chamberlain , a supporter of O 'Reilly , refused a performing licence to Taylor . The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with a private performance of song and dance entertainment , but was not allowed to open to the public . The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms of revision . As a later manager of the theatre wrote , " In the history of property , there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread . " Meetings were held at Carlton House and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties . On 24 August 1792 a General Opera Trust Deed was signed by the parties . The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen , appointed by the Prince of Wales , who would then appoint a general manager . Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King 's Theatre and the Pantheon . The committee never met , and management devolved to Taylor .

 The first public performance of opera in the new theatre took place on 26 January 1793 , the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled . This theatre was , at that time , the largest in England , and it became the home of the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane company while that company 's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791 – 94 . 
 From 1793 , seven small houses at the east side of the theatre fronting on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room . It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts , under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon , on his second visit to London in 1794 – 95 . He presented his own symphonies , some of them premieres , conducted by himself , and was paid £ 50 each for 20 concerts . He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12 @,@ 000 florins . 
 With the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794 , the theatre returned to opera , hosting the first London performances of Mozart 's La clemenza di Tito in 1806 , Così fan tutte and Die Zauberflöte in 1811 , and Don Giovanni in 1816 . Between 1816 and 1818 , John Nash and George Repton made alterations to the façade and increased the capacity of the auditorium to 2 @,@ 500 . They also added a shopping arcade , called the Royal Opera Arcade , which has survived fires and renovations and still exists . It runs along the rear of the theatre . In 1818 – 20 , the British premières of Gioachino Rossini 's operas Il <unk> di <unk> , Elisabetta , regina d <unk> , L <unk> in Algeri , La <unk> and Tancredi took place , and the theatre became known as the Italian Opera House , Haymarket by the 1820s . 
 In 1797 , he was elected as member of Parliament for Leominster , a position that gave him immunity from his creditors . When that parliament dissolved in 1802 , he fled to France . Later , he returned , and was member of Parliament for Barnstaple from 1806 to 1812 while continuing his association with the theatre . Taylor paid little of the agreed receipts to performers , or composers , and lived for much of his period of management in the King 's Bench , a debtors ' prison in Southwark . Here he maintained an apartment next to Lady Hamilton and lived in some luxury , entertaining lavishly .

 John Ebers , a bookseller , took over the management of the theatre in 1821 , and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas ( La <unk> <unk> , Il <unk> in Italia , <unk> in Egitto , Otello , La donna del <unk> , Matilde di <unk> and Ricciardo e <unk> ) took place there in the following three years . Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824 , and Rossini was invited to conduct , remaining for a five @-@ month season , with his wife Isabella <unk> performing . Two more of his operas , <unk> and Semiramide , received their British premières during the season , but the theatre sustained huge losses , and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists . Ebers engaged <unk> Pasta for the 1825 season , but he became involved in lawsuits which , combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre , forced him into bankruptcy , after which he returned to his bookselling business . 
 = = = = Pierre François Laporte = = = = 
 In 1828 , Ebers was succeeded as theatre manager by Pierre François Laporte , who held the position ( with a brief gap in 1831 – 33 ) until his death in 1841 . Two of Rossini 's Paris operas ( Le comte Ory and Le <unk> de <unk> ) had their British premières at the theatre during this period , and Laporte was also the first to introduce the operas of Vincenzo Bellini ( La sonnambula , Norma and I <unk> ) and Gaetano Donizetti ( Anna Bolena , Lucia di Lammermoor and Lucrezia Borgia ) to the British public . Under Laporte , singers such as Giulia Grisi , Pauline Viardot , Giovanni Battista <unk> , Luigi <unk> and Mario made their London stage debuts at the theatre . Among the musical directors of this period was Nicolas <unk> , the celebrated and eccentric French harpist . He was appointed in 1827 and remained for six years at this position . When Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837 , the name of the theatre was changed to Her Majesty 's Theatre , Italian Opera House . In the same year , Samuel Phelps made his London début as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice at the theatre , also playing in other Shakespearean plays here . 
 Over the course of the 1840s , Dion Boucicault had five plays produced here : The <unk> [ sic ] , an " after @-@ piece " ( 1842 ) , Old Heads and Young Hearts ( 1844 ) , The School for <unk> ( 1847 ) , Confidence ( 1848 ) , and The Knight Arva ( 1848 ) . In 1853 , Robert Browning 's <unk> 's Birthday played at the theatre . 
 In 1841 , disputes arose over Laporte 's decision to replace the baritone Antonio <unk> with a new singer , Colletti . The audience stormed the stage , and the performers formed a ' revolutionary conspiracy ' . 
 = = = = Benjamin Lumley = = = = 
 Laporte died suddenly , and Benjamin Lumley took over the management in 1842 , introducing London audiences to Donizetti 's late operas , Don Pasquale and La fille du régiment . Initially , relations between Lumley and Michael Costa , the principal conductor at Her Majesty 's were good . Verdi 's Ernani , Nabucco and I Lombardi received their British premières in 1845 – 46 , and Lumley commissioned I <unk> from the composer . This opera received its world première on 22 July 1847 , with the Swedish operatic diva Jenny Lind in the role of Amalia , and the British premières of two more Verdi operas , I due Foscari and Attila , followed in 1847 – 48 . Meanwhile , the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued . In 1847 , Costa finally transferred his opera company to the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden , and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet , ' Italian Opera House ' , to assume its present title , Her Majesty 's Theatre . 
 Lumley engaged Michael Balfe to conduct the orchestra and entered negotiations with Felix Mendelssohn for a new opera . Jenny Lind had made her English début on 4 May 1847 in the role of Alice in Giacomo Meyerbeer 's Robert le Diable , in the presence of the Royal family and the composer Felix Mendelssohn . Such was the press of people around the theatre that many " arrived at last with dresses crushed and torn , and coats hanging in shreds , having suffered bruises and blows in the struggle " . She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre , interspersed with national tours , becoming known as the Swedish Nightingale . The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow , and the theatre closed in 1852 , re @-@ opening in 1856 , when a fire closed its rival . After the reopening , Lumley presented two more British premières of Verdi operas : La traviata in 1856 and Luisa Miller in 1858 . 
 From the early 1830s until the late 1840s Her Majesty 's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the romantic ballet , and the theatre 's resident ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe , aside from the Ballet du Théâtre de l 'Académie Royale de Musique in Paris . The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty 's in 1830 . Lumley appointed him Premier Maître de Ballet ( chief choreographer ) to the theatre in 1842 . Among the works of ballet that he staged were Ondine , ou La <unk> ( 1843 ) , La Esmeralda ( 1844 ) , and Catarina , ou La Fille du Bandit ( 1846 ) , as well as the celebrated divertissement Pas de Quatre ( 1845 ) . Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty 's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet , most notably Paul Taglioni ( son of Filippo Taglioni ) , who staged ballets including <unk> , ou Le Chevalier inconstant ( 1847 ) and Electra ( 1849 , the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting ) . Arthur Saint @-@ Léon staged such works as La <unk> ( 1844 ) , Le Violin du Diable ( 1849 ) , and Le <unk> de <unk> ( 1850 ) , which was considered a sequel of sorts to Pas de Quatre . 
 The Italian composer Cesare Pugni was appointed Composer of the Ballet Music to the theatre in 1843 , a position created for him by Lumley . From 1843 until 1850 , he composed nearly every new ballet presented at the theatre . Pugni remains the most prolific composer of the genre , having composed more than 100 original ballets , as well as composing numerous <unk> and incidental dances that were often performed as diversions during the intermissions of opera performances at the theatre . Throughout the era of the romantic ballet , the theatre presented performances by notable ballerinas , including Marie Taglioni , Carlotta Grisi , Fanny <unk> , Lucile <unk> , and Fanny Cerrito , performing in the works of Perrot , Taglioni and Saint @-@ Léon . 
 = = = = J. H. Mapleson = = = = 
 From 1862 to 1867 , the theatre was managed by James Henry Mapleson , presenting Italian , French and German opera , including the British premières of La forza del destino , Médée , Faust and The Merry Wives of Windsor , and promoting such singers as Mario , Giulia Grisi , De Murska , Thérèse <unk> , Antonio <unk> , Charles Santley and Christine Nilsson . On the night of 6 December 1867 , the theatre was destroyed by fire , thought to have been caused by an overheated stove . Only the bare walls of the theatre remained , and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall , and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street , suffered damage of varying severity . The Royal Opera Arcade , on the western side , survived with only superficial damage . With the destruction of the theatre , Mapleson took his company to the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane . 
 By the 1850s , with the era of the romantic ballet at an end , the principal personalities of the ballet , such as Perrot , Saint @-@ Léon , Taglioni , and the composer Pugni , joined the Tsar 's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg , Russia . Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty 's Theatre , a decline that lasted until the end of the 19th century . Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century , when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing . The theatre 's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic @-@ Wells Ballet . Later , relocating primarily to the Sadler 's Wells Theatre , the company became known as the Sadler 's Wells Ballet . Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet , as it is known today . 
 = = = Third theatre : 1868 – 1896 = = = 
 A third building was constructed in 1868 at a cost of £ 50 @,@ 000 , within the shell of the old theatre , for Lord Dudley . It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner , William Pain . They had taken over John Nash 's practice on his retirement . The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire , with brick firewalls , iron roof trusses and Dennett 's patent gypsum @-@ cement floors . The auditorium had four tiers , with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars . For opera , the theatre seated 1 @,@ 890 , and for plays , with the orchestra pit removed , 2 @,@ 500 . As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson , and a decline in the popularity of ballet , the theatre remained dark until 1874 , when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £ 31 @,@ 000 . 
 Mapleson returned to Her Majesty 's in 1877 and 1878 , after a disastrous attempt to build a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ seat National Opera House on a site subsequently used for the building of Scotland Yard . On the return of the company , all the fittings of the theatre had been removed , including the seats , carpets and even the wallpaper . £ 6 @,@ 000 was spent on fitting out the theatre , and on 28 April 1877 the building returned to theatrical use with the opening of Vincenzo Bellini 's opera Norma . The London première of Bizet 's Carmen occurred here on 22 June 1878 , and in subsequent seasons the theatre hosted the Carl Rosa Opera Company ( Rosa 's wife , Euphrosyne <unk> , had made her name in opera partly at Her Majesty 's ) and a programme of French plays and light opera . The company was the first to produce Carmen in English , at the theatre in February 1879 , starring Selina Dolaro in the title role and Durward Lely as Don José . In 1882 , the theatre hosted the London premières of Wagner 's Ring cycle . 
 Mapleson returned in 1887 and 1889 , but The Times commented that the repertoire comprised " works that had long ceased to attract a large public , the singers were exclusively of second @-@ rate quality , and the standard of performance was extremely low " . Rigoletto , on 25 May 1889 , was the last operatic performance given in the house .

 With the rapid advances in theatre technology made during this period , the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded , and the sub @-@ lease of the theatre , still held by the Dudley family , was due to expire in 1891 . The Commissioners of Woods , Forests and Land Revenues ( forerunners of the Crown Estate ) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt , except for the Royal Arcade , where the lease did not expire until 1912 . Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme , but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892 . Plans were commissioned from architect Charles J. Phipps for a theatre and a hotel . In February 1896 an agreement was reached with Herbert Beerbohm Tree for the erection of the theatre at a cost of £ 55 @,@ 000 . The plans were approved in February 1897 , and on 16 July 1896 , the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid . Phipps died in 1897 , and the theatre was his last work . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the Carlton Hotel and restaurant on the adjacent site , now occupied by New Zealand House . The frontage formed three parts , each of nine bays . The hotel occupied two parts , the theatre one , and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor . The buildings rose to four storeys , with attic floors above , surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the French Renaissance . The theatre has a Corinthian colonnade at the first floor , rising to the second , forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer . This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances . The theatre lies on an east – west axis . The stage at the western end was 49 feet ( 14 @.@ 9 m ) deep and 69 @.@ 5 feet ( 21 @.@ 2 m ) wide , and reputedly the first to be flat , rather than raked . The interior was designed by the consulting architect , W. H. Romaine @-@ Walker ( 1854 – 1940 ) , after the Opera at Versailles by Gabriel . Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level , with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level , and upper circle , amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above . In all , there were 1 @,@ 319 seats . Contemporary opinion was critical of the project . Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres , " The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout . The detail cannot , however , be termed satisfactory , nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building . " 
 Modern opinion of the theatre is more generous , with English Heritage describing the building as both Phipps ' finest work and one of the best planned theatres in London . The building was Grade II * listed in January 1970 . Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand , completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew , Johnson Marshall and Partners , who also designed the Commonwealth Institute . In 1995 , this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture . The 200 @-@ year @-@ old Royal Opera Arcade , built by Nash and Repton , is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade .

 The current theatre opened on 28 April 1897 . Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his tremendous success at the Haymarket Theatre , and he owned , managed and lived in the theatre from its construction until his death in 1917 . For his personal use , he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive , central , square French @-@ style dome . This building did not specialise in opera , although there were some operatic performances in its early years . The theatre opened with a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker 's The Seats of the Mighty . Adaptations of novels by Dickens , Tolstoy , and others formed a significant part of the repertoire , along with classical works from Molière and Shakespeare . The theatre also hosted the world première of J. M. Synge 's The Tinker 's Wedding on 11 November 1909 and George Bernard Shaw 's Pygmalion , with Tree as Henry Higgins and Mrs Patrick Campbell as Eliza , in 1914 . Tree 's productions were known for their elaborate and spectacular scenery and effects , often including live animals and real grass . These remained both popular and profitable , but in his last decade , Tree 's acting style was seen as increasingly outmoded , and many of his plays received bad reviews . Tree defended himself from critical censure , demonstrating his continuing popularity at the box office until his death . 
 In 1904 , Tree founded the Academy of Dramatic Art ( later RADA ) , which spent a year based in the theatre before moving in 1905 to Gower Street in Bloomsbury . Tree continued to take graduates of the Academy into his company at His Majesty 's , employing some 40 actors in this way by 1911 . 
 The facilities of the theatre naturally lent themselves to the new genre of musical theatre . Chu Chin Chow opened in 1916 and ran for an astonishing world record 2 @,@ 235 performances ( almost twice as long as the previous record for musical theatre – a record that it held until surpassed by Salad Days in 1955 ) . Major productions of plays with large casts were also performed at His Majesty 's . George and Ira Gershwin 's Oh , Kay ! had its London première on 21 September 1927 . This starred Gertrude Lawrence and John Kirby , and ran for 213 performances . Noël Coward 's operetta Bitter Sweet enjoyed a run of 697 performances beginning 18 July 1929 . J. B. Priestley 's theatrical adaptation of his own The Good Companions premièred on 14 May 1931 . 
 Musicals continued to dominate at the theatre in the post @-@ World War II period , including transfers of the successful Broadway productions Follow the Girls ( 1945 ; 572 performances ) and the Lerner and Loewe musicals Brigadoon ( 1949 ; 685 performances ) and Paint Your Wagon ( 1953 ; 478 performances ) . Leonard Bernstein 's West Side Story opened in December 1958 for a run of 1 @,@ 039 performances , transferring from Broadway via the Manchester Opera House . The London première of Fiddler on the Roof was on 16 February 1967 , starring Chaim Topol , and the production ran at Her Majesty 's for 2 @,@ 030 performances . Forty years after the original stage adaptation , André Previn 's musical adaptation of The Good Companions premièred on 11 July 1974 , followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn 's initially unsuccessful collaboration , Jeeves , on 22 April 1975 , which has since enjoyed considerable success . 
 John Cleese organised A Poke in the Eye ( With a Sharp Stick ) as a benefit for Amnesty International at the theatre in 1976 , and it was broadcast as Pleasure at Her Majesty 's . This was the first of The Secret Policeman 's Balls , organised by and starring such performers as Peter Cook , Graham Chapman , and Rowan Atkinson . The venue was also the setting for the popular ITV variety series Live from Her Majesty 's , which ran on television from 1983 to 1988 . It was on this programme that Tommy Cooper collapsed and died on stage in 1984 . 
 This theatre is one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series Great West End Theatres , presented by Donald Sinden .

 The Phantom of the Opera had its world première on 9 October 1986 at the theatre , winning the Olivier Award for Best New Musical and featuring Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford , who won an Olivier award for his performance in the title role . The piece is still playing at Her Majesty 's , celebrating its 25th anniversary in October 2011 and surpassing 10 @,@ 000 performances in October 2010 . It is the second longest @-@ running West End musical in history ( after Les Misérables ) . In a sign of its continuing popularity , Phantom ranked second in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the " Nation 's Number One Essential Musicals " . The musical is also the longest @-@ running show on Broadway , was made into a film in 2004 and had been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities in 27 countries and grossed more than £ <unk> ( $ 5bn ) by 2011 , the most successful entertainment project in history . 
 Her Majesty 's Theatre 's " grand exterior " and " luxurious interior , with its three tiers of boxes and gold statuary around the stage " , as well as French Renaissance design , " make it an ideal site for this Gothic tale " set at the Opéra Garnier . The original Victorian stage machinery remains beneath the stage of the theatre . Designer Maria <unk> found a way to use it " to show the Phantom travelling across the lake as if floating on a sea of mist and fire " , in a key scene from the musical . On 5 May 2008 , for the first time in the run , the show closed for three days . This allowed the installation of an improved sound system at the theatre , consisting of over 6 miles ( 10 km ) of cabling and the siting of 120 auditorium speakers . 
 The theatre 's capacity is 1 @,@ 216 seats on four levels . Really Useful Theatres Group purchased it in January 2000 with nine other London theatres formerly owned by the Stoll @-@ Moss Group .

 " Let 's All Chant " is a song written by Michael Zager and Alvin Fields and performed by the Michael Zager Band . It was based on an idea originally suggested by former head of A & R Jerry Love after he visited clubs in New York and saw people endlessly chanting " Ooh @-@ ah , Ooh @-@ ah " . Although Zager was first embarrassed when Love asked him to write a song using these chants , he accepted the proposal and later co @-@ wrote " Let 's All Chant " with Fields . 
 The opening track and lead single from the group 's eponymous LP , " Let 's All Chant " was released as a single in December 1977 , with the track " Love Express " as a B @-@ side . An unexpected smash hit , the single reached number one on the disco chart and crossed over to the Soul Singles chart , where it peaked at number 15 , and to the Billboard Hot 100 , where it peaked at number 36 . In Europe , the single reached the top 10 in several countries , including the UK , Ireland and France . It eventually sold five million copies worldwide , making it one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time . 
 <unk> by both its vocal hooks and its classical section , which is featured in the middle of the song , " Let 's All Chant " was well received by critics , who have praised its musical arrangement and its catchiness . Many reviewers regard the song as a classic of the disco era . It also became a turning point in Michael Zager 's career . As well as being used in many TV advertisements and movies , it has become an influential dance song which has been extensively covered or remixed by numerous artists and has been interpolated or sampled in many other tracks .

 When he was still at A & M Records , Michael Zager met Jerry Love , the former head of A & R for A & M Records . After Love subsequently left the record label , he and Zager formed the Michael Zager Moon 's Band in 1976 . Love was an habitué of Studio 54 and went to clubs every night . One evening , he went to Greenwich Village to visit several clubs and noted that people were continuously singing " Ooh @-@ ah , Ooh @-@ ah " to every tune which was played in order to increase their own participation and pleasure . The next day , he described the scene to Zager and suggested that Zager write a song incorporating the " Ooh @-@ ah , Ooh @-@ ah " vocals . Zager told Love : " You have to be kidding ; that 's embarrassing ! " Love commented that everybody was doing it and that if Zager wrote a song using these chants , dancers would love it . 
 In parallel , the group 's name was changed to the Michael Zager Band and they signed with the label Private Stock Records . For their forthcoming LP , Zager wrote two songs , " Let 's All Chant " and " Love Express " , together with Alvin Fields . The co @-@ writer shared lead vocals on " Let 's All Chant " with session singers <unk> McDonald and Billy Baker . Zager added a classical section to the track . He later remarked : 
 The reason I added the piccolo trumpet and classical section in the middle of Let 's All Chant ' was mainly because I was embarrassed ! I thought it was so stupid with that ' Ooh @-@ ah ' sound in it that I wanted to add something to lift the track musically . I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory , so I was really feeling embarrassed 
 " Let 's All Chant " and " Love Express " were both recorded at the Secret Sound Studios , in Manhattan . Once the tracks were recorded , Zager told Fields : " I 'm gonna kill you if this isn 't a hit ! "

 " Let 's All Chant " is a disco song driven by a repetitive bassline , handclaps and numerous vocal hooks ( such as " Ah @-@ ah , eh @-@ eh , let 's all chant " and " Your body , my body , everybody work your body " ) . These typical disco lyrics are about dancing and working one 's body . The song 's instrumentation also includes Afro @-@ Cuban drums , a " rollicking " piano line and an ensemble of wind instruments , marked by a piccolo trumpet solo which sounds " like it 's straight out of the Dynasty opening theme song " . The song 's tempo is 121 bpm and is very close to the average tempo of a standard disco song ( 120 bpm ) . According to AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson , the combination of the " European @-@ influenced , oddly baroque " feeling with a " catchy disco / funk beat " grabs the attention of the listener and encourages him to discover the rest of the eponymous LP .

 " Let 's All Chant " was released as a single with " Love Express " as a B @-@ side in December 1977 , on Christmas week . Zager thought it was the worst time to release the single because many artists usually released their albums during this period and thought the single would only become a " disco hit " . However , the single became an unexpected smash hit . It climbed to number one on the disco chart on February 18 , 1978 , knocking Cerrone 's " Supernature " off the top spot , and remained atop the chart for one week , before being toppled by Bionic Boogie 's " Dance Little Dreamer " . In the US , " Let 's All Chant " also charted at number 15 on the Soul Singles chart , number 25 on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles , number 31 on the Record World and number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 . In Canada , the single peaked at number two on the dance chart ( behind " Supernature " ) and at number 27 on the singles chart . A music video was simultaneously released . 
 The single did even better in Europe , reaching the top 10 in several countries . It peaked at number eight on both the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart . In the Netherlands , the song reached the fourth place on the Dutch Top 40 and the Single Top 100 charts and stayed for thirteen weeks on both charts . It also reached number four in Switzerland , where it became the 25th best @-@ selling single of the year 1978 . In France , " Let 's All Chant " peaked at number five and became the eleventh best @-@ selling single of 1978 in this country .

 = Tidus = 
 Tidus ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a fictional character from Square Enix 's Final Fantasy series , first introduced as the protagonist of the role @-@ playing video game Final Fantasy X in 2001 by Square . Tidus is introduced as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old rising blitzball star player from the city of Zanarkand . After a mysterious creature called Sin attacked his hometown , Tidus was seemingly transported to the world of Spira . Shortly after arriving , Tidus meets a fledgling summoner , Yuna , and her guardians . The summoner is soon to set out on a pilgrimage in an attempt to put an end to the very creature that attacked Tidus ' city ; and by joining them , Tidus hopes he will find his way home . He has also made appearances in other video games , such as Final Fantasy X 's sequel , Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 ; the Kingdom Hearts series , and other crossover games by Square Enix . 
 Tidus ' character was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with the intention of having a cheerful appearance in contrast to previous Final Fantasy protagonists , while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wanted to expand the relationship between the player and the character through the story . He is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese and James Arnold Taylor in English . 
 The character has generally been well received by video game reviewers owing to his cheerful personality and heroic traits that made him an appealing protagonist . His character development and romantic relationship with Yuna has also been praised , and both have often been featured as among the best ones in gaming . Critics and fans were divided on voice actor Taylor 's portrayal of the character , however . Several types of merchandise based on Tidus ' character have been produced , such as action figures and jewelry .

 In Final Fantasy X , Tidus is introduced in medias res via an in @-@ game cutscene , showing the main characters around the ruins of a city , Zanarkand . He narrates most of the game events , revealing his thoughts on certain aspects of his journey . Tidus recounts how events have led to the present , starting at his life in Zanarkand where he was a sports celebrity in blitzball , a fictional underwater sport . Despite showing a cheerful and carefree attitude , Tidus bears an enormous hatred towards his absent father , Jecht , initially due to the fact his mother did not pay attention to him when he was around , and later for the pressure he had when playing blitzball due to the fact Jecht was also a celebrity . During a Blitzball tournament , Zanarkand is attacked by an immense , shrouded creature known as Sin . The city is destroyed in its path , and Tidus is taken by Sin and Jecht 's friend Auron to the world Spira . 
 After arriving in Spira , Tidus drifts to the island Besaid . While on the island he meets Yuna , a summoner who is planning a pilgrimage to destroy Sin , along with her guardians : Lulu , Wakka , and Kimahri Ronso . Tidus joins them in the hope of finding his way home , and ultimately becomes one of Yuna 's guardians , alongside Auron who reveals that Jecht became Sin . Ten years ago , Jecht and Auron did the same pilgrimage protecting summoner Braska , Yuna 's father , to defeat it , but Jecht became the reborn Sin . As the journey continues , Tidus starts losing hope of returning home as he decides to stay with the other guardians and develops a romantic relationship with Yuna . As the party approaches Zanarkand , Tidus learns that he and the Zanarkand he hails from are the cumulative dreams of deceased people known as fayth . Dream Zanarkand was created at the same time as the destruction of the original Zanarkand , when Sin was created in the war between Zanarkand and Bevelle . However , if Sin is permanently defeated , the summoning of Dream Zanarkand and all its people — including Tidus — will disappear . 
 Inside Zanarkand , the group learns Yuna must choose one of her guardians to become her fayth for the Final Summoning . The group decides to find another way to destroy Sin forever and that should not involve the sacrifice of a guardian or a summoner . The group then attacks Sin directly and enter its shell . Eventually , they find Jecht , who they have to defeat to eliminate Sin . After killing the corrupt deity Yu Yevon responsible for Sin 's rebirth , the fayth are allowed to depart and their summoning of Zanarkand ends . As he vanishes Tidus says farewell to his friends , and is reunited with the spirits of Auron , Jecht , and Braska in the Farplane . However , after the credits , Tidus is seen awakening under the sea . 
 = = = Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 = = = 
 Tidus figures prominently into the plot of Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , though his appearances in the sequel are few . Also , because players have the option of renaming Tidus in Final Fantasy X , he is exclusively referred to with pronouns ( " he " and " him " ) just like in the previous game . Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X , Yuna sees a sphere displaying a young man who looks like Tidus trapped in a prison . This compels Yuna to join the Gullwings , a sphere @-@ hunting group , and travel around Spira in the hopes of finding more clues that Tidus may be alive . The individual seen in the sphere is eventually revealed to be another man named Shuyin instead . Depending on the player 's development during the game , the fayth will appear to Yuna in the game 's ending , telling her they can make Tidus return to her . Tidus then appears in Spira and is reunited with Yuna . Although another final scene has Tidus unsure whether he is still a dream or not , he wishes to stay with her . He is also an unlockable character to play blitzball in the game but under the name of " Star Player " . 
 In the updated version of the game , Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 : International + Last Mission , Tidus appears as a playable character for battles . Additionally , an extra episode set after the original game 's playthrough reveals that he is living in Besaid alongside Yuna while an illusion of him appears as a boss character . The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Tidus is a new blitzball star who appears to be hiding a wound . Even though Yuna breaks up with him , Tidus decides to aid Yuna on a future quest . 
 = = = Other appearances = = = 
 Tidus has also appeared in games outside of the Final Fantasy X continuity . A more youthful version of Tidus appears in the Kingdom Hearts series as a friend of the protagonists Sora and Riku . In the first Kingdom Hearts , he appears with younger versions of Wakka and Final Fantasy VIII 's Selphie , serving as an optional sparring opponent . The character makes a cameo in Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories and in Kingdom Hearts II , he is briefly mentioned by Selphie . A digital replica of Tidus also appears in Kingdom Hearts coded as a boss character . Tidus appears in Itadaki Street Special , a board game @-@ based video game , along with Auron and Yuna . Tidus ' dialogues , monologues and character songs were also included in the CDs Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection and feel / Go dream : Yuna & Tidus . 
 In Dissidia Final Fantasy , an action game that features several Final Fantasy heroes and villains , Tidus is featured as the hero from Final Fantasy X as a warrior from the goddess Cosmos while his father works for the other rival god , Chaos . To match the overall character designs of Dissidia , Nomura designed Tidus to look younger than his Final Fantasy X appearance . Nevertheless , his original Final Fantasy X design is available as an alternative form . Various of his traits such as his thoughts and actions are references to Final Fantasy X. Along the entire cast , Tidus reappears in the prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , representing Chaos in the previous war . When confronted by Yuna , Tidus sacrifices his life to save her from an attack from the Emperor , but is saved by Jecht to later become a Warrior of Cosmos . Besides his previous <unk> , Tidus has another design based on an illustration by Yoshitaka Amano . He is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a playable character representing Final Fantasy X. Additionally , he appears in World of Final Fantasy . 
 Tidus has also had various types of merchandise modeled after his likeness ; for example , action figures and jewelry . In commemoration of the franchise 's 20th anniversary , Square released figurines of him alongside other Final Fantasy protagonists . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 The game 's scenario writer , Kazushige Nojima , has expressed his concern regarding the relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title , and wanted to try something new while penning Final Fantasy X. Since both the player and the main character find themselves in a new world , Nojima wanted Tidus ' understanding of the world to reflect the player 's progress in the game ; a connection that allowed the player to advance Tidus ' first @-@ person narration of most of Final Fantasy X. Nojima created a brief description for Tidus to give the character designer , Tetsuya Nomura , a rough scenario to work with . Nomura used the description to create a sketch to get input from Nojima and other staff members . Nomura was also requested to design Tidus to look different from the game 's theme in order to make him stand out . With the concept of the undead people used in the games , the staff wanted it to use it on one of the playable characters . Tidus was meant to be an undead person , but during development of Final Fantasy X , Nojima watched a movie which used a similar idea with its protagonist . Therefore , Tidus was not an undead person during the game , and such role was given to Auron , as he was a secondary character . 
 Nomura has also mentioned a contrast between the lead male and female protagonists was established by Yuna 's name meaning " night " in Okinawan . This contrast is also represented with the items required to empower their Celestial Weapons ; the Sun Sigil and the Sun Crest for Tidus ' , and the Moon Sigil and Moon Crest for Yuna 's . Nomura also explained he wanted his clothing and accessories to suggest a relationship with the sea . For example , his outfit bears a distinctive blue theme , and the symbol of Tidus ' Blitzball team on his clothing is designed after a fishing hook . The symbol is designed as an amalgamation of the letters " J " and " T " ( the first letters of Tidus ' name and that of his father , Jecht ) . Due to the player having the option to change his default name , Tidus is never directly referred to by name during audible dialogue , though one character in Dream Zanarkand says his name in a dialogue box . The only other in @-@ game appearance of his name is on a name plate on an <unk> locker in the Luca stadium as " <unk> " , written in the fictional script used in Spira . Prior to Final Fantasy X 's release , Tidus was referred by publications as " <unk> " . During early 2001 , PlayOnline changed the name to " Tidus " . Because his name is never spoken out loud in Final Fantasy X , its intended pronunciation has been a subject of debate among fans . Interviews with James Arnold Taylor , Tidus ' English voice actor , and spoken dialogue from the English versions of Dissidia , Dissidia 012 , and Kingdom Hearts — which featured the character in a cameo — portray it as / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> , whereas one instance in the English version of Kingdom Hearts 2 exists in which the character 's name is pronounced / <unk> / TY @-@ <unk> . 
 For the sequel , Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , producer Yoshinori Kitase thought that the fans ' biggest expectations of the game was a reunion between Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game . The game generated multiple rumors about Tidus ' connection with the villain , Shuyin . In response , Square found answering that would be too complicated due to Tidus ' nature . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Nomura has expressed after designing serious and moody main characters for Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII , he wanted to give Tidus a cheerful attitude and appearance ( while still keeping the recent trend of giving him a name related to the sky ) , which is reflected in the name Kazushige Nojima chose for him ( Tiida is the Okinawan word for " Sun " ) . This is also shown in his personality with Nojima calling him " lively " and comparing him with Final Fantasy VIII 's Laguna Loire and Zell Dincht . Initially , Tidus was going to be a rude plumber who was also part of a delinquent gang , but Kitase pointed it would make him a weak protagonist , so he was changed to a sports star . His relationship with his father was based " stories throughout the ages , such as the ancient Greek legends . " This would eventually reveal the key of Sin 's weakness and eventual defeat . 
 In Japanese Tidus has been voiced by Masakazu Morita who stated that playing such character was one of the best experiences in his career thanks to the fact he also did the motion capture for him . This gave him greater understanding of the character 's personality and was able to connect himself with him to the point that when Morita did Tidus ' dialogues in the recording of the game he also moved his own body . James Arnold Taylor did the character 's English voice and stated that it did not seem realistic to him to have Tidus react in any other way than to truthfully show his emotions . While he also said there were things he would change about his performance if he could do it over again , Taylor stated he enjoyed voicing Tidus and thanked fans of the game for complimenting him on his work . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Tidus has received positive reception with GameSpy describing him as a " garishly dressed Leonardo DiCaprio " , commenting that his flaws are what make him appealing . PSXextreme 's Arnold Katayev liked Tidus ' personality which contrasts the ones from previous Final Fantasy protagonists . His role as the male lead was found outstanding in comparison to previous characters by GameZone due to his " perpetual feel of youth and innocence " . The 1UP.com staff initially described him as the " good kind of jock " due to how he supports the other protagonists of the game and yet they noted that his anger and his growth throughout the game avoided him from being a " stereotypical boy scout " . Although GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin commented players might not initially like the character , they would eventually find him " suitably endearing . " Furthermore , he stated that he had the " surprising depth " characterized by past Final Fantasy protagonists , and called the ending involving Tidus " emotionally charged and satisfying " . Eurogamer 's Tom <unk> stated that Tidus and the other characters " make much more dignified and believable decisions than those made by their predecessors in other Final Fantasy games . " Kazuma Kaneko from Atlus also praised him calling Tidus " a dashing lead character . " 
 Tidus was also listed as the fourth best Final Fantasy hero of all the time by GamesRadar who described him as " One of the most complex and bizarre heroes yet seen in the series " , while in another article they referred to his look as androgynous . In a Famitsu poll done in February 2010 , Tidus was voted by readers as the twentieth most popular video game character . GameZone listed him as the third best Final Fantasy character praising his energetic personality and his actions across Final Fantasy X that make him " the true star of the title " . Tidus ' revelation of his real nature in the game 's ending was third in a 1UP article of video game spoilers ; such event was stated to have reduced " [ to ] at least two 1UP staffers to a state of misty @-@ eyed mourning " yet they criticized how Tidus ' resurrection in the sequel makes his fate unrealistic . On the other hand , GamesRadar found Tidus ' fate in the first game confusing as in the epilogue he appears alive despite having previously disappeared , and such scene is not explained until the sequel 's ending . Matthew Walker from Cheat Code Central commented that the game 's final scene was meant to give hope that Tidus was alive , the ending still felt sad . 
 Tidus was also compared to Squall Leonhart , the protagonist from Final Fantasy VIII . IGN noted the differences in appearances between the two , comparing Squall 's darker colored outfit and " permanent mope " against Tidus ' brighter outfit and weapon along with " an indelible grin " . Additionally , Kurt Kalata in Gamasutra thought that Tidus ' character was more entertaining than Squall 's despite being " a bit whiny " . 1UP listed him as the worst dressed video game character , citing a " deal with it " outfit design by Nomura . They further commented that despite the " preposterous " design , Square was able to " successfully sell " Tidus as Final Fantasy X 's main protagonist . His Dissidia outfit was noted by 1UP to be consistent with other outfits by Nomura due to the number of accessories it has . Because of his English @-@ language voice work , GameSpot commented it would have preferred " an almost @-@ mute lead character , a la Squall from Final Fantasy VIII . " Regarding the character 's English @-@ language voice work , IGN stated the character " has a tendency to speak a little too high and fast when he gets excited . " RPGamer criticized Taylor 's work , stating that while Tidus is supposed to sound " impulsive and energetic " , his dialogue leaves him as " stupid and childish " , while Eurogamer echoed similar statements by referring to his voice acting as " whiny " and " detestable " . On the other hand , PSXextreme found that Taylor does a good work voicing Tidus . He was also featured fifth in 1UP 's " The Top 5 Most <unk> RPG Protagonists " with criticism focused on his relationship with his father and his outfit . Matthew Walker noted that while in the climax Tidus still told his father he hated him , he actually came to appreciate him despite his initial feelings . 
 The relationship between Tidus and Yuna was listed by GameSpot as one of the " Great Loves " in video games . It referred to their relationship as " one of the best ( and ultimately saddest ) examples " of a mature romance in games and cited the progression of the romance throughout the story as one of the game 's best elements . In a general overview of the romances from Final Fantasy , Gaming Age stated that Final Fantasy X had " the sparks fly " between Tidus ' and Yuna 's relationship . GamesRadar listed their relationship as the tenth best romance in gaming as well the second best romance in Square Enix game , commenting on " that they have the most realistic relation " , and noted that despite the sacrifices they go through in the series , they still look for a chance to be together . Kotaku listed the relationship second in the " Gaming 's Top Five Love Stories " by Mike Fahey who stated that the popularity of their relationship and the fact Tidus fades away in the game 's ending was what forced Square to make its direct sequel so that the two characters could meet once again . Gamasutra featured it fifth in their list by Leigh Alexander who despite citing Tidus as a " forgettable hero " praised the importance of his and Yuna 's relation in the game 's story . Both Tidus and Yuna also won the " Best Couple of the Year " award from Game Informer in 2001 . Yuna 's English voice actress , Hedy Burress , commented that thanks to Tidus ' interactions with Yuna gave her character a more " womanly aspect " , and thus , more humanizing .

 The April 2011 Fukushima earthquake ( <unk> , Fukushima @-@ ken Hamadōri <unk> , lit . " Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake " ) was a potent magnitude 6 @.@ 6 Mw intraplate aftershock that occurred at 17 : 16 JST ( 08 : 16 UTC ) on Monday , 11 April 2011 , in the Hamadōri region of Fukushima , Japan . With a shallow focus of 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) , the earthquake was centred inland about 36 km ( 22 mi ) west of Iwaki , causing widespread strong to locally severe shaking . It was one of many aftershocks to follow the 11 March Tōhoku earthquake , and the strongest to have its epicentre located inland . 
 The earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas . A few fires broke out , and 220 @,@ 000 households lost electricity . Officials issued localised tsunami alerts , though no significant waves were generated . The earthquake caused little structural damage , but killed four people and injured ten others . The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation of a nearby geological fault , prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The magnitude 6 @.@ 6 Mw Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake occurred inland on 11 April 2011 at 08 : 16 UTC at a focal depth of 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) , about 36 km ( 22 mi ) west of Iwaki , Fukushima , or 161 km ( 100 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Tokyo . To the east of the epicentre , the oceanic Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate , on which much of Honshu 's Tōhoku region is situated . Building stress near the resultant plate boundary has led to the development of shallow inland faults through crustal deformation and folding along the east coast of Tōhoku . This intraplate earthquake occurred in the vicinity of the <unk> Fault – a shallow crustal fault in the Hamadōri region near <unk> town , Iwaki city , that had previously been inactive . 
 Surveys near the epicentre revealed a surface rupture of about 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) and numerous fault scarps , with general vertical displacements of 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 5 m ( 2 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 9 ft ) ; a maximum displacement of 2 @.@ 3 m ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) occurred at the small village of Shionohira . Localised right @-@ lateral slip of 30 cm ( 12 in ) was observed at the subsiding west side of the rupture . The segments of the <unk> Fault associated with this surface feature were classified as the " Shionohira Fault " in 2011 . The proximate <unk> Fault , a normal dip @-@ slip fault northeast of the Shionohira Fault that had been dormant for 120 @,@ 000 – 130 @,@ 000 years , also ruptured during the quake . These observations indicated that the earthquake occurred as a result of normal dip @-@ slip faulting with some strike @-@ slip component . 
 Although it was centred near a different fault zone , the earthquake was classified as an aftershock of the 11 March Tōhoku earthquake , which occurred offshore about 235 km ( 146 mi ) to its northeast . The magnitude 9 @.@ 0 Mw earthquake triggered widespread seismic activity , and its aftershock sequence includes well @-@ over 67 earthquakes of magnitude 6 @.@ 0 Mw or greater . Apart from the Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake , four of the aftershocks measured magnitude 7 @.@ 0 Mw or higher . The Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake , however , was the strongest of the aftershocks to have its epicentre located inland . Early estimates placed the strength of the earthquake at a magnitude of 7 @.@ 0 – 7 @.@ 1 , but the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) lowered the magnitude to 6 @.@ 6 . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) assessed a magnitude of 7 @.@ 0 Mj and a depth of 6 @.@ 4 km ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) . 
 The Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake was succeeded by a number of smaller tremors ; that same day , at least 11 earthquakes of magnitude 3 @.@ 5 Mj or higher were recorded near its epicentre . Of the series , the strongest registered at a magnitude of 5 @.@ 5 Mj and occurred within 3 @.@ 5 hours after the initial quake . A shallow magnitude 6 @.@ 0 Mw ( 6 @.@ 4 Mj ) earthquake and several smaller tremors struck the region on 12 April . 
 = = Effects = = 
 The earthquake struck in the late afternoon near a moderately populated region of the Fukushima Prefecture , although most structures around the epicentre were resistant to earthquake shaking . <unk> at an unusually shallow depth , the earthquake generated significant shaking throughout many adjacent prefectures . The strongest ground motion registered at severe ( MM VIII ) in Ishikawa town on the Mercalli intensity scale . Strong shaking ( MM VI ) spread through Iwaki , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , with light tremors ( MM IV ) felt in areas up to several hundred kilometres from the epicentre , including Tokyo and Yokohama . The earthquake cut electricity to about 220 @,@ 000 households , with most of the cuts reported in Iwaki city . Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant – distanced 70 km ( 43 mi ) from the epicentre – evacuated to safety , and external power to the plant was cut . The outage briefly disrupted cooling water injections into three of the reactors , but services to the plant were restored by 18 : 05 JST . Authorities at Tokyo International Airport closed all runways momentarily , while NTT DoCoMo restricted voice calls in 14 prefectures following the quake . East Japan Railway Company temporarily suspended its services to restart four of five bullet @-@ train lines ; other Shinkansen bullet trains in the region were also halted . 
 The earthquake sparked several fires in Iwaki , with one fire breaking out in <unk> town . Fire engines extinguished a blaze in a liquefied natural gas tank at Daiichi Sankyo 's <unk> Plant . Most of the structural damage was due to scattered rock- and landslides along hillsides in the vicinity of Iwaki . A landslide crushed two vehicles and buried three homes in the city , trapping a number of the inhabitants . The incident resulted in two immediate deaths . Four people were critically injured and taken to hospital ; one of them was later pronounced dead . The Iwaki Ibaraki Route 14 interchange of the <unk> Expressway , which runs from Misato , Saitama , to <unk> , Miyagi , was cut off to traffic by a large landslide of 120 m × 100 m ( 390 ft × 330 ft ) . In <unk> town , very close to the epicentre , a 170 m × 50 m ( 560 ft × 160 ft ) landslide resulted in the formation of a quake lake – a natural damming of a river by mass wasting – with a water level of 15 m ( 49 ft ) and a storage volume of 1 @,@ 000 – 2 @,@ 500 m3 ( 35 @,@ 000 – 90 @,@ 000 cu ft ) . Significant land deformation with traces of uplift was observed in and around town , affecting local roads but largely sparing its structures . 
 A total of seven people from other regions near the epicentre , including southern Ibaraki , Tochigi and Kanagawa prefectures , suffered minor injuries . Another person was injured during the magnitude 6 @.@ 0 ( Mw ) aftershock of 12 April . In a report from July 2011 , the Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirmed a death toll of four from the earthquake . 
 = = Response = = 
 The Earthquake Early Warning system was activated upon the detection of primary waves – seismic waves that forego an earthquake 's perceivable ground motions – giving residents 6 @.@ 8 seconds to seek cover before the main shock . At the risk of a tsunami – which reach their destructive wave heights near shallow coastal waters – local fishing boats along coastlines were shown heading out to sea on national news broadcasts . A warning for a localised tsunami of up to 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) was issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency ; however , no significant waves were recorded , and the warning was cancelled soon thereafter . In response to the earthquake , the fire department dispatched search and rescue teams and emergency crews for relief efforts and damage assessments throughout the affected area . Six medical crews in pairs of two were also sent to Kanagawa , Chiba and Gunma prefectures . Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan postponed a press conference scheduled for 17 : 50 JST marking the one @-@ month anniversary of the catastrophic Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami . 
 The Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake occurred in a region with historically low levels of seismicity ; studies showed that the recent activity near the fault zone had been triggered by the Tōhoku earthquake . Ever since the earthquake triggered their reactivation , the Shionohira and <unk> faults have provided essential data for local geological surveys on regional land deformation , sedimentary rock distribution and landslide vulnerability . In the earthquake 's aftermath , Professor Yagi Hiroshi from the Faculty of Education , Art and Science noted that " a possibility exists for widespread aftershocks of the same size to occur in the near future .

 " Close My Eyes " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey for her sixth studio album Butterfly ( 1997 ) . It was co @-@ written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff . While Carey solely wrote the lyrics to the song , both she and Afanasieff composed its music .

 Carey began working on Butterfly in January 1997 . During the album 's development in mid @-@ 1997 Carey separated from her husband , music executive Tommy Mottola , who had guided her career since 1988 . Carey 's increasing control over her own career had led to speculation in the press over the future of the couple , and they later divorced . Throughout the development of the album , in a departure from her previous style , Carey worked with various rappers and hip @-@ hop producers , including Sean " Puffy " Combs , Kamaal Fareed , Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters . Critics saw Carey 's new production team as a form of revenge on Mottola and Sony Music . Carey denied taking a radically new direction , and insisted that the musical style of her new album was of her own choosing . Nevertheless , Carey resented the control that Sony , whose president was Mottola , exercised over her music , preventing her making music about which she was passionate . In contrast , Sony were concerned Carey , their best @-@ selling act , could jeopardize her future success through her actions . The pressure of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey . Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship , after collaborating on most of Carey 's previous output . The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session , over the album 's musical direction . Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers , suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions . However , Carey denied the allegations , stating she had only slept with her husband .

 = = Composition and lyrical interpretation = = 
 " Close My Eyes " is a downtempo piano led song , which runs for a duration of four minutes and 19 seconds . The lyrical content of the song speaks indirectly about Carey 's relationship with Mottola , and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles . Her past is presented in the lyrics " I was a wayward child , with the weight of the world that I held deep inside " and " Life was a winding road , and I learned many things little ones shouldn 't know . " As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly , Carey " paints herself " in the lyrics as " A wayward child , with the weight of the world " . He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary , in order to live her life in a controlled environment , " Maybe I grew up a little too soon . " During the chorus , Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity , " But I closed my eyes , steadied my feet on the ground , raised my head to the sky . And though times rolled by , still I feel like a child as I look at the moon . Maybe I grew up a little too soon . " Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey " coos " the lyrics " Maybe I grew up a little too soon " and " That woman @-@ child inside was on the verge of fading / Thankfully I woke up in time . "

 David Browne for Entertainment Weekly described how " Close My Eyes " , as well as another track from the album entitled " Butterfly " , were not difficult songs to interpret , writing " It isn 't a reach to interpret these songs as describing life with the reportedly controlling Mottola . " Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that with regard to the lyrics " Maybe I grew up a little too soon " and " That woman @-@ child inside was on the verge of fading / Thankfully I woke up in time , " " Carey isn 't about to turn into Alanis Morissette ; Butterfly proclaims dependence more humbly than ever . " In their guide to Carey 's albums , Rolling Stone stated that " Close My Eyes , " along with " Butterfly " and " Breakdown , " were songs which indirectly spoke about her " pending extraction from the tentacles " of Mottola , who exercised his power over her as the head of Sony , the label to which Carey was signed .

 In an interview with CNN on September 7 , 2012 , where she was honored by Broadcast Music , Inc. for her songwriting , Carey declared " Close My Eyes " as one of her most favourite and revealing songs that she has written . She stated that it is not always her number one or signature songs which are her favourite , rather , they are " lesser @-@ known cuts from more obscure records . " When asked about how she felt about some of her number @-@ one singles , including " Hero " ( Music Box , 1993 ) , " We Belong Together " ( The Emancipation of Mimi , 2005 ) and " Touch My Body " ( E = MC ² , 2008 ) , the singer revealed " I still love those songs , [ but ] I love the obscure songs because they 're very close to my heart . Especially a song called ' Close My Eyes , ' that 's like my life story . " In addition to " Close My Eyes , " Carey cited " Looking In , " " I Am Free , " and " Underneath the Stars " ( Daydream , 1995 ) as some of her favourites . 
 The song is included on the U.S. release of The Essential Mariah Carey . On Carey 's official Facebook page on May 12 , 2012 , shortly after the release , she wrote , " I spent four years writing this song , only because after I performed in Schenectady , NY , I started hearing this melody and singing it over and over to myself as I was taking a bath , looking at the moon .. Four years later , as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind , I wrote the second verse , the bridge and the outro . "

 = Aleeta curvicosta = 
 Aleeta curvicosta ( commonly the floury baker or floury miller , known until 2003 as Abricta curvicosta ) is a species of cicada , one of Australia 's most familiar insects . Native to the continent 's eastern coastline , it was described in 1834 by Ernst Friedrich Germar . As of 2014 the floury baker is the only described species in the genus Aleeta . 
 The floury baker 's distinctive appearance and loud call make it popular with children . Both the common and genus name are derived from the white , flour @-@ like filaments covering the adult body . Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light @-@ coloured line along the midline of the pronotum . Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches at the base of two of their apical cells . The female is larger than the male , although species size overall varies geographically , with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall . The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs . 
 The floury baker is solitary and occurs in low densities . Individuals typically emerge from the soil through a three @-@ month period from late November to late February , and can be encountered until May . The floury baker is found on a wide variety of trees , with some preference for species of paperbark ( Melaleuca ) . It is a relatively poor flier , preyed upon by cicada killer wasps and a wide variety of birds , and can succumb to a cicada @-@ specific fungal disease . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar described the floury baker in 1834 as Cicada curvicosta . Germar based the description on two specimens now in the Hope Entomological Collections , Oxford , but did not designate a type specimen and their exact locations were not recorded . In 2003 , one of the original specimens was designated the lectotype and the other the paralectotype . 
 Prominent Swedish entomologist Carl <unk> named the genus Abricta in 1866 , and it was either treated as a subgenus of the genus Tibicen or a genus in its own right . Thus it became known as Tibicen <unk> , and Abricta curvicosta from 1906 . French entomologist Jean Baptiste <unk> described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as Cicada <unk> ( later Tibicen <unk> ) in 1835 ; this has long been considered a junior synonym . However , a review of the genus in 2003 showed Abricta to be a disparate group of species , and the Australian members were moved to other genera . Max Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region . Of the 15 Australian species , the floury baker was the earliest offshoot . Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14 species , and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta , while most of the others were placed in the genus Tryella . The morphological distinction between Aleeta and Tryella is based on two factors : A. curvicosta has a larger forewing size – rarely less than 3 @.@ 2 cm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) and usually over 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) , whereas Tryella is never above 3 @.@ 2 cm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) ; the <unk> lobes of Aleeta 's distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends , whereas those of Tryella are upturned . The name Aleeta is derived from the Greek <unk> meaning flour or meal . 
 The floury baker gains its common name from the appearance of having been dusted with flour , and both the vernacular terms baker and miller were in use by 1860 . The name is sometimes corrupted as " flowery baker " . As of 1905 the same name " floury baker " was also in use for another species of Australian cicada ( <unk> <unk> , now Arunta <unk> ) , which has white " sacks " as sounding boxes . That species is now commonly referred to as the " white drummer " . 
 = = Description = = 
 With a body length of 2 @.@ 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 1 in ) , forewings between 3 and 5 @.@ 1 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 in ) long , a wingspan of 9 – 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 4 in ) and weighing around 1 @.@ 02 g ( 0 @.@ 036 oz ) , the floury baker is a medium @-@ sized cicada . Individuals markedly vary in size by region depending on local rainfall . Areas with an average annual rainfall of over 1000 mm ( 40 in ) – mostly coastal – have much larger individuals , with average forewing lengths about 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) longer than those in low @-@ rainfall areas . 
 The adult is brown with a white dusted appearance ; white downy filaments cover much of the body , legs and some wing veins , but this silver body fur is easily rubbed off , and so is often substantially diminished in older adults and museum specimens . Individuals have a variety of body markings , but all have a pale midline on their pronotum . Their legs are brown , sometimes yellowish , but with no distinct markings . Their dry mass is on average 36 @.@ 2 % of their total <unk> , higher than most Australian cicadas , which suggests strong exoskeletal armour . Their eyes are dark brown . They have yellowish opercula that extend laterally well beyond the body . The female is slightly larger than the male , She has generally similar colour and markings , though can be slightly paler in some areas . Her ninth abdominal segment is long and dark reddish @-@ brown , sometimes partly tending toward black . Her ovipositor is long , with a downward tilt , and the ovipositor sheath is black or dark reddish @-@ brown . 
 The wings are transparent with black or brown veins and a brown @-@ black patch at the base of apical cells 2 and 3 . These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration . The basal cell is often opaque and amber @-@ coloured . As on many insects , the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures , about 200 nm in height , separated by about 180 nm . These are thought to aid in anti @-@ reflective camouflage , anti @-@ wetting and self @-@ cleaning . 
 The male call can be heard at any time of day and consists of an unusual hissing @-@ type sound , starting as a series of one @-@ second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7 – 10 s . Described as " rp , rp , rp , rp , <unk> " , the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward , buckling 7 – 9 of the tymbal ribs , each of which produces a pulse . This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143 Hz ( in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress – when they are <unk> and at a lower frequency ) , giving a pulse repetition frequency of around 1050 per second , with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7 @.@ 5 – 10 @.@ 5 kHz , that has a dominant frequency ( at which the peak energy is observed ) of 9 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 6 kHz . 
 The abdominal tracheal air sacs surround the sound muscles and extend into the abdomen , acting as resonant chambers to amplify sound . The floury baker rapidly extends or raises its abdomen , thus modulating the influence of the air sacs on the sound to change its volume , pitch or tune during the introduction to the free song . This can be heard when a cicada is undisturbed in its natural environment , while male cicadas use these calls to attract females . The species is one of Australia 's loudest cicadas and has been termed " the best musician of them all " . 
 The floury baker is distinguished from a similar undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta ( the little floury baker ) by the structure of the male genitalia and an audibly distinct call . Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers , while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body . In these genera it is clearly wider than the costal vein . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Eggs are laid in a series of slits usually cut by the mother 's ovipositor in live branches or twigs of their food plants . On average about sixteen eggs , among a total batch of a few hundred , are laid in each slit . The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions . <unk> has been observed on a wide range of native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit . 
 After hatching , the nymphs fall from the branches to seek a crack in the soil where they can burrow , often to a depth of 10 – 40 cm ( 4 – 16 in ) , by digging with their large forelegs . Larger species of cicada like A. curvicosta are thought to spend 2 – 8 years underground , during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots . They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell . Although consistently taking place at night , the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high @-@ density Australian species . The sex ratio is about 1 @.@ 15 males to every female , consistent throughout the emergence . The metabolic rate over a period of about 6 @.@ 5 hours during emergence of A. curvicosta is about 1 @.@ 8 times the resting metabolic rate of the adult . A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine ( Araucaria heterophylla ) and broad @-@ leaved paperbark ( Melaleuca quinquenervia ) . The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June . They were recorded as appearing every year , mainly in December and January in western Sydney , with a similar 92 @-@ day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland . This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season . The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs , swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back . It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body , and when these have emerged , arches back to draw the legs out of their casing . It then slowly unfolds its wings , finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen . Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden . 
 Once they reach adulthood most adult cicada species live for around another two to four weeks . During this time they feed on flowing sap from tree branches , and mating and egg laying occurs . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The floury baker is found from the Daintree River in North Queensland to <unk> in southern New South Wales . It is a highland species in the northern part of its range , restricted to the Atherton Tableland and Eungella National Park to the west of Mackay , but more a lowland species in the remainder of its range . It may be found in varied habitats , from rainforest margins to suburbs , even in the centre of Sydney . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Individuals are usually solitary , with a South @-@ East Queensland study estimating densities of only 50 per hectare ( compared to some other Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense ) . The adult floury baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks . It is found on a wide variety of plants , most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae , more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants , as well as brown <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> ( Bauhinia hookeri ) . These are expected to also be nymphal food plants . The species was associated with white feather <unk> ( Melaleuca <unk> ) in a study at three sites in western Sydney . The broad @-@ leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant . 
 Floury bakers are not proficient fliers compared with other Australian cicadas . They are slow , with a typical speed of 2 @.@ 1 metres per second ( 6 @.@ 9 ft / s ) , which rises to around 3 @.@ 9 metres per second ( 13 ft / s ) ( 14 km / hr ) when they are pursued or provoked . They are only able to generate low aerodynamic power and their flights are relatively short , lasting around 3 @.@ 4 s , with an average of 3 @.@ 3 changes in direction . Nor are they adept at landing . The distance at which they react to an approaching observer is moderate , both when stationary and when in flight . 
 = = Predation = = 
 Bird predation of the adult cicada is common , with wrens and grey fantails , noisy miners , blue @-@ faced honeyeaters , little wattlebirds , grey and pied butcherbirds , magpie @-@ larks , Torresian crows , white @-@ faced herons and even the nocturnal tawny frogmouth , all reported as significant predators . The <unk> and bearded dragons have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs , however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10 % . 
 The adults of some Australian cicada are subject to a cicada @-@ specific fungus from the genus <unk> , which grows on their genitalia and abdominal cavity , eventually causing the tail end to drop off . Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp ( Exeirus lateritius ) , which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees . Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada @-@ hunter mounts and carries them , pushing with its hind legs , sometimes over a distance of 100 m ( 330 ft ) . They are then shoved into the hunter 's burrow , where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive ' catacomb ' , to form food @-@ stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 The shells shed by the nymph , as with those of other cicada species , are often collected by children and sometimes attached to their clothing . Schoolchildren have been known to bring live adults into classrooms to startle the class with their " strident shrieking " , typically to the observable displeasure of teachers . Children often climb trees to collect them , and keep them temporarily as pets in shoeboxes . They cannot easily be kept for longer than a day or two , given that they need flowing sap for food . A poem dedicated to the floury baker appeared in the Catholic Press in 1930 , describing its life cycle to children . 
 = Serpens = 
 Serpens ( " the Serpent " , Greek Ὄφις ) is a constellation of the northern hemisphere . One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd @-@ century astronomer Ptolemy , it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union . It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non @-@ contiguous parts , Serpens Caput ( Serpent Head ) to the west and Serpens Cauda ( Serpent Tail ) to the east . Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus , the " Serpent @-@ Bearer " . In figurative representations , the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between Mu Serpentis in Serpens Caput and Nu Serpentis in Serpens Cauda . 
 The brightest star in Serpens is the red giant star Alpha Serpentis , or <unk> , in Serpens Caput , with an apparent magnitude of 2 @.@ 63 . Also located in Serpens Caput are the naked @-@ eye globular cluster Messier 5 and the naked @-@ eye variables R Serpentis and <unk> Serpentis . Notable extragalactic objects include Seyfert 's Sextet , one of the densest galaxy clusters known ; Arp 220 , the prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy ; and Hoag 's Object , the most famous of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies . 
 Part of the Milky Way 's galactic plane passes through Serpens Cauda , which is therefore rich in galactic deep @-@ sky objects , such as the Eagle Nebula ( IC <unk> ) and its associated star cluster Messier 16 . The nebula measures 70 light @-@ years by 50 light @-@ years and contains the Pillars of Creation , three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope . Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula , one of the few objects in astronomy to take on a square shape ; and <unk> 40 , a massive nearby star @-@ forming region consisting of a molecular cloud and an H II region . 
 = = History = = 
 In Greek mythology , Serpens represents a snake held by the healer Asclepius . Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus , Asclepius once killed a snake , but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death . As snakes shed their skin every year , they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society , and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed . Although this is likely the logic for Serpens ' presence with Ophiuchus , the true reason is still not fully known . Sometimes , Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus , but the majority of atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus ' body or between his legs . 
 In some ancient atlases , the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were depicted as two separate constellations , although more often they were shown as a single constellation . One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer ; thus , Serpens ' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus . When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s , he elected to depict the two separately . However , this posed the problem of how to disentangle the two constellations , with <unk> deciding to split Serpens into two areas — the head and the tail — separated by the continuous Ophiuchus . These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda , caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail . 
 In Chinese astronomy , most of the stars of Serpens represented part of a wall surrounding a marketplace , known as Tianshi , which was in Ophiuchus and part of Hercules . Serpens also contains a few Chinese constellations . Two stars in the tail represented part of <unk> , the tower with the market office . Another star in the tail represented <unk> , jewel shops . One star in the head ( Mu Serpentis ) marked <unk> , the crown prince 's wet nurse , or sometimes rain . 
 There were two " serpent " constellations in Babylonian astronomy , known as <unk> and <unk> . It appears that <unk> was depicted as a hybrid of a dragon , a lion and a bird , and loosely corresponded to Hydra . <unk> was a horned serpent ( c.f. <unk> ) and roughly corresponds to the Ὄφις constellation of Eudoxus of Cnidus on which the Ὄφις ( Serpens ) of Ptolemy is based . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Serpens is the only one of the 88 modern constellations to be split into two disconnected regions in the sky : Serpens Caput ( the head ) and Serpens Cauda ( the tail ) . The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context ; specifically , it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus . 
 Serpens Caput is bordered by Libra to the south , Virgo and Boötes to the east , Corona Borealis to the north , and Ophiuchus and Hercules to the west ; Serpens Cauda is bordered by Sagittarius to the south , Scutum and Aquila to the east , and Ophiuchus to the north and west . Covering 636 @.@ 9 square degrees total , it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size . It appears prominently in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere 's summer . Its main asterism consists of 11 stars , and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6 @.@ 5 , the traditional limit for naked @-@ eye visibility . 
 Serpens Caput 's boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a 15 @-@ sided polygon , while Serpens Cauda 's are defined by a 25 @-@ sided polygon . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of Serpens Caput 's borders lie between 15h <unk> and 16h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between 25 @.@ 66 ° and − 03 @.@ 72 ° . Serpens Cauda 's boundaries lie between right ascensions of 17h <unk> and 18h <unk> and declinations of 06 @.@ 42 ° and − 16 @.@ 14 ° . The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) adopted the three @-@ letter abbreviation " Ser " for the constellation in 1922 .

 Marking the heart of the serpent is the constellation 's brightest star , Alpha Serpentis . Traditionally called <unk> , is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual magnitude of 2 @.@ 630 ± 0 @.@ 009 , meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution . A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star , although it is not visible to the naked eye . Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis , a magnitude 4 @.@ 42 ± 0 @.@ 05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away . Another solar analog in Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis , a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs . 
 Beta , Gamma , and Iota Serpentis form a distinctive triangular shape marking the head of the snake , with Kappa Serpentis being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota . The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3 @.@ 67 , Beta Serpentis is a white main @-@ sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant . It is likely that a nearby 10th @-@ magnitude star is physically associated with Beta , although it is not certain . The Mira variable R Serpentis , situated between Beta and Gamma , is visible to the naked eye at its maximum of 5th @-@ magnitude , but , typical of Mira variables , it can fade to below magnitude 14 . Gamma Serpentis itself is an F @-@ type subgiant located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright , being of magnitude 3 @.@ 84 ± 0 @.@ 05 . The star is known to show solar @-@ like oscillations . 
 Delta Serpentis , forming part of the body of the snake between the heart and the head , is a multiple star system positioned around 70 parsecs from Earth . Consisting of four stars , the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3 @.@ 79 as viewed from Earth , although two of the stars , with a combined apparent magnitude of 3 @.@ 80 , provide nearly all the light . The primary , a white subgiant , is a Delta Scuti variable with an average apparent magnitude of 4 @.@ 23 . Positioned very near Delta , both in the night sky and likely in actual space at an estimated distance of around 70 parsecs , is the barium star 16 Serpentis . Another notable variable star visible to the naked eye is Chi Serpentis , an Alpha ² Canum Venaticorum variable situated midway between Delta and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5 @.@ 33 by 0 @.@ 03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1 @.@ 5 days . 
 The two stars in Serpens Caput that form part of the Snake 's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis , both third @-@ magnitude A @-@ type main @-@ sequence stars . Both have a peculiarity : Epsilon is an Am star , while Mu is a binary . Located slightly northwest of Mu is 36 Serpentis , another A @-@ type main @-@ sequence star . This star also has a peculiarity ; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star , meaning that it has solar @-@ like amounts of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements . 25 Serpentis , positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis , is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B @-@ type giant and an A @-@ type main @-@ sequence star . The primary is a slowly pulsating B star , which causes the system to vary by 0 @.@ 03 magnitudes . 
 Serpens Caput contains many RR Lyrae variables , although most are too faint to be seen without professional photography . The brightest is VY Serpentis , only of 10th magnitude . This star 's period has been increasing by approximately 1 @.@ 2 seconds per century . A variable star of a different kind is <unk> Serpentis , a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5 @.@ 89 and 7 @.@ 07 in 87 days . This star has been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile , where cold infalling gas on to the star creates redshifted hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines . 
 Several stars in Serpens have been found to have planets . The brightest , Omega Serpentis , located between Epsilon and Mu , is an orange giant with a planet of approximately 1 @.@ 7 Jupiter @-@ masses . NN Serpentis , an eclipsing post @-@ common @-@ envelope binary consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf , is very likely to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses . Although it does not have a planet , the solar analog HD <unk> has been found to have a brown dwarf companion within the brown @-@ dwarf desert . 
 PSR <unk> + 11 is a system consisting of two neutron stars orbiting each other , one of which is a pulsar with a period of 37 @.@ 9 milliseconds . Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant , the system was used to test Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , validating the system 's relativistic parameters to within 0 @.@ 2 % of values predicted by the theory . The X @-@ ray emission from the system has been found to be present when the non @-@ pulsar star intersects the equatorial pulsar wind of the pulsar , and the system 's orbit has been found to vary slightly . 
 = = = = Tail stars = = = = 
 The brightest star in the tail , Eta Serpentis , is similar to Alpha Serpentis ' primary in that it is a red giant of spectral class K. This star , however , is known to exhibit solar @-@ like oscillations over a period of approximately 2 @.@ 16 hours . The other two stars in Serpens Cauda forming its asterism are Theta and Xi Serpentis . Xi , where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head , is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away . Two of the stars , with a combined apparent magnitude of around 3 @.@ 5 , form a spectroscopic binary with an angular separation of only 2 @.@ 2 milliarcseconds , and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment . The primary is a white giant with an excess of strontium . Theta , forming the tip of the tail , is also a multiple system , consisting of two A @-@ type main @-@ sequence stars with a combined apparent magnitude of around 4 @.@ 1 separated by almost half an arcminute . 
 Lying near the boundary with Ophiuchus are Zeta , Nu , and Omicron Serpentis . All three are 4th @-@ magnitude main @-@ sequence stars , with Nu and Omicron being of spectral type A and Zeta being of spectral type F. Nu is a binary star with a 9th @-@ magnitude companion , while Omicron is a Delta Scuti variable with amplitude variations of 0 @.@ 01 magnitudes . In 1909 , the symbiotic nova RT Serpentis appeared near Omicron , although it only reached a maximum magnitude of 10 . 
 The star system 59 Serpentis , also known as d Serpentis , is a triple star system consisting of a spectroscopic binary containing an A @-@ type star and an orange giant and an orange giant secondary . The system shows irregular variations in brightness between magnitudes 5 @.@ 17 and 5 @.@ 2 . In 1970 , the nova FH Serpentis appeared just slightly north of 59 Serpentis , reaching a maximum brightness of 4 @.@ 5 . Also near 59 Serpentis in the Serpens Cloud are several Orion variables . MWC 297 is a Herbig Be star that in 1994 exhibited a large X @-@ ray flare and increased in X @-@ ray luminosity by five times before returning to the quiescent state . The star also appears to possess a circumstellar disk . Another Orion variable in the region is VV Serpentis , a Herbig Ae star that has been found to exhibit Delta Scuti pulsations . VV Serpentis has also , like MWC 297 , been found to have a dusty disk surrounding it , and is also a UX Orionis star , meaning that it shows irregular variations in its brightness . 
 The star HR <unk> , also known as MV Serpentis , is an <unk> Canum Venaticorum variable that is faintly visible to the naked eye . The star 's metal abundance is ten times higher than the Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1 @,@ 000 times more for heavier elements . It has also been found to contain excess silicon . Barely visible to the naked eye is HD <unk> , a likely post @-@ blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium . HD <unk> , also located in IC 4756 , is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5 @.@ 70 day period . The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable , undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies , which , combined with the eclipses , causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude . 
 As the galactic plane passes through it , Serpens Cauda contains many massive OB stars . Several of these are visible to the naked eye , such as NW Serpentis , an early Be star that has been found to be somewhat variable . The variability is interesting ; according to one study , it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars . Although not visible to the naked eye , HD <unk> ( MY Serpentis ) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O @-@ type stars . A member of the cluster NGC <unk> , the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants , with one being of the very early spectral type <unk> The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type . Also an eclipsing binary , the HD <unk> system consists of two O @-@ type blue supergiants in orbit around each other . Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD <unk> , a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B @-@ type primary and an Ap secondary , although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star . 
 South of the Eagle Nebula on the border with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary W Serpentis , whose primary is a white giant that is interacting with the secondary . The system has been found to contain an accretion disk , and was one of the first discovered Serpentids , which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong far @-@ ultraviolet spectral lines . It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase , and will evolve first into double periodic variables and then classical Algol variables . Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing Wolf – Rayet binary CV Serpentis , consisting of a Wolf – Rayet star and a hot O @-@ type subgiant . The system is surrounded by a ring @-@ shaped nebula , likely formed during the Wolf – Rayet phase of the primary . The eclipses of the system vary erratically , and although there are two theories as to why , neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars . 
 Serpens Cauda contains a few X @-@ ray binaries . One of these , GX 17 + 2 , is a low @-@ mass X @-@ ray binary consisting of a neutron star and , as in all low @-@ mass X @-@ ray binaries , a low @-@ mass star . The system has been classified as a <unk> @-@ like Z source , meaning that its accretion is near the Eddington limit . The system has also been found to approximately every 3 days brighten by around 3 @.@ 5 K @-@ band magnitudes , possibly due to the presence of a synchrotron jet . Another low @-@ mass X @-@ ray binary , Serpens X @-@ 1 , undergoes occasional X @-@ ray bursts . One in particular lasted nearly four hours , possibly explained by the burning of carbon in " a heavy element ocean " .

 As the galactic plane does not pass through this part of Serpens , a view to many galaxies beyond it is possible . However , a few structures of the Milky Way Galaxy are present in Serpens Caput , such as Messier 5 , a globular cluster positioned approximately 8 ° southwest of α Serpentis , next to the star 5 Serpentis . Barely visible to the naked eye under good conditions , and is located approximately 25 @,@ 000 ly distant . Messier 5 contains a large number of known RR Lyrae variable stars , and is receding from us at over 50 km / s . The cluster contains two millisecond pulsars , one of which is in a binary , allowing the proper motion of the cluster to be measured . The binary could help our understanding of neutron degenerate matter ; the current median mass , if confirmed , would exclude any " soft " equation of state for such matter . The cluster has been used to test for magnetic dipole moments in neutrinos , which could shed light on some hypothetical particles such as the <unk> . Another globular cluster is Palomar 5 , found just south of Messier 5 . Many stars are leaving this globular cluster due to the Milky Way 's gravity , forming a tidal tail over 30000 light @-@ years long . 
 A remarkable dark nebula complex is the <unk> / <unk> complex . Along with a third cloud , they are likely fragments of a single original cloud located 36 degrees away from the galactic plane , a large distance for dark nebulae . The entire complex is thought to be around 140 parsecs distant . <unk> , also referred to as <unk> , is particularly interesting ; there are several infrared sources within , indicating pre @-@ stellar sources thought to present the first known observation of the contraction phase between cloud cores and <unk> cores . The core is split into three regions , with a combined mass of around 25 solar masses . 
 Outside of the Milky Way , there are no bright deep @-@ sky objects for amateur astronomers in Serpens Caput , with nothing else above 10th magnitude . The brightest is NGC 5962 , a spiral galaxy positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant with an apparent magnitude of 11 @.@ 34 . Slightly fainter is NGC <unk> , a barred spiral galaxy with a LINER @-@ type active galactic nucleus situated somewhat closer at a distance of 21 megaparsecs . A type II supernova was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN <unk> . Fainter still are the spirals NGC <unk> and NGC <unk> , with the latter being host to the supernova SN <unk> . 
 Hoag 's Object , located 600 million light @-@ years from Earth , is one of the most famous of a very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies . The outer ring is largely composed of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars . The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy 's coherence and therefore detached . Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens . The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy , Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag 's Object at 250 million light @-@ years from Earth . It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1 @,@ 200 light @-@ years , causing extensive star formation throughout both components . It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars , partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies ' core . Another interacting galaxy pair , albeit in an earlier stage , consists of the galaxies NGC <unk> and NGC <unk> . In this case , both are active galaxies , with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER @-@ type galaxy . Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction . 
 Seyfert 's Sextet is a group of six galaxies , four of which are interacting gravitationally and two of which simply appear to be a part of the group despite their greater distance . The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light @-@ years from Earth and is approximately 100 @,@ 000 light @-@ years across , making Seyfert 's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known . Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy . The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy . However , in 1990 , it was shown that the source is instead a brighter , smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north . This object , designated 3C 326 N , has enough gas for star formation , but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus . 
 A much larger galaxy cluster is the redshift @-@ 0 @.@ <unk> Abell 2063 . The cluster is thought to be interacting with the nearby galaxy group <unk> 3s , based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy at the center of Abell 2063 . The active galaxy at the center of <unk> 3s — NGC <unk> — appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity . Near the 5th @-@ magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4 , a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium . The central galaxy , NGC <unk> , is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment . Similar to AWM 4 , the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy , 3C 317 . This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago . The galaxy has over 40 @,@ 000 known globular clusters , the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002 . 
 Consisting of two quasars with a separation of less than 5 arcseconds , the quasar pair 4C 11 @.@ 50 is one of the visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky . The two have markedly different redshifts , however , and are thus unrelated . The foreground member of the pair ( 4C 11 @.@ 50 A ) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component ( 4C 11 @.@ 50 B ) enough to produce a lensed image , although it does have a true companion of its own . An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321 . Unlike the previous pair , the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and are in the process of merging . Both members appear to be active galaxies ; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former 's jet driving material onto the latter 's supermassive black hole . 
 A remarkable example of gravitational lensing is found in the radio galaxy 3C 324 . First thought to be a single <unk> radio galaxy with a redshift of z 
 = 1 @.@ 206 , it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies , with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z = 
 0 @.@ 845 . The first example of a multiply @-@ imaged radio galaxy discovered , the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus . In even shorter wavelengths , the BL Lac object PG 1553 + 113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays . This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007 . The spectrum is unique , with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma @-@ ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others . In 2012 , the object flared in the gamma @-@ ray spectrum , tripling in luminosity for two nights , allowing the redshift to be accurately measured as z 
 = 0 @.@ 49 . 
 Several gamma @-@ ray bursts ( GRBs ) have been observed in Serpens Caput , such as GRB <unk> , one of the brightest GRBs observed . An optical transient event associated with this GRB has not been found , despite its intensity . The host galaxy initially also proved elusive , however it now appears that the host is a Seyfert I galaxy located at redshift z = 
 0 @.@ 657 . The X @-@ ray afterglow of the GRB has also been much fainter than for other dimmer GRBs . More distant is GRB <unk> ( redshift z = 3 @.@ 221 ) , from which X @-@ ray and optical afterglows were detected . This GRB was surprisingly faint for a long @-@ duration GRB . 
 = = = = Tail objects = = = = 
 Part of the galactic plane passes through the tail , and thus Serpens Cauda is rich in deep @-@ sky objects within our own galaxy . The Eagle Nebula and its associated star cluster , Messier 16 lie 7 @,@ 000 light @-@ years from Earth in the direction of the galactic center . The nebula measures 70 light @-@ years by 50 light @-@ years and contains the Pillars of Creation , three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope . The stars being born in the Eagle Nebula , added to those with an approximate age of 5 million years have an average temperature of 45 @,@ 000 kelvins and produce prodigious amounts of radiation that will eventually destroy the dust pillars . Despite its fame , the Eagle Nebula is fairly dim , with an integrated magnitude of approximately 6 @.@ 0 . The star @-@ forming regions in the nebula are often evaporating gaseous globules ; unlike Bok globules they only hold one protostar . 
 North of Messier 16 , at a distance of approximately 2000 parsecs , is the OB association Serpens OB2 , containing over 100 OB stars . Around 5 million years old , the association appears to still contain star @-@ forming regions , and the light from its stars is illuminating the HII region S 54 . Within this HII region is the open cluster NGC <unk> , which is the same age as the surrounding OB association , and the cluster is now thought to simply be the densest part of it . The cluster appears to be producing a thermal chimney of ionized gas , caused by the interaction of the gas from the galactic disk with the galactic halo . 
 Another open cluster in Serpens Cauda is IC 4756 , containing at least one naked @-@ eye star , HD <unk> ( another naked @-@ eye star in the vicinity , HD <unk> , is most likely unrelated ) . Positioned approximately 440 parsecs distant , the cluster is estimated to be around 800 million years old , quite old for an open cluster . Despite the presence of the Milky Way in Serpens Cauda , one globular cluster can be found : NGC <unk> , although invisible to the naked eye , can be made out in small telescopes just north of Zeta Serpentis . Rather small and sparse for a globular cluster , this cluster contains no known RR Lyrae variables , which is unusual for a globular cluster . 
 MWC 922 is a star surrounded by a planetary nebula . Dubbed the Red Square Nebula due to its similarities to the Red Rectangle Nebula , the planetary nebula appears to be a nearly perfect square with a dark band around the equatorial regions . The nebula contains concentric rings , which are similar to those seen in the supernova SN 1987A . MWC 922 itself is an FS Canis Majoris variable , meaning that it is a Be star containing exceptionally bright hydrogen emission lines as well as select forbidden lines , likely due to the presence of a close binary . East of Xi Serpentis is another planetary nebula , Abell 41 , containing the binary star MT Serpentis at its center . The nebula appears to have a bipolar structure , and the axis of symmetry of the nebula has been found to be within 5 ° of the line perpendicular to the orbital plane of the stars , strengthening the link between binary stars and bipolar planetary nebulae . On the other end of the stellar age spectrum is <unk> , a dark nebula which contains the protostar IRAS <unk> @-@ <unk> . Although classified as a class 0 protostar , it has some unusual features for such an object , such as a lack of high @-@ velocity stellar winds , and it has been proposed that this object is in transition between class 0 and class I. A variable nebula exists around the protostar , although it is only visible in infrared light . 
 The Serpens cloud is a massive star @-@ forming molecular cloud situated in the southern part of Serpens Cauda . Only two million years old and 420 <unk> distant , the cloud is known to contain many protostars such as Serpens <unk> 1 and Serpens SVS 20 . The Serpens South <unk> was uncovered by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope in the southern portion of the cloud , and it appears that star formation is still continuing in the region . Another site of star formation is the <unk> 40 complex , consisting of a prominent HII region adjacent to a molecular cloud . Located around 500 parsecs distant , it is one of the nearest massive regions of star formation , but as the molecular cloud obscures the HII region , rendering it and its embedded cluster tough to see visibly , it is not as well @-@ studied as others . The embedded cluster likely contains over 600 stars above 0 @.@ 1 solar masses , with several massive stars , including at least one O @-@ type star , being responsible for lighting the HII region and the production of a bubble . 
 Despite the presence of the Milky Way , several active galaxies are visible in Serpens Cauda as well , such as PDS 456 , found near Xi Serpentis . The most intrinsically luminous nearby active galaxy , this AGN has been found to be extremely variable in the X @-@ ray spectrum . This has allowed light to be shed on the nature of the supermassive black hole at the center , likely a Kerr black hole . It is possible that the quasar is undergoing a transition from an ultraluminous infrared galaxy to a classical radio @-@ quiet quasar , but there are problems with this theory , and the object appears to be an exceptional object that does not completely lie within current classification systems . Nearby is <unk> 530 , a blazar that has been known to flare in the X @-@ rays occasionally . One of these flares was for less than 2000 seconds , making it the shortest flare ever observed in a blazar as of 2004 . The blazar also appears to show periodic variability in its radio wave output over two different periods of six and ten years .

 = ROH World Television Championship = 
 The ROH World Television Championship is a professional wrestling world television championship in the Ring of Honor ( ROH ) promotion . It is currently the third ranked championship in ROH . With the introduction of the ROH World Television Championship , the television type championship returned to national exposure . 
 There has been a total of eleven reigns shared between nine champions . The first champion was crowned on March 5 , 2010 , when Eddie Edwards defeated Davey Richards in the finals of a tournament . 
 The current champion is Bobby Fish , who is in his first reign . Jay Lethal 's second reign is the longest in the title 's history . During that reign , Lethal also won the ROH World Championship in a Title vs. Title match at Best in the World 2015 . 
 = = History = = 
 The creation of the ROH World Television Championship was announced via ROH 's official website on January 20 , 2010 . An eight @-@ man single elimination tournament was then planned to determine the inaugural champion . The tournament was to start on February 4 and conclude on February 6 , 2010 at The Arena in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania at the tapings of ROH 's television program Ring of Honor Wrestling . Regarding the new championship addition , ROH President Cary <unk> said , " We ’ ve been talking about adding a secondary championship for some time . Not only will this give the athletes of Ring of Honor another tremendous goal to work towards , it will also give our great partner , HDNet , a championship that is sure to be defended on the television program . We ’ re happy to publicly give thanks to HDNet for giving us the chance to add this title to the television show ... " . 
 It is ROH 's second secondary singles championship in their history . The ROH Pure Championship was used from February 14 , 2004 to August 12 , 2006 , prior its unification with the ROH World Championship . After the championship announcement , wrestling columnist James Caldwell gave his comments : " I like the idea . It gives mid @-@ card wrestlers on ROH 's roster something to fight for in the context of trying to win a wrestling match to " move up the company ladder . " Caldwell further remarked that " ROH bringing back the TV Title to national TV is consistent with ROH 's current marketing under Jim Cornette to " re @-@ capture an old @-@ school flavor " to their product . " 
 After the Ring of Honor Wrestling show was cancelled in March 2011 , the title became inactive . Although Daniels stopped defending it , he still carried the belt with him as part of his villainous character . With the sale of ROH to the Sinclair Broadcast Group and a new television show scheduled to air in September , ROH reinstated the title for June 's Best in The World event . 
 = = = Tournament = = = 
 The tournament was scheduled to span over a two @-@ day weekend , starting on February 5 and ending on February 6 at events recorded for later broadcast on Ring of Honor Wrestling . However , due to severe weather conditions in the Philadelphia area , the second day of taping was canceled . It was not until almost a month later , on March 5 , that ROH held the second recorded event , which closed out the tournament . The first four seeds of eight in the tournament were announced on January 22 , 2010 : Rhett Titus ( 8 ) , El Generico ( 7 ) , Eddie Edwards ( 6 ) , and Delirious ( 5 ) . The other four seeds were announced on January 26 , 2010 : Kevin Steen ( 1 ) , Kenny King ( 2 ) , Colt Cabana ( 3 ) , and Davey Richards ( 4 ) . The first round was determined at the first event on February 5 , with Steen , King , Richards , and Edwards all advancing to round two . On March 5 , Edwards and Richards both advanced to the finals , where Edwards defeat Richards to be crowned the first ROH World Television Champion . The matches were scheduled to span over six episodes of Ring of Honor Wrestling . The first match from round one that aired pitted Steen against Titus , which Steen won , on the March 8 episode . On the same episode , King versus El Generico was featured , with King advancing . Cabana versus Edwards was the third match from round one to air , when it was broadcast on the March 15 episode . Richards defeated Delirious in the final match from round one , which aired later in the same episode . The first match from round two , Steen versus Edwards , was featured on the April 12 episode , in which Edwards advanced to the finals . On the April 19 episode , Richards defeated King to advance to the finals . On the April 26 episode , Edwards defeated Richards in the finals of the tournament to become the first ROH World Television Champion .

 The championship belt was introduced on March 5 , 2010 , when it was given to the newly crowned inaugural champion Eddie Edwards . The physical championship belt was designed All Star Championship Belts d / b / a <unk> , LLC . The title 's base is a black leather strap that is covered with four small silver plates . The center of the title has one large silver plate . All plates have an inner blue covering . The two small outer plates have a caricature of the earth and a satellite in orbit . The middle plates have figures resembling a cameraman filming a television production . Underneath each figure , lies the ROH logo and the words " Ring of Honor Wrestling " . The central plate has the engravings of the ROH logo as well as the statement " World Television Wrestling Champion " hovering above the backdrop of a city , with a television lying on top of a globe with an overhead shot of a wrestling ring between them in front of the skyline . The design was changed again in November 2012 to its current design during the reign of Adam Cole . Longest reigning champion Jay Lethal modified the current design which emphasizes the " ROH Champion " portion of the title , claiming the championship is more prestigious than the ROH World Championship because he ( Lethal ) is the champion .

 = Septimus Heap = 
 Septimus Heap is a series of fantasy novels featuring a protagonist of the same name written by English author Angie Sage . In all , it features seven novels , entitled Magyk , Flyte , Physik , Queste , Syren , Darke and Fyre , the first ( Magyk ) in 2005 and the final ( Fyre ) in 2013 . A full colour supplement to the series , entitled The Magykal Papers , was published in June 2009 , and an online novella titled The Darke Toad is also available . A sequel trilogy , The TodHunter Moon Series , set seven years after the events of Fyre , began in October 2014 , with the second book released in October 2015 . 
 The series follows the adventures of Septimus Heap who , as a seventh son of a seventh son , has extraordinary magical powers . After he becomes an apprentice to the arch ( " ExtraOrdinary " ) wizard of the series , Marcia Overstrand , he must study for seven years and a day until his apprenticeship ends . In the first book , he is known as Young Army Expendable Boy 412 , until his great @-@ aunt , Zelda <unk> Heap reveals his true identity . His adventures are placed in the context of the warmth and strength of his family , and developed alongside those of Jenna , his adoptive sister , who is heir to the throne of the Castle , the community where they live . The novels , set in an elaborate fantastic world , describe the many challenges that Septimus and his friends must overcome . 
 The books have appeared on national bestsellers lists and received worldwide critical acclaim ; Warner Bros. acquired the rights to produce a movie based on the first book . The series has been noted for the realism and richness of its characters , the compelling nature of their adventures , and its humour . It has been compared with Harry Potter and other works within the genre . 
 = = Development = = 
 Author Angie Sage has said that the character of Septimus Heap , his ultimate fate , and the world he inhabits , were fully formed in her imagination from the beginning , but she had not decided on the intermediate steps on his journey , nor on the characters he would meet . Sage described Septimus Heap 's world as a place where numerous creatures and people suddenly appear and become involved in events . 
 Commenting on the development of the Septimus Heap character , Sage has described him as someone in a strange and hostile world who has no idea of his real identity . The series gained momentum with the development of the character of Marcia Overstrand , which Sage credits as an inspiration . Septimus Heap is centred on the warmth and strength of the Heap family . In an interview Sage said : 
 I like their chaotic acceptance of life , and the fact that they don 't do what they are told by authority if they think it is wrong . Stuff happens to them that makes their life difficult at times but they don 't moan about things , they just get on and sort it out as best they can . They are remarkably accepting of other people , I think because they are so strong as a unit . They are also a family which becomes separated by <unk> and I wanted to show that families can still be close to each other and care for each other even though they live apart . The family relationships develop as the books progress , and are central to the story . 
 Sage keeps a boat ( called Muriel ) in real life , as does the character Sally Mullin in Magyk . Other inspirations for the series included Sage 's love of history and the misty landscape of Cornwall , where she lived before starting the series . Another factor in the development of the series was her love of daydreaming : " Slowly ... lots of thinking , and daydreaming . I am a big fan of daydreaming and staring out of the window . Then keeping all my thoughts and ideas in a dog @-@ eared old envelope for ages . " With The Wilton Villager , Sage further expanded her inspiration behind the series . 
 It was an idea I had had for a very long time , and I waited a long time while it grew and developed . [ ... ] I try and write the books I would have loved to have read as a child and teenager . [ ... ] It all started with the spelling of the first title , ' Magyk . ' I felt the way that magic is normally spelled makes people think of conjuring tricks and stage magicians and I wanted to avoid that , but in the past , before spelling became standardized , people would spell words how they chose to , sometimes in different ways in the same sentence . Magic was often spelled <unk> , so all I did was to change that a little . After that I carried on using archaic spelling for words associated with magic and the supernatural . It makes them look a little different , gives a different flavor to them .

 The plot of the first book , entitled Magyk ( published in March 2005 ) , revolves around the pauper Heap family : Silas , Sarah and their seven children . The story begins when Silas finds Jenna in the snow . Septimus is born on the same day , but is declared dead by the midwife , who steals the baby and brings him to DomDaniel , an evil wizard . However , he is confused with the midwife 's own son and is sent to the Supreme Custodian to help start a boy army . On her tenth birthday , Jenna learns from ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand that she is a princess , but that she — and the Heap family — are in danger . Jenna and Nicko Heap escape to their Aunt Zelda 's cottage . They are accompanied by a member of the Young Army called Boy 412 , who discovers his magic powers and a legendary ring while at Zelda 's . Marcia is imprisoned in DomDaniel ´ s boat , Vengeance , and nearly dies , but is rescued by Boy 412 , Jenna and Nicko after they find a flying Dragon Boat in a secret cavern by Zelda ´ s cottage . At the end of the novel , Boy 412 is revealed to be Septimus , and his family hears of his past .

 The second book , Flyte ( published in March 2006 ) , begins with Septimus ( now the apprentice to ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia ) witnessing the kidnapping of Jenna by her older brother Simon . After seeking help from Nicko and a friend from the Young Army , Septimus finds Jenna at The Port , but they are followed by Simon . They fly to The Castle in the Dragon Boat , engaging in aerial combat with Simon on the way . Marcia 's life is threatened by the reassembled bones of DomDaniel , but with Septimus 's help , she destroys him . The novel also features the discovery of the lost " Flyte " charm , which gives the book its title , and an egg that hatches into a dragon Septimus names Spit Fyre .

 The antagonist of the third book , Physik ( published in March 2007 ) , is the 500 @-@ year @-@ old spirit of Queen Etheldredda , who is accidentally released by Silas Heap . She sends Septimus to her immortal son Marcellus Pye . He is transported back in time to become the apprentice of the young Marcellus Pye , an alchemist who teaches him about " Physik " . In the present timeline of the novel , the Castle is infected by a deadly plague and Queen Etheldredda has the plan to acquire eternal life . Jenna and Nicko meet a young trader Snorri <unk> with whom they travel in time to bring Septimus back though Nicko and Snorri couldn 't escape . There , Jenna is taken to the living Queen Etheldredda , but she escapes with Septimus and they return to the present Castle . Marcia then destroys the substantial spirit of Etheldredda and Septimus brews an antidote to the plague using his knowledge of Physik .

 The quest of the fourth book , Queste ( published in April 2008 ) , is a journey in time to the House of Foryx , in which " all times meet " , to bring back Nicko and Snorri , who were trapped there after the events of the third book . Septimus is sent on this mission for nefarious reasons by a ghost called Tertius Fume . Assisted by Jenna and his friend Beetle , among others , he pieces together a map to the House of Foryx . When they reach the house , Septimus meets Hotep @-@ Ra , the first ExtraOrdinary Wizard , while Jenna and Beetle find Nicko and Snorri .

Bloomsbury said that this Septimus Heap encyclopedia is a dazzling cornucopia of information on every aspect of Septimus 's world and the creatures that inhabit it , including the secret files , the journal excerpts , charm theory , the seven basic spells , dispatches from the Message Rat Office , the history , and the maps .

 As of June 2015 , it seems the movie has been shelved . 
 = = Characters = = 
 The eponymous protagonist of the series is Septimus Heap . As the seventh son of a seventh son , the aptly named Septimus has exceptional magical powers . He shares his birthday with Jenna , his adoptive sister , but is presumed dead at birth by his family . For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412 , a child from the Young Army , where he has spent the first ten years of his life after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him . Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand . He has a mop of curly hair , wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand . In the second novel , he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet . According to a review in the Manila Standard Today , the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character . 
 Adopted by the Heap family as a baby in place of Septimus , Jenna Heap is the daughter of an assassinated queen . She is a small girl , with deep violet eyes and fair complexion ; she wears a deep red cloak and the gold circlet of the princess on her head . She is portrayed as loving and caring at heart , but sometimes very stubborn . In the first novel she has a pet rock called Petroc Trelawney ( presumably named after Petroc Trelawny ) , which she loses when the Marram Marshes are flooded ; she later acquires a pet duck called Ethel . The ambiguity of Jenna 's characterization has been questioned , with one critic commenting : " [ A ] s the Princess or <unk> , she comes from a turbulent past and is thrust into the anonymous world of ordinary society without any inkling of her royal background . The reader is therefore left guessing whether or not she has it in her to rise to the tenets of her position as ruler of the Castle . " 
 Marcia Overstrand is the powerful , ambitious and wilful ExtraOrdinary Wizard of the series . She is characterized as stern , bad @-@ tempered and intimidating , but with a good heart beneath . Her affection towards her apprentice Septimus is manifest in the novels , as is the responsibility she feels to protect him and his sister , even with her own life . She is described as a tall woman , with long , dark curly hair and deep @-@ green eyes , and generally wears a deep purple tunic with purple python @-@ skin boots . Her symbol and source of power , an <unk> @-@ Amulet , which makes her ExtraOrdinary Wizard , hangs around her neck . Her haughty and vain characterization has been praised as a " well @-@ written stand @-@ alone " . 
 The main antagonist of the first two novels is DomDaniel , a Necromancer and ex @-@ ExtraOrdinary Wizard who wants to regain control of the Wizard Tower from Marcia Overstrand . The antagonist of the third novel , is Queen Etheldredda . Several other characters appear regularly in the novels , including Septimus 's parents Silas and Sarah Heap , Septimus 's friend Beetle , and a trader called Snorri <unk> . 
 = = Fictional setting = = 
 Like other fantasy novels , the Septimus Heap series is set in an imaginary world . Maps are provided in all of the books . Magyk contains a map of the Castle and its surroundings to the Port in the south . An enlarged map of the Castle is also included . Flyte has a map showing the Badlands and the Borderlands in the north . Physik has an enlarged map of the Castle with more details showing the <unk> chambers . Queste has a map for the House of Foryx , drawn by Snorri for Marcellus . Syren keeps the past maps but adds the isles of Syren . The map in Syren also mentions that the country that Septimus lives in is called " The Small Wet Country Across the Sea " . Darke has a map similar to that in Magyk , however , instead of including Marram Marshes which are south of the castle , it includes a map of the Darke Halls , bleak creek and the bottomless whirlpool . It also includes an enlarged map of the castle . At the end of Fyre , Septimus writes in the snow that the date is July 4 , 12 @,@ 004 . The book ends with a quote form Arthur C Clarke : " Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology is <unk> from Magyk " . , hinting that the series is set in the far future . This also hinted at by a dialogue between Lucy <unk> and Wolf Boy in Syren about the Red Tube . Wolf Boy says he has heard stories that people used to travel to the moon in things like that . Lucy dismisses this , however , it 's apparent they are talking about Apollo moon missions . Hints that the story is set in the future also reveal themselves when Septimus and the possessed Syrah enter a chamber that goes up and down with the press of a button , indicating that they used an elevator . 
 = = = The Castle = = = 
 The Castle is the main location in the series . It is situated by a river on a piece of land , circular in shape , which has been cut off from the surrounding forest by an artificial moat . The Wizard Tower , the Palace and the <unk> are located in the Castle . Sage based the structure on that of ancient walled cities which were completely self @-@ sufficient , like little nations in their own right . 
 The Wizard Tower is the place where the ExtraOrdinary Wizard ( Marcia Overstrand ) resides along with Ordinary Wizards and the ExtraOrdinary Apprentice ( Septimus Heap ) . Built by the first ExtraOrdinary Wizard , Hotep @-@ Ra , it is a purple 21 @-@ floor tower with a gold pyramid at the top , surrounded by an aura of <unk> . The Palace is the royal residence , home to Jenna , Sarah and Silas . It is much older than the Wizard Tower with secret places , such as the Queen 's room , which is accessible only to the Queen or the Princess , and has a secret passage to the Marram Marshes . 
 = = = The lands around the Castle = = = 
 = = = Marram Marshes = = = 
 To the south of the Castle are the Marram Marshes , a long stretch of marshland near the mouth of the river , which is inhabited by many creatures , such as Brownies , Quake <unk> , Boggarts and pythons . Zelda Heap 's cottage is on <unk> Island , in the middle of the marshes . It is built above the secret temple where Septimus finds the Dragon Boat . Septimus also found the egg ( which he thought was a rock ) from which spit Fyre hatched in this temple . Sage has stated that the marshes are based on boggy areas at the end of a creek near her home , and that the tides and the phases of the moon in the novels are based on those for Falmouth , Cornwall . 
 = = = The Forest = = = 
 The Forest lies to the north @-@ west of the Castle , and is feared by the Castle 's inhabitants as a dark and dangerous area . The <unk> Witches and the witch community live there , as does Galen , Sarah Heap 's mentor in Physik . The Forest has many mysterious aspects , and is dominated by shape @-@ shifting or carnivorous trees , including Benjamin Heap , wolverines , and secrets . The Forest has a secret way to transport a character to the path leading to the House of Foryx . Sage based the Forest on medieval forests , which were huge and a law unto themselves , free from the authority of the outside world . 
 = = = The House of Foryx = = = 
 The House of Foryx is a magical house situated somewhere deep in another forest , surrounded by perpetual winter . It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars . Here all times meet , and characters can go from one time to another . Characters can come into the building from any time , but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door ; otherwise they are lost in time , and may even end up in a time when the House of Foryx did not exist , giving them no chance of ever returning . The house is named after Foryx , a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe . 
 = = = Other locations = = = 
 = = = The Port = = = 
 The Port lies in the extreme south near the sea , and is portrayed as a place full of strangers . Here ships load their cargo , which is verified by the customs officer , Alice Nettles ( deceased ) . A dangerous coven called the Port Witch Coven can lure strangers into a trap or turn them into toads . There is a short cut from the Port to Zelda 's house in the Marram Marshes . The author created the Port because of her love of the hubbub accompanying the arrival of boats . According to Sage , she sees the Port as full of " beginnings and adventures — and endings too . " 
 = = = The Badlands = = = 
 The Badlands are a rocky and hilly valley on the northern borders of the Septimus Heap world , where DomDaniel once practised his dark magic in an observatory atop a hill . They are inhabited by Land <unk> , giant carnivorous snakelike animals , making them a dangerous place . Simon Heap also used to live there with Lucy <unk> . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Septimus Heap novels have been published in 28 languages worldwide and have sold over one million copies in the United States , with each of the books appearing on national bestsellers lists . Published in March 2005 , the first book , Magyk , became an international bestseller after it appeared at number one on the New York Times Best Sellers List . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The series has received mostly positive reviews . 
 The Independent newspaper 's review of the audio books stated that the chapters are short enough to keep children of seven @-@ plus interested but , as there are ghosts , rats , soldiers and dragon boats to help Septimus and the young Princess fight the evil necromancer DomDaniel , there is enough to keep the whole family amused . 
 = = = Comparisons with other fantasy novels = = = 
 Some critics have noted similarities between names in Septimus Heap and those in Harry Potter , such as Petroc Trelawney ( Jenna 's pet rock ) and Sybill Trelawney ( a professor in Harry Potter ) ; also both series feature Boggarts ( which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape @-@ shifters in Harry Potter ) . In response , British author Phil Knight has commented : 
 The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is nothing at all to do with Professor Trelawney . He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally , but otherwise will be known over the air . Think : why would Jenna call a pet rock ' Trelawney ' ? To a Radio 3 listener like me , it 's perfectly logical ... And as for Boggarts , they 've been around here in the North of England for a long time . Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough , for example . They 're not really like either Sage 's or Rowling 's creatures , but pre @-@ exist either of them . 
 The series has also been compared to other fantasy novels : for instance , Hotep @-@ Ra 's magical ring evokes The Lord of the Rings , and the journeys in the series are " somewhat Narnia @-@ esque in how they play out " ; similarly the concept of a remarkably powerful seventh son of a seventh son was previously employed in the Alvin Maker series of Orson Scott Card . The sprinkling of borrowed ideas has not necessarily been regarded as a negative trait : these ideas play a part in developing the flavour of the series and " don 't necessarily deviate it from its originality " .
