 As winter broke in 1799 , on 1 March , General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25 @,@ 000 , the so @-@ called Army of Observation , crossed the Rhine between Basel and Kehl . This crossing officially violated the Treaty of Campo Formio . On 2 March , the Army was renamed Army of the Danube , upon orders of the French Directory . 
 The Army met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest in four columns , through the Höllental ( Hölle valley ) , via Oberkirch , and Freudenstadt , and at the southern end of the forest , along the Rhine bank . Although prudent counsel might have advised Jourdan to establish a position on the eastern slope of the mountains , he did not ; instead he pushed across the Danube plain , taking position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen . 
 The Austrian Army and Archduke Charles , its commander @-@ in @-@ chief , had wintered with his army in the Bavarian , Austrian , and Salzburg territories on the eastern side of the Lech ; his force alone numbered close to 80 @,@ 000 troops , and outnumbered the French force by three to one . An additional 26 @,@ 000 , commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze , guarded the Vorarlberg , and further south , another 46 @,@ 000 , under command of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde , formed the defense of the Tyrol . The Austrians had already reached an agreement with Tsar Paul of Russia by which the legendary Alexander Suvorov would leave retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60 @,@ 000 troops . 
 = = = Engagement at Ostrach = = = 
 The Army of the Danube advanced on Pfullendorf and Ostrach , the former an imperial city in Upper ( southern ) Swabia , and the latter a nearby village of 300 belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem , an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance . Jourdan 's objective was simple and direct : cut the Austrian line at the border of the southwestern German states and Switzerland , preventing the Coalition 's use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe . Isolation of the two theaters would prevent the Austrians from assisting one another ; furthermore , if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland , they could use these routes to move their own forces between the two theaters . 
 Stretching between the Pfullendorf heights and the village lies a flat , wide plain , marshy in places , ringed with low @-@ lying hills , and creased with a small tributary stream from which the village takes its name . Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain , but slightly south of the Danube itself . By 7 March , the first French forces arrived there , and the Austrians arrived a day or so later . Over the following week , additional forces for both sides arrived , and the two armies faced each other across this valley . 
 The French army extended in a long line from the Danube to Lake Constance . The Third Division , commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr , positioned itself at the far left flank , and Dominique Vandamme 's detached force , returning from reconnaissance near Stuttgart , roamed on the north shore of the river . François Joseph Lefebvre commanded the Advance Guard , positioned on the slope below Pfullendorf , and Joseph Souham , with the Second Division , took position behind him . Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino 's First Division held the southern @-@ most flank , to defend against any encirclement by Charles ' force . Jourdan set up command at Pfullendorf , and the Cavalry <unk> , commanded by Jean @-@ Joseph Ange d 'Hautpoul , stood slightly to the north and west of Souham . 
 By late on the 19th , Austrian and French soldiers had been skirmishing at outposts for more than 30 hours , with the action growing increasingly intense . In the early hours of the 21st , General Lefebvre informed Jourdan that the Austrians were attacking all his positions , and that the general engagement would begin shortly . After 24 hours of fighting , Austrian forces pushed Lefebvre and Saint Cyr 's troops back to the Pfullendorf heights . Although sappers blew up the primary bridge over the Ostrach river , the Austrians managed to ford the stream anyway . They nearly outflanked General Saint Cyr 's forces on the right flank , did outflank Lefebvre 's forces in the center , and cut off a portion of the southern flank from the main body . Saint Cyr 's troops barely managed to pull back before being fully cut off . Finally , General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze , marching north with 10 @,@ 000 men , from Feldkirch , threatened Ferino 's First Division from the south . 
 = = = Retreat from Ostrach = = = 
 On 21 March , at 2200 , Jourdan ordered the wounded to be transported to Schaffhausen in Switzerland , via Stockach . The main army then began its own retreat in the early morning of the 22nd . The reserve division of d 'Hautpoul left first , and pulled back via Stockach to <unk> ob Eck . The first division pulled back to Bodman , on the northern tip of the Überlingen @-@ finger of Lake Constance ; in the retreat , a portion of the force was encircled and cut off by the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp , Prince Schwarzenberg 's brigade , and more than 500 were taken prisoner . 
 = = Battle at Stockach and Engen = = 
 Fought at the junction of the east @-@ west and north @-@ south roads on the eastern side of the Black Forest , the day @-@ long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days . The Austrians still had the numerical superiority , but this time it was closer to two @-@ to @-@ one , instead of almost three @-@ to @-@ one . Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line , and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command . Charles , likewise , had shortened his line ; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke , he and his 10 @,@ 000 men were approaching from the Austrians ' left rear . 
 = = = Dispositions = = = 
 By 23 March , Jourdan had his headquarters in the vicinity of Stockach . He had recalled Barthélemy Ferino from the far right flank ; Ferino had retreated along the coast of the Überlingen Lake , the northwestern finger of Lake Constance , to be in position at the close right flank , adjacent to Souham 's division . Lefebvre , wounded at Ostrach , was unable to take the field himself , and Laurent Saint Cyr commanded the left flank . When Jourdan considered his position , he felt it too extended , so he drew back further behind Stockach , toward Engen , where he could concentrate his force . The first division camped near the Hohentwiel , the 11th @-@ century fortress overlooking the marshes at the westernmost point of the Lake Constance . The second division , the advanced guard , and a cavalry division were camped on the heights above Engen . The third division was camped by <unk> ( <unk> , the French called it ) , and Neuhausen . Vandamme and his small corps worked themselves discreetly into a position behind the Austrian right flank . Jourdan established his headquarters at Engen . 
 The plan was straightforward : Vandamme and Saint Cyr would make a simultaneous attack on the Austrian right , and Soult 's and Jourdan 's main force would attack the Austrian center and left . Jourdan 's plan , to attack four points of the opposition simultaneously , seemed to him to be the only reasonable action against a force with such numerical superiority . 
 The Habsburg center columns included 17 @,@ 000 men under the command of field marshal Friedrich Joseph , Count of Nauendorf , formed into three columns and approaching from the north east . The main force , under the command of the Archduke Charles , included 53 @,@ 000 men , also in three columns ; in the main force , Charles had under his command the princes of Anhalt and Fürstenberg plus six battalions in a fourth column , north of the main column , but south of Nauendorf 's command . An additional force of 13 @,@ 000 troops under the command of Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Count Sztáray formed the southern flank . 
 = = = General engagement = = = 
 The general engagement on 25 March was brutal and bloody . Before daybreak , at close to 0500 , Saint Cyr opened by sending his forces in a headlong attack on the Austrian right , coordinated with Souham and Ferino 's assault on the Austrian left . The ferocious attack forced the Austrians out of the woods in which they had been positioned overnight , and down the road to the village of <unk> . Fearing that his forces would be flanked , Charles directed some reinforcements to back up General <unk> 's force on the Austrian right , six squadrons of lancers of the First Regiment . At this point , Vandamme 's small corps , which had moved into position in the night of 24 March , attacked from the rear . Saint Cyr 's forces had taken hold of the woods outside Stockach , named by the Austrians as the gruesome wood , with the conflict there described as " obstinate and bloody . " The Archduke himself arrived with six battalions of Hungarian grenadiers and twelve squadrons of cuirassiers and led them into the fight . His grenadiers , experienced and battle @-@ hardened , objected to his exposure and one actually grabbed the bridle of Charles ' horse , to stop him . As the archduke prepared to dismount and lead his men on foot , Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg stepped forward to volunteer , reportedly stating that he would die first , before allowing the archduke to put himself in such danger . As Karl Aloys Fürstenberg led the hussars and grenadiers into a counter @-@ attack , he was hit by French case shot and killed . Archduke Charles eventually did lead his grenadiers , and the French momentum was not only arrested , but reversed . The Prince of Anhalt was also killed in the battle . Saint Cyr made no progress until Vandamme 's assault , but both withered under the Archduke 's response . In the melee , Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand , a general of brigade of Saint Cyr 's III . Division , lost both his brother at his side , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp , and Jourdan himself had barely escaped being trampled to death or captured , as he tried to rally his own troops . The superior number of Austrians stalled the main French assault on the Habsburg center . 
 At the French right flank , General Ferino attempted to push the Austrians back , first with a cannonade , followed by an attack through the woods on both sides of the road between Asch and Stockach . Two columns made two attacks , both of which were repulsed ; finally , Ferino added his third column to the assault , which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line , cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade . Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition . The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of <unk> , successfully taking it , but they were unable to hold it in the night , and subsequently fell back . 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 On the evening of 26 March , Jourdan arranged for the abandonment of the positions in Engen and Stockach . Saint Cyr had already withdrawn along the Danube , after his and Vandamme 's assaults on the Austrian right failed , and was working his way west toward the Black Forest . Inexplicably , at least at the time , the Austrians failed to pursue the retreating French ; instead of pursuing the French , Charles ordered his army into cantonments at Stockach and Engen , as far south as <unk> . The Aulic Council , in establishing a plan of battle , had forbidden his approach to the Rhine until Switzerland was also cleared of the French army ; Charles simply held his ground . 
 By 31 March , the Army of the Danube established itself in Neustadt , Freiburg im Breisgau , Freudenstadt and <unk> . Jourdan set up his command headquarters at Hornberg . The cavalry could not find enough forage in the mountains , and were sent to Offenburg . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Interpretation = = = 
 Jourdan later claimed that the Austrians had lost 7 @,@ 000 killed or wounded , plus another 4 @,@ 000 prisoners , and several cannons . For the whole day of the general engagement , the French had remained on the field of battle without meat , bread or brandy , and their animals had been without forage : " it is impossible to deny , " Jourdan wrote later , " without the most glaring injustice or falsehood , that we gained a victory . " Both sides claimed a victory , but most 19th- and 20th @-@ century historians granted it to the Austrian force . 
 The French Directory did as well . In mid April , suffering from an nephritic complaint , Jourdan handed over command to his chief of staff , general of division Jean Augustin Ernouf , and returned to Paris to complain about the lack of men , the inexperience of the men he had , their supplies , and the size , experience , and supply of the army he had to face . He found little sympathy there , and when he told the Directory that he was ill , tendering his resignation , it was accepted . 
 From exile on Elba fifteen years later , Napoleon analyzed the Battle of Stockach and the French defeat : its cause , he concluded , lay in Jourdan 's division of force . Although Jourdan had increased concentration from his dispositions at Ostrach , the French force was still over @-@ extended . Against a more concentrated force , the Austrians could not have moved troops from the left to reinforce the right flank when Saint Cyr and Vandamme attacked from front and rear . Furthermore , Napoleon averred , Ferino 's force on the French right had not been concentrated sufficiently and d 'Hautpoul 's cavalry assault had taken too long to materialize , giving the Austrians the upper hand . The Austrian left had halted his assault , freeing men from the southern flank to reinforce the northern one . Importantly , the Austrian line was short enough that troops could move quickly from the southern flank to the northern one . Furthermore , Napoleon argued , Jourdan had retreated north @-@ northwest , to the Black Forest to protect Alsace . He should have retreated south , to join with André Masséna 's well @-@ positioned Army of Helvetia , where in combination the Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube could have combined forces to defeat the Habsburg army . With Jourdan 's misguided overall strategy , Napoleon asserted , the French snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . 
 = Selling England by the Pound = 
 Selling England by the Pound is the fifth studio album from the English progressive rock band Genesis , released in October 1973 on Charisma Records . It reached number 3 in the UK and number 70 in the U.S. A single from the album , " I Know What I Like ( In Your Wardrobe ) " was released in February 1974 and became the band 's first top 30 hit in the UK ; November 1973 in the U.S .. 
 The album was recorded in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album , Foxtrot ( 1972 ) . The group set aside a short period of time to write new material , which covered a number of themes , including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence , which was reflected in the title . Following the album 's release , the group set out on tour , where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans . 
 Critics and the band have given mixed opinions of the album , though guitarist Steve Hackett has said it is his favourite Genesis record . The album has continued to sell and has reached Gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry and the Recording Industry Association of America . It was remastered for CD in 1994 and 2007 . Several of the album tracks became fan favourites and featured as a regular part of the band 's live setlist into the 1980s .

 By late 1972 , Genesis had stabilised around Peter Gabriel , Tony Banks , Mike Rutherford , Steve Hackett and Phil Collins . The group had been regularly touring , achieved commercial success with their previous album Foxtrot , and were starting to gig in the U.S. , particularly in New York City , where they had a positive response . However , journalists were still criticising the band and comparing them to other progressive rock bands such as ELP , Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd . The group were too busy touring to write new material , so after coming off the road in spring 1973 they set aside time to create new songs . The group 's record company , Charisma Records insisted they had three months to come up with a new album , which Rutherford considered " the kiss of death " . Collins formed a pick up band with former Yes guitarist Peter Banks for a few gigs , and Rutherford revealed in an interview to Sounds in 1976 that " there had been worries that Phil might want to leave the group " . 
 Gabriel chose the album title , a slogan adopted by the UK Labour Party manifesto , to ensure that the British press would not accuse them of " selling out " to America . Overall , it represented a decay of English folk culture and an increase in Americanisation .

 Gabriel later said he wrote all his lyrical contributions to the album in two days . Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album , the group entered Island Studios in August 1973 . As with Foxtrot , John Burns helped with production . Burns ' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment , and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements . Banks recalled the sessions being difficult , adding " it was hard to get things going . " Charisma released a live album , Genesis Live , compiled from concerts taped for the radio , to fill the gap between studio releases . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 " Dancing with the Moonlit Knight " evolved from a number of short piano pieces composed by Gabriel , which was combined with some of Hackett 's guitar figures to make up the track . Gabriel added English @-@ themed lyrics to counter the impression from the music press that Genesis were trying too hard to appeal to the American audience , including references to Green Shield Stamps . Banks had upgraded to a new model of Mellotron and used the choir sound on the track . The track ends with a series of 12 string guitar figures that were originally supposed to segue into " The Cinema Show " to make a piece around 20 minutes in length , but this idea was dropped as the result was too comparable to " Supper 's Ready " . 
 " I Know What I Like ( In Your Wardrobe ) " came out of a jam session by the group around one of Hackett 's guitar riffs . He had presented the riff to the group previously , but it had been rejected because it sounded too much like The Beatles . It was released as a single from the album , which became the first of the group 's to chart in the UK . 
 Banks wrote most of " Firth of Fifth " on his own , and had presented it to the group for Foxtrot , but it was rejected . He reworked some sections of the song for Selling England by the Pound , where it drew a more positive reception . The track opens with a solo piece for piano , that is repeated by the band later in the song . Hackett took one of Banks ' piano figures and rearranged it as a guitar solo , which dominates the latter part of the track . 
 " More Fool Me " is the second of two songs ( the other being " For Absent Friends " from Nursery Cryme ) to feature Collins on lead vocals before he became the band 's lead singer in 1975 . Uncharacteristically for the group 's output at the time , the song was a tender , romantic ballad . It was written quickly by Collins and Rutherford while sitting on the steps outside the recording studio . 
 " The Battle of Epping Forest " was inspired by a news story that Gabriel had read several years previously about the territorial battles by two rival gangs in the East End of London . He placed an advertisement in The Times in attempt to find more about the story , but was unable to find any further information , so he created his own fictional characters , including " Liquid Len " , " Harold <unk> " and " The Bethnal Green Butcher " . The lyrics have since been praised for their humour and wit , but they did not gel well with the music , which the band subsequently felt was complicated for the sake of being so . 
 " After the Ordeal " is an instrumental written by Hackett ; the first half is a classical guitar and piano piece followed by an electric guitar solo . Banks and Gabriel did not want to include the song on the album , but Hackett insisted it should be kept . It was ultimately left on after Gabriel and Banks argued about the length of " The Cinema Show " , which meant everything was included as a compromise . 
 " The Cinema Show " is divided into two sections . The first section is a 12 @-@ string guitar @-@ based piece , featuring vocal harmonies between Gabriel and Collins , as well as a short flute / oboe solo . The song concludes with a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute keyboard solo on the ARP Pro Soloist , with Rutherford and Collins playing a rhythm in a 7 / 8 time signature . The lyrics , written by Banks and Rutherford , draw much of their inspiration from the T. S. Eliot poem The Waste Land . 
 The album closes with a segue from the end of " The Cinema Show " into " Aisle of Plenty " , a reprise of " Dancing with the Moonlit Knight " which gives the album a book @-@ end effect . The track uses word play such as " Easy , love there 's the safe way home " and " Thankful for her fine fair discount , Tess co @-@ operates " , referring to British supermarkets .

 The album cover is a painting by Betty Swanwick titled The Dream . Swanwick had designed posters for London Transport between the 1930s and 1950s . The original painting did not feature a lawn mower ; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the song " I Know What I Like " as Swanwick told them that she had not enough time to paint a new picture for their cover .

 Selling England by the Pound was released in October 1973 , reaching No. 3 in the UK charts and No. 70 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Albums chart . The album 's success in the U.S. benefitted from a switch from Buddah Records to Atlantic . " I Know What I Like ( In Your Wardrobe ) " was released as a single in February 1974 . It was the band 's first single to enter the UK chart , and peaked at number 21 . In 2013 , the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry . 
 The album was digitally remastered for compact disc in 1994 and again in 2007 by Rhino Records . 
 = = = Critical reception and legacy = = = 
 Contemporary reviews for the album were mixed . Rolling Stone 's Paul Gambaccini praised the band for attempting something utterly different amidst " a stagnant pop scene " , but criticised the album 's lyrics , feeling they overused British pop culture references , and complained about some musical passages . Despite this , Gambaccini thought the album " merits some recognition " . NME 's Barbara <unk> said the album was " the band 's best , most adventurous album to date " . The Guardian 's Robin Denselow wrote that " much of the material is <unk> and tedious " . 
 Retrospective reviews have been more favourable . AllMusic and BBC Music remarked that the album returned to the whimsical eccentricity of Nursery Cryme while retaining the hard rock intensity and pessimism of Foxtrot , combining the best of both elements to make Genesis 's best album up to that point . Robert Christgau , who thoroughly panned most of Genesis 's albums , admitted that the songs " Firth of Fifth " and " The Battle of Epping Forest " have " a complexity of tone that 's pretty rare in any kind of art " , though he summarised the rest of the album by saying " it sounds as snooty as usual . " 
 In 2012 , the album ranked seventh in Rolling Stone 's " Readers ' Poll : Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time " . It was also included in IGN 's list " 10 Classic Prog Rock Albums " in 2008 , who praised its " subtle elegance , sublime textures , and lyrical splendor " . Rock author Edward Macan has mixed feelings towards the album , praising " Firth of Fifth " and " The Cinema Show " but questioning some of the other material . Motoring journalist and broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson is a fan of the album and wrote sleeve notes for it when it was included in the box set Genesis 1970 @-@ 1975 . 
 Hackett has considered the album to be his favourite Genesis record , and was happy with his extensive contributions to it . Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings , saying there are a lot of high points but also some lows . 
 Selling England by the Pound has been praised by other songwriters and musicians . Rush drummer Neil Peart has said : " I think Selling England by the Pound is an enduring masterpiece of drumming . Beautiful drumming , lovely sound , and the arrangements , I think they really nailed the best of what that band as an entity could have done with that album . " Fish , solo artist and former lead singer of Marillion , has called it " the definitive Genesis album " , praised its " emotive " quality , said the wordplay was " one of the things that became quite an influence on me - the games within the lyrics " and concluded it " took a whole jump forward and was the album that really got me into Genesis " . Singer and songwriter Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices considers Selling England by the Pound one of his ten favourite records of all time . John Lennon said he really liked the album during a radio interview , which the band took great encouragement from . 
 = = = Tour = = = 
 The group went on a sell @-@ out tour of the UK immediately following the album 's release , but had to cancel the first date at the Green Playhouse , Glasgow due to electrical safety issues . The group realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management , so they recruited Tony Smith ( no relation to Charisma Records boss Tony Stratton @-@ Smith ) as their new manager . The tour was filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release , but was rejected by the band who felt it was not up to standard . The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973 , with three shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles . 
 By this time , Genesis were suffering from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel at the expense of the rest of the band , a notable factor that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975 . They took an extended break in 1974 following the Selling England by the Pound tour ; Collins joined a side project , Brand X , while Rutherford worked with former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips . 
 Several tracks continued to feature in Genesis ' live set after Collins became the group 's full @-@ time lead singer . The instrumental section of " The Cinema Show " became part of a medley with The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway 's " In the Cage " and remained a fixture of the band 's live set up to the Invisible Touch Tour in 1987 . Versions of " Firth of Fifth " , " I Know What I Like " and " The Cinema Show " appeared on the live album Seconds Out ( 1977 ) , while portions of " Firth of Fifth " and " I Know What I Like " featured as part of the " Old Medley " on The Way We Walk , Volume Two : The <unk> ( 1993 ) . " Firth of Fifth " was performed as a one @-@ off reunion with Gabriel at the ' Six of the Best ' concert in 1982

 = Devasena = 
 Devasena is a Hindu goddess and the first wife of the god Kartikeya , also known as Murugan in South Indian traditions . She is known as Devayanai , Deivanai or <unk> in south @-@ Indian texts . Her name is also spelled as Teyvanai or <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 Devasena is often described as the daughter of Indra , the king of the gods . She is betrothed to Kartikeya by Indra , when he becomes the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the gods . In south @-@ Indian accounts , Devasena is generally depicted as an antithesis of Valli , her co @-@ wife ; together they complete the god . Devasena is generally depicted with Kartikeya and often is also accompanied by Valli . 
 Devasena does not enjoy independent worship , but is worshipped as Kartikeya 's consort in most of his temples . She plays a greater role in the Tirupparankunram Murugan Temple , believed to be the site of her marriage . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Sanskrit name of the goddess Devasena means " army of the gods " and thus , her husband is known as Devasenapati ( " Lord of Devasena " ) . The epithet Devasenapati is a pun which also conveys his role as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the gods . 
 She is called Deivanai or <unk> ( Tamil , literally meaning " celestial elephant " ) , as she was raised by Indra 's divine elephant Airavata . 
 = = Legends and textual references = = 
 In North India , Kartikeya is generally considered as celibate and unmarried . Sanskrit scriptures generally regard only Devasena as the consort of Kartikeya , while in South India , he has two consorts , Devayanai ( Devasena ) and Valli . Devasena is described as daughter of the king of the gods , Indra and his wife <unk> or at least the adopted daughter of Indra . 
 The third book of Mahabharata narrates the tale of the birth of Kartikeya which mentions Devasena . Devasena and <unk> ( literally " army of demons " ) are the daughters of Prajapati Daksha . Once , while the sisters are enjoying leisure at the banks of Lake Manasa , the asura ( demon ) Keshi abducts them so that he could marry them . While Devasena refuses , <unk> consents . Meanwhile , the gods are defeated in a battle by the demons . Indra , who is searching for an ideal Devasenapati ( commander of the army of the gods ) , reaches the place where Devasena is held captive . On her request , Indra defeats the demon and rescues her . Devasena asks Indra to find her a husband ( pati ) who can protect her and defeat the gods , the demons and the <unk> . Indra discusses the matter with the god Brahma and they agree that a son born of Agni would be suitable for being the Devasenapati , the husband of Devasena and the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the gods . Accordingly , Agni is forced to have a son , who becomes Kartikeya . After many exploits which prove his supremacy over the gods , Kartikeya is made the general of the army of the gods and is married to Devasena by Indra . At this point in the text , Agni is identified with Shiva , who is proclaimed as the father of Kartikeya . Ultimately , with the aid of Devasena and Kartikeya , the gods defeat the demons . In this narrative , Devasena is identified with many other goddesses like Shashthi , Shri @-@ Lakshmi , Kuhu @-@ Sinivali and others . 
 The south @-@ Indian manuscripts of the Sanskrit scripture Skanda Purana mentions Devasena and Valli as daughters of the god Vishnu in a previous life . Thus , Kartikeya is regarded as the son @-@ in @-@ law of Vishnu as their husband . An interpolation in the southern recensions of the scripture as well as the Kanda Purana ( the Tamil version of the Sanskrit Skanda Purana ) narrate the story of the marriage of the two maidens to Kartikeya . The two maidens are fated to be married to the god . The elder sister Devasena is born as <unk> . She follows the path of traditional Hindu rituals and practices to gain her husband . <unk> by her penance , Indra adopts her as his daughter and marries her to Kartikeya in an arranged marriage , following custom , after Kartikeya triumphs over the demons . The Kanda Purana describes Devayanai ( Devasena ) as the daughter of Indra , without any mention of adoption . The couple is described as taking their abode in the hills of <unk> , where one of Murugan 's chief temples , Thiruthani Murugan Temple , stands . Another version describes the couple as residing in heaven , the abode of the gods . Meanwhile , Valli is born as <unk> . She is adopted by a tribal chieftain and grows up as a huntress . Murugan wins Valli 's hand and takes her to <unk> . The god is worshipped at the Thiruthani temple , flanked by Devasena on his left and Valli on his right . In the end , the trio settles in the abode of the gods and lives in harmony thereafter . An alternate ending found in Sri Lankan lore describes Murugan as staying on in the forest with Valli after their wedding at Kataragama , where his temple stands . Devayanai tries in vain to compel the god to return to the abode of the gods , but finally joins Kartikeya and Valli to reside in Kataragama . 
 Unlike the Skanda Purana which talks about harmony between Devasena and Valli , the <unk> – part of Tamil Sangam literature – speaks about conflict , resulting in a battle between Devayanai 's royal soldiers and Valli 's hunter clan , which the latter win . Folk <unk> ( a folk poem , presented as a dialogue of two persons ) tradition also talks about the mistrust and quarrel between the co @-@ wives . In one version - where Devayanai is the elder sister of Valli , Valli tries to woo Murugan , before Devayanai 's marriage . As per tradition , the elder sister has to be married off first . Infuriated , Devayanai curses Valli to be born in the forest in her next life , and the curse is then fulfilled when Valli is born as a huntress . In the <unk> Mahatmya , the details of which correspond to most of those found in the Skanda Purana tale , Devasena and Valli are married to Kartikeya from primal times . However in this version , the god condemns Valli to be born on earth as punishment for mocking her sister Devayanai . The <unk> from Sangam literature describes Murugan being accompanied by his chaste wife Devayanai and honoured by a procession of gods and rishis ( sages ) .

 Deivanai is generally depicted with her husband , particularly in an iconographic form called <unk> . She sits on the left thigh of the six @-@ headed and twelve @-@ armed Kartikeya . One of his arms holds her waist . Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram , the location of their marriage . However , in many south @-@ Indian representations , when Murugan is depicted only with one consort , Valli is favoured over Devasena . In most South @-@ Indian depictions , Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him ; Devasena is on his left @-@ hand side . Her complexion is yellow ; she is often depicted adorned with a crown , earrings , necklaces and ornaments . She wears a traditional sari and has two arms . She holds a lotus in her left arm , while his right hand hangs down . 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 The presence of the two consorts is said to denote the dual nature of Murugan , as the god of heaven and earth . Devasena , the celestial wife , is married in a traditional arranged marriage while the earthy Valli is won by Murugan , resulting in a love marriage . The consorts also represent a syncretism between Shaiva and Vaishnava sects , dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu respectively . The son of Shiva , Kartikeya , becomes the son @-@ in @-@ law of Vishnu , due to the marriages . Both the consorts are identified with the soul ( Atman ) , while their husband ( pati , Lord ) represents God . The marriage of Devasena conveys Shaiva ideals , where the soul ( Devasena ) remains detached from God ; she has her own relative autonomy and earns the love of the god by her own merit . In contrast , the Vaishnava philosophy says that God is attached to the soul ( Valli ) and hence he woos her . The <unk> contains a Tamil panegyric dedicated to Murugan . It praises him as the god who is allowed to have two wives , Devasena – the daughter of Indra and Valli , a hunter princess . Murugan is described to equally spend his time on earth and in heaven . This is also conveyed by his wives , Devasena is a daughter of the heavens , while Valli is an earthly maiden . 
 Another interpretation regards the trio as the three eyes of Shiva . Devasena and Valli are representations of <unk> shakti ( the power of action ) and <unk> @-@ shakti ( will @-@ power ) respectively ; while their Lord Kartikeya is the third eye , the symbol of the transcendental jnana @-@ shakti ( the power of knowledge ) . In Tamil literature , two kinds of love are mentioned : <unk> ( " chastity " ) , love bound in the traditional marriage , represented by Devasena and <unk> , love before marriage , conveyed by Valli . Devasena represents " the conventional , control , ritualized approach to worship " God , while Valli is worship through " ecstasy and self @-@ abandonment " . Devasena is the epitome of chastity and purity . In trinity of gunas , she is the middle guna – Rajas , symbolizing " rulership , fixity , and stability " . Kartikeya is the most superior Sattva ( pure ) , while Valli is the inferior tamas ( dark ) .

 Tirupparankunram Murugan Temple in Tirupparankunram near Madurai is dedicated to Murugan and Devayanai . It is believed that she was married to the god at this location . A festival icon depicts the god seated close to his divine consort . The <unk> temple at <unk> is one of the earliest temples dedicated to the divine couple . 
 Devasena and Valli , the consorts of Murugan , do not have independent temples dedicated to them . Their images are installed in shrines of Murugan , where they flank their Lord on either side . They are worshipped with Murugan and receive offerings as part of his worship ( see Puja ( Hinduism ) ) . A fast is observed on Tuesdays to placate the consort goddesses . Festival icons of Murugan used during temple festival processions generally depict him with his consorts . 
 = Cincinnati chili = 
 Cincinnati chili ( or Cincinnati @-@ style chili ) is a Mediterranean @-@ spiced meat sauce used as a topping for spaghetti ( a " two @-@ way " ) or hot dogs ( " coneys " ) , both dishes developed by Macedonian immigrant restaurateurs in the 1920s . Ingredients include ground beef , stock , tomato paste , cinnamon , other Mediterranean spices and sometimes chocolate in a soup @-@ like consistency . Other toppings include cheese , onions , and beans ; specific combinations of toppings are known as " ways " . The name " Cincinnati chili " is often confusing to those unfamiliar with it , who expect the dish to be similar to chili con carne ; as a result , it is common for those encountering it for the first time to conclude it is a poor example of chili . 
 While served in many local restaurants , it is most often associated with the over 250 " chili parlors " , restaurants specializing in Cincinnati chili , found throughout greater Cincinnati with franchise locations throughout Ohio and in Kentucky , Indiana , and Florida . The dish is the area 's best @-@ known regional food . 
 = = Origins and history = = 
 Cincinnati chili originated with immigrant restaurateurs from the Macedonian region who were trying to expand their customer base by moving beyond narrowly ethnic styles of cuisine . Tom and John <unk> began serving a " stew with traditional Mediterranean spices " as a topping for hot dogs which they called " coneys " in 1922 at their hot dog stand located next to a burlesque theater called the Empress . Tom <unk> used the sauce to modify a traditional Greek dish , speculated to have been <unk> , moussaka or <unk> <unk> to come up with a dish he called chili spaghetti . He first developed a recipe calling for the spaghetti to be cooked in the chili but changed his method in response to customer requests and began serving the sauce as a topping , eventually adding grated cheese as a topping for both the chili spaghetti and the coneys , also in response to customer requests . To make ordering more efficient , the brothers created the " way " system of ordering . The style has since been copied and modified by many other restaurant proprietors , often fellow Greek and Macedonian immigrants who had worked at Empress restaurants before leaving to open their own chili parlors , often following the business model to the point of locating their restaurants adjacent to theaters . 
 Empress was the largest chili parlor chain in Cincinnati until 1949 , when a former Empress employee and Greek immigrant , Nicholas <unk> , started Skyline Chili . In 1965 , four brothers named Daoud , immigrants from Jordan , bought a restaurant called Hamburger Heaven from a former Empress employee , noticed the Cincinnati chili was outselling the hamburgers on their menu , and changed the restaurant 's name to Gold Star Chili . As of 2015 Skyline ( over 130 locations ) and Gold Star ( 89 locations ) were the largest Cincinnati chili parlor chains , while Empress had only two remaining locations , down from over a dozen during the chain 's most successful period . 
 Besides Empress , Skyline , and Gold Star , there are also smaller chains such as Dixie Chili and Deli and numerous independents including the acclaimed Camp Washington Chili , probably the most well @-@ known of the independents . Other independents include Pleasant Ridge Chili , Blue Ash Chili , Park Chili Parlor , Price Hill Chili , and the Blue Jay Restaurant , in all totalling more than 250 chili parlors . In addition to the chili parlors , some version of Cincinnati chili is commonly served at many local restaurants . Arnold 's Bar and Grill , the oldest bar in the city , serves a vegetarian " <unk> <unk> " dish ordered in " ways " . Melt Eclectic Cafe offers a vegan 3 @-@ way . 
 The history of Cincinnati chili shares many factors in common with the apparently independent but simultaneous development of the Coney Island hot dog in other areas of the United States . " Virtually all " were developed by Greek or Macedonian immigrants who passed through Ellis Island as they fled the fallout from the Balkan Wars in the first two decades of the twentieth century . 
 = = Preparation and ordering = = 
 Raw ground beef is crumbled in water and / or stock , tomato paste and seasonings are added , and the mixture is brought to a boil and then simmered for several hours to form a thin meat sauce . Many recipes call for an overnight chill in the refrigerator to allow for easy skimming of fat and to allow flavors to develop , then reheating to serve . Typical proportions are 2 pounds of ground beef to 4 cups of water and 6 oz tomato paste to make 8 servings . 
 = = = The " way " system = = = 
 Ordering Cincinnati chili is based on a specific ingredient series : chili , spaghetti , grated cheddar cheese , diced onions , and kidney beans . The number before the " way " of the chili determines which ingredients are included in each chili order . Customers order a : 
 Two @-@ way : spaghetti topped with chili ( also called " chili spaghetti " ) 
 Three @-@ way : spaghetti , chili , and cheese 
 Four @-@ way : spaghetti , chili , cheese , and onions 
 Four @-@ way bean : spaghetti , chili , cheese , and beans ( beans substituted for the onions ) 
 Five @-@ way : spaghetti , chili , cheese , onions , and beans 
 Some restaurants , among them Skyline and Gold Star , do not use the term " four @-@ way bean " , instead using the term " four @-@ way " to denote a three @-@ way plus the customer 's choice of onions or beans . Some restaurants may add extra ingredients to the " way " system ; for example , Dixie Chili offers a " six @-@ way " , which adds chopped garlic to a five @-@ way . " Ways " are traditionally served in a shallow oval bowl . Cincinnati chili is also used as a hot dog topping to make a " coney " , a regional variation on the Coney Island chili dog , which is topped with grated cheddar cheese to make a " cheese coney " . The standard coney also includes mustard and chopped onion . The " Three @-@ way " and the " Cheese Coney " are the most popular orders and very few customers order a bowl of plain chili . Most chili parlors do not offer plain chili as a regular menu item . Oyster crackers are usually served with Cincinnati chili , and a mild hot sauce such as Tabasco is frequently used as an optional topping .

 The name " Cincinnati chili " is often confusing to those unfamiliar with it because the term " chili " evokes the expectation of chili con carne , which it " bears no resemblance to . " Cincinnati chili is a Mediterranean @-@ spiced meat sauce for spaghetti or hot dogs and is very seldom eaten by the bowl as is typical with chili con carne . It is common for Cincinnatians to describe it starting with , " Well , it 's not really chili ... " Cincinnati chili is always seasoned with cinnamon , usually contains allspice and cloves , and often contains some combination of cumin , paprika , nutmeg , and / or chili pepper . Many copycat recipes call for a small amount of chocolate , but according to Dann <unk> , author of The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili , " There is no chili parlor in Cincinnati that uses chocolate in its chili . " It is normally of a thin consistency , closer to a soup than a stew , and contains no chunks of meat or vegetables , though it is common to find large pieces of cayenne pepper hulls in Empress chili . The consistency , seasonings , and serving method are more similar to pasta sauce or the spiced meat sauces used to top hot dogs in Rochester and other parts of Upstate New York , Rhode Island , and Michigan than they are to chili con carne .

 The Sega Saturn ( <unk> , Sega <unk> ) is a 32 @-@ bit fifth @-@ generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22 , 1994 in Japan , May 11 , 1995 in North America , and July 8 , 1995 in Europe as the successor to the successful Sega Genesis . The Saturn has a dual @-@ CPU architecture and eight processors . Its games are in CD @-@ ROM format , and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original titles . 
 Development of the Saturn began in 1992 , the same year Sega 's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted . Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi , another video display processor was incorporated into the system 's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9 @.@ 26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X @-@ treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance . 
 Although the system is remembered for several well @-@ regarded games , including Nights into Dreams ... , the Panzer Dragoon series , and the Virtua Fighter series , the Saturn 's reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third @-@ party support . Sega 's management has been criticized for its decision @-@ making during the system 's development and cancellation .

 Released in 1988 , the Genesis ( known as the Mega Drive in Europe and Japan ) was Sega 's entry into the fourth generation of video game consoles . In mid @-@ 1990 , Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as president and CEO of Sega of America . Kalinske developed a four @-@ point plan for sales of the Genesis : lower the price of the console , create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market , continue aggressive advertising campaigns , and sell Sonic the Hedgehog with the console . The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan , but all four points were approved by Nakayama , who told Kalinske , " I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas , so go ahead and do it . " Magazines praised Sonic as one of the greatest games yet made , and Sega 's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) decided to purchase a Genesis instead . However , the release of a CD @-@ based add @-@ on for the Genesis , the Sega CD ( known as Mega @-@ CD outside of North America ) , had been commercially disappointing . 
 Sega also experienced success with arcade games . In 1992 and 1993 , the company 's new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased Sega AM2 's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter ( the first 3D fighting game ) , which played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics . In particular , Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three @-@ button control scheme , with the game 's strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two @-@ dimensional competitors . Despite its crude visuals — with characters composed of fewer than 1 @,@ 200 polygons — Virtua Fighter 's fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites . The Model 1 was an expensive system board , and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle . Several alternatives helped to bring Sega 's newest arcade games to the console , such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for Virtua Racing , and eventually the Sega 32X add @-@ on . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Development of the Saturn was supervised by Hideki Sato , Sega 's director and deputy general manager of research and development . According to Sega project manager Hideki Okamura , the Saturn project started over two years before the system was showcased at the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994 . The name " Saturn " was initially the system 's codename during development in Japan , but was eventually chosen as the official product name . In 1993 , Sega and Japanese electronics company Hitachi formed a joint venture to develop a new CPU for the Saturn , which resulted in the creation of the " SuperH RISC Engine " ( or SH @-@ 2 ) later that year . The Saturn was ultimately designed around a dual @-@ SH2 configuration . According to Kazuhiro Hamada , Sega 's section chief for Saturn development during the system 's conception , " the SH @-@ 2 was chosen for reasons of cost and efficiency . The chip has a calculation system similar to a DSP [ digital signal processor ] , but we realized that a single CPU would not be enough to calculate a 3D world . " Although the Saturn 's design was largely finished before the end of 1993 , reports in early 1994 of the technical capabilities of Sony 's upcoming PlayStation console prompted Sega to include another video display processor ( VDP ) to improve the system 's 2D performance and texture @-@ mapping . CD @-@ ROM @-@ based and cartridge @-@ only versions of the Saturn hardware were considered for simultaneous release at one point during the system 's development , but this idea was discarded due to concerns over the lower quality and higher price of cartridge @-@ based games . 
 According to Kalinske , Sega of America " fought against the architecture of Saturn for quite some time " . Seeking an alternative graphics chip for the Saturn , Kalinske attempted to broker a deal with Silicon Graphics , but Sega Enterprises rejected the proposal . Silicon Graphics subsequently collaborated with Nintendo on the Nintendo 64 . Kalinske , Sony Electronic Publishing 's Olaf Olafsson , and Sony America 's Micky <unk> had previously discussed development of a joint " Sega / Sony hardware system " , which never came to fruition due to Sega 's desire to create hardware that could accommodate both 2D and 3D visuals and Sony 's competing notion of focusing entirely on 3D technology . Publicly , Kalinske defended the Saturn 's design : " Our people feel that they need the multiprocessing to be able to bring to the home what we 're doing next year in the arcades . " 
 In 1993 , Sega restructured its internal studios in preparation for the Saturn 's launch . To ensure high @-@ quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn 's life , and to create a more energetic working environment , developers from Sega 's arcade division were instructed to create console games . New teams , such as Panzer Dragoon developer Team Andromeda , were formed during this time . 
 In January 1994 , Sega began to develop an add @-@ on for the Genesis , the Sega 32X , which would serve as a less @-@ expensive entry into the 32 @-@ bit era . The decision to create the add @-@ on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees . According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless , Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega 's hardware sales . As a result , Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch by the end of the year . The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn , but Sega executive Richard <unk> @-@ Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles , and had the same system architecture as the Saturn . This was justified by Sega 's statement that both platforms would run at the same time , and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn . According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller , the 32X served a role in assisting development teams to familiarize themselves with the dual SH @-@ 2 architecture also used in the Saturn . Because both machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same time , tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega Enterprises when the Saturn was given priority .

 Sega released the Saturn in Japan on November 22 , 1994 , at a price of JP ¥ 44 @,@ 800 . Virtua Fighter , a nearly indistinguishable port of the popular arcade game , sold at a nearly one @-@ to @-@ one ratio with the Saturn hardware at launch and was crucial to the system 's early success in Japan . Along with Virtua Fighter , Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon , but the latter was not ready in time . Aside from Virtua Fighter , the only first @-@ party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection . Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter , Sega 's initial shipment of 200 @,@ 000 Saturn units sold out on the first day . Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units ; when both were sold side @-@ by @-@ side , the Saturn proved to be the more popular system . Meanwhile , the 32X was released on November 21 , 1994 in North America , December 3 , 1994 in Japan , and January 1995 in PAL territories , and was sold at less than half of the Saturn 's launch price . After the holiday season , however , interest in the 32X rapidly declined . 500 @,@ 000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1995 ( compared to 300 @,@ 000 PlayStation units ) , and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months . There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell @-@ through rate , and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995 . Sony attracted many third @-@ party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $ 10 licensing fee , excellent development tools , and the introduction of a revolutionary 7- to 10 @-@ day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12 @-@ week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry . 
 In March 1995 , Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be released in the U.S. on " <unk> " ( Saturday ) September 2 , 1995 . However , Sega Enterprises mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation . Therefore , at the first Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) in Los Angeles on May 11 , 1995 , Kalinske gave a keynote presentation for the upcoming Saturn in which he revealed the release price at US $ 399 ( $ 449 including a bundled copy of Virtua Fighter ) , and described the features of the console . Kalinske also revealed that , due to " high consumer demand " , Sega had already shipped 30 @,@ 000 Saturns to Toys " R " Us , Babbage 's , Electronics Boutique , and Software Etc. for immediate release . This announcement upset retailers who were not informed of the surprise release , including Best Buy and Walmart ; KB Toys responded by dropping Sega from its lineup . Sony subsequently unveiled the retail price for the PlayStation : Sony Computer Entertainment America president Steve Race took the stage , said " $ 299 " , and then walked away to applause . The Saturn 's release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date , on July 8 , 1995 , at a price of GB ₤ 399 @.@ 99 . European retailers and press did not have time to promote the system or its games , leading to poor sales . After its European launch on September 29 , by early November 1995 the PlayStation had already outsold the Saturn by a factor of three in the United Kingdom , where it was reported that Sony allocated ₤ 20 million to market the system during the holiday season compared to Sega 's ₤ 4 million . 
 The Saturn 's U.S. launch was accompanied by a reported $ 50 million advertising campaign that included coverage in publications such as Wired and Playboy . Because of the early launch , the Saturn had only six games ( all published by Sega ) available to start as most third @-@ party games were slated to be released around the original launch date . Virtua Fighter 's relative lack of popularity in the West , combined with a release schedule of only two games between the surprise launch and September 1995 , prevented Sega from capitalizing on the Saturn 's early timing . Within two days of its September 9 , 1995 launch in North America , the PlayStation ( backed by a large marketing campaign ) sold more units than the Saturn had in the five months following its surprise launch , with almost all of the initial shipment of 100 @,@ 000 units being presold in advance , and the rest selling @-@ out across the U.S. 
 A high @-@ quality port of the Namco arcade game Ridge Racer contributed to the PlayStation 's early success , and garnered favorable comparisons in the media to the Saturn version of Sega 's Daytona USA , which was considered inferior to its arcade counterpart . Namco , a longtime arcade competitor with Sega , also unveiled the Namco System 11 arcade board , which was based on raw PlayStation hardware . Although the System 11 was technically inferior to Sega 's Model 2 arcade board , its lower price made it an attractive prospect for smaller arcades . Following a 1994 acquisition of Sega developers , Namco released Tekken for the System 11 and PlayStation . Directed by former Virtua Fighter designer Seiichi Ishii , Tekken was intended to be a fundamentally similar title , with the addition of detailed textures and twice the frame rate . Tekken surpassed Virtua Fighter in popularity due to its superior graphics and nearly arcade @-@ perfect console port , becoming the first million @-@ selling PlayStation title . On October 2 , 1995 Sega announced a Saturn price reduction to $ 299 . Moreover , high @-@ quality Saturn ports of the Sega Model 2 arcade hits Sega Rally Championship , Virtua Cop , and Virtua Fighter 2 ( running at 60 frames per second at a high resolution ) were available by the end of the year — and were generally regarded as superior to any competitors on the PlayStation . Notwithstanding a subsequent increase in Saturn sales during the 1995 holiday season , these games were not enough to reverse the PlayStation 's decisive lead . By 1996 , the PlayStation had a considerably larger library than the Saturn , although Sega hoped to generate increased interest in the Saturn with upcoming exclusives such as Nights into Dreams .... Within its first year , the PlayStation secured over 20 % of the entire U.S. video game market . On the first day of the May 1996 E3 show , Sony announced a PlayStation price reduction to $ 199 ; on the second day of the show Sega announced they were matching this price , even though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture . Sony 's price reduction was in turn a reaction to the release of the Model 2 Saturn in Japan at a price roughly equivalent to $ 199 .

 In spite of the launch of the PlayStation and the Saturn , sales of 16 @-@ bit hardware / software continued to account for 64 % of the video game market in 1995 . Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis , and did not have the inventory to meet demand for the product . Sega was able to capture 43 % of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and sell more than 2 million Genesis units in 1995 , but Kalinske estimated that " we could have sold another 300 @,@ 000 Genesis systems in the November / December timeframe . " Nakayama 's decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis , based on the systems ' relative performance in Japan , has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation . 
 Due to long @-@ standing disagreements with Sega Enterprises , Kalinske lost most of his interest in his work as CEO of Sega of America . By the spring of 1996 , rumors were circulating that Kalinske planned to leave Sega , and a July 13 article in the press reported speculation that Sega Enterprises was planning significant changes to Sega of America 's management team . On July 16 , 1996 Sega announced that <unk> Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America , while Kalinske would be leaving Sega after September 30 of that year . A former Honda executive , Irimajiri had been actively involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in 1993 . Sega also announced that David Rosen and Nakayama had resigned from their positions as chairman and co @-@ chairman of Sega of America , though both men remained with the company . Bernie Stolar , a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America , was named Sega of America 's executive vice president in charge of product development and third @-@ party relations . Stolar , who had arranged a six @-@ month PlayStation exclusivity deal for Mortal Kombat 3 and helped build close relations with Electronic Arts while at Sony , was perceived as a major asset by Sega officials . Finally , Sega of America made plans to expand its PC software business . 
 Stolar was not supportive of the Saturn due to his belief that the hardware was poorly designed , and publicly announced at E3 1997 that " The Saturn is not our future . " While Stolar had " no interest in lying to people " about the Saturn 's prospects , he continued to emphasize quality games for the system , and subsequently reflected that " we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer . " At Sony , Stolar opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation titles that he felt would not represent the system well in North America , and he advocated a similar policy for the Saturn during his time at Sega , although he later sought to distance himself from this perception . These changes were accompanied by a softer image that Sega was beginning to portray in its advertising , including removing the " Sega ! " scream and holding press events for the education industry . Marketing for the Saturn in Japan also changed with the introduction of " <unk> <unk> " ( played by Hiroshi Fujioka ) as a character in a series of TV advertisements starting in 1997 ; the character would eventually star in a Saturn video game . 
 Temporarily abandoning arcade development , Sega AM2 head Yu Suzuki began developing several Saturn @-@ exclusive games , including a role @-@ playing game in the Virtua Fighter series . Initially conceived as an obscure prototype called " The Old Man and the Peach Tree " and intended to address the flaws of contemporary Japanese RPGs ( such as poor non @-@ player character artificial intelligence routines ) , Virtua Fighter RPG evolved into a planned 11 @-@ part , 45 @-@ hour " revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema " – which Suzuki hoped would become the Saturn 's killer app . The game was eventually released as Shenmue for the Saturn 's successor , the Dreamcast . 
 = = = Cancellation of Sonic X @-@ treme = = = 
 Sega tasked the U.S.-based Sega Technical Institute ( STI ) with developing what would have been the first fully 3D entry in its popular Sonic the Hedgehog series . The game , known as Sonic X @-@ treme , was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes were discarded . Featuring a fisheye lens camera system that caused levels to rotate with Sonic 's movement , the project was set back after Sonic creator Yuji Naka refused to allow the developers access to the engine he created for Nights into Dreams .... Sega Enterprises executives who visited STI in March 1996 were unimpressed by X @-@ treme 's progress , so Nakayama ordered that the entire game be reworked around the engine created specifically for its boss battles , and employees worked between 16 and 20 hours a day in an attempt to meet their December 1996 deadline . After programmer Ofer Alon quit and designer Chris Senn caught pneumonia , the project was cancelled in early 1997 . Sonic Team started work on an original 3D Sonic title for the Saturn ( which eventually became Sonic Adventure ) , but development was shifted to the Dreamcast . STI was officially disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America . 
 Journalists and fans have speculated about the impact a completed X @-@ treme might have had on the market . David Houghton of GamesRadar described the prospect of " a good 3D Sonic game " on the Saturn as " a ' What if ... ' situation on a par with the dinosaurs not becoming extinct . " IGN 's Tavis Fahs called X @-@ treme " the turning point not only for Sega 's mascot and their 32 @-@ bit console , but for the entire company " , although he also noted that the game served as " an empty vessel for Sega 's ambitions and the hopes of their fans " . Dave Zdyrko , who operated a prominent website for Saturn fans during the system 's lifespan , offered a more nuanced perspective : " I don 't know if [ X @-@ treme ] could 've saved the Saturn , but ... Sonic helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn 't a great new Sonic title ready at or near the launch of the [ Saturn ] " . In a 2007 retrospective , producer Mike Wallis maintained that X @-@ treme " definitely would have been competitive " with Nintendo 's Super Mario 64 . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 From 1993 to early 1996 , although Sega 's revenue declined as part of an industry @-@ wide slowdown , the company retained control of 38 % of the U.S. video game market ( compared to Nintendo 's 30 % and Sony 's 24 % ) . 800 @,@ 000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995 , compared to 400 @,@ 000 Saturn units . In part due to an aggressive price war , the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two @-@ to @-@ one in 1996 , while Sega 's 16 @-@ bit sales declined markedly . By the end of 1996 , the PlayStation had sold 2 @.@ 9 million units in the U.S. , more than twice the 1 @.@ 2 million units sold by the Saturn . After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996 , sales of the Saturn and Sega 's 32 @-@ bit software were sharply reduced , while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three @-@ to @-@ one in the U.S. market in 1997 . The 1997 release of Final Fantasy VII significantly increased the PlayStation 's popularity in Japan . As of August 1997 , Sony controlled 47 % of the console market , Nintendo controlled 40 % , and Sega controlled only 12 % . Neither price cuts nor high @-@ profile game releases were proving helpful to the Saturn 's success . Reflecting decreased demand for the system , worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2 @.@ 35 million to 600 @,@ 000 versus the same period in 1996 ; shipments in North America declined from 800 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 . Due to the Saturn 's poor performance in North America , 60 of Sega of America 's 200 employees were laid off in the fall of 1997 . 
 As a result of the company 's deteriorating financial situation , Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri . Stolar would subsequently accede to president of Sega of America . Following five years of generally declining profits , in the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . Due to a 54 @.@ 8 % decline in consumer product sales ( including a 75 @.@ 4 % decline overseas ) , the company reported a net loss of ¥ 43 @.@ 3 billion ( US $ 327 @.@ 8 million ) and a consolidated net loss of ¥ 35 @.@ 6 billion ( US $ 269 @.@ 8 million ) . Shortly before announcing its financial losses , Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America , with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor . Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 ( Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release ) , compared to 119 in 1996 . The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe . Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast — spread mainly by Sega itself — were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released . The Dreamcast was released on November 27 , 1998 in Japan and on September 9 , 1999 in North America . The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year . Sega suffered an additional ¥ 42 @.@ 881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999 , and the company announced plans to eliminate 1 @,@ 000 jobs , or nearly one @-@ fourth of its workforce . 
 Worldwide Saturn sales include at least the following amounts in each territory : 5 @.@ 75 million in Japan ( surpassing the Genesis ' sales of 3 @.@ 58 million in the country ) , 1 @.@ 8 million in the United States , 1 million in Europe , and 530 @,@ 000 elsewhere . With lifetime sales of 9 @.@ 26 million units , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure , although its install base in Japan surpassed the Nintendo 64 's 5 @.@ 54 million . Lack of distribution has been cited as a significant factor contributing to the Saturn 's failure , as the system 's surprise launch damaged Sega 's reputation with key retailers . Conversely , Nintendo 's long delay in releasing a 3D console and damage caused to Sega 's reputation by poorly supported add @-@ ons for the Genesis are considered major factors allowing Sony to gain a foothold in the market . 
 = = Technical specifications = = 
 Featuring a total of eight processors the Saturn 's main central processing units are two Hitachi SH @-@ 2 microprocessors clocked at 28 @.@ 6 MHz and capable of 56 MIPS . The system contains a Motorola <unk> running at 11 @.@ 3 MHz as a sound controller , a custom sound processor with an integrated Yamaha <unk> DSP running at 22 @.@ 6 MHz capable of up to 32 sound channels with both FM synthesis and 16 @-@ bit PCM sampling at a maximum rate of 44 @.@ 1 kHz , and two video display processors , the <unk> ( which handles sprites , textures and polygons ) and the <unk> ( which handles backgrounds ) . Its double @-@ speed CD @-@ ROM drive is controlled by a dedicated Hitachi SH @-@ 1 processor to reduce load times . The Saturn 's System Control Unit ( SCU ) , which controls all buses and functions as a co @-@ processor of the main SH @-@ 2 CPU , has an internal DSP running at 14 @.@ 3 MHz . The Saturn contains a cartridge slot for memory expansion , 16 Mbit of work random @-@ access memory ( RAM ) , 12 Mbit of video RAM , 4 Mbit of RAM for sound functions , 4 Mbit of CD buffer RAM and 256 Kbit ( 32 KB ) of battery backup RAM . Its video output , provided by a stereo AV cable , displays at resolutions from 320 × 224 to 704 × 224 pixels , and is capable of displaying up to 16 @.@ 77 million colors simultaneously . Physically , the Saturn measures 260 mm × 230 mm × 83 mm ( 10 @.@ 2 in × 9 @.@ 1 in × 3 @.@ 3 in ) . The Saturn was sold packaged with an instruction manual , one control pad , a stereo AV cable , and its <unk> AC power supply , with a power consumption of approximately 15W . 
 The Saturn had technically impressive hardware at the time of its release , but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming . The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time . Making full use of the 4 kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance . For example , Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character , while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects . The Saturn 's Visual Display Processor 2 ( <unk> ) , which can generate and manipulate backgrounds , has also been cited as one of the system 's most important features . 
 The Saturn 's design elicited mixed commentary among game developers and journalists . Developers quoted by Next Generation in December 1995 described the Saturn as " a real coder 's machine " for " those who love to get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware " , with " more flexibility " and " more calculating power than the PlayStation " . The Saturn 's sound board was also widely praised . By contrast , Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation , whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little difference between the two systems . In particular , Dreisbach criticized the Saturn 's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive , in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 . Third @-@ party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools , requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance . During early Saturn development , programming in assembly could offer a two @-@ to @-@ fivefold speed increase over C language . The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate . Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier . Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom @-@ based development firm , Cross Products , to produce the Saturn 's official development system . Despite these challenges , Treasure CEO Masato <unk> stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn . Traveller 's Tales ' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier " to get started on ... you quickly reach [ its ] limits " , whereas the Saturn 's " complicated " hardware had the ability to " improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly . " A major point of criticism was the Saturn 's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space . The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner , but also featured a dedicated " Geometry Transfer Engine " that rendered additional polygons . As a result , several analysts described the Saturn as an " essentially " 2D system . 
 Several models of the Saturn were produced in Japan . An updated model in a recolored light gray ( officially white ) was released in Japan at a price of ¥ 20 @,@ 000 in order to reduce the system 's cost and raise its appeal among women and younger children . Two models were released by third parties : Hitachi released a model known as the Hi @-@ Saturn ( a smaller Saturn model equipped with a car navigation function ) , while JVC released the V @-@ Saturn . Saturn controllers came in various color schemes to match different models of the console . The system also supports several accessories . A wireless controller powered by AA batteries utilizes infrared signal to connect to the Saturn . Designed to work with Nights , the Saturn 3D Pad is a fully functional controller that includes both a control pad and an analog stick for directional input . Sega also released several versions of arcade sticks as peripherals , including the Virtua Stick , the Virtua Stick Pro , the Mission Analog Stick , and the Twin Stick . Sega also created a light gun peripheral known as the " Virtua Gun " for use with shooting games such as Virtua Cop and The Guardian , as well as the Arcade Racer , a wheel for racing games . The Play Cable allows for two Saturn consoles to be connected for multiplayer gaming across two screens , while a multitap allows up to six players to play games on the same console . The Saturn was designed to support up to 12 players on a single console , by using two <unk> . RAM cartridges expand the amount of memory in the system . Other accessories include a keyboard , mouse , floppy disk drive , and movie card . 
 Like the Genesis , the Saturn had an Internet @-@ based gaming service . The Sega NetLink was a <unk> modem that fit into the cartridge slot in the Saturn for direct dial multiplayer . In Japan , a now defunct pay @-@ to @-@ play service was used . It could also be used for web browsing , sending email , and online chat . Because the NetLink was released before the Saturn keyboard , Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses so that Saturn owners could browse with the <unk> . The NetLink functioned with five games : Daytona USA , Duke Nukem 3D , Saturn Bomberman , Sega Rally , and Cyber Troopers Virtual @-@ On : Operation <unk> . Sega allegedly developed a variant of the Saturn featuring a built @-@ in NetLink modem under the code name " Sega Pluto " , but it was never released . 
 Sega developed an arcade board based on the Saturn 's hardware , called the Sega ST @-@ V ( or Titan ) , which was intended as an affordable alternative to Sega 's Model 2 arcade board as well as a testing ground for upcoming Saturn software . The Titan was criticized for its comparatively weak performance by Sega AM2 's Yu Suzuki and was overproduced by Sega 's arcade division . Because Sega already possessed the Die Hard license , members of Sega <unk> working at the Sega Technical Institute developed Die Hard Arcade for the Titan , in order to clear out excess inventory . This goal was achieved , as Die Hard became the most successful Sega arcade game produced in the United States at that point . Other games released for the Titan include Golden Axe : The Duel and Virtua Fighter Kids . 
 = = Game library = = 
 Much of the Saturn 's library comes from Sega 's arcade ports , including Daytona USA , The House of the Dead , Last Bronx , Sega Rally Championship , the Virtua Cop series , the Virtua Fighter series , and Virtual @-@ On . The Saturn ports of 2D Capcom fighting games including Darkstalkers 3 , Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter , and Street Fighter Alpha 3 were noted for their faithfulness to their arcade counterparts . Fighters Megamix , developed by Sega AM2 for the Saturn rather than arcades , combined characters from Fighting Vipers and Virtua Fighter to positive reviews . Highly rated Saturn exclusives include Panzer Dragoon Saga , Dragon Force , Guardian Heroes , Nights , Panzer Dragoon II Zwei , and Shining Force III . Although originally made for the PlayStation , games such as Castlevania : Symphony of the Night , Resident Evil , and Wipeout 2097 received Saturn ports with mixed results . Tomb Raider was created with the Saturn in mind , but the PlayStation version ultimately became better known to the public . Lobotomy Software 's <unk> featured some of the most impressive 3D graphics on the system , leading Sega to contract the developer to produce Saturn ports of Duke Nukem 3D and Quake . While Electronic Arts ' limited support for the Saturn and Sega 's failure to develop a football game for the 1996 fall season allowed Sony to take the lead in the sports genre , " Sega Sports " published Saturn sports games including the well @-@ regarded World Series Baseball and Sega Worldwide Soccer series . With about 600 official releases , the Saturn 's library is nearly twice as large as the Nintendo 64 's . 
 Due to the cancellation of Sonic X @-@ treme , the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer , containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast , the compilation Sonic Jam , and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug ! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn , but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had . Considered one of the most important Saturn releases , Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams ... , a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams . The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp @-@ like androgynous protagonist , Nights , as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each . The levels repeat for as long as an in @-@ game time limit allows , while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points . Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo 's Super Mario 64 , Nights ' emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control . Sonic Team 's Burning Rangers , a fully 3D action @-@ adventure game involving a team of outer @-@ space firefighters , garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction , but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn 's lifespan and criticized for its short length . 
 Some of the games that made the Saturn popular in Japan , such as Grandia and the Sakura Wars series , never saw a Western release due to Sega of America 's policy of not localizing RPGs and other Japanese titles that might have damaged the system 's reputation in North America . Despite appearing first on the Saturn , games such as Dead or Alive , Grandia , and Lunar : Silver Star Story Complete only saw a Western release on the PlayStation . Working Designs localized several Japanese Saturn games before a public feud between Sega of America 's Bernie Stolar and Working Designs president Victor Ireland resulted in the company switching their support to the PlayStation . Panzer Dragoon Saga was praised as perhaps the finest RPG for the system due to its cinematic presentation , evocative plot , and unique battle system — with a tactical emphasis on circling around opponents to identify weak points and the ability to " morph " the physical attributes of the protagonist 's dragon companion during combat — but Sega released fewer than 20 @,@ 000 retail copies of the game in North America in what IGN 's Levi Buchanan characterized as one example of the Saturn 's " ignominious send @-@ off " in the region . Similarly , only the first of three installments of Shining Force III was released outside Japan . The Saturn 's library also garnered criticism for its lack of sequels to high @-@ profile Genesis @-@ era Sega franchises , with Sega Enterprises ' cancellation of a planned third installment in Sega of America 's popular Eternal Champions series cited as a significant source of controversy . 
 Later ports of Saturn games including Guardian Heroes , Nights , and Shin Megami Tensei : Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers continued to garner positive reviews . Partly due to rarity , Saturn titles such as Panzer Dragoon Saga and Radiant Silvergun have been noted for their cult following . Due to the system 's commercial failure and hardware limitations , planned Saturn versions of games such as Resident Evil 2 , Shenmue , Sonic Adventure , and Virtua Fighter 3 were cancelled and moved to the Dreamcast . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 At the time of its release , Famicom Tsūshin awarded the Saturn console 24 out of 40 possible points , higher than the PlayStation 's 19 out of 40 . In June 1995 , Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune and Albert Kim of Entertainment Weekly both praised the Saturn as the most advanced gaming console available , with the former complimenting its double @-@ speed CD @-@ ROM drive and " intense surround @-@ sound capabilities " and the latter citing Panzer Dragoon as a " lyrical and exhilarating epic " demonstrating the ability of new technology to " transform " the industry . In December 1995 , Next Generation evaluated the system with three and a half stars out of a possible five , highlighting Sega 's marketing and arcade background as strengths but the system 's complexity as a weakness . Electronic Gaming Monthly 's December 1996 Buyer 's Guide had four reviewers rate the Saturn 8 , 6 , 7 , and 8 out of 10 ; these ratings were inferior to those of the PlayStation , which was scored 9 , 10 , 9 , and 9 in the same review . By December 1998 , Electronic Gaming Monthly 's reviews were more mixed , with reviewers citing the lack of titles for the system as a major issue . According to EGM reviewer Crispin Boyer , " the Saturn is the only system that can thrill me one month and totally disappoint me the next . " 
 Retrospective feedback of the Saturn is mixed , but generally praises its game library . According to Greg Sewart of 1UP.com , " the Saturn will go down in history as one of the most troubled , and greatest , systems of all time . " In 2009 , IGN chose the Saturn to be their 18th best video game console of all time , praising its unique game library . According to the reviewers , " While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo ... Nights into Dreams , the Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite . " The staff of Edge noted " hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers , Guardian Heroes , Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga . " In 2015 , The Guardian 's Keith Stuart declared " the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history . " Retro Gamer 's Damien McFerran stated " Even today , despite the widespread availability of sequels and re @-@ releases on other formats , the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it . " IGN 's Adam Redsell wrote " [ Sega 's ] devil @-@ may @-@ care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that we simply do not see outside of the indie scene today . " <unk> Games director Brandon Sheffield expounded that " The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too ' adult ' in content for other systems , as it was the only one that allowed an 18 + rating for content in Japan ... some games , like Enemy Zero used it to take body horror to new levels , an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served . " Sewart praised the Saturn 's first @-@ party titles as " Sega 's shining moment as a game developer " , with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports , but also commented on the many Japan @-@ exclusive Saturn releases , which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market . IGN 's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library 's lack of " fresh ideas " and " precious few high @-@ profile franchises " , in contrast to what he described as Sega 's more creative Dreamcast output . 
 Criticism has befallen Sega 's management regarding both the creation and handling of the Saturn . McFerran criticizes Sega 's management at the time of the Saturn 's development , claiming that they had " fallen out of touch with both the demands of the market and the industry " . Bernie Stolar has also been criticized for his decision to end support for the Saturn . According to Fahs , " Stolar 's decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans , but ... it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised . Dreamcast would be Stolar 's redemption . " Stolar has defended his decision , stating , " I felt Saturn was hurting the company more than helping it . That was a battle that we weren 't going to win . " Sheffield stated that the Saturn 's use of quadrilaterals undermined third @-@ party support for the system , but because " <unk> invested in quads " at the same time there is " a remote possibility " they could have " become the standard instead of triangles " — " if somehow , magically , the Saturn were the most popular console of that era . " Speaking more positively of the system , former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as " the start of the future of console gaming " because it " got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel @-@ processing architecture in mind for the first time " . Writing for GamesRadar , Justin Towell noted that the Saturn 's 3D Pad " set the template for every successful controller that followed , with analog shoulder triggers and left thumbstick ... I don 't see any three @-@ pronged controllers around the office these days . " 
 Douglass C. Perry of Gamasutra notes that , from its surprise launch to its ultimate failure , the Saturn " soured many gamers on Sega products . " Sewart and IGN 's Levi Buchanan cited the failure of the Saturn as the major reason for Sega 's downfall as a hardware manufacturer , but USgamer 's Jeremy Parish described the Saturn as " more a symptom ... than a cause " of the company 's decline , which began with add @-@ ons for the Genesis that fragmented the market and continued with Sega of America and Sega Enterprises ' competing designs for the Dreamcast . Sheffield portrayed Sega 's mistakes with the Saturn as emblematic of the broader decline of the Japanese gaming industry : " They thought they were invincible , and that structure and hierarchy were necessary for their survival , but more flexibility , and a greater participation with the West could have saved them . " According to Stuart , Sega " didn 't see ... the roots of a prevailing trend , away from arcade conversions and traditional role @-@ playing adventures and toward a much wider console development community with fresh ideas about gameplay and structure . " <unk> reviews editor Matt Paprocki concluded " the Saturn is a relic , but an important one , which represents the harshness of progress and what it can leave in its wake " . 
 = Yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo = 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchus funereus ) is a large cockatoo native to the south @-@ east of Australia measuring 55 – 65 cm ( 22 – 26 in ) in length . It has a short crest on the top of its head . Its plumage is mostly brownish black and it has prominent yellow cheek patches and a yellow tail band . The body feathers are edged with yellow giving a scalloped appearance . The adult male has a black beak and pinkish @-@ red eye @-@ rings , and the female has a bone @-@ coloured beak and grey eye @-@ rings . In flight , yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos flap deeply and slowly , and with a peculiar heavy fluid motion . Their loud eerie wailing calls carry for long distances . 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is found in forested regions from south and central eastern Queensland to southeastern South Australia including a very small population persisting in the Eyre Peninsula . Two subspecies are recognised , although Tasmanian and southern mainland populations of the southern subspecies xanthanotus may be distinct enough from each other to bring the total to three . Birds of subspecies funereus ( Queensland to eastern Victoria ) have longer wings and tails and darker plumage overall , while those of xanthanotus ( western Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania ) have more prominent scalloping . 
 Unlike other cockatoos , a large proportion of the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo 's diet is made up of wood @-@ boring grubs , and they also eat seeds . They nest in hollows situated high in trees with fairly large diameters , generally Eucalyptus . Although , they remain common throughout much of their range , fragmentation of habitat and loss of large trees suitable for nesting has caused a population decline in Victoria and South Australia . In some places yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos appear to have adapted to humans and they can often be seen in parts of urban Sydney and Melbourne . It is not commonly seen in aviculture , especially outside Australia . Like most parrots , it is protected by CITES , an international agreement , that makes trade , export , and import of listed wild @-@ caught species illegal . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo was first described in 1794 by the English naturalist George Shaw as Psittacus funereus , its specific name funereus relating to its dark and sombre plumage , as if dressed for a funeral . The French zoologist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest reclassified it in the new genus Calyptorhynchus in 1826 . The genus name is derived from the Greek words <unk> ( <unk> ) " hidden " and <unk> ( rhynchos ) " beak " . 
 The ornithologist John Gould knew the bird as the funereal cockatoo . Other common names used include yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo , yellow @-@ eared black cockatoo , and <unk> . Wy @-@ la was an aboriginal term from the Hunter Region of New South Wales , while the Dharawal name from the Illawarra region is <unk> . Scientist and cockatoo authority Matt Cameron has proposed dropping the " black " and shortening the name to " yellow @-@ tailed cockatoo " , explaining that shorter names are more widely accepted . 
 Within the genus , the yellow @-@ tailed and the two Western Australian white @-@ tailed species , the short @-@ billed and long @-@ billed black cockatoo , form the subgenus Zanda . The red @-@ tailed and glossy black cockatoos form the other subgenus , Calyptorhynchus . The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile food begging calls and the degree of sexual dimorphism . Males and females of the latter group have markedly different plumage , whereas those of the former have similar plumage . 
 The three species of the subgenus Zanda have been variously considered as two , then as a single species for many years . In a 1979 paper , Australian ornithologist Denis Saunders highlighted the similarity between the short @-@ billed and the southern race xanthanotus of the yellow @-@ tailed and treated them as a single species with the long @-@ billed as a distinct species . He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions , once by a common ancestor of all three forms ( which became the long @-@ billed black cockatoo ) , and later by what has become the short @-@ billed black cockatoo . However , an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be more closely related to each other than to the yellow @-@ tailed , and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species . 
 Within the species , two subspecies are recognised : 
 C. f. funereus , the nominate form , is known as the eastern yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo . It is found from Berserker Range in central Queensland , south through New South Wales , and into eastern Victoria . It is distinguished by its overall larger size , longer tail and wings , and larger bill and claws . 
 C. f. xanthanotus , known as the southern yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo , is found in western Victoria , southeastern South Australia , the islands of Bass Strait , and Tasmania . Gould described it in 1838 and later changed his spelling to " <unk> " . However , the first name was recognised as taking precedence under ICZN naming rules and its spelling preserved . Saunders reported in 1979 that male birds from Tasmania had wider bills than their mainland relatives , and that Tasmanian female birds were larger than males . However , this observation has yet to be replicated and most authorities only recognize two subspecies . If a third subspecies is recognized , the southern mainland subspecies would be named <unk> , having been named so by Gregory Mathews in 1912 , and the name xanthanotus , originally applied to a Tasmanian specimen , would be restricted to the Tasmanian population . 
 = = Description = = 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is 55 – 65 cm ( 22 – 26 in ) in length and 750 – 900 grams in weight . It has a short mobile crest on the top of its head , and the plumage is mostly brownish @-@ black with paler feather @-@ margins in the neck , nape , and wings , and pale yellow bands in the tail feathers . The tails of birds of subspecies funereus measure around 33 cm ( 13 in ) , with an average tail length 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) longer than xanthanotus . Male funereus birds weigh on average around 731 g ( 1 @.@ 612 lb ) and females weigh about 800 g ( 1 @.@ 8 lb ) . Birds of the xanthanotus race on the mainland average heavier than the Tasmanian birds ; the males on the mainland weigh on average around 630 g and females 637 g ( 1 @.@ 404 lb ) , while those on Tasmania average 583 and 585 g ( 1 @.@ 290 lb ) respectively . Both mainland and Tasmanian birds of the xanthanotus race average about 28 cm ( 11 in ) in tail length . The plumage is a more solid brown @-@ black in the eastern subspecies , while the southern race has more pronounced yellow scalloping on the underparts . 
 The male yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo has a black bill , a dull yellow patch behind each eye , and pinkish or reddish eye @-@ rings . The female has grey eye @-@ rings , a horn @-@ coloured bill , and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek @-@ patches . Immature birds have duller plumage overall , a horn @-@ coloured bill , and grey eye @-@ rings ; The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by two years of age , commencing at the base of the bill and spreading over ten weeks . The lower beak blackens later by four years of age . The elongated bill has a pointed maxilla ( upper beak ) , suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks . Records of the timing of the eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse , but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age . Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds . He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males . Moulting appears to take place in stages over the course of a year , and is poorly understood . 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is distinguished from other dark @-@ plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings , and its contact call . Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding , the red @-@ tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo . Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance ; however , crows have shorter tails , a quicker wing beat , and different calls . 
 An all @-@ yellow bird lacking in black pigment was recorded in Wauchope , New South Wales , in December 1996 , and it remained a part of the local group of cockatoos for four years . Birds with part @-@ yellow plumage have been recorded from different areas in Victoria . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is found up to 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) AMSL over southeastern Australia including the island of Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait ( King , Flinders , Cape Barren islands ) , and also on Kangaroo Island . On Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait it is the only native black @-@ coloured cockatoo . On the mainland , it is found from the vicinity of Gin Gin and Gympie in south and central eastern Queensland , south through New South Wales , where it occurs along the Great Dividing Range and to the coast , and into and across most of Victoria bar the northern and northwestern corner , to the Coorong and Mount Lofty Ranges in southeastern South Australia . A tiny population numbering 30 to 40 birds inhabits the Eyre Peninsula . There they are found in sugar gum ( Eucalyptus <unk> ) woodland in the lower peninsula and migrate to the mallee areas in the northern peninsula after breeding . There is evidence that birds on the New South Wales south coast move from elevated areas to lower lying areas towards the coast in winter . They are generally common or locally very common in a wide range of habits , although they tend to be locally rare at the limits of their range . Their breeding range is restricted to areas with large old trees . 
 The birds may be found in a variety of habitats including grassy woodland , riparian forest , heathland , subalpine areas , pine plantations , and occasionally in urban areas , as long as there is a plentiful food supply . They have also spread to parts of suburban Sydney , particularly on or near golf courses , pine plantations and parks , such as Centennial Park in the eastern suburbs . It is unclear whether this is adaptive or because of loss of habitat elsewhere . In urban Melbourne , they have been recorded at Yarra Bend Park . The so @-@ called " Black Saturday bushfires " in 2009 appear to have caused sufficient loss of their natural habitat for them to have been sighted in other parts if the urban areas of Melbourne as well . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos are diurnal , raucous and noisy , and are often heard before being seen . They make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other , and they are often seen flying high overhead in pairs , or trios comprising a pair and their young , or small groups . Outside of the breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more , while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained . They are generally wary birds , although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas . They generally keep to trees , only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or banksia cones or to drink . Flight is fluid and has been described as " lazy " , with deep , slow wingbeats . 
 Tall eucalypts that are emergent over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites . It is here that the cockatoos rest for the night , and also rest to shelter from the heat of the day . They often socialise before dusk , engaging in preening , feeding young , and flying acrobatically . Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather . 
 The usual call is an eerie high @-@ pitched wailing contact call , kee @-@ ow ... kee @-@ ow ... kee @-@ ow , made while flying or roosting , and can be heard from afar . Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call . They also make a soft , chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae . Adults are normally quiet when feeding , while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls . The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo 's contact call with some success . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The diet of the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution , which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat . Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees , particularly she @-@ oaks ( Allocasuarina and Casuarina , including A. torulosa and A. verticillata ) , but also Eucalyptus ( including E. maculata flowers and E. nitida seeds ) , Acacia ( including gum exudate and galls ) , Banksia ( including the green seed pods and seeds of B. serrata , B. integrifolia , and B. marginata ) , and Hakea species ( including H. <unk> , H. rugosa , H. nodosa , H. sericea , H. <unk> , and H. dactyloides ) . They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata and to other introduced trees , including Cupressus torulosa , Betula pendula and the buds of elm Ulmus species . In the Eyre Peninsula , the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis ) , alongside native species . 
 The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is very fond of the larvae of tree @-@ boring beetles , such as the longhorn beetle <unk> <unk> , and cossid moth <unk> <unk> . Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July , when the moth caterpillars are largest , and they are accompanied by their just fledged young . They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae . If successful , they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae , which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood . 
 A yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo was observed stripping 4 cm × 2 cm ( 1 @.@ 57 in × 0 @.@ 79 in ) pieces of bark off the trunk of a dead Leptospermum tree in Acacia <unk> swamp near <unk> in northwestern Tasmania . It then scraped a layer of white material about 0 @.@ 5 mm thick from the inner surface with its beak . This white layer turned out to be <unk> fungi and slime mould that grew in the cambium of the bark . 
 Yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos have been reported flocking to Banksia cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open . With pine trees , they prefer green cones , nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot , then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed . A cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone . 
 They drink at various places , from stock troughs to puddles , and do so in the early morning or late in the afternoon . Insect larvae and Fabaceae seeds are among food reported to have been fed to young . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The breeding season varies according to latitude , taking place from April to July in Queensland , January to May in northern New South Wales , December to February in southern New South Wales , and October to February in Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania . The male yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage . Softly growling , he approaches the female and bows three or four times to her . His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink . Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees , generally eucalypts , which are either living or dead . Isolated trees are generally chosen , so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered . The same tree may be used for many years . A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years . The authors noted that the proposed 80 – 150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees . 
 Hollows can be 1 to 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 3 to 6 @.@ 6 ft ) deep and 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 – 19 @.@ 7 in ) wide , with a base of woodchips . A chance felling of a eucalypt known to have been used as a nesting tree near Scottsdale in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made , yielding a hollow measuring 56 cm ( 22 in ) high by 30 cm ( 12 in ) wide at the mouth , and at least 65 cm ( 26 in ) deep , in a tree which measured 72 cm ( 28 in ) in diameter below the hollow . Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding , which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs . Gum leaves are occasionally added as well . The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule . The first egg averages around 47 or 48 mm long and 37 mm in diameter ( 2 × 1 @.@ 4 in ) . The second egg is around 2 mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later . The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying . She enters the hollow feet first , and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day . Later both parents help to raise the chicks . The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy . Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking ; however , the incubation period in captivity is 28 – 31 days . Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging . Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching , and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season . 
 Like other cockatoos , this species is long @-@ lived . A pair of yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo stopped breeding when they were 41 and 37 years of age , but still showed signs of close bonding . Birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age ; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity . 
 = = = Parasites = = = 
 In 2004 , a captive yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo and two free @-@ living tawny <unk> ( Podargus strigoides ) suffering neurological symptoms were shown to be hosting the rat nematode <unk> <unk> . They were the first non @-@ mammalian hosts discovered for the organism . A species of feather mite , <unk> <unk> , has also been isolated from the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo , its only host to date . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 Yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos can cause damage in pine and eucalyptus plantations by weakening stems through gouging out pieces of wood to extract moth larvae . In places with these gum plantations , the population of the larva of the cossid moth <unk> <unk> grows , which then leads to increased predation ( and hence tree damage ) by cockatoos . Furthermore , plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees . Yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s because of this . The yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is promoted by the Shoalhaven City Council local government on the NSW south coast as the region 's bird . Within the Jervis bay area the birds can be seen feasting on the many casuarina trees native to the area . 
 Although it is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , and not listed nationally as threatened , the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia . This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows , although birds have become more plentiful in the vicinity of pine plantations . It has been listed as vulnerable in South Australia , due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges , and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula , which has declined sharply since European settlement , probably from loss of suitable habitat . A recovery program was commenced in 1998 . Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland , planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa , monitoring breeding , and raising chicks in captivity . As a result , the population has increased from a low of 19 – 21 individuals in 1998 . 
 This species was seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s , after which time a large number of wild @-@ caught birds entered the Australian market . Since then , it has become more common , but is still rarely seen outside Australia . Captive yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health . There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos , and low protein has been linked with the production of <unk> eggs in captivity . Females in particular enjoy mealworms . They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots , but do not handle disturbance while breeding . As with other black cockatoos , yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos , since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959 , but birds seized by government agencies in Germany , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria ( EAZA ) . In 2000 , there were pairs of yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam . Like most species of parrots , the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species , which makes the import , export , and trade of listed wild @-@ caught animals illegal . 
 = The Halo Graphic Novel = 
 The Halo Graphic Novel is the first graphic novel adaptation of the military science fiction video game Halo , published by Marvel Comics in partnership with Bungie . The Halo series began with the award @-@ winning popular video game Halo : Combat Evolved , which spawned several books as well as video game sequels , and is focused on the story of future humanity fighting against a powerful collective of races called the Covenant . The Halo Graphic Novel is the series ' first entry into the sequential art medium , and features aspects of the Halo universe which until then had not been discussed or seen in any medium . 
 The majority of the book is divided into four short stories by different writers and artists from the computer game and comic industries . Each story focuses on different aspects of the Halo universe , revealing stories that are tangential to the main plot of the game . Apart from the stories , the book also contains an extensive art gallery compiled of contributions from Bungie , Marvel and independent sources . 
 Released on July 19 , 2006 , The Halo Graphic Novel was well @-@ received , with reviewers noting the cohesiveness of the work as a whole , as well as the diversity of the individual material . The success of the novel led to Marvel announcing a new limited comic series , which became known as Halo : Uprising . 
 = = Background and publication = = 
 Bungie Studios ' and Microsoft 's original concept of the graphic novel was to bring the Halo series into new media beyond that of video games , with sequential art being the main focus . The comic was originally pitched by the head of Microsoft 's Franchise Development Eric Trautmann , who led the assembly of a draft comic written by John Ney Rieber and illustrated by Adi Granov . However , Lorraine McLees , the art director of Bungie , disliked the comic , calling it " a lump of coal " . Bungie also disliked Trautmann 's comic team and requested to be able to choose their own artists and writers instead . Pete Parsons , the studio director of Bungie , wanted to hire Alan Moore and Joe Kubert for the graphic novel , though Trautmann was highly skeptical that such high profile artists would deign to the project . 
 After many unsuccessful negotiation attempts , Lorraine suggested that Bungie Studios finance and edit the novel itself before pursuing a publisher , allowing the studio to maintain control over the content and pursue the venture unencumbered by outside intervention . Lead designer Maria <unk> created a " dream team " roster of writers and artists Bungie admired , and through a period of negotiation Bungie was able to gain contributions from many of those named on the list . Buoyed by their success in approaching those in the medium that they respected and admired , including British comic book artist Simon Bisley and French artist Jean " Moebius " Giraud , the progress of Halo Graphic Novel was described as a " cool morale boost for our team to see their universe , their characters , realized by people that we idolize in the comic industry . " 
 The novel was completed after a two @-@ year development cycle and Bungie sought out a publisher , eventually approaching Marvel Comics . Bungie cited Marvel 's " passion for Halo " and " reach in the comic and publishing industry " as the main draws to the company . The studio worked alongside Marvel director of development Ruwan Jayatilleke , an early champion of the project , to assist in the distribution and publication of the novel . 
 The stories themselves were designed as glimpses into the Halo universe , including information on the inner workings of the alien Covenant , as well as details regarding elements of the back @-@ story that were hitherto undisclosed . Jarrard explained that " The stories that happen off camera , the parallel events to the arcs that our fans know from the existing mediums , are the stories we really wanted to tell . " Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the Master Chief , the central character of the franchise , and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe , such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity 's struggle for survival ; themes that extended beyond " ... a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt . " The four stories that ended up in the final publication were " the most interesting to [ Bungie ] , and the writers of [ the novel ] " . Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the Halo Graphic Novel , the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice . Artist Simon Bisley said that " the stress was to make the characters look very much as they do in the game . Beyond that point I was given free rein to interpret the script and the action " based on what was given to the artists and writers . 
 = = = Supplemental = = = 
 Located after the main body of stories is a selection of art pieces that represent interpretations of the Halo universe from a number of comic book artists . These contributors include Doug Alexander , Rick Berry , Geof Darrow , and more than twenty @-@ five others , both freelance and from Bungie Studios — including lead composer Martin O 'Donnell . 
 A few promotional pieces were created before the Halo Graphic Novel 's release date , including a sixteen @-@ page preview , released May 31 , 2006 , which contained Bungie 's introductions to each story along with short excerpts of each story . A full @-@ color poster of the book 's cover was released on June 28 , 2006 . 
 = = Stories = = 
 The novel is split into four stories ; each has an introduction by the creators of the work detailing their thoughts about the plot or their experiences adding to the Halo lore . 
 = = = The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor = = = 
 " The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor " takes place during and after the sixth mission of the video game Halo : Combat Evolved . During the game , players discover that the ringworld on which they are trapped , dubbed " Halo " by the enemy alien collective the Covenant , is in fact a super weapon designed to wipe out all life in the galaxy to deprive an intergalactic parasite known as the Flood of their food source ( their food source being all sentient life in the galaxy ) . The Flood are accidentally released by the Covenant from stasis and begins to spread across the ring . Halo was built by an ancient alien race known as the Forerunners to contain and study the Flood , but also as a weapon of last resort ; faced with the prospect of the Flood consuming every thinking being in the universe , the Forerunners activated Halo , destroying themselves but also starving the Flood . 
 In contrast to the player 's point of view in the game , " The Last Voyage " focuses on the Covenant . In Halo : Combat Evolved 's sequel Halo 2 , players experience some of the plot through the eyes of the Arbiter , a Covenant warrior . The Arbiter is aided by a fellow Covenant Elite who is never named in the game itself ; fans called the character " Half @-@ Jaw " due to the Elite missing his mandibles on one side of his face . " The Last Voyage " names the Elite Rtas ' Vadumee , explains his injury , and describes events during Halo that the player did not see . 
 In " The Last Voyage " , Elite Special Operations Commander Rtas ' Vadumee and his team respond to a distress call and board the crippled supply craft Infinite Succor , which the Covenant believe has been attacked by humans . The only crew member still alive , a Covenant Prophet , tells ' Vadumee that the Succor has been infested by the Flood , which escaped Halo on a Covenant dropship and crash landed in the Succor 's hangar . Currently stuck on the ship , the parasite intends to activate the Succor 's slipspace drive to escape the star system and find new planets to infect . Fighting waves of Flood , including the reanimated remains of his fallen soldiers , ' Vadumee plots a slipspace course that will destroy both the Succor and the Flood , then escapes via a Covenant shuttle . 
 The central premise behind the story of " The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor " was to showcase both the true danger posed by the Flood and the inner workings of the Covenant military machine , to dispel the image that the Covenant " simply stand around waiting for the Chief to blast them " . The story was written by Lee Hammock with art provided by Simon Bisley . Hammock described the process of writing the story as a " heady task " since he had to respect Halo fans ' knowledge of the characters and canon , ensuring that " characters that [ the fans ] know as a part of themselves are portrayed aptly " . These difficulties were mitigated by the knowledge that fans were not as intimately connected to the history of the character of Rtas as they were to the likes of the Master Chief ; this allowed ample room to expand ' Vadumee 's background in sync with the Halo canon while permitting the writer to " bring something new to the table " . 
 = = = Armor Testing = = = 
 In the Halo universe , Earth and humanity 's various colonies are governed by the United Nations Space Command . Faced with the technological superiority of the Covenant , humanity 's chief hope is the tenacity of the SPARTANs , elite supersoldiers equipped with special armor . The protagonist of the Halo series , the Master Chief , is one of the few SPARTANs in active service by the events of Halo : Combat Evolved . " Armor Testing " takes place shortly before the opening of Halo 2 , as the UNSC field @-@ tests a new version of the SPARTAN 's armor in a series of exercises which prove to be a challenging endeavor for all involved . A lone SPARTAN puts the armor through its paces by dropping from Earth 's atmosphere and engaging in a mock battle against UNSC special forces . This SPARTAN is revealed to be a woman , Maria @-@ 062 , who has come out of retirement as a special favor to test the new equipment before it is sent to the Master Chief . 
 The concept of the story was inspired by the book Skunkworks , a memoir of the testing of military projects at Lockheed ; highlighting the rigorous experimentation the SPARTAN equipment goes through before it ends up in the hands of the Master Chief was an idea that Bungie originally wanted to pursue at the beginning of Halo 2 . Bungie instead opted to communicate this background information at a later time . " Armor Testing " was written by Jay Faerber with pencils by W. Andrew Robinson and colors by Ed Lee . 
 = = = Breaking Quarantine = = = 
 Like " The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor " , " Breaking Quarantine " deals with the Flood outbreak that occurs during Halo . While " The Last Voyage " tells the story from the Covenant perspective , " Breaking Quarantine " highlights the escape of the human soldier Sgt. Johnson from the Flood . Johnson is a minor personality in Halo : Combat Evolved who becomes an important character in the following two games ; while the novel Halo : First Strike explains that Johnson resists Flood infestation due to a medical condition , no other story up to that point explained how Johnson escapes . " Breaking Quarantine " is an example of Bungie 's attempts to expand the story arcs of secondary characters that would have no opportunity to go explained in the main storyline . Unlike the other stories , " Breaking Quarantine " contains no dialogue , only weapon sound effects , which are rendered in Japanese . Both art and story were provided by Tsutomu Nihei , a manga artist and architect who based his illustrations directly on the structures found within the game . 
 = = = Second Sunrise over New Mombasa = = = 
 Near the beginning of Halo 2 , the Covenant stumble upon humanity 's best @-@ guarded secret — the location of Earth — and launch a direct attack on the city of New Mombasa , Kenya . By the time players arrive at the city in Halo 2 , it is deserted ; " Second Sunrise " , which takes place during the attack , explains that this was not always the case . The story is told through the eyes of a reporter who creates propaganda for the UNSC . When the Covenant invade the city , the reporter and fellow citizens take to its defense , until they are forced to flee as the city faces ruin . 
 Bungie described " Second Sunrise " as an attempt to put a human face on the conflict by illustrating the effects of war on the common citizen . The story was written by Brett Lewis with art provided by Jean " Moebius " Giraud . Giraud explained that his son 's enjoyment of the game series ultimately compelled him to accept an invitation to contribute his art ; before writing , he had never played the video games . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Critical reaction from both the gaming community and the comic book community was positive . UGO Networks praised the novel , citing the wealth of contributions from recognized artists and the strength of the material in fleshing out the Halo universe as the work 's greatest strength . They gave it an overall grade of B + . Mike Deeley of Comics Bulletin lauded the book for the diverse range of storytelling and art styles that lent the Halo Graphic Novel the feel of an anthology yet still retained a cohesive whole . Other areas that received particular attention included Tsutomu Nihei 's work on Breaking Quarantine for its vivid imagery and its focus on visual storytelling in lieu of any dialogue . 
 Some reviewers expressed their disappointment at the novel 's focus on minor characters and events , with the presence of the Master Chief — the central character of the Halo series and its most iconic figure — limited to featuring in artwork and a brief appearance in the first story . On the other hand , GameTrailers praised Bungie for having the moxie to not focus on the major character . Each publication had their own opinions on the weakest story in the collection ; both IGN and GameTrailers thought that " Armor Testing " had the least emotional impact , although its surprise ending and art were well done . 
 Upon release , the Halo Graphic Novel proved to be a " rare hit " for the games @-@ to @-@ comics genre , debuting at No. 2 on both the Nielsen BookScan and Diamond sales charts . At least 100 @,@ 000 copies were rumored to have been published , and the comic continued to be one of the top @-@ selling graphic novels months after its debut . The success of the novel led Marvel Comics and Bungie Studios to announce a four @-@ issue monthly Halo comic series at San Diego Comic @-@ Con 2006 called Halo : Uprising . Despite delays , the first issue of the limited series was released on August 22 , 2007 . 
 = Labyrinth : The Computer Game = 
 Labyrinth : The Computer Game is a 1986 graphic adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games and published by Activision . Based on the fantasy film Labyrinth , it tasks the player with navigating a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers . The player 's goal is to find and defeat the main antagonist , Jareth , within 13 real @-@ time hours . Unlike other adventure games of the period , Labyrinth does not feature a command @-@ line interface . Instead , the player uses two scrolling " word wheel " menus on the screen to construct basic sentences . 
 Labyrinth was the first adventure game created by Lucasfilm . The project was led by designer David Fox , who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text @-@ based adventure games . Early in development , the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week @-@ long series of brainstorming sessions , which inspired much of the final product . Labyrinth received positive reviews and , in the United States , was a bigger commercial success than the film upon which it was based . Its design influenced Lucasfilm 's subsequent adventure title , the critically acclaimed Maniac Mansion . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Labyrinth : The Computer Game is a graphic adventure game in which the player maneuvers a character through a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers . It is an adaptation of the 1986 film Labyrinth , many of whose events and characters are reproduced in the game . However , it does not follow the plot of the film . At the beginning , the player enters their name , sex and favorite color : the last two fields determine the appearance of the player character . Afterward , a short text @-@ based adventure sequence unfolds , wherein the player enters a movie theater to watch the film Labyrinth . The game then changes to a graphic adventure format . Jareth , the main antagonist , appears on the projection screen and transports the protagonist to a labyrinthine prison . 
 The player 's goal is to locate and destroy Jareth within 13 real @-@ time hours ; otherwise , the protagonist will be trapped in the maze forever . While traveling the maze , the player passes through a series of scrolling hallways that contain doors , enemies and other things . A " radar " bar on the screen allows the player to see each hallway in miniature form : the locations of all doorways , items and characters in a given hallway are displayed . Unlike other adventure games of the period , Labyrinth does not feature a command @-@ line interface .

 Lucasfilm Games began to design Labyrinth : The Computer Game in 1985 . Company head George Lucas had requested a tie @-@ in video game for the movie of the same name , which was under production at Lucasfilm . As was common with Lucasfilm Games projects , Lucas himself provided very little direction to the team . Labyrinth was the first licensed game developed by the company : earlier products , such as Rescue on <unk> ! and The Eidolon , had been original intellectual properties . According to project leader David Fox , working with a license " frees you up in some ways and restricts you , too " . With their adaptation , the team was not pressured to reuse events and characters from the Labyrinth film ; but they " felt obligated " to follow the source material . Because they saw the film as an adventure story , they chose to set their adaptation in the adventure game genre . However , Fox disliked the genre 's then @-@ reliance on text parsers and syntax guessing , and so he created the word wheel menus as a replacement . They were meant to supply " a limited set of words that still let you do a lot of things " , in order to streamline the game without hampering the player 's freedom . The game 's visual design was shared by Lucasfilm 's Habitat , a massively multiplayer online game under production at the time . 
 Early in development , the game 's team was screened a rough cut of the film . Afterward , they were sent to London by Lucasfilm management for a one @-@ week brainstorming session with Douglas Adams , author of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . Adams had worked previously with <unk> , during the development of his book 's 1984 video game adaptation . Also present at the meetings were writer Christopher Cerf ( a friend of the film 's director , Jim Henson ) and Brenda Laurel of Activision , the game 's publisher . The team worked extensively with Adams during this period . Laurel later wrote , " Every day a fresh blast of his wild and intelligent humor stoked up the creativity of the team . " In her view , the pinnacle of the meetings was Adams ' idea for the opening sequence . He suggested a reference to The Wizard of Oz 's famous transition from black @-@ and @-@ white to color : a transition from a text @-@ based format to a graphical one . 
 Fox was given the job of taking notes during the trip . Although he had hoped for a complete design to emerge from the meetings , he returned from London with only " sheets and sheets of ideas " , through which he sifted to find usable concepts . However , all of the material influenced the game , and many of Adams ' suggestions were used . Retrospectively , Fox felt that the opening sequence was a mistake : he called it " tedious " and believed that it alienated potential fans . Labyrinth was released in 1986 for the Commodore 64 , Apple II and MSX .

 In the United States , Labyrinth was more commercially successful than the film upon which it was based . Commodore Magazine 's Mark <unk> lauded the game 's puzzle design , detailed graphics and newcomer @-@ friendly interface . He believed that experienced players would enjoy its depth and challenging puzzles . Keith Campbell of Commodore User praised its animation and dubbed it " a superb game " — which he found unusual , given its status as a tie @-@ in product . However , Campbell hesitated to call it an adventure game , and he wrote that the word wheels were " rather tedious " for genre veterans . Roy Wagner of Computer Gaming World summarized Labyrinth as a " very well done [ game ] with an excellent user interface " . 
 Writing for Computer & Video Games , Matthew Woodley praised the game 's variety and interface . While he disliked its long loading times , he believed that they were " a small price to pay for such a brilliant game " . However , Labyrinth was criticized by the three reviewers of Zzap ! 64 . Although he praised its visuals , co @-@ reviewer Paul Sumner called the game too slow @-@ paced for an action title and too simplistic for an adventure . Co @-@ reviewer Julian Rignall considered it to be boring and " a real disappointment " , given Lucasfilm 's strong track record . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Labyrinth was the first adventure game produced by Lucasfilm , which became a critically acclaimed and commercially successful developer in the genre . The game 's technology and mechanics influenced the company 's subsequent title Maniac Mansion , whose " SCUMM " engine was reused in many Lucasfilm adventure games . The word wheels were a predecessor to that game 's point @-@ and @-@ click interface . Gary Winnick , an artist for Labyrinth , went on to lead the production of Maniac Mansion with Ron Gilbert . Fox contributed to Maniac Mansion as well , and he later directed Lucasfilm 's Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders . Retrospectively , writers for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation regarded Labyrinth as a solid first attempt , but as inferior to " the real classics " made afterward by Lucasfilm .

 The George Gordon Meade Memorial , also known as the Meade Memorial or Major General George Gordon Meade , is a public artwork in Washington , D.C. honoring George Meade , a career military officer from Pennsylvania who is best known for defeating General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg . The monument is sited on the 300 block of Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse . It was originally located at Union Square , but was removed and placed in storage for fourteen years before being installed at its current location . The statue was sculpted by Charles Grafly , an educator and founder of the National Sculpture Society , and was a gift from the state of Pennsylvania . Prominent attendees at the dedication ceremony in 1927 included President Calvin Coolidge , Governor John <unk> Fisher , Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon , and Senator Simeon D. Fess . 
 The memorial is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington , D.C. , which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 . The marble and granite sculpture , which includes depictions of Meade and seven allegorical figures , rests on a granite base and granite platform . It is surrounded by a public plaza and small park . The monument is owned and maintained by the National Park Service , a federal agency of the Interior Department .

 = = = Background = = = 
 George Meade ( 1815 – 1872 ) was a career military officer from Pennsylvania who is best known for his role as a Union general during the Civil War . He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1835 and briefly served in the Army during the Second Seminole War . He began working as a civil engineer for railroad companies and the Department of War until reenlisting in the army in 1842 . Meade fought in the Mexican – American War and was promoted to first lieutenant for his heroic actions at the Battle of Monterrey . From the 1850s until the onset of the Civil War in 1861 , Meade was involved in coastal surveying and designing lighthouses , mainly for the Corps of Topographical Engineers . He was promoted to brigadier general at the beginning of war , but was badly wounded at the Battle of Glendale in 1862 . He recovered and led forces during major battles , including Antietam and Fredericksburg . In June 1863 , Meade succeeded in defeating General Joseph Hooker as commanding officer of the Army of the Potomac , and fought his greatest battle only days later at Gettysburg , the bloodiest battle of the war . He succeeding in defeating General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate forces , but was criticized by President Abraham Lincoln for allowing Confederate forces to retreat to Virginia . Meade continued to serve as the Army of the Potomac 's commanding officer until the end of the war , though Ulysses S. Grant was appointed general @-@ in @-@ chief of all Union armies , superseding Meade 's authority . 
 Unlike many Civil War generals , there were no calls for a memorial to Meade after his death in 1872 because he was not popular with Lincoln , Grant , or his fellow officers , though he was considered a hero in his native Pennsylvania . In the 1910s , members of the Grand Army of the Republic ( GAR ) and Society of the Army of the Potomac fraternal organizations lobbied the Pennsylvania General Assembly to fund a statue of Meade . The state assembly commissioned the sculpture on October 18 , 1913 , and appropriated $ 200 @,@ 000 for its construction . Members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation lobbied Congress to approve the sculpture and an act of Congress authorized its erection on January 21 , 1915 . Congress mandated that the sculpture design and site of the memorial be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts ( CFA ) . Because the memorial was a gift from the state of Pennsylvania , a Meade Memorial Commission was appointed by the state governor . The commission , led by John W. Frazier , a veteran who fought with Meade at Gettysburg , was composed of architects , artists , and planners who agreed on very little . Frazier was considered abusive and tactless , sending rude letters to the CFA and demanding certain requirements for the memorial . This created an impasse which lasted until Frazier 's death in 1918 . Following his death , the memorial commission finally chose a sculptor , a Pennsylvania native named Charles Grafly ( 1862 – 1929 ) . 
 Grafly was a founder of the National Sculpture Society and longtime educator at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts who was best known for his portrait busts . Although Grafly was at the peak of his career , the CGA was hesitant in approving him to design the sculpture because his symbolic works has been criticized for being incomprehensible . The CFA finally agreed to consider Grafly and following several months of negotiations and changes , a preliminary sculpture design was approved in August 1918 . Grafly received $ 85 @,@ 000 for his commission . Several years of bickering about the final design and location of the memorial passed until March 28 , 1922 , when an official groundbreaking ceremony took place . The chosen site was near 3rd Street NW in Union Square , a public park on Capitol Hill , and close to the large Ulysses S. Grant Memorial . Before the memorial was installed , the last of the old Botanic Garden greenhouses were demolished and the Bartholdi Fountain was moved to make way . The architects chosen to design the memorial were Grant Simon and Edward P. Simon of Philadelphia . Piccirilli Brothers carved the memorial and the project contractor was the George A. Fuller Company . The total cost of the memorial and its installation was $ 400 @,@ 000 .

 The memorial was formally dedicated on October 19 , 1927 , becoming one of the last Civil War monuments erected in Washington , D.C. By the time of the dedication , many of the GAR and Society of the Army of the Potomac members who championed the memorial had died and only a few Civil War veterans were able to attend the ceremony . Prominent attendees at the ceremony included President Calvin Coolidge , his wife , Grace , Pennsylvania Governor John <unk> Fisher , Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur , Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon , Secretary of Labor James J. Davis , and Senator Simeon D. Fess , the acting chairman of the memorial commission . White , temporary pavilions adorned with greenery , national shields , and the coat of arms of Pennsylvania were built around the memorial for invited guests and members of the public . The speaker 's stand was decorated with palms , ferns , and autumn @-@ colored flowers . On either side of the memorial was the national flag ; the left flag from the Civil War era had 35 stars and the right flag was the current 48 @-@ starred flag . 
 <unk> Presbyterian Church minister Hugh K. Fulton gave the invocation and Reverend J. H. Pershing led the dedicatory prayer . A speech detailing Meade 's life and career was given by Fisher which was followed by the unveiling of the memorial by Meade 's daughter , Henrietta , who was escorted by Ulysses S. Grant III . As the memorial was unveiled , a flock of pigeons , symbolizing peace , was released from an altar bearing the Army of the Potomac 's emblem . The Army Band played " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " as Army cannons were fired . Fisher presented the memorial on behalf of the state of Pennsylvania to Coolidge on behalf of the American people . Coolidge 's remarks including the following : " On behalf of the Government of the Nation which he helped to save , I accept this memorial erected by the Commonwealth which has his own home and the home of his ancestors . The conflict in which he took such an important part has long since passed away . The peace which he loved has come . The reconciliation which he sought is complete . The loyalty to the flag which he followed is universal . Through all of this shines his own immortal flame . " An elderly veteran who fought at Gettysburg collapsed as he was giving a speech recounting his experience during the battle . Blanton Winship , at the time the president 's chief military aid , and James F. <unk> , the president 's physician , came to his aid . He was able to finish his speech and the crowds cheered him . The ceremony concluded with the band playing " Taps " .

 In 1969 , the memorial was dismantled and placed in a storage facility at 42nd Street and Hunt Place NE when the Capitol Reflecting Pool was built atop Interstate 395 's Third Street Tunnel . It remained in storage for several years and members of the public began inquiring why the memorial had not been replaced . Pennsylvania Representative William F. <unk> contacted the memorial coordinator for the National Capital Region of the National Park Service ( NPS ) while members of the Gettysburg Civil War Round Table ( <unk> ) contacted Jeff Wolf to repair the sculpture , which had cracked in several places . The <unk> also contacted Maryland Representative Marjorie Holt who had requested the memorial be placed in her congressional district at Fort George G. Meade . The memorial was repaired and in 1983 placed in a new plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue NW . A formal rededication took place on October 3 , 1984 . 
 The memorial is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington , D.C. , which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 20 , 1978 , and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3 , 1979 .

 May Fung Yee Pang ( born October 24 , 1950 ) is an American , best known as the former girlfriend of John Lennon . She had previously worked as a personal assistant and production coordinator for Lennon and his wife , Yoko Ono . 
 In 1973 , when Lennon and Ono separated , Pang and Lennon had a relationship lasting over 18 months , during a time which Lennon later referred to as his " Lost Weekend . " Pang subsequently produced two books about their relationship : a memoir called Loving John ( Warner , 1983 ) and a book of photographs , Instamatic Karma ( St. Martin 's Press , 2008 ) . 
 Pang was married to producer Tony Visconti from 1989 to 2000 and had two children , Sebastian and Lara . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Pang was born in Manhattan . She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants and grew up in New York 's Spanish Harlem with an elder sister and an adopted brother ( both of whom were born in China ) . Pang 's mother had a laundry business in the area , but the Pang family left when the tenements where they lived were scheduled to be torn down and moved to an apartment near 97th Street and 3rd Avenue , in Manhattan . 
 After graduating from Saint Michael Academy , Pang attended New York City Community College . She wanted to be a model , but was told she was too " ethnic " by the modeling agencies . Pang 's early jobs included being a song @-@ plugger , which meant encouraging artists to record them . In 1970 , she began work in New York as a receptionist at ABKCO Records , Allen Klein 's management office , which at that time represented Apple Records and three former Beatles : Lennon , George Harrison , and Ringo Starr . 
 Pang was asked to help Lennon and Ono with their avant @-@ garde film projects , Up Your Legs Forever and Fly , in December 1970 . Pang was then asked to be Lennon and Ono 's secretary and factotum / gofer in New York and England , which led to a permanent position as their personal assistant when the Lennons moved from London to New York in 1971 . Pang coordinated an art exhibition in Syracuse , New York , on October 9 , 1971 , for Ono 's This Is Not Here art show at the Everson Museum . Ono 's show coincided with Lennon 's 31st birthday , and a party was held at the Hotel Syracuse , which was attended by Ringo Starr , Phil Spector , and Elliot Mintz , among others . 
 = = " Lost Weekend " = = 
 At the time Lennon had his 18 @-@ month relationship with Pang , he was in a period of his life which he would later refer to as being his " Lost Weekend " , in reference to the film and novel of the same name . 
 In mid @-@ 1973 , Pang was working on the recording of Lennon 's Mind Games album . Lennon and Ono were having marital problems and decided to separate , and Ono suggested to Pang that she become Lennon 's companion . Ono explained that she and Lennon were not getting along , had been arguing and were growing apart , and said that Lennon would start seeing other women . She pointed out that Lennon had said he found Pang sexually attractive . Pang replied that she could never start a relationship with Lennon as he was her employer and married . Ono ignored Pang 's protests and said that she would arrange everything . Ono later confirmed this conversation in an interview . In October 1973 , Lennon and Pang left New York for Los Angeles to promote Mind Games , and decided to stay for a while , living at the homes of friends . 
 While there , Lennon was inspired to embark on two recording projects : to make an album of the old rock ' n ' roll songs that inspired him to become a musician , and to produce another artist . In December 1973 , Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album . The alcohol @-@ fueled recording sessions became legendary . Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate , but soon Lennon 's drinking and Spector 's erratic behavior ( which included his firing a gun in the studio control room ) caused the sessions to break down . Then Spector , who claimed to have been in a car accident , took the sessions tapes and was unreachable . 
 In March 1974 , Lennon began producing Harry Nilsson 's Pussy Cats album , thus named to counter the " bad boy " image the pair had earned in the media with two drinking incidents at The Troubadour : the first when Lennon placed a <unk> on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress at a concert given by Ann Peebles , who at the time had released one of Lennon 's favorite records , ' I Can 't Stand The Rain ' and , two weeks later , when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers . Lennon thought it would be a good idea for the musicians to live under one roof to ensure they would get to the studio on time , so Pang rented a beach house in Santa Monica , for her , Lennon , Nilsson , Ringo Starr and Keith Moon to live in . At this time , Pang encouraged Lennon to reach out to family and friends . He and Paul McCartney mended fences and played together for the first and only time after the breakup of The Beatles ( see A Toot and a Snore in ' 74 ) . Pang also arranged for Julian Lennon to visit his father for the first time in almost four years . 
 Julian began to see his father more regularly . Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas in 1973 , and encouraged Julian 's interest in music by showing him some chords . " Dad and I got on a great deal better then , " recalls Julian . " We had a lot of fun , laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang . My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear — they were the happiest time I can remember with them . " 
 In June 1974 , Lennon and Pang returned to live in New York City . Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording . As Lennon had previously had cats in Liverpool — while living at his aunt Mimi 's house — he and Pang adopted two cats which they named Major and Minor . In the early summer , while Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album , the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street , where Lennon and Pang claim to have seen a UFO on August 23 , 1974 , from their terrace , which had a panoramic view of east New York . To gain access to the deck Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their kitchen window . On the night in question , a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away . Lennon called Bob Gruen — Lennon 's " official " photographer — and told him what had happened . Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police , but Lennon laughed it off , saying , " I ’ m not going to call up the newspaper and say , ' This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night ' " . Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting , and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived . 
 Walls and Bridges rose to the top spot on the album charts . Lennon achieved his only number one solo single in his lifetime with " Whatever Gets You Thru the Night " . Pang 's is the voice whispering Lennon 's name on " # 9 Dream " . Another song , " Surprise , Surprise ( Sweet Bird of Paradox ) " , was written about her . Julian played drums on the album 's last track , " Ya Ya " . While recording Walls and Bridges , Al Coury , vice president of promotion for Capitol Records , got possession of the chaotic Spector session tapes and brought them to New York . Lennon would complete his oldies album , which would be called Rock ' n ' Roll , with the same musicians he used on Walls and Bridges . Pang received an RIAA gold record award for her work on Walls and Bridges and continued her work as production coordinator of Lennon 's Rock ' n ' Roll album , where she was credited as " Mother Superior " . Pang also worked on albums by Nilsson , Starr , Elton John and David Bowie . 
 While visiting Mick Jagger in Montauk , New York ( the eastern tip of Long Island ) , Lennon and Pang saw a Scottish @-@ style cottage for sale close to the Montauk Point Lighthouse . Lennon asked a real estate broker to put in an offer for it in February 1975 . Lennon and Pang were also planning on visiting Paul and Linda McCartney in New Orleans in February 1975 , where Wings were recording the Venus and Mars album , but Lennon reconciled with Ono the day before the planned visit , after Ono said she had a new cure for Lennon 's smoking habit . 
 Although Lennon would lament this period publicly , he did not do so in private . Journalist Larry Kane , who befriended Lennon in 1964 , wrote a comprehensive biography of Lennon which detailed the " Lost Weekend " period . In the interview with Kane , Lennon explained his feelings about his time with Pang : " You know Larry , I may have been the happiest I 've ever been ... I loved this woman ( Pang ) , I made some beautiful music and I got so fucked up with booze and shit and whatever . "

 After Lennon returned to Ono , Pang started working for United Artists Records and Island Records as a PR manager , working on albums by Bob Marley and Robert Palmer . 
 Pang published her memoir , Loving John , in 1983 . It was later updated and renamed John Lennon : The Lost Weekend . The original 500 @-@ page Loving John book focused mainly on Pang 's role on Lennon 's albums and sessions . It was edited down to 300 pages , concentrating mostly on the sensational aspects of their relationship . It also included postcards that Lennon had written to Pang during his travels throughout the world in the late ' 70s . Pang claims that she and Lennon remained lovers until 1977 , and stayed in contact until his death . 
 Pang 's book of photographs , Instamatic Karma , was published in 2008 . Besides the candid personal portraits , the book contains some historically important photographs , such as Lennon signing the official dissolution of The Beatles ' partnership , and the last known photograph of Lennon and Paul McCartney together . Cynthia Lennon also provided a back cover endorsement , acknowledging Pang 's role in reuniting Lennon with his estranged first son , Julian .

 = 1992 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1992 Atlantic hurricane season had one of the latest dates on record for the first named storm . The season officially began on June 1 , 1992 , and lasted until November 30 , 1992 . The first storm , an unnamed subtropical storm , developed in the central Atlantic on April 21 , over a month before the official start of hurricane season . The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Andrew , which at the time was the costliest United States hurricane . After crossing the Bahamas , the hurricane made landfall in Florida and Louisiana . It caused $ 26 billion ( 1992 USD ) in damage , mostly in Florida , and 65 fatalities . Andrew was also the strongest hurricane of the season , reaching winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) while approaching Florida . 
 Unusually , Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley produced tropical storm force winds in the Azores , and the former caused one fatality . Tropical Storm Danielle was one of few tropical cyclones known to make landfall on the Delmarva Peninsula . The storm caused minor damage and two fatalities in the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England regions of the United States . One other hurricane in the season – Frances – did not significantly affect land . The system developed in the central Atlantic , and tracked well away from land , and brought only light rainfall to Newfoundland . In addition to the 7 storms , there were three non @-@ developing tropical depressions . The first depression of the season caused flooding in Cuba and Florida while the other two depressions did not affect any land . Collectively , the storms in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season caused $ 26 @.@ 502 billion in losses and 73 fatalities . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ season forecasts = = = 
 Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University ( CSU ) and the Weather Research Center ( WRC ) . A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has 12 @.@ 1 named storms , of which 6 @.@ 4 reach hurricane strength , and 2 @.@ 7 become major hurricanes . In December 1991 , CSU issued its first forecast for the year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms , four hurricanes , and one major hurricane . CSU also issued a forecast in April , June and August , however no revisions were made to the numbers of named storms , hurricanes , and major hurricane predicted in 1992 . Prior to the season starting , the WRC predicted that the season would see six named storms , with three of those becoming a hurricane while no forecast was made on the numbers of major hurricanes . 
 = = = Season activity = = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , but activity in 1992 began more than a month earlier with the formation of Subtropical Storm One on April 21 . It was a below average season in which 10 tropical depressions formed . Seven of the depressions attained tropical storm status , and four of these attained hurricane status . In addition , one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status , which is below the 1981 – 2010 average of 2 @.@ 7 per season . The low amount of activity is partially attributed to weaker than normal tropical waves , the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones . Only two hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season . However , damage from Hurricane Andrew was astronomical , causing most of the season 's 106 deaths and $ 26 @.@ 5 billion ( 1992 USD ) damage toll . The last storm of the season , Hurricane Frances , became extratropical on October 27 , over a month before the official end of the season on November 30 . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of Subtropical Storm One on April 21 . However , over the next three months , minimal activity occurred , with only two depressions developing , one in June and the other in July . Although wind shear was relatively weak in August , only one tropical cyclone occurred in that month . However , that one tropical cyclone , Hurricane Andrew , was the strongest and costliest of the season . Though September is the climatological peak of hurricane season , an increase in wind shear prevented tropical cyclogenesis in the first half of the month . After September 16 , however , five tropical cyclones developed in a span of nine days , from September 17 to 26 . Thereafter , activity abruptly halted , and only one tropical cyclone developed in October , Hurricane Frances . By October 27 , Frances became extratropical , which was more than a month before the official end of the season on November 30 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 76 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Although officially , subtropical cyclones , such as the first storm , are excluded from the total , the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase .

 On April 21 , a low pressure area separated from the prevailing westerlies about 600 miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) southeast of Bermuda , and developed into a subtropical depression at 1200 UTC . The system maintained a large comma @-@ shaped cloud pattern around the low @-@ level circulation . Operationally it was not classified until 27 hours later . Isolated from strong steering currents , the depression tracked northwestward at 12 mph ( 19 km / h ) , and intensified into a subtropical storm early on April 22 ; this was the first such storm on record in the month . It gradually became better organized , with a large convective band in the eastern semicircle . Reports from a nearby ship indicated peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , with swells of 64 @.@ 4 feet ( 19 @.@ 7 m ) . 
 The National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for the system transitioning into a tropical cyclone . An approaching trough caused the storm to stall and weaken the deep convection . On April 23 , the cyclone weakened to depression status due to strong wind shear . A Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the weakening , and also reported a 1 @.@ 8 ° F ( 1 ° C ) temperature rise in the center , suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics . Early on April 24 , the subtropical depression turned eastward , maintaining limited convection . At the time , forecasters anticipated the depression would continue east @-@ northeastward and become an extratropical cyclone . By late on April 24 , the system was too weak to classify using the Dvorak technique , and the NHC ceased issuing advisories . Within 24 hours , the circulation dissipated as the system continued eastward through the westerlies . 
 = = = Tropical Depression One = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on June 12 , and eventually developed into Tropical Depression One in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center designated this system as Tropical Depression Two , which led to confusion because of Subtropical Storm One in April , and then another Tropical Depression Two in July . Outflow from Hurricane Celia in the Pacific Ocean and a trough in the Gulf of Mexico generated wind shear on the depression , which prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm . The depression curved north @-@ northeastward and eventually made landfall in near Tampa , Florida on June 26 around 1500 UTC . As it was moving ashore , the National Hurricane Center noted that the depression was too poorly organized to locate the center of circulation , and discontinued advisories on the system . 
 The depression dropped heavy rainfall in Cuba , peaking at 33 @.@ 43 inches ( 849 mm ) . Large amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding , which damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities in provinces of Pinar del Río and La Habana . As the system was only a tropical depression , light winds were reported , however , a peak gust of 56 mph ( 90 km / h ) was reported at MacDill Air Force Base . Heavy rainfall fell on the west coast of Florida , with local amounts exceeded 20 inches ( 510 mm ) . Precipitation throughout the state peaked at 25 inches ( 640 mm ) in Arcadia Tower . Heavy rainfall caused flooding in portions of Florida , which in turn , damaged 4 @,@ 000 houses and destroyed 70 houses . In addition , five homes destroyed and twelve were damage by a tornado spawned in Nokomis . Severe crop damage to orange trees was also reported . The depression caused two fatalities in Florida and damage totaled to $ 2 @.@ 6 million ( 1992 USD ) .

 A squall line which moved offshore New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex , which fired new thunderstorm activity each day as it moved within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic . Once it reached mid @-@ ocean , an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics to the east of Bermuda , and it maintained decent organization . By 2100 UTC on July 24 , the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two . In the first advisory on the depression , it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two . 
 Due to northeasterly wind shear , the depression failed to intensified or organize further , as predicted . Instead , the depression weakened by late on July 25 , with satellite imagery indicating that much of the deep convection was removed from the surface circulation . By July 26 , the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory , noting that it was " too weak to classify and is rapidly losing its identity " . The depression dissipated about three hours later . 
 = = = Hurricane Andrew = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 14 , and organized into Tropical Depression Three on August 16 while located about halfway between the Windward Islands and the coast of Africa . It moved to the west @-@ northwest , and strengthened into Tropical Storm Andrew on August 17 . After reaching winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , strong southwesterly shear weakened the storm , and by August 20 it weakened to a minimal storm with a pressure of 1 @,@ 015 mbar ( 30 @.@ 0 inHg ) . It bypassed the Lesser Antilles completely , and turned to the west in response to a building high pressure system to the north . Upon turning to the west , a trough of low pressure positioned to the southwest of Andrew created an environment with little vertical shear and well @-@ defined outflow . The storm quickly intensified due to its small size , and became a hurricane on August 22 . Andrew rapidly intensified under ideal conditions for development , and on August 23 the hurricane peaked with winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . It crossed the Bahamas at that intensity , weakened slightly , and re @-@ intensified to a 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) Category 5 hurricane before making landfall near Homestead , Florida . It weakened slightly over the state to a 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) hurricane , but restrengthened to a 145 mph ( 235 km / h ) hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico . A strong mid @-@ latitude trough turned Andrew northward , where it greatly weakened before hitting west of Morgan City , Louisiana on August 26 as a 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) Category 3 hurricane . It turned northeastward , and dissipated over Tennessee on August 28 . 
 In the Bahamas , Andrew brought high tides , hurricane @-@ force winds , and tornadoes , which caused significant damage in the archipelago , especially on Cat Cays . At least 800 houses were destroyed and left damage to the transport , communications , water , sanitation , agriculture , and fishing sectors . Overall , Andrew caused four fatalities and $ 250 million in damage in the Bahamas . Throughout the southern portions of Florida , Andrew brought very high winds ; a wind gust of 177 mph ( 282 km / h ) was reported at a house in Perrine , Florida . High winds caused catastrophic damage in Florida , especially in Miami @-@ Dade County , where approximately 117 @,@ 000 houses were either severely damaged or destroyed . In the Everglades , 70 @,@ 000 acres ( 280 km2 ) of trees were knocked down and about 182 million fish were killed . Rainfall in Florida was moderate , peaking at 13 @.@ 98 inches ( 355 mm ) in western Miami @-@ Dade County . Significant damage to oil platforms was reported , with one company losing 13 platforms , had 104 structures damaged , and five drilling wells blown off course . In Louisiana , Andrew produced hurricane @-@ force winds along its path , damaging 23 @,@ 000 homes and destroying 985 homes and 1 @,@ 951 mobile homes . An F3 tornado in St. John the Baptist Parish damaged or destroyed 163 structures . 17 fatalities were reported in Louisiana , six of which were drowning victims offshore . Elsewhere , the storm spawned at least 28 tornadoes , especially in Alabama , Georgia , and Mississippi . Overall , Andrew caused 65 fatalities and $ 26 billion ( 1992 USD ) in damage , making it the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S. history , behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Hurricane Sandy in 2012 , and Hurricane Ike in 2008 . 
 = = = Hurricane Bonnie = = = 
 In mid @-@ September , a tropical low detached from a cold front and developed into Tropical Depression Four late on September 17 , while located about 340 miles ( 550 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda . Early on the following day , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie . Due to light vertical wind shear , Bonnie quickly strengthened , and became a hurricane late on September 18 . Further deepening occurred , and at 1800 UTC on September 21 , Bonnie peaked as a 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) Category 2 hurricane . Thereafter , Bonnie became nearly stationary for almost 24 hours . Satellite images indicated that the low @-@ level center became exposed , indicating that Bonnie was significantly weakening while tracking southward . It is estimated that Bonnie weakened to a tropical storm by late on September 24 . Bonnie further deteriorated to tropical depression status on September 26 , but re @-@ strengthened to a tropical storm later that day . 
 By 1500 UTC on September 27 , the National Hurricane Center declared Bonnie extratropical , since it was losing tropical characteristics . Bonnie re @-@ acquired tropical characteristics , and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100 UTC on September 28 . However , post @-@ analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period . Bonnie re @-@ strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores . Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30 , Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm . One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds . In addition , one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of São Miguel . No damage was reported in association with Bonnie . 
 = = = Hurricane Charley = = = 
 On September 20 , <unk> imagery indicated an area of convection becoming concentrated while well south of the Azores . It is possible that a mid to upper @-@ level cyclonic circulation interacted with the northern portion of a tropical wave . By the following day , satellite imagery noted a well @-@ defined low @-@ level circulation and thus , Tropical Depression Five while centered about 633 miles ( 1 @,@ 019 km ) south of the Azores . The depression tracked northwestward and satellite imagery began to indicate banding features . As a result , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley on September 22 . An eye developed as Charley tracked north @-@ northwestward , and it became a hurricane on September 23 . Further strengthening occurred , and by late on September 24 , Charley peaked as a 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) Category 2 hurricane . 
 Thereafter , Charley turned eastward and then east @-@ northeastward while tracking over decreasing sea surface temperatures ( SST 's ) . Early on September 27 , Charley was downgraded to a tropical storm . Later that day , Charley crossed over Terceira Island in the Azores with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Charley gradually lost tropical characteristic , and by 1800 UTC on September 27 , it had transitioned into an extratropical storm . The remnant system accelerated northeastward toward the British Isles , where it merged with another extratropical low on September 29 . While passing through the Azores , Charley produced tropical storm force winds , with the Lajes AFB reporting sustained winds of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) and gusts reaching 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) . No other effects from Charley were reported in the Azores . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Danielle = = = 
 Tropical Depression Six developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on September 22 from the merger of a surface trough , a tropical wave , and a cold front . The depression quickly intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Danielle six hours later . An approaching trough caused a northeastward movement , but later a high pressure system forced the storm to northwestward , which caused Danielle to execute a small anti @-@ cyclonic loop on September 23 – 24 . While offshore of North Carolina on September 25 , Danielle reached its peak intensity as a moderately strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . It was initially predicted that Danielle would make landfall in North Carolina , however , the storm curved north @-@ northwestward and made landfall in Maryland on the eastern shore of the Delmarva Peninsula at the same intensity . Danielle continued inland and weakened and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26 . 
 Danielle caused severe beach erosion in North Carolina , Virginia , and Maryland , which resulted in overwash , which in turn , damage or destroyed several businesses and houses in the coastal portions of the three states . In addition , street flooding also closed several roads in the region , most notably , North Carolina Highway 12 . Many states in the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England also reported rainfall , although rarely exceeding 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . In addition high seas offshore of New Jersey capsized a sailboat , causing two people to drown . Overall , damage from the storm was minimal , with the exception of the damage or destroyed businesses and houses in North Carolina , Virginia , and Maryland . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Seven = = = 
 A poorly organized tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 23 and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Seven on September 25 , while centered 775 miles ( 1 @,@ 247 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . Because the depression was tracking over warm SST 's , it was predicted to intensify into a tropical storm . However , wind shear exposed the center as indicated by visible satellite images on September 26 , and the National Hurricane Center noted on September 26 that " the depression could be downgraded to a tropical wave later today " . Early on September 27 , the center of the depression became difficult to locate on satellite imagery . 
 By September 28 , the organization of the depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear . The center of the depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29 . Later that day , a few computer models indicated a decrease in wind shear over the depression within two days , thus , it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm . However , wind shear exposed the center of the depression again by early on September 30 , though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status . By late on October 1 , satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated , and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Earl = = = 
 On September 26 , a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight while centered about 345 miles ( 555 km ) north of Hispaniola . The depression tracked west @-@ northwestward toward the Bahamas . Initially , the depression remained weak , but after reaching the Gulf Stream it strengthened into Tropical Storm Earl at 1200 UTC on September 29 . Around that time , Earl began to veer east , lessening the threat to Florida . Early on October 1 , Earl reached maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 990 mbar ( 29 inHg ) . It gradually weakened thereafter , and Earl was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 3 . Later that day , Earl became extratropical about 295 mi ( 475 km ) south of Bermuda . 
 The threat from Earl prompted a tropical storm watch in the Bahamas and later Bermuda , while a coastal flood watch was issued in Florida . Because Earl remained offshore , impact was generally minor . Throughout Florida , Earl spawned 11 tornadoes and brought moderately heavy rainfall , peaking at 9 @.@ 38 inches ( 238 mm ) near Canal Point , Florida . In addition , light amounts of precipitation were also reported in Georgia and North Carolina . Above normal tides washed away 30 to 35 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 to 10 @.@ 7 m ) of beaches , and lifeguards on St. Augustine Beach made eight rescues . 
 = = = Hurricane Frances = = = 
 A low pressure area developed along the end of a quasi @-@ stationary frontal trough . Initially , vertical wind shear prevented deep convection from forming on the western portion of the system . After wind shear decreased , the system became a gale center late on October 22 . By early on the following day , the gale center had transitioned into a tropical storm , and it is estimated that Tropical Storm Frances developed at 0600 UTC on October 23 . Frances quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical storm , and was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800 UTC on that same day . After becoming a hurricane , Frances curved northeastward , and remained well east of Bermuda . By midday on October 24 , Frances peaked as an 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) Category 1 hurricane . 
 After reaching peak intensity , Frances began tracking over cooler SST 's , which gradually weakened the storm . The eye featured became indistinct and by late on October 25 , Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm . Over the next two days , Frances began losing tropical characteristics , and was declared extratropical by early on October 27 . One sailor was reported missing , however , it is unknown if it was as a result of Frances . In addition , one person on a sailboat suffered injuries during an encounter with Frances . On land , Frances caused minimal impact , limited to light rainfall across Newfoundland .

 = I Heard It Through the Grapevine = 
 " I Heard It Through the Grapevine " is a song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong for Motown Records in 1966 . The first recording of the song to be released was produced by Whitfield for Gladys Knight & the Pips and released as a single in September 1967 ; it went to number two in the Billboard chart . 
 Smokey Robinson & the Miracles included their version on their 1968 album , Special Occasion . The Marvin Gaye version was placed on his 1968 album In the Groove , where it gained the attention of radio disc jockeys , and Gordy finally agreed to its release as a single in October 1968 , when it went to the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart for seven weeks from December 1968 to January 1969 and became for a time the biggest hit single on the Motown label ( Tamla ) . 
 The Gaye recording has since become an acclaimed soul classic , and in 2004 , it was placed on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008 , Marvin Gaye 's " Grapevine " was ranked 65th . It was also inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame for " historical , artistic and significant " value . 
 In addition to being released several times by Motown artists , the song has been recorded by a range of musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival , who made an eleven @-@ minute interpretation for their 1970 album , Cosmo 's Factory ; and has been used twice in television commercials – each time using session musicians recreating the style of the Marvin Gaye version : the 1985 Levi 's commercial , " Launderette " , featuring male model Nick Kamen , and the 1986 California raisins promotion with Buddy Miles as the singer for the clay animation group The California Raisins .

 By 1966 , Barrett Strong , the singer on Motown Records ' breakthrough hit , " Money ( That 's What I Want ) " , had the basics of a song he had started to write in Chicago , where the idea had come to him while walking down Michigan Avenue that people were always saying " I heard it through the grapevine " . The phrase is associated with black slaves during the Civil War , who had their form of telegraph : the human grapevine . Producer Norman Whitfield worked with Strong on the song , adding lyrics to Strong 's basic Ray Charles influenced gospel tune and the single chorus line of " I heard it through the grapevine " . This was to be the first of a number of successful collaborations between Strong and Whitfield . 
 The lyrics tell the story in a first person narrative of the betrayal of the singer 's romantic partner , how he heard about it indirectly via gossip from other people ( through the " grapevine " ) , and the emotional pain and disbelief he is suffering . 
 = = Motown recordings = = 
 Producer Norman Whitfield recorded " I Heard It Through the Grapevine " with various Motown artists . The first known recording is with the Miracles on August 6 , 1966 , though there may also have been a recording with the Isley Brothers , or at least Whitfield intended to record it with them ; however a track has not turned up – some Motown historians believe that a session may have been scheduled but cancelled . The Miracles ' version was not released as a single due to Berry Gordy 's veto during Motown 's weekly quality control meetings ; Gordy advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single . The Miracles version later appeared on their 1968 Special Occasion album , and a slightly different take , possibly from the same session but unreleased , appeared on the 1998 compilation album , Motown Sings Motown Treasures . 
 Marvin Gaye 's version was recorded in spring 1967 , and is the second known recording , though was also rejected by Gordy as a single , and would also later go onto an album , In the Groove . The third recording was in 1967 with Gladys Knight and the Pips in a new , faster arrangement . Gordy accepted the new arrangement and the Gladys Knight version was released as a single in September 1967 , reaching number 2 in the charts . When Gaye 's album with his version of Grapevine was released in August 1968 radio disc jockeys were playing the song , so Gordy had it released as a single in October , and it went to number one in December . 
 In 1968 , Bobby Taylor & the <unk> recorded a version for their debut album based on Gladys ' recent hit ; however , after hearing the Marvin Gaye version , they felt they 'd made the wrong choice . In 1969 , Whitfield produced a version for the Temptations " psychedelic soul " album , Cloud Nine , in which he " brought compelling percussion to the fore , and relegated the piano well into the wings " . In 1971 , the Undisputed Truth became the final Motown act to record the song in its Marvin @-@ styled version . The song was also covered by the Chi @-@ Lites on their 1969 debut album Give It Away . 
 = = = Marvin Gaye = = = 
 Whitfield recorded the song with Marvin Gaye over five sessions , the first on February 3 , 1967 , and the final one on April 10 , 1967 . Recordings of this version took more than a month due to Whitfield overdubbing Gaye 's vocals with that of the Andantes ' background vocals , mixing in several tracks featuring the Funk Brothers on the rhythm track , and adding the string section from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with an arrangement by Paul Riser . 
 The session featuring Gaye led to an argument between the producer and singer . Whitfield wanted Gaye to perform the song in a higher key than his normal range , a move that had worked on David Ruffin during the recording of the Temptations ' hit , " Ain 't Too Proud to Beg " . The mixture of Gaye 's raspy vocals and the Andantes ' sweeter harmonies , made Whitfield confident that he had a hit ; however , despite approval from Motown 's Quality Control Department , Gordy blocked the release . 
 = = = Gladys Knight & the Pips = = = 
 Gladys Knight & the Pips recorded " Grapevine " on June 17 , 1967 in Motown 's Studio A , with Norman Whitfield as producer . After hearing Aretha Franklin 's version of " Respect " , Whitfield rearranged " Grapevine " to include some of the funk elements of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section . According to David Ritz , Whitfield set to record a song that would " out @-@ funk " Aretha . After Whitfield presented the demo tapes , Gladys Knight , Bubba Knight , William Guest , and Edward Patten worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement . To make the song suitable for Gladys , the first line of the second verse ( " I know a man ain 't supposed to cry / But these tears I can 't hold inside " ) was altered to ( " Take a good look at these tears in my eyes / Baby , these tears I can 't hold inside " ) . After much talk , Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips ' version to be a single on September 28 , 1967 on Motown 's Soul label . 
 = = Releases = = 
 The first release was the Gladys Knight & the Pips version on September 28 , 1967 on Motown 's Soul label , with " It ’ s Time to Go Now " on the B @-@ side . Motown put little support behind it and the Pips relied on connections with DJs across the United States to get the record played . The Pips ' version of " Grapevine " reached number one on the Billboard R & B chart on November 25 , 1967 , and stayed there for six weeks , making it the group 's second R & B number one after 1961 's " Every Beat of My Heart " . It reached two on the Billboard Pop Singles singles chart the same month , with the Monkees ' " Daydream Believer " holding top spot . It was Motown 's best @-@ selling single to that point . The song was later placed on the Gladys Knight & the Pips album Everybody Needs Love . 
 Whitfield wanted Gordy to release Gaye 's " Grapevine " as a single , but Gordy didn 't want to release another version after the Pips had already made a hit out of it . In September 1968 , Whitfield added " Grapevine " to Gaye 's new album In the Groove . On release " Grapevine " became a radio hit and , according to Gordy himself , " The DJs played it so much off the album that we had to release it as a single " . So Gaye 's version was released as a single on October 30 , 1968 . Gaye 's " I Heard It Through the Grapevine " eventually outsold the Pips ' , and until The Jackson 5 's " I 'll Be There " 20 months later , was the biggest hit single of all time on the Motown label . It stayed at the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart for seven weeks , from December 14 , 1968 to January 25 , 1969 . Gaye 's " Grapevine " also held number one on the R & B chart during the same seven weeks , and stayed at number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks starting on March 26 , 1969 . The label was pleased with the success , although Gaye , depressed because of issues such as the illness of singing partner Tammi Terrell ( which would kill her less than a year later ) , was quoted as saying that his success " didn 't seem real " and that he " didn 't deserve it " . 
 Due to the song 's success , In the Groove was re @-@ issued as I Heard It Through the Grapevine and peaked at number two on the R & B album chart and number sixty @-@ three on the album chart , which was at the time Marvin 's highest @-@ charted solo studio effort to date . Because of the success of both versions , " I Heard It Through the Grapevine " was the first and last number one on the Billboard R & B chart in 1968 : the Pips version was the first week of January , the Gaye version the last week of December . Gladys Knight was not pleased that Gaye 's version usurped her own , and claimed that Gaye 's version was recorded over an instrumental track Whitfield had prepared for a Pips song , an allegation Gaye denied . In 1985 , one year following Gaye 's death , the song was re @-@ released in the UK reaching number eight thanks to a Levi 's commercial ( starring Nick Kamen ) .

 The Gaye recording has become an acclaimed soul classic . In 2004 , it was placed at number 80 on Rolling Stone 's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time , with the comment that Whitfield had produced the song with a number of artists using different arrangements , and that on the Marvin Gaye recording he had a " golden idea " when he set the song " in a slower , more mysterious tempo " . In a new Rolling Stone list published in 2011 , the single was placed slightly lower at 81 . 
 On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008 , the Marvin Gaye version was ranked as the 65th biggest song on the chart . It was also inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame for " historical , artistic and significant " value .

 In addition to being recorded several times by Motown artists , the song has been covered by musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival who recorded an eleven @-@ minute version for their 1970 album , Cosmo 's Factory , that was released as a single , reaching 43 on Billboard 's chart , with more modest success in other countries , and funk musician Roger Troutman whose extended version lifted off his 1981 solo album , The Many Facets of Roger , brought the song back to number one on the R & B chart in early 1982 marking the third time the single reached the top spot on that chart . It also made the Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at number seventy @-@ nine . Queen Latifah used the music as a basis for her 1998 single " Paper " , produced by Pras Michel for her album Order in the Court .

 " I Heard It Through the Grapevine " has been used twice in television commercials – each time using session musicians recreating the style of the Marvin Gaye version . For the 1985 Levi 's 501 commercial , " Launderette " , featuring male model Nick Kamen , agency BBH and director Roger Lyons , owing to budgetary constraints , brought in Karl Jenkins and Mike Ratledge to recreate the sound of the Marvin Gaye original with Tony Jackson , a Barbadian background singer for Paul Young , handling vocals and P. P. Arnold on backing vocals . The commercial 's success prompted Tamla @-@ Motown to re @-@ release Gaye 's single with the Levi 's 501 logo on the sleeve — " an example of integrated marketing almost before the term was invented " . The record went to number eight on the UK Singles chart , marking its second chart performance . A year later , in 1986 , Buddy Miles was the singer for the clay animation group The California Raisins which sang it as part a TV advertising campaign . 
 Marvin Gaye 's version of the song is used in the opening credits of The Big Chill ( 1983 ) as each of the main characters gets to hear ( through the " grapevine " ) about the death of their college friend , and then travels to his funeral ; the song serves in an <unk> fashion to both unite the main characters ' friendship and to locate it nostalgically for the viewer .

 Jared Christopher Monti ( September 20 , 1975 – June 21 , 2006 ) was a Soldier in the United States Army who received the United States military 's highest decoration for valor , the Medal of Honor , for his actions in Afghanistan . 
 Monti was deployed with his unit when they were attacked by a group of enemy insurgents . When another Soldier was wounded , Monti attempted to rescue him three times and was killed in action . The President signed the authorization for Monti to receive the Medal of Honor and the medal was presented to his family in a ceremony at the White House in 2009 . It was the first Medal of Honor presentation during Obama 's presidency . Monti was the sixth person from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to be awarded the Medal of Honor .

 Monti was born in Abington , Massachusetts , on September 20 , 1975 , to Paul , a school teacher , and Janet Monti . He grew up in Raynham , Massachusetts and even as a child the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor was , military . As a four @-@ year @-@ old , he disappeared from the backyard one day , and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt on the other side of the fence . On another occasion , a migraine headache kept him home from school , but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree . In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater @-@ Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18 . Monti had two siblings , a sister , Nicole and a brother , Timothy .

 After enlisting in the Army in March 1993 , he completed basic training and forward observer training at Fort Sill , Oklahoma and continued his training as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division . Monti , a fire support specialist , served as a staff sergeant and Fire Support Team sergeant with the 3rd Squadron , 71st Cavalry Regiment , 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division . Previous to his service in Afghanistan he was deployed to Kosovo , where he sustained injuries while sky diving . He rejected a medical discharge and reenlisted to deploy with his unit to Afghanistan in February 2006 , as part of Task Force Spartan .

 On June 21 , 2006 , Monti served as the assistant leader of a 16 @-@ man patrol and leader of a weapons forward observer team tasked with gathering intelligence in <unk> , Nuristan Province , in northeastern Afghanistan . The team established a small base on a ridge to support a larger Army operation in the valley below . When the larger operation was delayed , Monti 's team ran low on provisions . The helicopter that brought supplies revealed the team 's position . 
 That evening , the patrol was attacked by a group of at least 60 insurgents , who had established two positions on a wooded ridge about 50 @-@ yards above the patrol and attempted to outflank Monti and his team . The Americans took cover and returned fire , and Monti radioed for artillery and close air support . Enemy fire killed Staff Sergeant Patrick <unk> . Another Soldier , Specialist Brian J. Bradbury , was severely wounded and left lying in the open between the enemy and the team 's position . Staff Sergeant Chris Cunningham , leader of the patrol 's sniper team , called out that he was going to try to rescue Bradbury . Monti replied , " That ’ s my guy . I am going to get him . " 
 Monti made three attempts to reach Bradbury . On his first , he advanced to within three feet of Bradbury before being forced back by intense machine @-@ gun and rocket @-@ propelled grenade ( RPG ) fire . His second try was similarly turned back and as the rest of his patrol provided covering fire , Monti advanced a third time but was struck by an RPG . Some news reports indicated that the explosion blew off both of his legs , but this is not supported by family accounts or military records . Monti attempted to crawl back towards cover . He is reported by comrades to have made his peace with God and asked Sgt. Cunningham to tell his parents he loved them . Monti died moments later . At about the same time , the artillery and air support for which he had called began hitting the enemy position , killing 22 of the attackers and dispersing the rest . 
 SPC Bradbury subsequently died during his evacuation when the cable on the rescue hoist lifting him to a 159th Medical Company ( Air Ambulance ) helicopter broke . The fall also killed Staff Sergeant <unk> Craig , 28 , a medic from Severn , Maryland .

 For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty . 
 Sergeant First Class Monti distinguished himself at the cost of his life while serving as a team leader with the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop , 3d Squadron , 71st Cavalry Regiment in Nuristan Province , Afghanistan on 21 June 2006 . On that day , Sergeant First Class Monti was leading a mission to gather intelligence and to direct fires against the enemy in support of a squadron @-@ size interdiction mission . While at an observation position on top of a mountain ridge , Sergeant First Class Monti ’ s sixteen @-@ man patrol came under attack by a superior force consisting of as many as 50 enemy fighters . On the verge of being overrun , Sergeant First Class Monti directed his patrol to set up a hasty defensive position behind a collection of rocks . He then began to call for indirect fire from a nearby support base ; accurately bringing the rounds upon the enemy who had closed to within 50 meters of his position . While still calling for fire , Sergeant First Class Monti personally engaged the enemy with his rifle and a grenade , successfully disrupting an attempt to flank the patrol . Sergeant First Class Monti then realized that one of his Soldiers was lying wounded and exposed in the open ground between the advancing enemy and the patrol ’ s position . With complete disregard for his own safety , Sergeant First Class Monti moved from behind the cover of the rocks into the face of withering enemy fire . After closing within meters of his wounded Soldier , the heavy volume of fire forced Sergeant First Class Monti to seek cover . Sergeant First Class Monti then gathered himself and rose again to maneuver through a barrage of enemy fire to save his wounded Soldier . Again , Sergeant First Class Monti was driven back by relentless enemy fire . Unwilling to leave his Soldier wounded and exposed , Sergeant First Class Monti made another attempt to move across open terrain and through the enemy fire to the aide of his wounded Soldier . On his third attempt , Sergeant First Class Monti was mortally wounded , sacrificing his own life in an effort to save his Soldier . Sergeant First Class Monti ’ s acts of heroism inspired the patrol to fight off the larger enemy force . Sergeant First Class Monti ’ s immeasurable courage and uncommon valor were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself , 3d Squadron 71st Cavalry Regiment , the 3d Brigade Combat Team , the 10th Mountain Division ( Light Infantry ) , and the United States Army .

 = Cyclone Geralda = 
 Cyclone Geralda ( also known as Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda ) was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994 , among the strongest to hit the country . It originated from an area of low pressure over the Indian Ocean on January 25 . Over the following few days , the depression underwent gradual intensification , reaching its peak intensity with ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) on January 31 . Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina , Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity . Within hours of moving onshore , the system had substantially weakened , and by February 5 , Geralda had degenerated into a land depression , and it became extratropical three days later . 
 Geralda was the second cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar , after Daisy in January . Geralda produced wind gusts as strong as 350 km / h ( 220 mph ) , which were the highest worldwide for several decades . The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding , particularly in valleys . About 80 % of the city of Toamasina was destroyed , including most schools , homes , and churches . The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines , which later disrupted relief efforts . In the capital Antananarivo , Geralda killed 43 people after flooding many houses . Overall , more than 40 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed , leaving 356 @,@ 000 people homeless . Nationwide , the cyclone killed 231 people and caused over $ 10 million in damage ( 1994 USD ) . Relief work in the storm 's aftermath was hampered by lack of coordination , and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims . Few stocks were pre @-@ positioned , causing food prices to rise greatly . Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In late January 1994 , the south Indian Ocean Intertropical Convergence Zone produced widespread convection from the eastern coast of Africa to Indonesia . Late on January 25 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring a low @-@ pressure area about halfway between Madagascar and Indonesia , later giving it the designation " 13S " . The following day , the Météo @-@ France on Réunion ( MFR ) classified the system as a tropical disturbance . By that time , the system had developed an organized area of convection with curved rainbands and was strengthening quickly ; early on January 28 , it developed a central dense overcast . In response , MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Geralda . At that time , the storm was moving generally west @-@ southwestward due to a ridge extending from Madagascar to the Mascarene Islands . High water temperatures fueled further development , first into a moderate tropical storm late on January 28 and then into a tropical cyclone 24 hours later . By then , the JTWC had upgraded Geralda to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . 
 Continuing generally to the west @-@ southwest , Geralda intensified further , and MFR upgraded it to intense tropical cyclone status on January 30 . The cyclone developed a well @-@ defined eye 35 km ( 22 mi ) in diameter and grew to a size of 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) in diameter . At 0600 UTC on January 31 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 – minute sustained winds of 270 km / h ( 165 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . Six hours later , Geralda 's appearance on satellite imagery warranted a Dvorak rating of 7 @.@ 0 . Based on this , MFR estimated a minimum barometric pressure of 905 mbar ( 26 @.@ 7 inHg ) and peak 10 – minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , just shy of very intense tropical cyclone status . At that time , gusts were estimated at over 300 km / h ( 190 mph ) . Geralda had intensified from a tropical disturbance to its peak intensity in only five days , which was described by MFR as " an exceptional phenomenon " . Near peak intensity , the center of Geralda passed about 45 km ( 28 mi ) northwest of Tromelin Island , offshore eastern Madagascar . 
 After maintaining its peak winds for about 18 hours , Geralda weakened slightly while approaching eastern Madagascar . At 0600 UTC on February 2 , MFR estimated the winds were around 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) . At about 1100 UTC that day , the cyclone made landfall just north of Toamasina as an intense tropical cyclone , where a pressure of 943 mbar ( 27 @.@ 8 inHg ) was reported . Officials considered Geralda the strongest storm to hit the country since a cyclone in March 1927 . Geralda weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Madagascar , passing over the capital Antananarivo late on February 2 ; both the JTWC and MFR had downgraded the cyclone to tropical depression status by the next day . About 30 hours after its first landfall , Geralda briefly emerged into the Mozambique Channel late on February 3 . However , a trough soon turned it to the south , and Geralda crossed over western Madagascar , reaching open waters on February 5 . By that time , the winds had decreased to 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . An approaching polar trough turned Geralda to the southeast on February 6 , and the cyclone became extratropical two days later . MFR continued tracking the remnants of Geralda until February 12 . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 Tromelin Island was the first landmass affected by Geralda . The island was just outside the eyewall , and experienced wind gusts of 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) . 
 Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar just weeks after Tropical Cyclone Daisy affected the same general area . While Geralda was approaching the country , officials declared Emergency Phase 3 for Toamasina Province , indicating immediate danger , and Emergency Phase 1 for Antananarivo , which is a general alert . 
 As Geralda moved ashore , the cyclone produced wind gusts as strong as 350 km / h ( 220 mph ) , among the strongest gusts worldwide in several decades . The storm also dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides and severe flooding , mostly in Toamasina Province . About 80 % of the city of Toamasina was destroyed , including the country 's only petroleum refinery at the time . Damage to the refinery alone was estimated at $ 800 @,@ 000 . 
 An early estimate indicated that 95 % of schools , homes , and churches sustained severe damage to complete destruction in the city , leaving 50 @,@ 000 people homeless . In the harbor at Toamasina , Geralda sank seven ships , and throughout the city , power outages and road damage were commonplace . Elsewhere in Madagascar , Geralda wrecked houses and bridges in <unk> . On Île Sainte @-@ Marie , all power lines and 90 % of plantations were destroyed . Brickaville , to the south of Toamasina , experienced severe flooding up to 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . Lack of basic repairs before the storm contributed to roads and bridges being washed away there . The cyclone killed 43 people when it flooded large portions of Antananarivo , leaving 60 @,@ 000 people homeless . High rainfall damaged houses in the city and cut off roads outside of the city . Damage was heavy in valleys where flash flooding occurred . Across Madagascar , flooding wrecked over 300 @,@ 000 ha ( 740 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields , affecting 70 % of the rice crop , and killed more than 13 @,@ 000 cattle . The combined impact of Geralda and earlier Cyclone Daisy damaged or destroyed more than 40 @,@ 000 homes , leaving at least 356 @,@ 000 people homeless . The storms also left severe damage to roads and rail systems . A total of 20 national roads and several secondary roads were disrupted . The rail line between Moramanga near the capital and Brickaville near the coast was damaged . Overall , Cyclone Geralda killed at least 231 people , with 73 missing as of MFR 's annual cyclone report on the season ; the storm also injured 267 people and caused over $ 10 million in damage ( 1994 USD ) . 
 In the aftermath , there was no pre @-@ existing method of dealing with a storm of such magnitude , and most local governments failed to respond immediately due to lack of coordination . As a result , agencies spent much time in dealing with the logistics of the aftermath . There were few food supplies that were pre @-@ positioned . The Malagasy government worked with the United Nations to create a committee , which met weekly and addressed various facets of the recovery . Malagasy officials deployed members of the military to help storm victims , although damaged roads initially hampered relief efforts . Due to crop damage , the price of rice increased by 300 % in the country , and there were food shortages in Antananarivo , along with fuel shortages elsewhere . In Toamasina , industrial activity was expected to take six months to resume production . Médecins Sans Frontières helped assure the cleanliness of shelters in Antananarivo , while CARE delivered food to residents in Brickaville . There were health issues related to the widespread flooding , prompting the government to distribute medical supplies for 60 @,@ 000 people . Shortly after Geralda struck , the Malagasy government requested international assistance . The United Nations Department of Human Services provided an emergency $ 30 @,@ 000 relief grant , and UNICEF later provided about $ 2 @.@ 3 million in assistance . The European Union provided about $ 560 @,@ 000 worth of medicine and relief . The French government sent $ 5 million worth of supplies via airplane from Réunion , including food and medicine . Eight other countries sent assistance in the form of money or relief items . 
 By about two weeks after the storm 's landfall , water and power service were being restored in Toamasina , although by that time , 40 % of the communications network remained offline . By February 16 , the road from <unk> and Toamasina had been reopened . The Malagasy government imported oil for several months while its refinery was out of order . Non @-@ government organizations provided rice to stabilize prices . The damaged rail line between Antananarivo and the coast was rebuilt in 2003 . Schools that were repaired following Geralda were later successfully used as shelters . 
 = Māori Battalion = 
 The 28th ( Māori ) Battalion , more commonly known as the Māori Battalion , was an infantry battalion of the New Zealand Army that served during the Second World War . It was formed following pressure on the Labour government by some Māori Members of Parliament ( MPs ) and Māori organisations throughout the country which wanted a full Māori unit to be raised for service overseas . The Māori Battalion followed in the footsteps of the Māori Pioneer Battalion that served during the First World War with success , and was wanted by Māori to raise their profile , and to serve alongside their Pākehā compatriots as subjects of the British Empire . It also gave a generation of people with a well @-@ noted military ancestry a chance to test their own warrior skills . 
 Raised in 1940 as part of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) , the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division as an extra battalion that was moved between the division 's three infantry brigades . The battalion fought during the Greek , North African and Italian campaigns during which it earned a formidable reputation as a fighting force which has subsequently been acknowledged by both Allied and German commanders . It was also the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war . Following the end of hostilities , the battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force , before being disbanded in January 1946 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The 28th ( Māori ) Battalion had its origins before the start of the Second World War . In mid @-@ 1939 , as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable , Sir <unk> Ngata started to discuss proposals for the formation of a military unit made up of Māori volunteers similar to the Māori Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War . This proposal was furthered by two Māori MPs , Eruera <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and from this support within the Māori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the British Empire and to test their warrior skills . At first the New Zealand government was hesitant , but on 4 October , the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division . 
 Nevertheless , it was decided that the battalion 's key positions , including its officers , non commissioned officers ( NCOs ) and signallers , would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent . This decision was met with some consternation , so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions . In this regard , it was decided that the battalion 's first commanding officer would be a regular officer , Major George Dittmer — later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940 — and that his second @-@ in @-@ command would be a Reserve officer , Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand , a part @-@ Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major . Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience . 
 Almost immediately effort was focused upon selecting and identifying the officers and NCOs . To this end volunteers were called for amongst units that had already formed as part of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) and from new recruits . At the end of November , 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham , where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion . Concurrently , recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted . The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities , and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35 , although later married men were allowed to join , but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages . 
 On 26 January 1940 the battalion came together for the first time , marking its official raising at the Palmerston North Show Grounds . Upon formation it was decided that the battalion would be organised upon tribal lines . The unit consisted of a headquarters company and four rifle companies , designated ' A ' through ' D ' : ' A ' Company was recruited from North Auckland ; ' B ' Company from Rotorua , the Bay of Plenty and Thames – Coromandel ; ' C ' Company from the East Coast from Gisborne to East Cape and ' D ' Company from Waikato , Maniapoto , Hawkes Bay , Wellington and the South Island , as well as some Pacific Islands and the Chatham and Stewart Islands . 
 February saw the issuing of equipment and the commencement of training , however , this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi . A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion , as the unit was short of men who were able to serve in roles such as clerks , drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds . Consequently , men for these roles had to be trained from scratch . The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March , when the men were allocated to their respective companies , and on 13 March 1940 the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion was declared on active service . After 14 days leave , the battalion conducted a five @-@ week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940 . The battalion 's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks .

 Sailing upon the Aquitania via Fremantle and Cape Town , the battalion arrived at Gourock , Scotland , after six weeks at sea . Initially they had been destined to join the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East , but due to concerns about a possible invasion of the United Kingdom by the German Wehrmacht , the decision was made to divert the division 's second echelon , a brigade @-@ sized force that included the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion , to Britain to help bolster the island 's defences . 
 In late June or early July 1940 the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion was attached to a mixed brigade under Brigadier Harold Barrowclough . During this time they manned defences in the south of England and undertook further training . The battalion suffered from a lack of equipment , largely due to the priority given to re @-@ equip British units following the losses suffered by the British Expeditionary Force in France , and consequently training was largely focused upon anti @-@ gas procedures and route marching . On 6 July they were inspected by King George VI and he was said to have been impressed by the " smartness of the close order and arms drill of the Māori Battalion " and " by the fine physique , keenness and determined demeanour " of the men . 
 Shortly afterwards the Mixed Brigade began quick deployment and defensive manoeuvres in earnest , as fears of invasion grew . In between exercises , further training was undertaken and the battalion also worked to improve fixed defences throughout July and into August and September . These exercises varied in size from company to battalion @-@ level , and involved differing scenarios and enemy forces . In September , a divisional review was undertaken and amidst massive German air raids upon London , the New Zealanders were declared to be ready for front @-@ line service in the event of a German landing . Warning orders for deployment to Egypt were cancelled and the New Zealanders were placed under command of XII Corps , taking up defensive positions in the Folkestone – Dover region . 
 In October , the Māori Battalion was attached to " <unk> " , under Dittmer 's command , along with a squadron of tanks , a squadron of cavalry and a medium machine gun company . The following month , with an invasion now considered unlikely , the battalion returned to Aldershot for the winter , remaining there for two months . During this time limited training was undertaken , although upon invitation the battalion fielded a rugby team against a Welsh side at Langley Park , losing 12 – 3 . Later in the month , the battalion received the order to begin preparing for redeployment to Egypt and an advance party was dispatched in mid @-@ December . On 7 January 1941 the rest of the battalion left for the Middle East , embarking from Liverpool on the Athlone Castle . 
 = = = Middle East = = = 
 After sailing via Freetown , Cape Town and Durban , the Athlone Castle sailed up the east coast of Africa and entered the Suez Canal , arriving at Tewfik harbour on 3 March 1941 . In the afternoon the battalion entrained and two days later they arrived in the desert , where they were met by motor transport which carried them to camp <unk> , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Cairo . At this point they were met by about 300 reinforcements which were used to replace men who had been laid down with influenza and to bring the battalion up to a higher establishment . Shortly afterwards they were moved to Alexandria , where they embarked on the <unk> , bound for Greece . 
 = = = Greece = = = 
 On 6 April the German invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia began . In order to help defend Greece , a composite force of three divisions of Australian , British and New Zealand troops were to be deployed , and were grouped together under the title of ' W ' Force . However , by the time the invasion began only two of the three divisions had arrived , and the New Zealanders were consequently spread thin , holding a position to the north of Katerini , where they were tasked to defend the strategic Olympus Pass to the south . During this time , the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion was attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade , which was later grouped with other Australian and New Zealand units to form the Anzac Corps . Vastly outnumbered , within two days the situation for the Allies was not good as the Germans had broken through the defences along the Bulgarian border and the Yugoslav resistance had collapsed . As the situation worsened , orders came down from brigade headquarters that the passes would be held " to the last man and last round " . 
 On 9 April , the fall of Salonika precipitated the order for the battalion to withdraw from their positions at Katerini south to Olympus . As events unfolded elsewhere , the battalion remained in position , digging in and constructing defences until 12 April when they were ordered to withdraw behind the Mavroneri Gorge and reposition themselves on the western aspect . At this time the 5th Infantry Brigade 's orders were changed from a holding action to a delay and withdrawal . It was in the Petra Pass , alongside the 22nd Battalion , that the 28th Battalion fought its first engagement of the war . In preparation for the coming attack , the Māoris built their position , running out barbed and concertina wire and digging in while German bombers <unk> overhead . During the night they carried out patrols along the Mavroneri riverbed , but no contact was made . The following morning , the divisional cavalry , which had been carrying out a rearguard action , conducted a withdrawal through the battalion 's position , making the Māori Battalion the most forward Allied unit . As German forces were halted at Platamon by the 21st Battalion , thrusts towards Larisa once again put the battalion 's position in doubt and they were again ordered to withdraw . Meanwhile , the Anzac Corps decided to make its last stand 100 miles ( 160 km ) south at Thermopylae . 
 In the end the Māoris remained in position until 17 April . Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines , before finally they received the order to fall back . With isolated platoons still in contact with the Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain , the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging . Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass , the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units . The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance . In the end the battalion only just made it , for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3 : 00 am . 
 After meeting motor transport , the battalion moved back to Ay <unk> , which they began to prepare to defend in order to help seal off the exit of the Olympus pass . The withdrawal continued , though , and on 19 April the Māori Battalion was called upon conduct a delaying action as the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade pulled back through Larisa towards Lamia , 80 miles ( 130 km ) south . Along roads packed with vehicles and civilian traffic they withdrew amidst considerable confusion . Upon arrival at Thermopylae the battalion had had just enough time to dig in before receiving the order that they were to move their position in order to make way for the 6th Infantry Brigade . They completed this move by 21 April , taking up the same positions that Leonidas and his army had defended against Xerxes in 480 BC , according to legend . Here they took up position in a marsh and as they made preparations for its defence , on 22 April , in Athens , the decision was made that the units of the British Commonwealth forces would be withdrawn from the country . 
 Over the course of the next two days , the battalion withdrew towards Athens , where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April . They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti , destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went . In the confusion of orders and counter orders , the battalion 's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit . By 9 : 00 pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived . The operation went according to plan however , and by 3 : 00 am on 25 April the transports embarked . Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion , some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches , but a number of them were ultimately captured . The battalion 's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds , six wounded , 83 captured , 11 wounded and captured .

 After being evacuated from Greece , the Māori Battalion embarked upon the landing ship , infantry HMS Glengyle and was taken to Crete where they formed part of the island 's hastily formed garrison . The 5th Infantry Brigade was allocated to the area surrounding the airfield and the battalion was positioned on the north coast at <unk> , on the brigade 's right flank . On 20 May 1941 , the Germans launched the opening stages of their campaign with large @-@ scale glider and parachute drops of troops from Maleme to Canea . The landings were focused around the airfield and no troops landed in the area being held by the Māoris , nevertheless , a small force of glider troops were found to be occupying a house on the beach about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from them . A platoon was dispatched to attack them and after a brief fire @-@ fight in which two New Zealanders were wounded and eight Germans were killed , the 10 remaining men in the house surrendered . 
 The main German attack was focused upon the 22nd Battalion which was defending the airfield . Hard pressed , late in the day the 22nd requested reinforcements and the 5th Infantry Brigade commander , Brigadier J. Hargest , sent one company from the 23rd and one from the 28th . The task was given to ' B ' Company and , as the company commander only knew the direct route , they had a night approach march of over 8 miles ( 13 km ) to cover . During the march they came in contact with a platoon @-@ sized force of Germans which briefly held up the company before reinforcements could arrive . The German force surrendered , but in doing so one of their number threw a grenade at the New Zealanders , wounding two men . In response the Māoris fixed bayonets and carried out the first bayonet charge by a New Zealand force during the war , killing 24 . A short while later they killed another eight in a separate engagement . Continuing on towards the 22nd Battalion , they bumped into a number of small pockets of Germans before eventually linking up with the 22nd Battalion 's headquarters where they were told to return to their own lines as the decision had been made to withdraw from the airfield . Eleven hours later the company reported back to the 28th Battalion 's lines . 
 Over the course of the next ten days the battalion was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island , with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the Australian 2 / 7th Battalion at 42nd Street on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed , with the Māori accounting for 100 . However , it soon became clear that the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards Sfakia . The 5th Infantry Brigade took turns with two Australian battalions and the commandos of Layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape . 
 On 30 May the final order was received , although due to shipping losses it was not possible to evacuate everyone . In order to maintain fairness , each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away . The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark , while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind . A large number of men volunteered to remain , and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later . The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island , including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded . A further 67 were captured , of which 46 were wounded . For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete , Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order .

 After their escape from Crete , the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion was evacuated to Egypt where they were re @-@ issued with summer uniforms and began to receive reinforcements . In June they carried out a ceremonial parade for King George VI and the Queen , and the commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division , Lieutenant General Bernard Freyberg . Throughout July , the battalion undertook desert familiarisation training and sports parades before moving to Kabrit where they concentrated with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade for a three @-@ week combined operations exercise . Later , in August , they moved to a position 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of El Alamein , known as the " Kaponga Box " where throughout September and into October they undertook the unfamiliar task of road construction . In October , the brigade received orders to link up with the rest of the division in preparation for their commitment to the battle along the frontier . 
 On 11 November 1941 , the 5th Infantry Brigade concentrated near Mersa Matruh . Three days later the division had assembled and began the advance into Libya . Their first task was to capture the seaside town of Sollum , which was taken on 23 November from its Italian garrison with only a few casualties . Follow @-@ up artillery inflicted 18 killed and 33 wounded however , including the commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel George Dittmer , and two company commanders . Two hundred and forty @-@ seven Italian prisoners were taken . Following this , the 5th Infantry Brigade was placed under the command of the 4th Indian Division and the 28th Battalion took up positions near Bardia . 
 Three days later the battalion attacked a column of tanks and motorised infantry before ambushing a column at Menastir on 3 December . Later , notable actions were undertaken at Gazala and at Sidi <unk> where over 1 @,@ 000 Italians prisoners were captured . Following this , the battalion was deployed to Syria before returning to Egypt in June 1942 . Now officially under the command of a Māori for the first time — Lieutenant Colonel Eruera Love having taken over from Dyer in May — the Māoris took part in the 2nd New Zealand Division 's breakout from Minqar Qaim , undertaking a successful bayonet charge . At this time , the battalion 's skills with the bayonet earned them a reputation as " scalp hunters " among German commanders , including Rommel . 
 In September and October the battalion took part in important actions as part of the offensive in the Munassib Depression and at Miteiriya Ridge during the Second Battle of El Alamein . On 2 November the battalion supported the final breakthrough by Allied forces that decided the outcome of the battle . Casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between July and November 1942 . Nevertheless , the battalion remained in the fighting and in March 1943 , at Medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to the offensive at Point 209 in the Tebaga Gap , where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a German panzer grenadier battalion . It was during this action that Second Lieutenant Moana @-@ Nui @-@ a @-@ Kiwa Ngarimu performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross . The battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bennett , also received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership during the attack . 
 Two weeks later , on the night 19 / 20 April 1943 , the battalion took part in the 5th Infantry Brigade 's attack on the Tunisian village of Takrouna . The village was situated atop a steep slope , and the attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines , which wounded a number of men , including the commanding officer . Nevertheless , two sections under the command of Sergeant Haane te Rauawa Manahi , managed to scale the western side of the escarpment and gain a foothold on the pinnacle in the early dawn . Following heavy shellfire and hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the Italian defenders , the Māoris were forced off the pinnacle twice ; each time , though , Manahi led his small force in a counterattack . In the afternoon , Manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions , encircling the Italians and forcing them to surrender . For these actions , Manahi was also recommended for a Victoria Cross , but the nomination was not approved and he received a Distinguished Conduct Medal instead .

 The battalion returned to Egypt with the 5th Infantry Brigade in late @-@ May and underwent a period of refit and retraining , during which the bulk of the original unit was given three months leave and returned to New Zealand . Following the evacuation to hospital of Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> , there were no suitable senior Māori officers available and he was replaced as commanding officer by Lieutenant Colonel Monty Fairbrother on 11 September . Having taken no part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July – August , the 2nd New Zealand Division was committed to battle again in late 1943 as part of Eighth Army during the Italian Campaign . The Māori Battalion subsequently arrived in Italy on 22 October , landing at Taranto . 5th Infantry Brigade undertook a period of training in close @-@ country tactics , remaining in camp at Taranto until 18 November when it was ordered to move north 250 miles ( 400 km ) to join the Eighth Army . 
 The 2nd New Zealand Division had moved into the front line in November in order to relieve the 8th Indian Division and would take part in the advance across the Sangro planned for the end of the month . The brigade subsequently occupied positions around <unk> , with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve , occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley . The Eighth Army 's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander — commander of the 15th Army Group — had planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps . Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power , bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap . Heavy rain flooded the river , forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements . In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began , supported by heavy artillery concentrations . The New Zealanders advanced steadily , capturing the bulk of their objectives . The Māori Battalion , still in brigade reserve , stood to during the attack but was not required . 
 During December the 2nd New Zealand Division took part in the Moro River Campaign . By this time the attacking battalions had exploited forward towards the Winter Line and the Māori Battalion moved forward by truck on 1 December , crossing the Sangro . Heavy congestion on the road delayed the battalion 's movements , and although scheduled to assault towards Elici , they arrived to find the 23rd Battalion and the Division Cavalry had already completed the task . The Māoris were again ordered into reserve , occupying positions 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of <unk> . Meanwhile , on 3 December , the 6th Infantry Brigade assaulted Orsogna , and was involved in heavy fighting there , first capturing and then losing it following a counter @-@ attack by German armour . A subsequent attack against Orsogna was planned by the New Zealanders utilising both the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades . The attack was scheduled for 7 December , with both brigades to advance on a one battalion front . The Māori Battalion would lead the assault in the 5th Infantry Brigade section , up the <unk> spur to cut the Orsogna – Ortona road east of the 6th Infantry Brigade 's objective . Fairbrother planned to assault with two companies forward , one in depth and one in reserve , with support from armour and anti @-@ tank guns . This could not be provided though , as difficult terrain prevented tracked vehicles from moving across the Moro and up on to <unk> . 
 The attack on <unk> began at 3 : 30 pm , following a half @-@ hour artillery bombardment , and marked the battalion 's first battle on Italian soil . Although initially some progress was made , the Germans managed to hold <unk> throughout December amidst intense hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting . Finally , the Māoris were withdrawn from the line on the night of 15 / 16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit . Over the course of the battle , they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded . 
 The New Zealanders were subsequently transferred to the Fifth Army for its advance up the west coast of Italy towards Rome . Leaving behind the bitter cold on the other side of the peninsula , the battalion undertook a period of training and reorganisation near Sant ' Angelo d <unk> . At this time Fairbrother was replaced by another <unk> officer , Major Russell Young , who was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently led the battalion until July 1944 . 
 As part of the Fifth Army 's advance up the Liri valley , the Māori Battalion 's next major engagement came in early 1944 when they took part in the fighting around Monte Cassino . The position at Cassino was dominated by an historic Benedictine monastery . Throughout January the Allies continued their advance , but as they were checked by the German positions at Cassino the advance stalled . On the night of 17 / 18 February 1944 , as part of an attempt to establish a bridgehead into the German lines , the Māoris were tasked with attacking the railway station in Cassino . They met very stiff resistance , and although they managed to reach the railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders . Lacking armoured support , which had failed to arrive , they fought through the morning and into the afternoon , but when their position was assaulted by two German tanks they were forced to withdraw . The two assaulting companies , ' A ' and ' B ' , suffered over 60 per cent casualties , losing 128 men killed or wounded . In March they were again involved in fighting around Cassino , however , it was not until May that the position was eventually captured , by which time the New Zealanders had been withdrawn from the line , and transferred back to the Eighth Army . 
 Due to these losses , the battalion did not return to the front until July 1944 . It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards Florence and is believed to have been first to reach the city on 4 August . During this time Major <unk> Awatere led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with jaundice , although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around Rimini in September . In November , Awatere took over command substantively , and in December the battalion launched an attack around Faenza , for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order . The winter snow set in after this and , as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere , offensive action died down . Thus , throughout January , February and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties , before being withdrawn from the line in mid @-@ March . 
 In April 1945 the battalion returned to the front line to take part in the final stages of the war . On 1 April the battalion entered the line near <unk> along with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade and for the next month they were involved in five main battles along the Senio , Santerno , Sillaro , Gaiana and Idice rivers as the Allies pursued the Germans back towards Trieste . It was in Trieste that the Māori Battalion 's war came to an end . Their involvement in the final stages of the fighting in Italy had cost them 25 killed and 117 wounded , while losses for the entire Italian campaign were 230 men killed , and 887 wounded . 
 = = = Disbandment = = = 
 On 2 May 1945 news was received that all German forces west of the Isonzo River had surrendered . While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy , it was all but over . Five days later , on the night of 7 May , the battalion received the momentous news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies , and that the war in Europe was over . Nevertheless , tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion remained on high alert . This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River . 
 Following this the routine of the battalion became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach . Afterwards , preparations began for the battalion 's return to New Zealand . The war with Japan continued however , and at the time it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific . New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service . In this regard , commencing in late May , drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion . This included the commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel <unk> Awatere , who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare . 
 Throughout July the battalion undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene . On 15 August 1945 news was received of Japan 's unconditional surrender , ending plans for the battalion to take part in further combat in the Pacific . In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre , memorial services would be held at the locations of the division 's major battles . As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete , while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge , Faenza , Forli , Padua , Monfalcone and Udine . 
 The last batch of long service men had departed shortly after the battalion 's arrival at Lake Trasimene , and so after this it was decided that the battalion would return to New Zealand as a formed unit . As such their return was to be delayed and so they found winter quarters in Florence . At this time it was decided that men from the battalion would be included within the New Zealand contribution to the occupation of Japan . In this vein , a 270 @-@ strong contingent from the battalion was sent to Japan under the designation of ' D ' Squadron , 2nd Divisional Cavalry Battalion , under the command of Major <unk> Baker . Finally , on 6 December the battalion entrained at Florence and embarked on the troopship Dominion Monarch at Taranto on Boxing Day . Passing through the Suez Canal , they sailed via Fremantle , arriving in Wellington on 23 January 1946 , where they were met by the acting Prime Minister , Walter Nash , at <unk> Quay for an official Māori welcome home ceremony . Afterwards the men were sent back to their homes and the battalion was disbanded . 
 Throughout the course of the war , 3 @,@ 600 men served in the battalion . Of these , 649 were killed or died of wounds while another 1 @,@ 712 were wounded . Another 29 died as a result of service following discharge , while two were killed by accident during training in New Zealand . The Māori Battalion 's service against the Germans in North Africa earned them a distinguished reputation . Such was the respect that Allied commanders had for the Māori Battalion that they were frequently used as a spearhead unit . Bernard Freyberg , the General Officer Commanding of the 2NZEF , commented , " No infantry had a more distinguished record , or saw more fighting , or , alas , had such heavy casualties , as the Maori Battalion . " The battalion 's reputation was also acknowledged by their opponents . Some sources state that the Afrika Korps commander , Erwin Rommel remarked , " Give me the Maori Battalion and I will conquer the world " . Although , other sources attribute this comment to Rommel 's former chief of staff , General Siegfried Westphal , who met with the former Māori Battalion chaplain , Reverend Canon W. T. <unk> , during an Afrika Korps reunion dinner in Mainz , Germany , in 1972 . 
 = = Decorations = = 
 In total , the Māori Battalion received more individual bravery decorations than any other New Zealand battalion . One member of the battalion , Second Lieutenant Moana @-@ Nui @-@ a @-@ Kiwa Ngarimu , was awarded the Victoria Cross during the war , while another member , Sergeant Haane Manahi , was also recommended for the award . During the fighting around Takrouna in 1943 , Manahi led a section of men up a sheer limestone escarpment to capture a number of Italian positions ; the following day he set out to capture Italian outposts . Four generals , including Harold Alexander , Bernard Freyberg , Howard Kippenberger and Bernard Law Montgomery had recommended that Manahi receive the Victoria Cross but this recommendation was downgraded in London to the Distinguished Conduct Medal . 
 In 2000 , iwi Te Arawa lodged a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal for Haane Manahi to have his award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal upgraded to a Victoria Cross . In December 2005 the Waitangi Tribunal released their findings supporting the claim , but in October 2006 the New Zealand Minister of Defence announced that the award could not be made as King George VI had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made . Instead , it was decided that Manahi would be recognised by the presentation of an altar cloth , a personal letter from Queen Elizabeth II acknowledging his gallantry and a sword . The award was presented to Manahi 's son by The Duke of York on 17 March 2007 at a ceremony in Rotorua . 
 Other awards to members of the 28th ( Māori ) Battalion included : seven Distinguished Service Orders ; one Member of the Order of the British Empire ; 21 Military Crosses and three bars ; and 13 Distinguished Conduct Medals ; 51 Military Medals ; one British Empire Medal and one US Silver Star .

 = Yugoslav monitor Sava = 
 The Yugoslav monitor Sava was a Temes @-@ class river monitor built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as SMS Bodrog . She fired the first shots of World War I on the night of 28 July 1914 , when she and two other monitors shelled Serbian defences near Belgrade . She was part of the Danube Flotilla , and fought the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the mouth of the Danube . In the closing stages of the war , she was the last monitor to withdraw towards Budapest , but was captured by the Serbs when she grounded on a sandbank downstream from Belgrade . After the war , she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) , and renamed Sava . 
 During the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , Sava served with the 1st Monitor Division . Along with her fellow monitor Vardar , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border during the first few days of the invasion . The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe , but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade . Due to high river levels and low bridges , navigation was difficult , and Sava was scuttled on 11 April . Some of her crew tried to escape cross @-@ country towards the southern Adriatic coast , but all were captured prior to the Yugoslav surrender . The vessel was later raised by the navy of the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia and continued to serve as Sava until the night of 8 September 1944 when she was again scuttled . 
 Following World War II , Sava was raised once again , and was refurbished to serve in the Yugoslav Navy from 1952 to 1962 . She was then transferred to a state @-@ owned company that was eventually privatised . As of 2014 , Sava was still in service as a gravel barge . In 2005 , the government of Serbia granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a floating museum , but little else has been done to restore her . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 A Temes @-@ class river monitor , the ship was built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy by H. Schönichen , and designed by Austrian naval architect Josef Thiel . Originally named SMS Bodrog , she was laid down at <unk> on 14 February 1903 . Like her sister ship SMS Temes , she had an overall length of 57 @.@ 7 m ( 189 ft 4 in ) , a beam of 9 @.@ 5 m ( 31 ft 2 in ) , and a normal draught of 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 ft 11 in ) . Her standard displacement was 440 tonnes ( 430 long tons ) , and her crew consisted of 86 officers and enlisted men . Bodrog had two triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam was provided by two Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers , and her engines were rated at 1 @,@ 400 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 000 kW ) . As designed , she had a maximum speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) , and carried 62 tonnes ( 61 long tons ) of coal . 
 Bodrog was armed with two 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 35 guns in single gun turrets , a single 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 10 howitzer in a central pivot mount , and two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . The maximum range of her Škoda 120 mm guns was 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) , and her howitzer could fire its 20 kg ( 44 lb ) shells a maximum of 6 @.@ 2 km ( 3 @.@ 9 mi ) . Her armour consisted of belt , bulkheads and gun turrets 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and deck armour 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick . The armour on her conning tower was 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . Bodrog was launched on 12 April 1904 , commissioned on 2 August 1904 , and completed on 10 November 1904 .

 Bodrog was part of the Danube Flotilla , and at the start of World War I she was based in Zemun , just upstream from Belgrade on the Danube , under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant ( LSL ) Paul Ekl . She shared the base with three other monitors and three patrol boats . Austria @-@ Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914 , and that night Bodrog and two other monitors fired the first shots of the war against Serb fortifications on the Zemun – Belgrade railway bridge over the Sava river and on Topčider Hill . The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors , and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians . This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns and the establishment of river obstacles and mines . On 8 September , the Austro @-@ Hungarian base at Zemun was evacuated in the face of a Serbian counterattack . Bodrog and the minesweeper Andor conducted a deception operation towards Pančevo on 19 September , and six days later , Bodrog bombarded Serb positions on the bank of the Sava near Belgrade . On 28 September , she rendezvoused with the monitor SMS Szamos at <unk> , and the following day the two monitors targeted the Belgrade Fortress and conducted a reconnaissance of Zemun . On 1 October , Bodrog sailed to Budapest , where she was placed in dry dock for two weeks . She returned to the flotilla on 15 October . By November , French artillery support had arrived in Belgrade , endangering the monitor 's anchorage , and on 12 November , Ekl was replaced by LSL Olaf Wulff . The stalemate continued until the following month , when the Serbs evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro @-@ Hungarian assault . On 1 December , Bodrog and the newly commissioned monitor SMS Enns engaged the retreating Serbs . After less than two weeks , the Austro @-@ Hungarians retreated from Belgrade , and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French support . Bodrog continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December , when her base was withdrawn to Petrovaradin , near Novi Sad , for the winter . 
 The Germans and Austro @-@ Hungarians wanted to transport munitions down the Danube to the Ottoman Empire , so on 24 December 1914 , Bodrog and the minesweeper Almos escorted the steamer <unk> loaded with munitions , the patrol boat b and two tugs from Zemun past Belgrade towards the Iron Gates gorge on the Serbian – Romanian border . The convoy ran the gauntlet of the Belgrade defences unharmed , but when it reached Smederevo it received information that the Russians had established a minefield and log barrier just south of the Iron Gates . It turned back under heavy fire , and withdrew as far as Pančevo without serious damage to any vessel . Bodrog returned to base , and the monitor SMS Inn was sent to guard the munitions and escort the convoy back to Petrovaradin . In January 1915 , British artillery arrived in Belgrade , further bolstering its defences , and Bodrog spent the first months of the year at Zemun . On 23 February , LSL <unk> Böhm took command . On 1 March , Bodrog and several other vessels including the monitor SMS Körös were relocated to Petrovaradin . After the commencement of the Gallipoli campaign , munitions supply to the Ottomans became critical , so another attempt was planned . On 30 March , the steamer Belgrad left Zemun , escorted by Bodrog and Enns . The convoy was undetected as it sailed past Belgrade at night during a storm , but after the monitors returned to base , Belgrad struck a mine near Vinča , and after coming under heavy artillery fire , exploded near Ritopek . On 22 April 1915 , a British picket boat that had been brought overland by rail from Salonika was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun , firing two torpedoes without success . 
 In September 1915 , the Central Powers were joined by Bulgaria , and the Serbian Army soon faced an overwhelming Austro @-@ Hungarian , German and Bulgarian ground invasion . In early October , the Austro @-@ Hungarian 3rd Army attacked Belgrade , and Bodrog , along with the majority of the flotilla , was heavily engaged in support of crossings near the Belgrade Fortress and the island of Ada Ciganlija . 
 = = = = Romanian campaign = = = = 
 Following the capture of Belgrade on 11 October and the initial clearance of mines and other obstacles , the flotilla sailed downstream to Orșova near the Hungarian – Romanian border and waited for the lower Danube to be swept for mines . Commencing on 30 October 1915 , they escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to Lom where the munitions were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the Ottoman Empire . 
 In November 1915 , Bodrog and the other monitors were assembled at Rustschuk , Bulgaria . The Central Powers were aware that the Romanians were negotiating to enter the war on the side of the Entente , so the flotilla established a sheltered base in the Belene Canal to protect the 480 @-@ kilometre ( 300 mi ) Danube border between Romania and Bulgaria . During 1915 , the 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns on the Bodrog were replaced with a single 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) L / 18 gun , and three machine guns were also fitted . 
 When the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916 , the monitors were again at Rustschuk , and were immediately attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu . The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a lighter loaded with fuel . Tasked with shelling Giurgiu the following day , the Second Monitor Division , consisting of Bodrog and three other monitors , set fire to oil storage tanks , the railway station and magazines , and sank several Romanian lighters . While the attack was underway , the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage . Bodrog and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer on their way back to Belene . This was followed by forays of the Division both east and west of Belene , during which both Turnu Măgurele and Zimnicea were shelled . 
 On 2 October 1916 , Bodrog and Körös attacked a Romanian pontoon bridge being established across the Danube at Oryahovo , obtaining five direct hits , thus contributing to the defeat of the Romanian Flămânda Offensive . This was followed by action supporting the crossing of Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen 's Austro @-@ Hungarian Third Army at Sistow . Bodrog then wintered at Turnu Severin . 
 From 21 February 1917 , Bodrog and Körös were deployed as guardships at Brăila . On 1 March , Bodrog became stuck in ice at nearby <unk> . LSL Guido <unk> took command of Bodrog in 1918 . That year 's spring thaw saw Bodrog , Körös , Szamos , Bosna and several other vessels sent through the mouth of the Danube into the Black Sea as part of Flottenabteilung Wulff ( Fleet Division Wulff ) under the command of Flottenkapitän ( Fleet Captain ) Olav Wulff , arriving in Odessa on 12 April . On 15 July , she and Bosna sailed to the port of Nikolaev , and from 5 August , Bodrog was stationed at Cherson . On 12 September , she returned to Brăila along with other vessels . 
 Bodrog was sent to Reni near the mouth of the Danube to protect withdrawing Austro @-@ Hungarian troops , arriving there on 1 October . She then sailed upstream , reaching Rustschuk on 11 October , and Giurgiu two days later . On 14 October , she was deployed at Lom . She was the last Austro @-@ Hungarian monitor to withdraw towards Budapest and was the only one that failed to reach the city . On 31 October 1918 , Bodrog collided with a sand bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča . She was later captured by the Serbian Army . 
 = = = Interwar period and World War II = = = 
 From the Armistice to September 1919 , Bodrog was crewed by sailors of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> Srba , Hrvata i <unk> , KSCS ; later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) . Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , Bodrog was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels , including three other river monitors , but was not officially handed over to the KSCS Navy and renamed Sava until 15 April 1920 . Her sister ship Temes was transferred to Romania and renamed <unk> . In 1925 – 26 , Sava was refitted , but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time . In 1932 , the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training , and few exercises or manoeuvres , due to reduced budgets . 
 Sava was based at Dubovac when the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 . She was assigned to the 1st Monitor Division , and was responsible for the Romanian border on the Danube , under the operational control of the 3rd Infantry Division Dunavska . Her commander was Poručnik bojnog broda S. Rojos . 
 On that day , Sava and her fellow monitor Vardar fought off several attacks by individual Luftwaffe aircraft on their base . Over the next three days , the two monitors laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border . On 11 April , they were forced to withdraw from Dubovac towards Belgrade . During their withdrawal , they came under repeated attacks by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers . Sava and her fellow monitor were undamaged , and anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade at about 20 : 00 , where they were joined by the Morava . The three captains conferred , and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges , which meant there was insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely . The crews of the monitors were then transshipped to two tugboats , but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge , charges on the bridge accidentally exploded and the bridge fell onto the tugboat . Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel , 95 were killed . 
 After the scuttling of the monitors , around 450 officers and men from the Sava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac . Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels , the crews started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in two groups . The smaller of the two groups reached its objective , but the larger group only made it as far as Sarajevo by 14 April before they were obliged to surrender . The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor , which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April . 
 Sava was raised and repaired by the navy of the Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia , and served under that name alongside her fellow monitor Morava , which was raised , repaired , and renamed Bosna . Along with six captured motorboats and ten auxiliary vessels , they made up the riverine police force of the Croatian state . Sava was part of the 1st Patrol Group of the River Flotilla Command , headquartered at Zemun . Her crew scuttled her near Slavonski Brod on the night of 8 September 1944 and defected to the Yugoslav Partisans .

 According to lead vocalist Bart Millard , MercyMe had started as a rock band and had wanted to make a rock record . Following the success of their breakthrough single " I Can Only Imagine " , a ballad , they were advised to " duplicate [ ' I Can Only Imagine ' ] on the next two records " . Millard says they felt that they were at a point where " we are known more for ballads than the rock band we wanted to be " . With the consent of their label , which felt there was a trend towards heavier music , MercyMe decided to make an " edgier " record . In particular the band focused on up @-@ tempo songs , trying to put more edge into what they were making . Millard noted that while the songs are still pop rock songs , the band tried to put a bit more edge into them . Additionally , the band decided to work with producer Brown Bannister , who had produced the group 's Christmas record and Millard 's solo album <unk> No. 1 , as opposed to Pete Kipley , who had produced the band 's previous three albums . Bannister 's producing style was different from Kipley 's ; while Kipley was a hands @-@ on producer , " involved in every part of the song " , Bannister would wait until the band had " run down all [ their ] avenues " before giving input . The band felt <unk> was an " amazing encourager " and were satisfied with the Christmas album Bannister had produced with him ; although they felt Kipley did a great job on their previous records , improving themselves as a band and as songwriters , they felt it was " time for a change " . Another factor in the decision to use Bannister was his previous recording experience ; Bannister had produced one of Millard 's favorite albums , White Heart 's 1989 album Freedom . The different approach the band took with Bannister resulted in a sometimes " radical " approach , with the band " taking songs apart , putting them back together and , at times , totally reinventing them " . One song , " Something About You " , shifted from " an aggressive rock song to a soaring anthem " . 
 The tracks on Coming Up to Breathe were recorded in Allaire Studios in Shokan , New York ; the studio had previously hosted artists such as Norah Jones , Tim McGraw , and David Bowie . Overdubs were recorded at Oxford Sound in Nashville , Tennessee . Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London , England by the London Session Orchestra . Recording sessions at Allaire started in October 2005 , and lasted a month . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Although Coming Up to Breathe possesses an overall heavier tone than MercyMe 's previous albums , it has been described as an extension or a shift in presentation rather than a total departure . The sound of the album has been described as epitomizing the genre of modern rock . Guitars and guitar solos are more prominent on the album . 
 As a whole , the album does not mention Jesus directly by name ; the only song to do so , " Bring the Rain " uses his name in the refrain " Jesus , bring the rain " . " I Would Die for You " is also a tribute to a teen who died after serving on a mission field . " One Trick Pony " is a response to MercyMe 's critics who argue that the band recycles the same song over and over . " So Long Self " is about bidding farewell to sinful nature , while " Hold Fast " is a reminder of God 's presence through difficult times . " Something About You " and " 3 : 42 a.m. ( Writer 's Block ) " both relate to the difficulty of writing a song about an omnipotent God . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Coming Up to Breathe received positive reception from music critics . Steve Losey of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars , saying " In a concerted effort to revert back to the days when they were more a rock band and less of a hitmaking machine , MercyMe delivers . While it 's certainly not heavy metal , the songs definitely keep driving forward . Guitars are more prominent and production leans on a more earthy formula ... MercyMe is able to rock on portions of each song but they always bring it back to a memorable chorus or a hooky verse . That 's the formula that has always worked for them , and it does here , too " . Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted that " For the most part , MercyMe has built a multiplatinum foundation on compelling power ballads . But on this set , the Texas band rocks out with passion and edgy intensity . It doesn 't stray so far that it would alienate the faithful , but it delivers a powerful collection of pop / rock that should take the band 's career to a new level " . She also praised Millard 's vocals and called it a " landmark album in an already impressive career " . Mark Joseph of CCM Magazine gave the album a B- ; he called the album " enjoyable " but suggesting that a stronger producer or A & R team would have resulted in better lyrics . Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars , praising the vocals and string arrangements as well as the choir on " Bring the Rain " . Russ Breimeier of The Fish called Coming Up to Breathe MercyMe 's " best album to date " and an " impressive step in the right direction for a band that many have pegged to be too formulaic " , but derided the album 's " simplistic songwriting " . 
 Lauren <unk> of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four out of five stars , calling it " unlike anything we 've heard from [ MercyMe ] so far " and " undeniably strong project from MercyMe " . She suggested that some of the lyrics off the album are too predictable , but said that " some places [ on the album ] display some of the best songwriting we have heard from the band so far " . Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of four stars , opining that it " has the feel of a blockbuster rock album " but suggesting that the Christian songwriting on the record would limit its success . 
 Coming Up to Breathe was nominated for Best Pop / Contemporary Gospel Album at the 49th Grammy Awards . It was also nominated for Pop / Contemporary Album of the Year at the 38th GMA Dove Awards . " Bring the Rain " was nominated for Dove Award for Song of the Year at the 39th GMA Dove Awards .

 = John Mousinho = 
 John Michael Lewis Mousinho ( born 30 April 1986 ) is an English professional footballer who plays for Burton Albion as a midfielder . 
 Mousinho began his professional football career at Brentford , having previously been on the books at Chesham United and Notre Dame Fighting Irish , the latter whilst studying at the University of Notre Dame . He spent two and a half years at Brentford , before joining Wycombe Wanderers in June 2008 on a free transfer . Mousinho played regularly for Wycombe for two seasons ; witnessing both a promotion and relegation during his tenure at the Buckinghamshire club . He rejected a contract extension from Wycombe in June 2010 , and instead opted to join Stevenage on a two – year contract . In his first season at Stevenage , Mousinho helped guide the club to back @-@ to @-@ back promotions , scoring the winner in the 2010 – 11 League Two play @-@ off final , as well as finishing as the club 's joint top goalscorer for the season . Following an injury @-@ hit season during the 2011 – 12 campaign , Mousinho left Stevenage and joined Preston North End . In his final season at the club , he was loaned to Gillingham and back to Stevenage before being released and joining Burton in June 2014 .

 Born in Isleworth , Greater London , Mousinho was signed by then Brentford manager Martin Allen during the 2005 – 06 season , after returning from the United States where he was studying and playing at the University of Notre Dame . He was recommended to Brentford by Martin Allen 's son , having previously been on the books at Chesham United . He made his Brentford debut in October 2005 in a 1 – 1 against Oxford United in the Football League Trophy ; playing the whole match . He made his league debut for the club two months later in a 4 – 1 away win over Tranmere Rovers , coming on as a 76th @-@ minute substitute . Initially he acted as cover for regular right @-@ back Kevin O 'Connor , but was then played in a central midfield role . He was also the outfield player chosen to play as goalkeeper against Gillingham in 2006 , when Clark Masters was sent @-@ off , and there was not a substitute goalkeeper available ; the game ended 2 – 2 with Mousinho playing 75 minutes in goal . 
 Mousinho was then sent on loan to several non – league clubs in the form of Woking , Slough Town , and Yeading respectively mid – way through the 2005 – 06 season . He failed to make any first – team appearances for Woking , with his loan spell lasting just two weeks . He was loaned to Slough Town just days later , and made his debut for the club in a 2 – 1 away win over Fisher Athletic , before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3 – 2 win over Bromley – Mousinho scoring a goal in the 58th minute as Slough came from two goals down to win the match . In April 2006 , he was loaned out to Conference South side Yeading , where he played a total of six times , making his debut in the club 's 4 – 0 defeat to Basingstoke Town . Martin Allen stated that Mousinho 's loan moves were " positive " and " definitely not the end of his time at Brentford " . 
 On return to his parent club , Mousinho played a lot more frequently during the 2006 – 07 season , a total of 39 times , and was subsequently rewarded with an extended contract which was due to run until June 2009 . The following campaign , he scored his first goal for the club in a 2 – 1 win against Barnet – tapping in the rebound from Kevin O 'Connor 's missed penalty , and also scored Brentford 's first against Dagenham & Redbridge shortly after . However , he only played a total of 24 times in all competitions , 15 times less than during the club 's previous campaign . At the end of the 2007 – 08 season , Mousinho was transfer – listed by manager Andy Scott because he did not feature in the club 's future plans and , as a result , his first – team chances would be limited . 
 = = = Wycombe Wanderers = = = 
 His contract was terminated by mutual consent with a year to run on 16 June 2008 and he joined Wycombe later that day . On joining Wycombe , Mousinho said " It 's been my local club since I was quite young so I 've been down here a few times and it was the lure of that , plus the chance to work with Peter Taylor , that made me jump at the chance " . He made his debut for Wycombe in a 1 – 1 draw against Morecambe , and scored his first goal for the club shortly after in a 2 – 0 away victory over Chester City . Shortly after this , Wycombe triggered a one – year extension clause in his contract , subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010 . Mousinho scored his second goal of the season in Wycombe 's 3 – 3 draw against his former employers , Brentford , netting in the first – half of the game with a volley . Two weeks later , he provided the assist for John <unk> 's goal in the club 's 1 – 1 draw with Barnet . He played a total of 38 times in all competitions during his first season with the club , scoring twice as Wycombe earned promotion to League One after finishing in the third and final automatic promotion place . The following season , he played a further 41 games for the club , scoring once in a 5 – 2 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion , but Wycombe were relegated at the end of the season . During his two years at Wycombe , he played a total of 79 times for the club , scoring three goals . 
 = = = Stevenage = = = 
 In late June 2010 , Mousinho rejected a contract extension at Wycombe , which led to Wycombe manager Gary Waddock saying " we wanted to keep John , but he 's decided to go elsewhere . It 's an open secret where he 's going " . Two days later Mousinho joined newly promoted League Two outfit Stevenage on a two – year deal , officially signing for the club on 1 July . A day later , he was assigned the number 21 shirt ahead of the 2010 – 11 season . Mousinho made his Stevenage debut in the club 's 1 – 0 loss to Bradford City in the club 's second game of the season , playing the whole game in the centre of midfield . He scored his first goal for Stevenage in October 2010 , scoring the equaliser in the club 's 1 – 1 draw with Rotherham United . A month later , Mousinho scored twice in Stevenage 's 3 – 0 victory away at local rivals Barnet . Mousinho scored his fourth goal of the season in a 1 – 0 away win at his former employers , Wycombe Wanderers , at Adams Park , scoring with a low drilled shot from 30 yards out . Ten days later , Mousinho scored both of Stevenage 's goals in their 2 – 0 away win against Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium . This subsequently meant that all six of Mousinho 's goals were scored away from Broadhall Way , although this record ended when he scored a penalty in Stevenage 's 2 – 1 home win against Bradford City on 2 April 2011 . Mousinho was sent @-@ off for the first time in his Stevenage career on 30 April 2011 , receiving a straight red card in Stevenage 's 2 – 0 defeat at Northampton Town . The red card meant that Mousinho served a three @-@ game suspension . Stevenage appealed against the sending off , but were unsuccessful . He subsequently missed the club 's 3 – 3 draw against Bury , as well as Stevenage 's 3 – 0 aggregate play @-@ off win against Accrington Stanley . Mousinho returned to the first @-@ team for the 2010 – 11 play @-@ off final against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011 , a game in which he scored the only goal with a strike from 20 yards out in a 1 – 0 Stevenage victory .

 Mousinho missed the start of the 2011 – 12 season due to suffering a calf injury during pre @-@ season , subsequently missing Stevenage 's first three games of the campaign . He returned to first @-@ team action on 16 August 2011 , starting in a 3 – 1 away victory against Bournemouth , scoring Stevenage 's second goal of the game from the penalty spot . Mousinho 's second goal of the season came in Stevenage 's 5 – 1 win against Sheffield Wednesday at Broadhall Way , beating defender Rob Jones for pace before driving a shot from 20 yards past goalkeeper Richard O 'Donnell . He injured a metatarsal bone in his right foot in Stevenage 's 1 – 0 away victory against Hartlepool United in the FA Cup on 12 November 2011 , and was subsequently ruled out of first @-@ team action for six weeks . Mousinho suffered another setback in January , when scans revealed further damage to the metatarsal bone . After a brief substitute appearance in Stevenage 's reserve game against Southend United in early April 2012 , Mousinho returned to first @-@ team action on 14 April 2012 , coming on as a late substitute in the club 's 6 – 0 away victory at Yeovil Town . In the club 's next match , a " vital " game against fellow play @-@ off contenders Carlisle United , Mousinho came on as a substitute in the 73rd minute and scored the winning goal three minutes later as Stevenage ran out 1 – 0 winners . He made 23 appearances during an injury @-@ hit season , scoring three goals .
