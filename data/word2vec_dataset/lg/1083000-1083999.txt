 Mariela <unk> , a reporter for the daily newspaper La Hora , reported that the ground collapsed suddenly , taking a three @-@ story house that was used as a factory , and possibly a security guard , along with it . Electricity poles were also sucked in . Authorities said they could not confirm the security guard 's death . 
 The sinkhole 's collapse in Guatemala City 's Zona 2 left at least 15 dead , and a further 300 residents ' lives were put at risk . Because of the role played by sewage pipes in the sinkhole 's collapse , Sam Bonis , along with other geologists , has demanded that the government inspect the sewer system more regularly . 
 According to officials , the sinkhole had similarities with another Guatemalan sinkhole which collapsed in 2007 , which may also have been formed by ruptured sewage pipes . 
 On a wider scale , immediately following reports of fatalities due to Agatha , a state of emergency was declared for Guatemala . On May 31 , the government started to deploy national aid , and donation centers for victims of the storm were opened across the country . According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , schools in Guatemala were to be closed until at least June 4 .

 Immediately after the sinkhole 's collapse , there were plans to fill it in with a soil cement made from cement , limestone , and water known locally as <unk> . This substance was also used to fill in the 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole . However , another technique , which geologists call the graded @-@ filter technique , in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders , smaller rocks , and gravel , could possibly be a better solution . This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas , potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring in other parts of the city . The graded @-@ filter technique , on the other hand , allows water to seep through . 
 = Cannon Fodder 3 = 
 Cannon Fodder 3 is an action @-@ strategy PC game developed and published – originally in Russia – by Game Factory Interactive ( GFI ) , along with developer <unk> CT . The game is the second sequel to Cannon Fodder , a commercially and critically successful game released for multiple formats in 1993 . Jon Hare and his company Sensible Software , the developers of Cannon Fodder and its prior sequel , were uninvolved with Cannon Fodder 3 . GFI instead licensed the intellectual property from now @-@ owner Codemasters . 
 The game is a combination of action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling enemy terrorists . The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed . The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies , their vehicles and installations . 
 Cannon Fodder 3 was released in Russia in December 2011 and – via download service GamersGate – Europe and North America on 9 February 2012 , receiving mixed reviews . Reviewers found the game to be enjoyable but limited and repetitive . The graphics and humour received both positive and negative criticism . Critics derided the poor English translations as well as technical problems . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Cannon Fodder 3 has a basic premise involving American soldiers battling disparate terrorists who have united with the aim of world domination . Like the earlier games in the series , it features a mix of " old school " action and strategy gameplay viewed from an isometric perspective . The player directs a small squad of soldiers , primarily with the mouse though the keyboard is used to deploy additional weaponry . The control system " is very similar to ‘ twin @-@ stick ’ shooters like Geometry Wars , except here you control just one of the four soldiers while the others fall in line , shooting when the lead does . " Each squad begins with four soldiers . They are fragile ( though , possessing health bars , are somewhat tougher than the protagonists of the originals ) , but increase in status and power should they survive ; the player is provided with a replacement squad should all his platoon die . The player can also split the squad into smaller units should strategy so require . The game has an online cooperative mode for up to four players , though Strategy Informer noted this mode is unpopular . As well as facing large numbers of equally frail enemy infantry , the player must combat vehicles , buildings and turrets which cannot be destroyed with the standard machine guns . For this reason , the player must rely on explosive secondary weapons such as grenades and rockets , which are essential to destroy enemy structures and more powerful units . He can also make use of vehicles – such as tanks and helicopters – as well as various power @-@ ups . The game features an extensively destructible environment and several settings , including the moon .

 Cannon Fodder 3 is the third instalment in the Cannon Fodder series , the first two games of which – Cannon Fodder and Cannon Fodder 2 – were successful across multiple formats in the 1990s . Those games were created by Sensible Software led by Jon Hare ; Hare later worked on abortive sequels for both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable , as well as planning a version for smartphones . However , the publisher Codemasters had acquired Sensible Software and its intellectual property . In 2008 Codemasters licensed Russian company Game Factory Interactive ( GFI ) – which had previously been involved in games such as The Precursors , Boiling Point : Road to Hell and White Gold : War in Paradise – to develop Cannon Fodder 3 . While English @-@ language media reported on the development in January 2011 , GFI was initially permitted only to release the game in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States , with the possibility of a wider European or North American release unclear . GFI , described as an " unknown " , or " little @-@ known " company , published the game in Russia in December 2011 , with both GFI and <unk> CT variously reported as developers . Eurogamer then reported that Codemasters had clarified the agreement between itself and GFI : Codemasters had reserved the option to publish the game in the UK , but ultimately declined . This allowed GFI to distribute the game out with Russia and dispelled the belief that GFI was not authorised to make such a release . The game was released via GamersGate , in Europe and North America , on 9 February 2012 . 
 GFI 's Oleg <unk> stated the developers attempted to retain the most appealing elements of the original Cannon Fodder while attracting new players . GFI also attempted to retain Cannon Fodder 's " antimilitarist message " and was most proud of the new destructible environment . The developers broadened the variety of weapons and vehicles and changed the level structure by adding sub @-@ missions .

 Richard Cobbet , writing in PC Gamer UK said : " just maybe , this is going too far " , in reference to images of soldiers ' gory corpses cleared from the interface by windscreen wipers . The reviewer expressed bemusement at " Terrorists with robots and plasma guns " antagonists , but reflected – in reference to Cannon Fodder 2 – " Still , could be worse . They could be time @-@ travelling aliens again . " He said the " biggest issue " is that a " gung @-@ ho " approach to play is infeasible and that the " precise and tactical " approach faithful to earlier games in the series " turns out to be a very different experience from before . Far less satisfying " . This is due to the " key problem " of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher @-@ armed turrets can destroy the player 's soldiers . The player is thus forced " to play with aching , paranoid care , picking away at base defences from as far away as possible , and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner . This is not fun . " He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels " raining down over the entire screen . " Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that Cannon Fodder 3 did not evoke nostalgia and was a " poor substitute " for other action or strategy games . On the other hand , he found the game " admittedly nowhere near as frustrating " as the original . He reflected that it " does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age , and it 's far from as bad as expected " given its obscure development . 
 Liam Martin of Digital Spy noted that the variety of locations and weather effects added to the distinctiveness of individual levels . He praised the " simple but effective " , " cartoonish " and colorful visual style , the improved detail from the game 's predecessors along with the " light @-@ hearted tone " and " spectacular and bloody " gore effects . He praised the destructible environments but thought the characters too small . He felt use of strategy to be " limited " but the action " enormous amounts of explosive fun " and enjoyed the gratification of destroying enemies and buildings with rifles and tanks . The writer found the game a " little repetitive " with a " tendency to grate " , which he blamed on somewhat tedious level design , a lack of variety in objectives , a poor camera and long loading times . The lack of a tutorial or mini @-@ map proved sometimes confusing . He noted the " welcome " but limited on @-@ line cooperative mode . Martin felt the game was " best played in short bursts " and summarised : " Provided you 're not expecting a game with much depth or that 's oozing innovation , Cannon Fodder 3 proves that virtual war can still be a lot of fun . " 
 Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay complained the need for secondary weapons proves frustrating : " It is not uncommon to run out of the weapons needed for the job , forcing the player to engage in a tedious game of hide and seek as they scour the map in the hopes of finding another cache . " He wrote : " In fact , tedium is a frequent <unk> in Cannon Fodder 3 " , due to the lack of variety in the gameplay and mission objectives . He felt the player 's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad . Cocks complained of the game 's " bargain basement production " ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting , as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game , crashes , spawning and using vehicles . The reviewer acknowledged the " wonderfully cartoony " graphics , found the gory windscreen wipers " amusing " and wrote " It ’ s all over @-@ the @-@ top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present . " Cocks summarised : " Cannon Fodder 3 is the ultimate coat @-@ tail rider [ ... ] perhaps there is some nostalgic pleasure to be taken in this but for the most part , we suggest leaving well enough alone . " 
 Strategy Informer felt the game had updated and improved upon the original , noting better controls , more forgiving health bars and save points , and more engaging mission goals . The reviewer criticised the poor translations and perceived <unk> ethnic stereotypes in the enemy characters . Overall the reviewer was impressed by the game , saying " in the end <unk> far exceeded my expectations " . Metro had some praise for the graphics but complained of a lack of any fun and poor camera , controls and level design . The reviewer called the translated dialogue worse than that of Zero Wing . Greece 's PC Master praised the game as enjoyable and while somewhat repetitive , a successful update of the Cannon Fodder series . Czech website <unk> criticised the game as a failure , with poor graphics , music , sound effects and immature , unimpressive humour , saying the game would only be worth buying at a lower price . 
 = 2007 NBA betting scandal = 
 The 2007 NBA betting scandal was a scandal involving the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and accusations that an NBA referee used his knowledge of relationships between referees , coaches , players and owners to bet on professional basketball games . In July 2007 , reports of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) were made public , which alleged that during the 2005 – 06 and 2006 – 07 NBA seasons , referee Tim Donaghy bet on games in which he officiated . 
 On August 15 , 2007 , Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation , and a year later he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of supervised release . As a result , the general reaction by the media was that the NBA 's popularity would be hurt by the news of this scandal . 
 = = Initial reports = = 
 The story first broke when the New York Post reported that the FBI was investigating allegations that an NBA referee had bet on games . The story was soon picked up by other major news agencies , as it was revealed that Donaghy was the referee under investigation . The reports claimed that Donaghy had started betting on games in 2005 , and had connections to organized crime . 
 The day after the initial reports , NBA commissioner David Stern said " that no amount of effort , time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation , to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports , and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again . " He then held a press conference on July 24 to address questions about the investigation . Although he called the Donaghy matter " an isolated case " , he also said it was " the most serious situation and worst situation that I have ever experienced " . 
 On July 27 , U.S. Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Commerce , Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee , asked to meet with Stern regarding the Donaghy matter . In a letter to Stern , Rush indicated that he might call a hearing " should the facts warrant public scrutiny . " He also said that the affair could potentially be " one of the most damaging scandals in the history of American sports . " On the same day , it was reported that a high school classmate of Donaghy 's , and the classmate 's boss , had bet on NBA games based on Donaghy 's tips . Donaghy later revealed that he was rewarded $ 2 @,@ 000 cash for each correct pick based on the tips he would pass along . 
 = = = Surrender = = = 
 After the initial reports , Donaghy stayed at his home , before moving to a secure location to avoid the media scrutiny . He surrendered on August 15 , 2007 , and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy . He told judges that he had used coded language to tip others about players ' physical condition and player / referee relations , and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006 – 07 season . In total , he received $ 30 @,@ 000 to pass inside information to the bookies . Donaghy also admitted that he had a severe gambling addiction , and was on medication to address it . He was released on a $ 250 @,@ 000 bond . 
 = = Sentencing = = 
 On June 11 , 2008 , Donaghy alleged in a statement through his lawyers that several series in the NBA Playoffs had been improperly refereed according to the NBA 's instructions . He alluded specifically to a playoff game where " personal fouls [ resulting in obviously injured players ] were ignored even when they occurred in full view of the referees " because " it was in the NBA 's interest to add another game to the series . " The game referred to was widely believed to be Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings , in which the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter . Donaghy also referred to a playoff series where " Team 3 's Owner alleged that referees were letting a Team 4 player get away with illegal screens . NBA Executive Y told Referee Supervisor Z that the referees for that game were to enforce the screening rules strictly against that Team 4 player . " The playoff series was believed to be the first @-@ round encounter between the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks in the 2005 NBA Playoffs . The Rockets led 2 – 0 in the series before losing in 7 games , and then @-@ Rockets head coach Jeff Van Gundy was fined $ 100 @,@ 000 for stating that a referee was targeting Houston center Yao Ming . 
 On July 29 , 2008 , Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison , and three years of supervised release . Although his lawyer asked for a probationary sentence , Donaghy admitted that he had " brought shame on myself , my family and the profession " . 
 Donaghy was released from federal prison on November 4 , 2009 . He is under supervised release by a federal parole @-@ type officer . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 Immediately after the reports were released , several writers said that the NBA 's popularity would be hurt by the news . Chris Sheridan of ESPN said that " the general American public has been turning away since the end of the Bulls ' dynasty , and this fiasco isn 't going to help bring it back " , and J. A. Adande said that " the integrity of the games just took a major hit " . 
 Sports gambling expert R. J. Bell , president of sports betting information site <unk> , tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007 . He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA , the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time . In the previous two seasons , this only happened 44 percent of the time . According to Bell , the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1 @,@ 000 , and there was " a 99 @.@ 9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor . " He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1 @.@ 5 points or more before the tip — an indication that big money had been wagered on the game . The big money won every time — another indication that " something ( was ) going on " . However , Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn 't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy 's actions during a game ; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on . 
 Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game , despite Stern 's insistence that Donaghy was a " rogue official " . According to Lang , an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game . For instance , Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus . When a game is being fixed , Lang said , the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future . Lang also believed a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI . 
 As a result of the betting scandal , Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors ' meeting in 2007 . Despite the labor agreement for referees , which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling , it was revealed that about half of the NBA 's officials had made bets in casinos , albeit not with sportsbooks . In addition , almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling . Stern stated that " [ the ] ban on gambling is absolute , and in my view it is too absolute , too harsh and was not particularly well @-@ enforced over the years " . The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting — though not on sports . There were several other referee @-@ related rule changes made : the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip @-@ off to the morning of the game , to reduce the value of the information to gamblers ; referees received more in @-@ season training and counseling on gambling ; more thorough background checks were carried out ; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees ' gambling patterns for those games ; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal .

Smith attended Colonial Beach Elementary School , where his physical education teacher , Steve Swope , recognized his athletic ability and allowed Smith to attend his camps free of charge . Smith noted , " Coach Swope knew me before I knew myself ... Every kid who 's athletic in that town goes through Coach Swope . " Smith went on to Stafford Senior High School , where he played basketball as a guard , and football at several different positions . He enjoys fishing as a pastime . 
 Smith played on the Stafford Indians football team as a quarterback , running back , wide receiver , cornerback , kickoff returner , and punt returner .

ESPN assessed him as a " do @-@ it @-@ all prospect " and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed . Smith was recruited by Maryland , Penn State , and Virginia Tech . He was shown interest by Virginia , but did not receive a scholarship offer . The Virginia staff , which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year , asked Smith to run a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ second 40 @-@ yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University , which he did . The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus , but Maryland offered a scholarship , which Smith accepted . He later said , " I kind of hold a grudge against <unk> a little bit . I 'm not afraid to say it . I kind of want to show them that they questioned my speed and whether I was going to get it back . I want to show them that I 'm all healed up . " Virginia head coach Al Groh said of the Fredericksburg native before the 2009 game against Maryland , " Clearly if we <unk> [ sic ] him being the type of player that he is now , he would be returning kicks for Virginia . So we are not above admitting that there is a player that certainly has turned out to be superior to what many people thought , including ourselves . He 's — regardless of what the circumstances were in the past — he is a superior college football player . "

 Before the 2009 season , Smith reportedly struggled in Maryland 's summer camp , dividing his time between practice and online courses at night . Towards the end of camp , head coach Ralph Friedgen noted an improvement in his performance , which reestablished Smith as the team 's top receiver alongside Adrian Cannon . 
 During the season , Smith saw action in all twelve games , including ten as a starter , and he amassed 61 receptions for 824 receiving yards and five touchdowns , 51 kickoff returns for 1 @,@ 309 yards and two touchdowns , and eleven rushing attempts for 59 yards and one touchdown . His kickoff return yardage surpassed the ACC single @-@ season record that he had set the previous year . Smith finished the season ranked sixth in the nation in all @-@ purpose yards . He was one of two players , alongside Donald <unk> of UTEP , to record more than 260 all @-@ purpose yards in three games . Smith led the team in receptions , receiving yards and return yards . Smith 's 2 @,@ 192 all @-@ purpose yards were the second @-@ most ever recorded by an ACC player behind only C. J. Spiller of Clemson .

Against Division I FCS James Madison , Smith caught eight passes for 80 yards , rushed twice for 22 yards and a touchdown , and returned four kickoffs 127 yards , including one 81 @-@ yard touchdown return . Despite the strong statistical performance , head coach Ralph Friedgen said , " To be honest with you , I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey . I 've got a lot of faith in him . I 'm not surprised at all about the return yards . But I think if you asked Torrey , he has high expectations for himself , too . " Smith agreed with the criticism , and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver , he had room for improvement . He recorded five catches for 165 yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game , and caught four passes for 112 yards against Rutgers . He led the team with three receptions for 64 yards and a 29 @-@ yard touchdown against Clemson , and became the first player in the nation to reach 1 @,@ 000 all @-@ purpose yards on the season . Against Wake Forest , Smith returned six kickoffs 194 yards and caught a career @-@ high ten passes for 70 yards and a touchdown . For his performance , he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week . Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said , " This kid is probably a better receiver [ than Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey ] . He catches the ball better , he 's got great foot speed . He can hurt you running the ball or catching it . Everywhere you look , he 's a problem . " 
 Coach Friedgen named Smith the special teams captain for the Virginia game . During the game , Virginia chose to kick short to keep the ball away from Smith on kickoffs , and quarterback Chris Turner did not target him until the fourth quarter . He finished with three receptions for 34 yards and no returns . He recorded two receptions for 13 yards at Duke .

 Smith returned to Maryland for the 2010 season to increase his NFL draft stock , complete his criminology and criminal justice degree in December , and improve the team 's record from a 2 – 10 finish the year prior . He said , " I 'll have the same talk with the same people [ about the draft ] . But my focus is to change what happened last year . " Prior to the start of the season , the coaching staff planned to increase Smith 's efficiency by playing him fewer snaps in an attempt to keep him fresh . In the Red – White spring game , Smith accounted for 90 of starting quarterback Jamarr Robinson 's 146 passing yards , including a " fingertip catch in the end zone " on the opening drive , and the two roommates were reported to have developed a good rapport . Before the season , Smith was named to the watchlists for the Paul Hornung Award and Biletnikoff Award . 
 Maryland started the 2010 season against Navy , which intentionally kicked away from the elusive return man . In the home opener against Morgan State , Smith scored on a 24 @-@ yard pass from backup quarterback Danny O 'Brien and a five @-@ yard pass from starter Jamarr Robinson . Smith scored two touchdowns of 60 and 80 yards in Maryland 's failed comeback attempt at 21st @-@ ranked West Virginia , 31 – 17 . After the West Virginia game , Sports Illustrated considered Smith a rising prospect for the 2011 NFL Draft and described him as " a true vertical threat who has NFL size and home @-@ run hitting speed . " Redshirt freshman Danny O 'Brien secured the starting quarterback position after Jamarr Robinson suffered a shoulder injury , and the rookie soon " found great chemistry " with Smith . Against Florida International , Smith made eight receptions for 159 yards , including a 68 @-@ yard touchdown catch and a 32 @-@ yard catch that set up another score . He limped off of the field after his touchdown catch , but later said , " I was fine . I was Jim Brown @-@ ing . " The following week , he was limited in practice , but started against Duke and caught a 44 @-@ yard reception during a first @-@ half scoring drive . However , the lingering ankle ailment continued to bother Smith , and head coach Ralph Friedgen considered using punt returner Tony Logan for kickoff returns until he fully healed . Smith had four receptions for 55 yards in the 31 – 7 loss to Clemson , but was hindered by his sore ankle which kept him out of practice . Smith said , " I don 't like sitting out [ practices ] . I feel like I 'm leaving my teammates out to dry . I didn 't battle with them all week . " After the game , Friedgen said in the future he would sit players who could not practice by the Thursday before a game . 
 Against Boston College , running back Da 'Rel Scott handled some of the kickoff return duties , but Smith returned two for 38 yards . He also caught eight passes for 34 yards and a touchdown . The following week , Maryland clinched bowl eligibility with a 62 – 14 rout of Wake Forest . Regarding the turnaround from the previous season 's 2 – 10 record , Smith said , " We expected to be in this position . No one else expected it , " but added " No one is going to respect us [ yet ] because we have not beaten any top dogs . " In the game , Smith had five catches for 66 yards , including a 17 @-@ yard touchdown reception . Before the game against Miami , the coaching staff reported Smith 's ankle had improved and he was " as healthy as he has been in a while . " Against Miami , he had three receptions for 35 yards . Smith also compiled 46 yards on two kickoff returns to break the ACC career kickoff return yards record with 2 @,@ 724 yards , which surpassed the previous mark of 2 @,@ 688 yards held by Brandon Tate of North Carolina . At Virginia , Smith took advantage of the Cavaliers ' man @-@ to @-@ man coverage and had seven receptions for 157 yards , including a 12 @-@ yard touchdown . On a 62 @-@ yard catch , he said he was tackled on the seven @-@ yard line only because he was exhausted . Quarterback Danny O 'Brien expressed his readiness to throw deep passes to Smith in single coverage , " If it 's even , I put it up . " Maryland entered the game against 25th @-@ ranked Florida State in contention for the ACC Atlantic Division championship . Smith recorded a phone message and video appealing to fans in a bid to improve home attendance , which had been lackluster throughout the season . The game was attended by 48 @,@ 115 spectators , which surpassed the athletic department 's projections . Maryland lost , 30 – 16 , and Smith had seven receptions for 69 yards . 
 Smith delivered a record @-@ setting performance against 23rd @-@ ranked North Carolina State , in which he collected a career @-@ high 14 receptions for 224 yards and four touchdowns . Smith scored on catches of 10 , 11 , 12 , and 71 yards , and his performance helped Maryland win , 38 – 31 , despite amassing negative rushing yards . During the game , Smith set the school record for career all @-@ purpose yardage , which surpassed Lamont Jordan 's previous mark of 4 @,@ 960 yards . His four touchdown receptions in a single game also set a school record , which surpassed the previous mark of three shared by Vernon Davis , <unk> Gary , Jermaine Lewis , and James Milling . Smith 's season tally of twelve touchdowns also set a school record , which surpassed the mark of nine shared by Jermaine Lewis and Marcus Badgett . He also joined Marcus Badgett as just the second Maryland receiver to accumulate over 1 @,@ 000 yards in a single season . For his performance , the Atlantic Coast Conference named him the Offensive Back of the Week . 
 Upon the conclusion of the regular season , the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association named Smith to the All @-@ ACC first team as a wide receiver . In the 2010 Military Bowl against East Carolina , Smith had two catches for ten yards . Shortly after the game , he declared himself available for the 2011 NFL Draft in order to financially support his family . ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper said , while he believed Smith could have potentially reached first @-@ round status with another year , he would likely be selected in the second or third round of the 2011 NFL Draft .

 The Baltimore Ravens selected Smith with the 58th overall pick in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft . Smith , who ran the 40 @-@ yard dash in 4 @.@ 41 seconds at the combine , was described as a deep threat that the team had missed the previous season . 
 After facing criticism for a lack of production in the first two weeks , Smith turned in a record @-@ setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3 . In the first quarter , he scored on each of his first three career receptions with <unk> , <unk> , and 18 @-@ yard touchdowns . The 74 @-@ yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco 's career .

 Despite losing his brother , Tevin Jones , in a tragic motorcycle accident the morning before the Week 3 game against the New England Patriots , Smith had a great second season as a Raven . During the Monday Night Football game vs. New England , Smith played the game of his life for his late brother , leading his team in receptions ( 6 ) , receiving yards ( 127 ) and receiving touchdowns ( 2 ) , helping Baltimore win 31 @-@ 30 . On January 12 , 2013 , in the Division Playoff Round against the Denver Broncos , Smith caught both a 59 @-@ yard pass and a 32 @-@ yard pass for touchdowns in a 38 @-@ 35 double overtime win .

 Smith started the 2013 season as the Ravens # 1 receiver . 6 weeks into the season he was one of the NFL 's leaders in receptions and receiving yards . Smith reached the 1 @,@ 000 yard receiving season mark for the first time in his career after Week 15 into the season . Smith was also the first Raven @-@ drafted receiver to eclipse 1 @,@ 000 yards for the team . 
 = = = = 2014 = = = = 
 During the 2014 offseason , the Ravens signed veteran wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. After Smith started out the 2014 season slowly , he lost his starting job to Smith Sr. Even though Smith would have another productive season , most of his impressive games seemed to be overshadowed by other players . 
 Smith would have his first decent performance of 2014 in Week 4 , when he had 2 receptions for 53 yards and a touchdown in a 38 @-@ 10 blowout victory against the Carolina Panthers . 
 In Week 6 , Smith finally had a performance that was considered good . On the game ’ s first drive , he scored on a 15 @-@ yard touchdown catch . On the Ravens ' next possession , Smith scored another touchdown . He would finish the game with 4 receptions , 51 yards and two touchdowns , as he helped Joe Flacco set the NFL record for the fastest time to record five touchdown passes ( 16 minutes and 3 seconds ) . The Ravens would rout the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48 @-@ 17 . 
 The following week , against the Atlanta Falcons , Smith would score the game @-@ sealing touchdown . With less than two minutes left in the game and facing a fourth down , Flacco lofted a pass to Smith , and he hauled it in for a 39 @-@ yard score . Smith would finish the game with 3 receptions , 81 yards and the 39 yard touchdown , as the Ravens again had a blowout win of 29 @-@ 7 . 
 Two weeks later , the Ravens faced their division rivals , the Pittsburgh Steelers . Smith scored the game ’ s opening touchdown , a 35 @-@ yard touchdown catch . However , this week the Ravens would be on the other side of the blowout , and would lose 43 @-@ 23 . Smith still had a good game , as he had 4 receptions for 63 yards and the 35 yard score . 
 The next week against the Tennessee Titans , Smith would again seal the game with a 32 @-@ yard score . He would finish the game with 5 receptions for 75 yards and the previously mentioned touchdown , in another dominating win of 21 @-@ 7 . 
 Two weeks later , the Ravens faced the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football . Smith was tied with Saints wide receiver Kenny Stills as the game ’ s leading receiver , having 5 receptions for 98 yards . The Ravens would win in a 34 @-@ 27 shootout . 
 The following week , the Ravens played the San Diego Chargers . On the first possession , Smith again scored the game ’ s opening touchdown , on a very impressive juggle in the endzone . In the third quarter , he would score again . Despite having the lead for nearly the entire game , the Ravens would lose it when San Diego scored a touchdown with less than two minutes left in regulation , and would suffer a shocking 34 @-@ 33 home defeat . Despite the heartbreaking loss Smith played his best game of the season , catching 6 receptions for 65 yards and the pair of touchdowns . 
 In Week 14 , against the Miami Dolphins , the Ravens would get redemption for their mistake the previous week with a 28 @-@ 13 victory . However , Smith had no catches in this game , surprisingly not being targeted at all . 
 During Week 16 , the Ravens looked to clinch a playoff spot . However , they had their worst game of the season , losing to the Houston Texans by a score of 25 @-@ 13 . However , Smith still had one of his best games of the season , with 5 receptions , 59 yards and both of the Ravens ’ touchdowns . 
 In their regular season finale , the Ravens took on their division rivals , the Cleveland Browns , needing a win to get into the playoffs . They also needed the Kansas City Chiefs to defeat or tie the San Diego Chargers . Trailing 10 @-@ 6 in the final quarter , Smith stepped up big time . He caught a deep pass from Flacco , and on the very next play , a 16 @-@ yard touchdown to give Baltimore the lead . The Ravens and Chiefs would both be victorious that day , giving Baltimore another playoff berth . Smith finished the game with 4 receptions for 83 yards , including those two huge fourth quarter plays . 
 In the Wild Card round of the playoffs , the Ravens faced the division rival Steelers once again . They would win the game 30 @-@ 17 , and Smith would contribute . He may have only had 2 catches for 28 yards , but one of them was a touchdown . 
 In the Divisional Round of the playoffs , the Ravens would face the New England Patriots . Trailing 35 @-@ 31 in the game ’ s final minutes , Flacco lofted a deep throw to Smith , but he missed the throw and Smith didn ’ t attempt to catch the ball . The pass was intercepted by safety Duron Harmon in the back of the endzone , ending the Ravens ' season . The Patriots would go on to win Super Bowl XLIX . 
 Smith finished the season with 49 receptions , 767 yards and a career high 11 touchdown catches . He also had three games in which he scored multiple touchdowns . 
 During March 2015 , Smith sent a letter to the entire city of Baltimore , announcing that he would test free agency . The letter was a goodbye note , which thanked Baltimore , Ravens ' fans and the entire Baltimore Ravens organization for starting out his career on such a strong note .

 = Mass in B minor structure = 
 The Mass in B minor is Johann Sebastian Bach 's only setting of the complete Latin text of the <unk> <unk> ( short : mass ) . Towards the end of his life , mainly in 1748 and 1749 , he finished composing new sections and compiling it into a complex , unified structure . 
 Bach structured the work in four parts : 
 No. 1 Missa 
 No. 2 Symbolum Nicenum 
 No. 3 Sanctus 
 No. 4 Osanna , Benedictus , Agnus Dei et Dona nobis pacem 
 The four sections of the manuscript are numbered , and Bach 's usual closing formula ( <unk> = Soli Deo Gloria ) is found at the end of the Dona nobis pacem . 
 Some parts of the mass were used in Latin even in Lutheran Leipzig , and Bach had composed them : five settings of the Missa , containing Kyrie and Gloria , and several additional settings of Kyrie and Sanctus . To achieve the Missa tota , a setting of the complete text of the mass , he combined his most elaborate Missa , the Missa in B minor , written in 1733 for the court in Dresden , and a Sanctus , written for Christmas of 1724 . He added a few new compositions , but mostly derived movements from cantata movements , in the technique known as parody . 
 The Mass is a compendium of his styles in vocal composition , containing Gregorian chant , " stile antico " reminiscent of Renaissance music and the Baroque concertante style of his own time , fugal writing and dances , arias and a movement for two four @-@ part choirs . Formally , the mass is a missa <unk> . Similar to architecture of the period , Bach achieved a symmetry of parts , with the profession of faith ( Credo ) in the center and the movement Crucifixus in its center . Bach scored the work for five vocal parts ( two sopranos , alto , tenor and bass , SSATB ) . While some choral movements are for only four parts , the Sanctus is scored for six voices ( SSAATB ) , and the Osanna even for two four @-@ part choirs . Bach called for a rich instrumentation of brass , woodwinds and strings , assigning specific varied obbligato parts to different instruments . 
 = = History and parody = = 
 The Mass was Bach 's last major artistic undertaking . The reason for the composition is unknown . Scholars found no plausible occasion for which the work may have been intended . Joshua Rifkin notes : 
 ... likely , Bach sought to create a paradigmatic example of vocal composition while at the same time contributing to the venerable musical genre of the Mass , still the most demanding and prestigious apart from opera . 
 Bach first composed a Missa in B minor of Kyrie and Gloria , often held in Latin even in Lutheran services , in 1733 , for the Catholic royal court in Dresden . He devoted the parts to the new king Augustus III , Elector of Saxony ( later Augustus III of Poland ) , accompanied by a letter : 
 In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique , with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition , but with a most gracious eye ... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection . 
 He arranged the text in diverse movements for a five @-@ part choir and solo voices , according to the taste in Dresden where sacred music " borrowed " from Italian opera with a focus on choral movements , as musicologist Arthur Wenk notes . 
 Bach expanded the Missa of 1733 to a Missa tota from 1748 to 1749 , near the end of his life . In these last years , he added three choral parts of the Credo : its opening Credo in unum Deum , Confiteor and Et incarnatus est . The Sanctus was originally an individual movement composed for Christmas 1724 in Leipzig . 
 Most other movements of the mass are parodies of music from earlier cantata movements , dating back as far as 1714 . Wenk points out that Bach often used parody to " bring a composition to a higher level of perfection " . The original musical sources of several movements are known , for others they are lost but the score shows that they are copied and reworked . Bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and affekt . For example Gratias agimus tibi ( We give you thanks ) is based on Wir danken dir , Gott , wir danken dir ( We thank you , God , we thank you ) . Crucifixus ( Crucified ) is based on the general lamenting about the situation of the Christian , Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen ( Weeping , lamenting , worrying , fearing ) which Bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for the court of Weimar . 
 Bach quoted Gregorian chant twice , in the Credo in unum Deum as a theme , in the Confiteor as a cantus firmus embedded in complex polyphony . 
 Formally , the mass is a missa <unk> . Bach achieved a symmetry of the parts , with the profession of faith ( Credo ) in the center and the movement Crucifixus in its center . Markus Rathey , Associate Professor of Music History at the Institute of Sacred Music at the Yale School of Music , sees a similarity to architecture of the period , such as the Palace of Versailles . Bach knew buildings in that style , for example Schloss <unk> in Gotha , built in 1710 . Rathey continues : 
 The symmetry on earth mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven . The purpose of art at this time — in architecture , the visual arts , and music — was not to create something entirely new , but to reflect this divine perfection , and in this way to praise God . We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach , 19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass . 
 The parts Kyrie , Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements , framing an intimate center of theological significance . 
 According to Christoph Wolff , the Mass can be seen as a " kind of specimen book of his finest compositions in every kind of style , from the stile antico of Palestrina in the ' Credo ' and ' Confiteor ' and the expressively free writing of the ' Crucifixus ' and ' Agnus Dei ' , to the supreme counterpoint of the opening Kyrie as well as so many other choruses , right up to the most modern style in <unk> solos like ' Christe eleison ' and ' Domine Deus ' " . Bach made " a conscious effort to incorporate all styles that were available to him , to encompass all music history as far as it was accessible " . The Mass is a compendium of vocal sacred music , similar to other collections that Bach compiled during the last decade of his life , such as Clavier @-@ <unk> III , The Art of Fugue , Goldberg Variations , Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes and The Musical Offering . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Due to Bach 's Lutheran background and the history of the composition , developed over several decades , he deviated from the typical structure of the mass in five parts , Kyrie , Gloria , Credo , Sanctus and Agnus Dei . He had composed the Sanctus in 1724 , and the Missa of Kyrie and Gloria in 1733 . When he compiled the Mass , he used these parts , added the Credo , including new compositions , and a final part beginning with Osanna which is normally part of the Sanctus . 
 = = Scoring = = 
 The work is scored for five vocal soloists , chorus and orchestra . Its movements are listed in a table for the scoring in voices and instruments , key , tempo marking , time signature and source . The movement numbers follow the Bärenreiter editions of the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe , first in a consecutive numbering ( NBA II ) , then in numbering for the four individual parts ( NBA I ) . 
 The voices are abbreviated S for soprano , A for alto , T for tenor , B for bass . Bach asked for two sopranos . Practical performances often have only one soprano soloist , sharing the parts for the second soprano ( SII ) between soprano and alto . A four @-@ part choir is indicated by SATB , a five @-@ part choir by SSATB . The Sanctus requires six vocal parts , SSAATB , which are often divided in the three upper voices versus the lower voices . The Osanna requires two choirs SATB . Instruments in the orchestra are three trumpets ( Tr ) , timpani ( Ti ) , corno da caccia ( Co ) , two flauti traversi ( Ft ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two bassoons ( Fg ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo . The continuo is not mentioned in the table as it is present all the time . The other instruments are grouped by brass , woodwinds and strings . If no source for a parody is given , the movement was composed for the Mass , otherwise the title of the original music and a year are provided if known . For several movements , scholars assume that they are a parody , looking at indications such as similarities of text , musical style and the manuscript , where parodies look neater . The Missa of 1733 is not mentioned as the source for the Kyrie and Gloria , but earlier compositions that Bach used as the basis for movements of the Missa are shown .

 Kyrie and Gloria 
 The section Kyrie is structured , following tradition , in a threefold acclamation of God , a choral Kyrie I , a duet Christe , and a different choral Kyrie II . Kyrie I is in B minor , Christe in D major , Kyrie II in F @-@ sharp minor . The three notes B , D and F @-@ sharp form the B minor triad . Butt notes D major as the central key , corresponding to the " atonement of Christ " . 
 The Gloria is structured in symmetry as a sequence of choral movements and solo movements , arias and a central duet , in three sections . The first is opened by a chorus followed by an aria , closed in the last section in symmetry by an aria followed by a chorus ; the middle section alternates choral music with solo . The trumpets are introduced as a symbol of divine glory in several movements , beginning and ending in D major , with a planned architecture of keys in the middle movements . The central duet is in the " lowly " key of G major , referring to Christ as a " human incarnation of God " . A corno da caccia appears only once in the whole work , in the movement Quoniam , which is about the holiness of God . 
 = = = = Kyrie I = = = = 
 The first movement is scored for five @-@ part choir , woodwinds and strings . As the Dresden Mass style required , it opens with a short homophonic section , followed by an extended fugue in two sections , which both begin with an instrumental fugue . 
 Christoph Wolff notes a similarity between the fugue theme and one by Johann Hugo von <unk> , whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731 . <unk> 's mass also has a slow introduction , a duet as the second movement and a motet in stile antico , similar to late Renaissance music , as the third movement . Bach based the work on a composition in C minor , as mistakes in the copying process show . 
 The vast movement has aspects of both a fugue and a ritornello movement . In the first fugal section , the voices enter in the sequence tenor , alto , soprano I , soprano II , bass , expanding from middle range to the extreme parts , just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards . In the second fugal section , the instruments begin in low registers , and the voices build , with every part first in extremely low range , from bass to soprano I. In both sections , the instruments open the fugue , but play with the voices once they enter . 
 = = = = Christe = = = = 
 The acclamation of Christ stresses the second person of the Trinity and is therefore rendered as a duet of the two sopranos . Their lines are often parallel , in an analogy to Christ and God proclaimed as " two in one " . Probably a parody of an earlier work , it is Bach 's only extant duet for two sopranos , stressing that idea . Rathey points out that the duet is similar in many aspects to the love duets of Neapolitan opera . Typical features of these duets are consonant melodies , in parallel thirds and sixths , or imitating each other , with sigh motifs as on the word Christe . Rendering Christe eleison as a duet followed the Dresden Mass style . 
 = = = = Kyrie II = = = = 
 The second acclamation of God is a four @-@ part choral fugue , set in stile antico , with the instruments playing colla parte . The style was preferred at court in Dresden . The theme begins with intervals such as minor seconds and major seconds , similar to the motif B @-@ A @-@ C @-@ H. The first entrances build from the lowest voice in the sequence bass , tenor , alto , soprano . According to Christoph Wolff , Bach assimilated the stricter style of the Renaissance only in the early 1730s , after he had composed most of his cantatas , and this movement is his first " significant product " in the style . 
 = = = = Gloria = = = = 
 The Gloria is structured in nine movements . The first and last are similar in style , concertante music of the eighteenth century . In further symmetry , the opening in two different tempos corresponds to the final sequence of an aria leading to " Cum sancto spiritu " , the soprano II solo with obbligato violin " Laudamus te " to the alto solo with obbligato oboe " Qui sedes " , and the choral movements " Gratias " frame the central duet of soprano I and tenor " Domine Deus " . 
 The text of the Hymnus Gloria begins with the angels ' song from Luke 's Christmas story . Bach used this section , the central duet and the concluding doxology as a Christmas cantata , Gloria in excelsis Deo , BWV 191 ( Glory to God in the Highest ) , probably in 1745 , a few years before the completion of the Mass . The opening is set as a five @-@ part chorus , beginning with an instrumental presentation of the material . In great contrast to the first section Kyrie , it is in D major , introducing the trumpets and timpani . The first thought , " Gloria in excelsis Deo " ( Glory to God in the Highest ) , is set in 3 / 8 time , compared by Wenk to the dance Giga . 
 = = = = Et in terra pax = = = = 
 The continuation of the thought within the angels ' song , " Et in terra pax " ( and peace on earth ) , is in common time . The duration of an eighth note stays the same , Bach thus achieves a contrast of " heavenly " three eights , a symbol of the Trinity , and " earthly " four quarters . The voices start this section , and the trumpets are silent for its beginning , but return for its conclusion . 
 = = = = Laudamus te = = = = 
 An aria for soprano II and obbligato violin express the praise and adoration of God in vivid coloraturas . It has been argued that Bach might have thought of the Dresden taste and the specific voice of Faustina <unk> . 
 = = = = Gratias agimus tibi = = = = 
 A four @-@ part chorus in stile antico illustrates the idea of thanks and praise , again with trumpets and timpani . It is based on the first choral movement of Wir danken dir , Gott , wir danken dir , BWV 29 , which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation . The first part of the text , devoted to thanks , is a melody in even tempo that rises gradually and falls again . The voices enter without instrumental support in dense succession . The countersubject on the second line " <unk> magnam gloriam tuam " ( for your great glory ) , devoted to the glory of God , is more complex in rhythm . Similarly , in the cantata the second line " und verkündigen deine Wunder " ( and proclaim your wonders ) lead to a more vivid countersubject . Towards the end of the movement , the trumpets take part in the polyphony of the dense movement . 
 = = = = Domine Deus = = = = 
 The section addressing God as Father and Son is again a duet , this time of soprano I and tenor . The voices are often in canon and in parallel , as in the Christe . The movement is likely another parody , possibly from the 1729 cantata Ihr <unk> des Himmels , BWV <unk> . As the Christe , it is a love @-@ duet addressing Jesus . Both duets appear as the center of the symmetry within the respective part , Kyrie and Gloria . Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up . 
 Rathey points out , that the scoring at a first glance seems not to match the text " Domine Deus , Rex coelestis " ( Lord God , Heavenly King ) , but it matches the continuation " Domine Deus , Agnus Dei " ( Lord God , Lamb of God ) , stressing the Lutheran " <unk> <unk> " ( theology of the cross ) that the omnipotent God is the same as the one revealed on the cross . 
 = = = = Qui tollis = = = = 
 When the text reaches the phase " Qui tollis peccata mundi " ( who takes away the sins of the world ) , the music is given <unk> to a five @-@ part choir with an obbligato flute . The movement is based on the first choral movement of <unk> doch und <unk> , ob <unk> ein <unk> sei , BWV 46 . The cantata text was based on the Book of Lamentations , Lamentations 1 : 12 , a similar expression of grief . Bach changed the key , and the rhythm for the different text . The key of B minor connects this description of " Christ 's suffering and mankind 's plea for mercy " to the similar quest in the first Kyrie . The keys G – B – D form the G major triad , leading to the " home key " of the Gloria , D major . Bach uses only part of the cantata movement , without the instrumental introduction and the second part . 
 = = = = Qui sedes = = = = 
 The continuation of the thought , " Qui sedes ad <unk> Patris " ( who sits at the right [ hand ] of the Father ) , is expressed by an aria for alto and obbligato oboe d 'amore . It is probably a parody . In Bach 's earlier settings of the mass he had treated " Qui tollis and " Qui sedes " as one movement , here he distinguished Jesus at the right hand of the father by dance @-@ like music . Wenk likens it to a gigue . 
 = = = = Quoniam tu solus sanctus = = = = 
 The last section begins with an aria for bass , showing " Quoniam tu solus sanctus " ( For you alone are holy ) in an unusual scoring of only corno da caccia and two bassoons . <unk> points out the symbolic function of this corno da caccia as well as the polonaise . By using the polonaise , Bach not only expressed the text by musical means , but also paid respect to the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony , August III , to whom the Mass in dedicated . Probably a parody , it is the only movement in the work using the horn . The unusual scoring provides a " solemn character " . Butt observes that Bach uses a rhythmic pattern throughout the movement in the two bassoons which is even extended into the following movement , although they originally were independent . The repeated figure of an <unk> provides the " rhythmic energy of the texture . " 
 = = = = Cum sancto spiritu = = = = 
 On the continuing text " Cum sancto spiritu " ( with the Holy Spirit ) , the choir enters in five parts , in symmetry to the beginning . A homophonic section is followed by a fugue . The concertante music corresponds in symmetry to the opening of the Gloria , both praising God . 
 = = = No. 2 Symbolum Nicenum = = = 
 The text of the profession of faith , Credo , is the Nicene Creed . It is structured in three sections , regarding Father , Son and Holy Spirit . Bach follows the structure , devoting two choral movements to the first section , beginning the second section with a duet , followed by three choral movements , and opening the third with an aria , followed by two choral movements . The center is the movement Crucifixus , set in E minor , the lowest key of the part . Crucifixus is also the oldest music in the Mass , dating back to 1714 . The part begins and ends a sequence of two connected choral movements in contrasting style , a motet and stile antico , containing a chant melody , and a concerto . The chant melodies are devoted two the key words of this part : Credo ( I believe ) and Confiteor ( I confess ) . 
 = = = = Credo in unum Deum = = = = 
 The Credo begins with " Credo in unum Deum " ( I believe in one God ) , a polyphonic movement for five @-@ part choir , to which two obbligato violins add independent parts . The theme is the Gregorian Chant , first presented by the tenor in long notes on a walking bass of the continuo . The other voices enter in the sequence bass , alto , soprano I , soprano II , each one before the former one even finished the line . The two violins enter independently , reaching a seven @-@ part fugue . The complex counterpoint of the seven parts , five voices and two violins , expands the theme of the chant , often in stretto function , and uses a variety of countersubjects . In the second exposition ( sequence of fugue entries ) , the bass voice is missing , leading to anticipation and a climactic entry in augmentation ( long notes ) beginning the third exposition , just as an entry of the first violin ends the second exposition . Musicologist John Butt summarizes : " By using numerous stile antico devices in a particular order and combination , Bach has created a movement in which a standardised structure breeds a new momentum of its own " . 
 This movement in stile antico contrasts with the following modern concerto @-@ style movement , Patrem omnipotentem . This contrast is reminiscent of the contrast between the two Kyrie movements and foreshadows the last two movements of the Symbolum Nicenum . Recent research dates the movement to 1747 or 1748 and suggests that it might have been the introduction to a Credo by a different composer , before Bach began to assemble the Mass . 
 = = = = Patrem omnipotentem = = = = 
 The thought is continued in " Patrem omnipotentem " ( to the Father , almighty ) , in a four @-@ part choral movement with trumpets . The movement probably shares its original source with the opening chorus of Gott , wie dein Name , so ist auch dein <unk> , BWV 171 ( God , as Your name is , so is also Your praise ) , which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation . The voices sing a fugue to a concerto of the orchestra . The bass introduces the theme , without an instrumental opening , while the other voices repeat simultaneously in homophony : " Credo in unum Deum " as a firm statement . The theme contains all eight notes of the scale , as a symbol completeness . Bach noted at the end of the movement that it contains 84 measures , the multiplication of 7 and 12 , a hint at the symbolic meaning of numbers . The word " Credo " appears 49 times ( 7 * 7 ) , the words " Patrem omnipotentem " 84 times . 
 = = = = Et in unum Dominum = = = = 
 The belief in Jesus Christ begins with " Et in unum Dominum " ( And in one Lord ) , another duet , this time of soprano and alto , beginning in a canon where the second voice follows the first after only one beat . The instruments often play the same line in different articulation . The movement is based on a lost duet which serves already in 1733 as the basis for a movement of <unk> uns <unk> , laßt uns <unk> , BWV 213 . Bach headed the movement " Duo voces <unk> 2 " which can be translated as " Two voices express 2 " or " the two vocal parts of Article 2 " . The text included originally the line " Et incarnatus est de Spiritu sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est " , illustrating " <unk> " by a descending figure for the violins . When Bach treated " Et incarnatus est " as a separate choral movement , he rearranged the text , and the figure lost its " pictorial association " . 
 = = = = Et incarnatus est = = = = 
 The virgin birth , " Et incarnatus est " ( And was incarnate ) , is a five @-@ part movement . It is probably Bach 's last vocal composition , dating from end of 1749 or the first weeks of 1750 . Until then , the text had been included in the preceding duet . The late separate setting of the words which had been given special attention by previous composers of the mass , established the symmetry of the Credo . The humiliation of God , born as man , is illustrated by the violins in a pattern of one measure that descends and that combines the symbol of the cross and sighing motifs , alluding to the crucifixion . The voices sing a motif of descending triads . They enter in imitation starting in measure 4 , one voice every measure in the sequence alto , soprano II , soprano I , tenor , bass , forming a rich texture . The text " ex Maria <unk> " ( out of the virgin Mary ) appears in an upward movement , " et homo factus est " ( and made man ) even in upward triads . 
 = = = = Crucifixus = = = = 
 " Crucifixus " ( Crucified ) , the enter of the Credo part , is the oldest music in the setting of the Mass , dating back to 1714 . It is a passacaglia , with the chromatic fourth in the bass line repeated thirteen times . Wenk likens it to the dance Sarabande . The movement is based on the first section of the first choral movement of Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 . Bach transposed the music from F minor to E minor , changed the instrumentation and repeated each bass note for more expressiveness . Bach begins the movement with an instrumental setting of the bass line , while the cantata movement started immediately with the voices . 
 The suffering of Jesus is expressed in chromatic melodic lines , dissonant harmonies , and sigh @-@ motifs . The final line , on the 13th repeat of the bass line , " et sepultus est " ( and was buried ) was newly composed , with the accompaniment silent and a modulation to G major , to lead to the following movement . At the end , soprano and alto reach the lowest range of the movement on the final " et sepultus est " ( and was buried ) . A pianissimo ending of the movement , contrasted by a forte Et resurrexit followed the Dresden Mass style . 
 = = = = Et resurrexit = = = = 
 " Et resurrexit " ( And is risen ) is expressed by a five @-@ part choral movement with trumpets . The concerto on ascending motifs renders the resurrection , the ascension and the second coming , all separated by long instrumental interludes and followed by a postlude . " Et <unk> <unk> est " ( and will come again ) is given to the bass only , for Bach the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) . Wenk likens the movement to the dance <unk> , a " light festive movement in triple meter , upbeat three eighth notes " . 
 = = = = Et in Spiritum Sanctum = = = = 
 A bass aria renders " Et in Spiritum Sanctum " ( And in the Holy Spirit ) with two obbligato oboes d 'amore . Only wind instruments are used to convey the idea of the Spirit as breath and wind . Speaking about the third person of the Trinity , the number three appears in many aspects : the aria is in three sections , in a triple 6 / 8 @-@ time , in A major , a key with three sharps , in German " Kreuz " ( cross ) . A major is the dominant key to D major , the main key of the part , symbolising superiority , in contrast to the E minor of the " Crucifixus " as the lowest point of the architecture . The two oboes d 'amore open the movement with a ritornello , with an <unk> theme played in parallels , which is later picked up by the voice . The ritornello is played between the three sections , the second time shortened , and it concludes the movement . The sections cover first the Holy Spirit , then his adoration with the Father and the Son , finally how he acted through the prophets and the church . The voice sings in highest register for the words " Et <unk> <unk> <unk> ... <unk> " ( and one holy universal ... church ) , and expands in a repeat of the text in long coloraturas the words " <unk> " and " <unk> " . Wenk likens the movement to a Pastorale , a " Christmas dance " , often on a drone bass . 
 = = = = Confiteor = = = = 
 The belief of one baptism for the forgiveness of sins , " Confiteor " ( I confess ) , is expressed in strict counterpoint , which incorporates a cantus firmus in plainchant . The five @-@ part choir is accompanied only by the continuo as a walking bass . The voices first perform a double fugue in stile antico , the first entries of the first theme , " Confiteor unum <unk> " ( I proclaim the one baptism ) , from soprano to bass , followed by the first entries of the second theme , " in <unk> <unk> " ( for the remission of sinners ) , in the sequence tenor , alto , soprano I , soprano II , bass . The voices follow each other in fast succession , only one or two measures apart . The two themes appear in complex combinations , until the cantus firmus is heard from measure 73 as a canon in the bass and alto , and then in augmentation ( long notes ) from measure 92 in the tenor . Then the movement slows down to Adagio ( a written tempo change , rare in Bach ) , as the altos sing the word " <unk> " ( sinners ) one last time in an extremely low range . As the text turns to the words " Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum " ( and expect the resurrection of the dead ) , the slow music modulates daringly with enharmonic transformations through several keys , touching E @-@ flat major and G @-@ sharp major , vividly bringing a sense of dissolving into disorder as well as expectation before the resurrection to come . Whenever the word " mortuorum " appears , the voices sing long low notes , whereas " resurrectionem " is illustrated in triad motifs leading upwards . 
 = = = = Et expecto = = = = 
 The expectation of a world to come , " Et expecto " ( And I expect ) is a joyful concerto of five voices with trumpets . Marked " Vivace a Allegro " , the voices begin with the trumpets fanfares in imitation on the same text as before . The movement is based on the first choral movement of Gott , man lobet dich in der Stille , BWV 120 , Jauchzet , ihr <unk> Stimmen ( Exult , you delighted voices ) . After this statement , which ends in homophony , the instruments begin a short section in which runs in rising sequences alternate with the fanfares , in which the voices are later embedded . The word " resurrectionem " appears then in the runs in the voices , one after the other in cumulation . A second turn of instruments , embedded voices and upward runs brings the whole section to a jubilant close on the words " et vitam venturi <unk> . Amen " ( and the life of the world to come . Amen ) , with extended runs on " Amen " . Wenk likens the movement to the dance <unk> , a " quick duple meter with an upbeat " . 
 = = = No. 3 Sanctus = = = 
 = = = = Sanctus = = = = 
 " Sanctus " ( Holy ) was an independent movement written for Christmas , scored for six voices SSAATB and a festive orchestra with trumpets and three oboes . In the original , dating from 1724 , Bach had asked for three soprano parts , alto , tenor and bass . Only the score and duplicate parts of this performance survived . The music in D major is in common time , but dominated by triplets . The three upper voices sing frequently alternating with the thee lower voices , reminiscent of a passage by Isaiah about the angels singing " Holy , holy , holy " to each other ( Isaiah 6 : 23 ) . The number of voices may relate to the six wings of the seraphim described in that passage . 
 = = = = <unk> sunt coeli = = = = 
 The continuation , " <unk> sunt coeli " ( Full are the heavens ) , follows immediately , written for the same scoring as a fugue in dancing 3 / 8 time with " quick runs " . 
 = = = No. 4 Osanna , Benedictus , Agnus Dei et Dona nobis pacem = = = 
 = = = = Osanna in excelsis = = = = 
 " Osanna in excelsis " ( Osanna in the Highest ) is set for two choirs and a festive orchestra , in the same key and time as the previous movement . The movement is based , as is the opening chorus of the secular cantata Preise dein Glücke , <unk> Sachsen , BWV 215 , probably on the opening movement of the secular cantata Es <unk> der König , der Vater im Lande , BWV Anh 11 , of 1732 . The movement contrasts homophonic sections with fugal development . Wenk likens the movement to the dance <unk> , a " fast triple meter with an upbeat " . 
 = = = = Benedictus = = = = 
 The following thought , " Benedictus " , " blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord " , is sung by the tenor in an aria with an obbligato instrument , probably a flauto traverso , leading to a repeat of the Osanna . The intimate music contrasts with the Osanna like the Christe eleison with Kyrie eleison . It is written in the latest <unk> Stil ( sensitive style ) as if Bach had wanted to " prove his command of this style " . 
 = = = = Agnus Dei = = = = 
 " Agnus Dei " ( Lamb of God ) is sung by the alto with obbligato violins in unison . The source for the aria is possibly the aria " <unk> euch , ihr <unk> <unk> " ( Leave , you cold hearts ) , the third movement of the lost wedding cantata Auf , süß entzückende Gewalt , BWV Anh 196 . It was the basis also for the fourth movement of the Ascension Oratorio , Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen , BWV 11 , the aria Ach , bleibe doch , mein <unk> Leben . 
 = = = = Dona nobis pacem = = = = 
 The final movement , " Dona nobis pacem " ( Give us peace ) , recalls the music of the thanks expressed in Gratias agimus tibi . A choral movement in Renaissance style as the conclusion followed the Dresden Mass style . As the Gratias agimus tibi , the movement is based on the first choral movement of Wir danken dir , Gott , wir danken dir , BWV 29 , with minor alterations because of the different text . The text appears on both the theme and the countersubject , here stressing " pacem " ( peace ) at the beginning of the line . By quoting Gratias , Bach connects asking for peace to thanks and praise to God . He also connects the Missa composed in 1733 to the later parts .

 US Highway 141 ( US 141 ) is a north – south United States Numbered Highway in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan . The highway runs north @-@ northwesterly from an interchange with Interstate 43 ( I @-@ 43 ) in Bellevue , Wisconsin , near Green Bay , to a junction with US 41 / M @-@ 28 near Covington , Michigan . In between , it follows city streets in Green Bay and has a concurrent section with US 41 in Wisconsin . North of Green Bay , US 141 is either a freeway or an expressway into rural northern Wisconsin before downgrading to an undivided highway . In Michigan , US 141 is an undivided highway that runs through rural woodlands . The highway has two segments in each state ; after running through Wisconsin for about 103 miles ( 166 km ) , it crosses into Michigan for approximately another 8 miles ( 13 km ) . After that , it crosses back into Wisconsin for about 14 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 23 km ) before crossing the state line one last time . The northernmost Michigan section is about 43 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 70 km ) , making the overall length about 169 miles ( 272 km ) . 
 When the US Highway System was formed on November 11 , 1926 , US 141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay , and one segment of the modern highway in Michigan was originally designated US 102 . This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US 141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan . Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages over the years to smooth out sharp curves in the routing . Since the 1960s , the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments . US 141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s — the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I @-@ 43 . The section north of Abrams , Wisconsin , was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century , with an additional divided @-@ highway section opening a few years later .

 As a bi @-@ state highway , US 141 is a state trunk highway in Wisconsin and a state trunkline highway in Michigan . In Wisconsin , the segment through the Green Bay area is not on the National Highway System ( NHS ) , except for about four blocks along Broadway Avenue that is part of an intermodal connector with the Port of Green Bay . The NHS is a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . From the Green Bay suburb of Howard northward , including the entire length through Michigan , US 141 is a part of the NHS . From the I @-@ 43 interchange in Howard north to the split at Abrams , US 141 is also a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) , a tourist route that surrounds Lake Michigan .

 US 141 starts at an interchange with I @-@ 43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue . From the terminus at exit 178 , US 141 runs north to Main Street , and then northwesterly along Main Street through town . Wisconsin Highway 29 ( WIS 29 ) merges with US 141 at an intersection on the northwest side of Bellevue , and the two highways run concurrently through residential subdivisions . Main Street passes over I @-@ 43 and continues to the north and into the city of Green Bay . US 141 / WIS 29 crosses Baird Creek and runs along the banks of the East River . At the intersection with Monroe Avenue , WIS 29 turns south , joining WIS 54 / WIS 57 while US 141 continues westward on Main Street to cross the Fox River on the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge . On the west side of the river , the highway follows <unk> Street for a block before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four blocks . From there , the highway follows Mather Street west to <unk> Avenue . US 141 follows that street northwesterly and parallel to I @-@ 43 on the north side of Green Bay . This area is mostly residential with some businesses immediately on either side . In the suburb of Howard , US 141 merges onto the US 41 freeway via the interchange at exit 170 . US 41 / US 141 has an interchange for I @-@ 43 just south of the Duck Creek crossing . 
 From Howard northward , the freeway runs through suburban Brown County to Suamico , parallel to a line of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad ( ELS ) , through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions . There are frontage roads on both sides of the freeway to provide access to the properties immediately adjacent to US 41 / US 141 . There are a number of interchanges with county @-@ maintained roads between Suamico and Abrams in Oconto County . At Abrams , US 141 splits from US 41 and heads northward while the latter freeway turns northeasterly . The landscape north of the split transitions to forest , and the freeway crosses the Oconto River in Stiles south of the interchange with WIS 22 . The freeway bypasses Lena to the east and continues north through mixed farm fields and forest to the county line . North of the line , US 141 continues to the Marinette County communities of Coleman and Pound as an expressway . Through Coleman and Pound there is also a Business US 141 . Past the latter town , US 141 transitions from expressway to a two @-@ lane undivided highway . 
 South of Crivitz , US 141 crosses the Peshtigo River . The highway crosses a branch line of the ELS on the east side of Crivitz and continues north through woodland to the community of Middle Inlet . North of town , the roadway turns northeasterly to the community of Wausaukee where it intersects WIS 180 . From there , the highway passes through the communities of Amberg and Beecher before coming into Pembine . That town is where US 8 merges in from the west . The two highways run concurrently north and northeasterly to an intersection southeast of Niagara . US 8 separates to the east , and US 141 turns <unk> along River Street into Niagara . The highway then turns north along Roosevelt Road and over the Menominee River to exit the state of Wisconsin . 
 = = = Quinnesec northward = = = 
 Once in Michigan , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of Quinnesec , US 141 meets and joins US 2 . The two highways run concurrently westward into Iron Mountain along Stephenson Avenue , passing through a retail business corridor and into downtown . M @-@ 95 joins the two highways , and all three pass Lake Antoine . M @-@ 95 turns off north of town and US 2 / US 141 crosses the Menominee River back into Wisconsin . 
 US 2 / US 141 makes a 14 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 23 @.@ 3 km ) run through Florence County , passing the Spread Eagle Chain of Lakes . The highway serves the communities of Spread Eagle and Florence . The only junction with another state trunk highway in Wisconsin on the northern section is with the concurrent highways WIS 70 / WIS 101 in Florence . The highway crosses back into Michigan on a bridge over the Brule River south of Crystal Falls . 
 Across the state line , the trunkline runs through forest near several smaller bodies of water such as <unk> , Kennedy and Railroad lakes . The highway enters Crystal Falls on 5th Street . US 2 / US 141 runs along the top of the hill in town and intersects the western terminus of M @-@ 69 next to the Iron County Courthouse . US 141 continues westward on Crystal Avenue and separates from the US 2 concurrency on the western edge of town . Running north and northwesterly , US 141 passes to the east of the Ottawa National Forest through rural Iron County . The highway crosses the Paint River and continues through forest to the community of Amasa . The trunkline crosses the Hemlock River on the west side of town . From there , US 141 runs northward into the southwest corner of Baraga County and also enters the Eastern Time Zone . West of Worm Lake , US 141 meets M @-@ 28 in the community of Covington . The two highways merge and run easterly for about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) before US 141 terminates at US 41 ; M @-@ 28 continues eastward , merging with US 41 .

 = = = Initial state highways = = = 
 In 1918 , when Wisconsin initially numbered its highway system , the route of what later became US 141 followed two separate state highways : WIS 17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS 16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay . Segments that later became US 141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS 15 between Green Bay and Abrams , and WIS 38 between Abrams and Wausaukee . North of Wausaukee , the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway . In 1919 , Michigan signed its highway system , but the state did not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line . The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M @-@ 12 . The segment through Florence County , Wisconsin , was WIS 69 , and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington , the M @-@ 69 moniker was used . In 1919 , the WIS 38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line . The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921 . The same year , WIS 17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via <unk> . WIS 17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington ; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS 57 in the area . By 1924 , maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS 57 at the state line . 
 = = = Conversion to a US Highway = = = 
 As originally proposed in 1925 , several US Highways in Wisconsin and Michigan 's Upper Peninsula were to be designated . However , the routings for two highways were different in Michigan in 1925 than on the final 1926 map . In the original plan , US 102 was supposed to replace M @-@ 15 from US 2 at Rapid River , continue via Marquette into Baraga County , and end at US 41 near Covington . At the same time , US 41 was to have followed US 2 from Powers to Crystal Falls and continued north to Covington . However , when the final plan was approved and implemented on November 11 , 1926 , US 41 took the eastern routing through Rapid River and Marquette , and US 102 was routed between Crystal Falls and Covington . In both plans , US 141 was only routed between Milwaukee and Green Bay , replacing WIS 17 and WIS 16 . At the time the two US Highways were created , WIS 57 was left untouched between Abrams and Niagara . The next year , the M @-@ 57 designation was assigned to connect WIS 57 to Quinnesec , and US 8 was extended to follow US 141 to US 2 near Iron Mountain . 
 By September 20 , 1928 , the extension of US 141 northward from Green Bay along WIS 57 to the Michigan state line had been approved , and the signage was readied for installation the following month . The US 102 designation was decommissioned when US 141 was also extended to replace M @-@ 57 from the state line , along US 2 to Crystal Falls and north to Covington . US 8 's eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US 2 in Norway in 1929 . US 141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s ; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams . 
 The next major changes were made at the beginning of the 1930s in Michigan . A realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934 . In 1940 , a new routing from the state line north to Crystal Falls was opened ; the previous routing was returned to local control . The northern end was relocated near Covington in late 1948 or early 1949 when US 41 was realigned in the area . This terminus was shifted again when US 141 / M @-@ 28 was realigned in the area in late 1955 or early 1956 . 
 = = = Freeway era = = = 
 At about the same time as the realignments in Michigan , two @-@ lane bypasses of Manitowoc and Port Washington in Wisconsin were opened in 1957 . The state built a divided @-@ highway segment that opened the following year running from the Milwaukee area northward to the <unk> – Milwaukee county line . The highway was rerouted to run further inland , bypassing Haven , Wisconsin , in 1959 . In late 1961 , the highway in Michigan was rebuilt in northern Iron and southern Baraga counties between Amasa and Covington as the state smoothed out sharp corners in the routing and finished paving US 141 ; a similar project was completed in 1972 south of Amasa to Crystal Falls . 
 Wisconsin proposed an addition to the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s to connect Green Bay , the state 's third @-@ largest city , to the system . Variations on this proposal included using either the US 41 or US 141 corridors , or a new corridor in between . This request was rejected in the 1950s , but it was approved in the 1960s . After approval , the state started the process to convert US 141 between Milwaukee and Abrams into a freeway . The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area , starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road . The following year , an extension of the freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue . By 1965 , the bypass of Sheboygan was opened ; the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year . Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967 , extending northward to Grafton in <unk> County . The last section of US 141 in the city of Milwaukee to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when I @-@ 94 was finished through downtown ; at the same time , US 141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I @-@ 94 . 
 Another freeway section from north of Green Bay to Suamico was opened in 1971 . In 1972 , the divided @-@ highway segment between Suamico and Abrams opened , and the state started the construction of additional freeways between Green Bay and Milwaukee . The bypasses of Sheboygan and Cedar Grove were converted to full freeways in 1973 . Another segment of freeway opened in 1975 that bypassed Port Washington and connected the freeway sections that ended near Grafton and Cedar Grove . I @-@ 43 was first designated on the 1978 official state highway map along US 141 from Milwaukee to Sheboygan ; missing segments of I @-@ 43 between Green Bay and Milwaukee are shown as either under construction or proposed . By 1980 , the northern bypass of Green Bay was under construction and I @-@ 43 / US 141 was open from Maribel to Branch northwest of Manitowoc ; US 141 was truncated to end at the northern end of the Sheboygan bypass . I @-@ 43 was initially completed in 1981 , and the southern terminus of US 141 was moved again , truncating the highway to end in Bellevue by 1983 . 
 In 1986 , the states in the Great Lakes region created the LMCT as part of a larger program of tourist routes in the region ; US 141 carries the LMCT between the northern I @-@ 43 junction in the Green Bay area north to the split with US 41 at Abrams . In the first years of the 21st century , US 141 was expanded to a four @-@ lane expressway northward from Abrams to Oconto Falls . A further upgrade in 2006 expanded the highway to four @-@ lanes northward to Beaver . On April 7 , 2015 , the segment of US 141 that runs concurrently with US 41 on the west side of Green Bay designated a part of I @-@ 41 by the Federal Highway Administration .

 Business U.S. Highway 141 ( Bus . US 141 ) is a business loop of US 141 that runs through the communities of Coleman and Pound . The loop follows County Trunk Highway B ( CTH @-@ B ) northeasterly from the US 141 expressway into downtown Coleman and then turns northward near Coleman High School . Bus . US 141 continues northward into Pound , crossing the Peshtigo River in between the two communities . North of Pound , the loop crosses over US 141 on 21st Road and continues to an intersection with WIS 64 . The business loop follows WIS 64 back to an interchange on US 141 northwest of Pound where the loop terminates . 
 In 2006 , the US 141 expressway was extended northward near Beaver , and the former route of US 141 , plus a connector roadway southwest of downtown Coleman was designated as a business loop . This route does not appear on the official Wisconsin Department of Transportation maps , so it is a locally designated business loop under local maintenance .

 Robert California ( James Spader ) challenges office manager Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) to double sales after a rousing motivational speech . After Andy tries unsuccessfully to mine ideas from the office employees , he consults a book on management techniques and decides to try an incentives program . He presents a number of items catered to individual employees , which they can purchase with " points " earned by exceptional workplace performance . This idea garners mixed reactions from the employees , but when Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) jokingly asks Andy what prizes he will offer for inordinately large numbers of points , he offers to tattoo whatever his co @-@ workers would like on his butt in exchange for 5 @,@ 000 points , not anticipating that anyone will be able to even come close to this amount . 
 The entire staff agrees to pool their points towards Andy 's butt tattoo , and the office suddenly becomes a hubbub of activity , with Stanley Hudson ( Leslie David Baker ) even giving up his nap @-@ time to make sales calls for Sabre 's new Pyramid tablet . To Andy 's great dismay , they earn 5 @,@ 000 points by the end of the day . When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor , Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he isn 't sure why Robert made him manager . Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales , and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea . <unk> up by Jim 's talk , Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo , which Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) changes , without telling Andy , to an image of a dog that has " Nard " written on it , a reference to Andy 's nickname " Nard Dog . " Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror , Andy is pleased with the result . Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him , because he is an underdog . Meanwhile , Pam and Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) become walking buddies at Angela 's request , but after Angela says she 's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant , a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have anything else to do with each other .

He also criticized the series for low stakes writing that " While Andy 's character might be reflecting on his management skills , and Pam and Angela might be pregnant , nothing about the eighth season " of the series suggested that the show would try anything other than what it had already established as the status quo . He ultimately gave the episode a " C " . 
 M. Giant from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a " B – " . Cindy White from IGN gave the episode a mixed review , writing that it took a " step back " from the promise of the season premiere and resorted to " <unk> [ ing ] familiar plot elements " for the sake of the plot .

 " Simpson Safari " is the seventeenth episode of The Simpsons ' twelfth season . It was produced in 2000 and aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 1 , 2001 . When the Simpsons run out of food thanks to a bag boy strike , the family finds an old box of Animal Crackers in their attic . In the box is a golden cracker that was part of a contest conducted by the owners of Animal Crackers . Finding out that anyone that found the golden cracker would win a trip to Africa , Homer shows it to the company 's owners , who refuse to honor the prize . When he is injured by one of the box 's sharp corners however , the family is given a free trip to Africa as compensation . 
 Although " Simpson Safari " was written by John Swartzwelder , the idea for the episode was pitched by a former staff writer Larry Doyle . The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland , who had been to Africa as a child . Because of his visit there , Kirkland attempted to make the episode look as authentic as possible , even though the Simpsons trip to Africa was " all over the place " geographically . 
 The episode features Frank Welker as all the animals in Africa . In its original broadcast , the episode was seen by approximately 7 @.@ 7 million viewers , finishing in 42nd place in the ratings the week it aired . Following its broadcast , the episode received mixed reviews from critics . The episode was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 2001 , which it ultimately lost .

 While Marge takes Maggie to the hospital after Maggie swallowed an issue of Time magazine whole , Homer , Bart and Lisa go grocery shopping . Homer and many others mistreat the bag boys at the grocery store , and every bag boy in Springfield goes on strike . Presumably and strangely having no ability to shop without bag boys to pack their bags , they are unable to buy more food . Homer thus goes on a search for food when it runs out , and Santa 's Little Helper finds a box of animal crackers in the attic , which is more than 30 years old . 
 Homer bites into a giraffe , but he does not know that it is made of solid gold , which indicates Homer has won a trip to Africa . The makers of the animal crackers initially refuse to honor the prize because the contest ended a number of years ago , but when Homer is injured by the sharp corner of the box , they reconsider in order to avoid a lawsuit . 
 The family lands in Tanzania . When the family is in Africa , they experience such sights as the Masai Mara , Ngorongoro Crater , Olduvai Gorge , Mount Kilimanjaro , and meet with a group of Maasai tribesmen . During a vigorous tribal dance , Homer manages to enrage a hippo . It chases after the family , who escape on a raft going down a raging river . After surviving the plunge over Victoria Falls , the family stumble upon a chimpanzee sanctuary maintained by the scientist Dr. Joan Bushwell ( a parody of Jane Goodall ) . She claims to be researching the animals behavior when a group of poachers arrive to take the chimps . 
 The Simpsons try to hold the poachers but eventually they break into the sanctuary . The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists , who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a chimp slave master , exploiting their labor at a nearby diamond mine . Worried that the Simpsons will report her to the authorities , Dr. Bushwell offers everyone diamonds as a bribe , which all except Lisa happily accept . The Simpsons leave Africa , and return to Springfield with the diamonds offered to them by Dr. Bushwell . On the plane , it is revealed that their former tour guide , Kitenge , is now president of the country , with the former president now the Simpsons ' flight attendant .

 " Simpson Safari " ' s setpiece shows some of Springfield 's citizens mistreating the bag boys in a grocery store , prompting the bag boys to go on strike . The sequence was inspired by an <unk> store in Los Angeles , whose employees went on strike at the time the episode was written . The idea to have the Simpsons visit Africa was pitched by former staff writer Larry Doyle . Former staff writer John Swartzwelder was then assigned to write the first draft of the episode 's script . Because of his involvement with the episode , " Simpson Safari " contains several " classic " Swarzwelder @-@ type jokes , according to staff writer Matt Selman . Examples of these include the cover of the Animal Cracker box and Homer and Dr. Joan Bushwell 's discussion about the smell of feces in the doctor 's hut . After Swarzwelder wrote the first draft , the writing staff rewrote the script . When writing the episode , the writers deliberately included factual errors to annoy viewers who wanted the series to seem realistic . Commenting on the episode , Selman said " It 's kind of a combination of really nice , observational designs and then just [ ... ] things that are deliberately wrong . To anger people who care about things being real . " 
 Mark Kirkland , who had visited Africa before , served as the director for " Simpson Safari " . When he was sixteen years old , Kirkland spent six weeks in Kenya with a film crew that was making a documentary film called A Visit to a Chief 's Son . When he first read the script , he found that the episode was " all over the place " geographically . " It would be like in the United States , saying : ' I walked out of Grand Central Station and then I turned left and was standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon . ' The locations are just all over the place " he said in the episode 's DVD commentary . Still , Kirkland strove to make the episode look as realistic as possible by drawing influence from his experience in Kenya . 
 For example , the steering column on Kitenge 's Land Rover is placed on the right side of the car . At one point in the episode , the Simpsons visit the Maasai people , a <unk> ethnic group of semi @-@ nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania . The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode are dancing is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life , and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people 's culture , the use of lip plates and neck rings are not . " That was kind of fun for me to try to make this stuff [ ... ] as crazy as the story is , [ to ] make it realistic " , Kirkland commented on directing the episode . 
 In a scene in the episode , the Simpsons are floating down a river on a shield . At one point , the family is seen by two Africans , who speak in Kiswahili . Additionally , the song that Kitenge sings when driving the Simpsons ( " <unk> @-@ <unk> " by Angélique <unk> ) was a popular song in Africa . In order to make it sound accurate , Hank Azaria , who portrays Kitenge in the episode , was taught to sing the song phonetically by a professor in Swahili in the University of California , Los Angeles . Dr. Joan Bushwell , the " Jane Goodall @-@ type " character in the episode , was portrayed by American voice actress Tress MacNeille , who also voices Lindsey Naegle among other characters in the series . All animals ' noises ( except for Santa 's Little Helper , who is voiced by main cast member Dan Castellaneta ) were done by American voice actor Frank Welker .

" Their habit of using the first act as a red herring , only semi @-@ connected to the rest of the show , is ingenious and hilarious " , he wrote . 
 " ' Simpson Safari ' , for example , begins with an extended bit about a <unk> strike , which leads the family to desperate culinary measures , which then leads Homer to a box of animal crackers in the attic , which then leads to the discovery of a prize inside the box for the safari trip that encompasses the rest of the episode .

 = Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa = 
 The Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa ( AFM ) is a classical Pentecostal Christian denomination in South Africa . With 1 @.@ 2 million adherents , it is South Africa 's largest Pentecostal church and the fifth largest religious grouping in South Africa representing 7 @.@ 6 percent of the population . Dr. Isak Burger has led the AFM as president since 1996 when the white and black branches of the church were united . It is a member of the Apostolic Faith Mission International , a fellowship of 23 AFM national churches . It is also a member of the South African Council of Churches . 
 The AFM is one of the oldest Pentecostal movement is South Africa with roots in the Azusa Street Revival , the Holiness Movement teachings of Andrew Murray and the teachings of John Alexander Dowie . The AFM had an interracial character when it started , but , as in American Pentecostalism , this interracial cooperation was short @-@ lived . The decades from the 1950s to the 1980s were marked by the implementation of apartheid . After 1994 , the white AFM moved rapidly towards unification with the black churches . By 1996 , all the AFM churches were united in a single multi @-@ racial church . 
 The constitution of the AFM blends at the national level the elements of a presbyterian polity with an episcopal polity . Decentralization is a major feature of its constitution , which allows local churches to develop their own policies . The Apostolic Faith Mission displays a variety of identities and ministry philosophies , including seeker @-@ sensitive , Word of Faith , Presbyterian , and classical Pentecostal . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history : 1908 – 1912 = = = 
 While the Apostolic Faith Mission was founded in 1908 and Pentecostalism brought to South Africa by American missionaries , several factors helped create a favorable climate for the Pentecostal movement to spread in the country . First , revivals in the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa ( DRC ) in 1860 , 1874 and 1884 were characterized by deep conviction of sin followed by conversion , fervent prayer and some ecstatic phenomenon . Thus in 1908 , some older DRC members were familiar and open to Pentecostalism . Second , the Dutch Reformed minister Andrew Murray was a prominent holiness teacher and helped create a climate for revival . A third factor was the Zionist churches , led by John Alexander Dowie from Zion City , Illinois , United States . 
 In May 1908 , five American missionaries — John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch , along with their wives , and A. Lehman — arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis . Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie 's Zion City and had been baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles . Despite these influences , however , the missionaries had no organizational affiliation . Arriving in Pretoria , Lake felt that the Holy Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria . In Johannesburg , a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house . She witnessed that the Holy Spirit had sent her to the train station to meet the American missionaries . They first began ministry at a rental hall in <unk> , a Johannesburg suburb , on 25 May 1908 . The services consisted of a mixed racial group , and many who attended the first services were Zionists . The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle , Bree Street , Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew . It was there that the Apostolic Faith Mission developed , initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908 . It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913 , however . 
 By 1909 , it had spread to the Orange River Colony . In South Africa , as at Azusa Street , the movement was initially multi @-@ racial , appealing to both Boers and blacks . It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and <unk> , where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer would have made it an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment . Lake made contact with the <unk> Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux , and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission . Their influence can be seen in the AFM 's practice of baptism by triple immersion , once each in the name of the Father , and the Son , and the Holy Spirit . There was also interaction with other churches , such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement , which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM . Most AFM converts , however , came from the Dutch Reformed churches . 
 The AFM was a self @-@ propagating movement early on due to the successful evangelism of Boer and African converts . In 1909 , Lake wrote to The Upper Room , an American Pentecostal journal , that missionaries were not needed as the AFM had men " far superior to any that can come from America . . . who can speak English , Dutch , Zulu , and Basuto " . Towns and mining compounds were prime areas for missionary activity , reflected by the fact that 69 percent of AFM members lived in urban areas in 1928 . From urban centers , the AFM spread to rural areas through returning labor migrants or native preachers . 
 The interracial character of the AFM was , like American Pentecostalism , short @-@ lived . One explanation for this shift was tensions over economic competition between poorer whites and blacks . In July 1909 , it was decided that baptisms of whites , blacks , and coloureds would be separate . Lake even addressed the South African Parliament , which he advised to adopt a policy of racial segregation similar to the policy for Native Americans in the United States . An all white executive council controlled the movement , and a separate committee , also white controlled , was responsible for coordinating the " black work " . This situation would lead to many black secessions from the AFM resulting in the formation of African Initiated Churches , but the church would continue to have a large black constituency , who continued to exercise considerable autonomy in their local churches . As the AFM adopted the " daughter churches " approach to missions from the Dutch Reformed churches , eventually the AFM was divided into four main groupings : the white parent church , a large black daughter church , a coloured daughter church and an Indian daughter church . 
 According to Barry Morton , " An analysis of the missionary career of John G. Lake shows that the initial spread of Pentecostalism and Zionism in southern Africa was facilitated by the systematic use of fraud and deception " . Morton cites examples of misappropriation of AFM funds and the staging of miraculous healings . 
 = = = 1913 – 1969 : Divisions , institutionalization , accommodation = = = 
 The return of Lake and Hezmalhalch to America was an important turning point for the AFM . Le Roux was elected its president in 1913 , a role he filled until 1943 . During his leadership , the AFM distanced itself from the black Zionist movement with its distinctive taboos and dress and began looking to the Dutch Reformed heritage and respectability . During his leadership a large portion of the AFM 's African constituency withdrew in 1919 . Another schism occurred in 1928 when Maria Fraser led a number of AFM members to withdraw and form the Latter Rain Mission in South Africa . She and her followers , known as <unk> ( Blue Dresses ) for the dresses worn by female adherents , emphasized Holy Spirit @-@ inspired prophecy to a degree seen as unbiblical , excessive and dangerous by AFM officials . The movement did , however , contribute to a re @-@ emphasis on the work and presence of the Holy Spirit in the church and ministry . 
 Upon becoming general secretary in 1935 , David du Plessis oversaw a process of institutionalization from which a strong bureaucracy developed , directed by an increasingly educated leadership . It also had the effect of decreasing the role of the laity in the governance of the denomination . He is seen as the father of the " New Order " of AFM liturgy which called for more " respectable " and less extroverted Pentecostal church services . By the 1940s , the simple halls that once housed AFM congregations had been replaced by buildings modeled on Dutch Reformed architecture . Elders and deacons were introduced in 1945 , and by the 1960s relations between the AFM and Dutch Reformed churches had improved . 
 While du Plessis advocated closer ties with the other Afrikaans churches in the 1950s and 60s , the AFM accommodated itself to South Africa 's apartheid system . This move toward Afrikaner Nationalist support was led by AFM vice @-@ president Gerrie Wessels , who became a National Party senator in 1955 . During this time , the AFM ( despite its large black , coloured , English and Indian membership ) began to be spoken of as the " Fourth Afrikaans church " after South Africa 's three Reformed churches . 
 However , not everyone was satisfied with the new liturgical and political directions of the AFM . Wessel 's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors , the loss of the majority of the English membership , and a major division of Afrikaner members who did not share his political views . These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically . In 1958 , they broke from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 Since 1919 , the black , coloured , and Indian sections of the AFM had developed as separate " daughter churches " or " mission churches " . These were , however , dependent on the white church ; the AFM 's missions superintendent was the ex officio chairman of the daughter churches ' Workers and Executive councils . After 1991 , the white and black churches remained separate , but blacks were made legal members for the first time . In 1996 , the two sections came together to become one operational unit , and the church 's newly elected president , Isak Burger , apologized for the past treatment of non @-@ whites . 
 The AFM is a growing church that prioritize church planting and growth . It has spread to all towns and villages in South Africa . More than 2000 assemblies and branch assemblies have been established . 
 = = Beliefs = = 
 Local churches within the Apostolic Faith Mission display a variety of identities and ministry philosophies , including seeker @-@ sensitive , Word of Faith , Presbyterian , and classical Pentecostal . The beliefs of the Apostolic Faith Mission are articulated in its Confession of Faith : 
 God is the eternal and triune . 
 God the Father is the author of creation and salvation . 
 Jesus Christ is the only Son of God the Father . For the sake of humanity and its salvation , he became flesh , lived on earth and was crucified , died and was buried ; rose from the dead and ascended to heaven , seated at the right hand of the Father . 
 The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son , convicts the world of sin , righteousness and judgement and leads in all truth . 
 The Bible is the word of God , written by men inspired by the Holy Spirit . It authoritatively proclaims the will of God and teaches all that is necessary for salvation . 
 All human beings are created in the image of God , but because of sin , this image is marred . It is the will of God that all people should receive salvation through faith in Jesus Christ . 
 The baptism in the Holy Spirit with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues is promised to all believers . The gifts and fruit of the Spirit will be manifested in the life of a Christian , and a Christian should be a disciple of Jesus Christ living a consecrated and holy life . 
 Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church which is constituted by the Holy Spirit and consists of born again believers . The Church is responsible for the proclamation and demonstration of the gospel and God ’ s will to all people . As a charismatic community they fellowship with and edify one another . 
 Believer 's baptism by immersion and the Lord 's Supper are instituted by Jesus Christ to be observed by the Church . 
 At the time appointed by God , Jesus Christ will come to take away his Church . 
 Jesus Christ will judge the living and the dead . There will be a resurrection of the body and eternal life for the righteous and eternal punishment for the wicked . There will be the new heaven and the new earth where God will reign in glory . 
 = = Worship = = 
 The AFM is a Pentecostal church and its liturgy reflects the ecstatic and experiential practices found in similar churches world @-@ wide . Shouting , antiphonal singing , simultaneous and spontaneous prayer and dance are still commonly found in the worship services . 
 The order of service is similar to other Pentecostal churches , for example the Assemblies of God . There is no formal order of service , but most churches follow a routine of congregational singing , an offering / tithe collection , prayer , a sermon and an altar call . During the service , congregants may operate in various spiritual gifts , such as a message in tongues , a prophecy and words of wisdom or knowledge , as inspired by the Holy Spirit . During the congregational singing part of a service , a believer ’ s attitude of worship is often expressed through raising their hands in the <unk> posture . 
 Regular services are generally held on Sunday mornings and evenings . During the week , there are sometimes prayer or small group meetings and other types of gatherings . 
 = = Organization = = 
 In 2000 , the Apostolic Faith Mission adopted a new constitution which at the national level blends elements of its preexisting presbyterian polity with the " New Apostolic Paradigm " , which moved it towards an episcopal polity . According to this philosophy , successful , proven Christian leaders and pastors fulfill the role of apostles . At the local level , decentralization is the major effect of this new constitution , which allows local churches to develop their own policies . In the adoption of its new constitution , the AFM looked to the Assemblies of God in Australia as a model . 
 = = = Local and regional = = = 
 Qualifications for membership are that one be born again , baptized , recognized as a member of a local assembly ( church ) and adhere to the Confession of Faith . Local assemblies are led by a pastor and governing body , of which the pastor is a member . In addition to being a member of the governing body , the pastor is the assembly 's leader and " vision carrier " . The governing body appoints pastors . 
 Local assemblies are organized into geographical regions . Regional leadership forums are representative bodies consisting of pastors and delegates from each local assembly . Every three years , each forum elects a regional committee from among its members and a regional leader from among its pastors . The committee acts as an executive and advisory body to the regional leadership forum . Each region is represented by its leader on the National Leadership Forum . Non @-@ geographical regions , in the form of networks of local churches that share a peculiar ministry philosophy , also exist . These are normally led by the senior pastors of urban mega @-@ churches , who network with a number of local assemblies nationwide that look to them for leadership and mentorship . 
 = = = National = = = 
 The AFM 's national representative body is the triennial General Business Meeting . Its main function is the election of the national officers : president , deputy president , general secretary and general treasurer . The four national officers always represent the significant ethnic groups within the church . Each local assembly is entitled to send a pastor and a delegate as voting members . Additional voting members are members of the National Leadership Forum , members of standing committees , one additional member representing each church department and one additional representative of the church 's theological training institutions . Before 2000 , the General Business Meeting was known as the Workers Council , met annually , and possessed greater power . After the adoption of the new constitution , most of the body 's power was transferred to the National Leadership Forum . 
 The National Leadership Forum , formerly known as the Executive Council , is the AFM 's policy making body and the " guardian of doctrinal , ethical and liturgical matters in the church " . It licenses pastors , sets standards for ministerial training and settles disputes . It also convenes the annual National Leadership Conference and the General Business Meeting . While it has power to create and implement regulations , over 50 percent of the regional leadership forums can veto a regulation within 90 days of its passage by the National Leadership Forum . The National Leadership Forum 's members are the national officers , the regional leaders , leaders of church departments and a representative of the AFM 's theological training institutions . It may appoint additional members at its discretion . The administrative affairs of the national church are under the oversight of the national officers .

 Theological training in the AFM is presently done at four campuses . Pastor M.A. <unk> is rector of the Theological Institute of <unk> north of Pretoria . Pastor . A. Govender is the rector of the <unk> Covenant Campus in Durban . Pastor J.R. de Beer is principal of the Sarepta Theological College in <unk> <unk> , Cape Town . Prof. Jan <unk> is rector of the Auckland Park Theological Seminary in Auckland Park , Johannesburg . These training institutions are in the process of being united , as decided by the General Business meeting of the AFM in 2007 . The Apostolic Faith Mission Seminary is now in partnership with the North @-@ West University .

 Enter the Void is a 2009 English @-@ language French drama film written and directed by Gaspar Noé and starring Nathaniel Brown , Paz de la Huerta , and Cyril Roy . Set in the neon @-@ lit nightclub environments of Tokyo , the story follows Oscar , a young American drug dealer who gets shot by the police , but continues to watch subsequent events during an out @-@ of @-@ body experience . The film is shot from a first @-@ person viewpoint , which often floats above the city streets , and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past . Noé labels the film a " psychedelic melodrama " . 
 Noé 's dream project for many years , the production was made possible after the commercial success of his previous feature film , Irréversible ( 2002 ) . Enter the Void was primarily financed by Wild Bunch , while Fidélité Films led the actual production . With a mix of professionals and newcomers , the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and psychedelic drug experiences . Principal photography took place on location in Tokyo , and involved many complicated crane shots . Co @-@ producers included the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie , which also provided the computer @-@ generated imagery . The film 's soundtrack is a collage of electronic pop and experimental music . 
 A rough cut premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival , but post @-@ production work continued , and the film was not released in France until almost a year later . A cut @-@ down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010 . The critical response was sharply divided : positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative , while negative critics called it tedious and puerile . The film performed poorly at the box office . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Oscar ( Nathaniel Brown ) lives in Tokyo with his younger sister Linda ( Paz de la Huerta ) and supports himself by dealing drugs , against the advice of his friend Alex ( Cyril Roy ) , who attempts to turn Oscar 's interest toward The Tibetan Book of the Dead , a Buddhist book about the afterlife . The first segment begins with Linda leaving for work ( at a local strip club ) and then follows Oscar 's nightly routine through strict point @-@ of @-@ view shots , including momentary blackouts that represent blinking , private internal thoughts , and extended sequences of a drug @-@ induced hallucination . 
 Next , Alex meets Oscar at the apartment and they leave so that Oscar can deliver drugs to his friend Victor ( Olly Alexander ) . On the way , Alex explains parts of The Tibetan Book of the Dead to Oscar : how the spirit of a dead person sometimes stays among the living until it begins to experience nightmares , after which it attempts to reincarnate . They arrive at a bar called The Void . Oscar enters alone and sits down with a distressed Victor , who mutters " I 'm sorry " before they are swarmed by police officers . Oscar seals himself in a bathroom stall and attempts to flush his drugs . When the flush does not work , he yells through the door that he has a gun and will shoot . In response , a police officer opens fire and hits Oscar , who falls to the floor . 
 Oscar 's viewpoint rises and looks at his body from above , and then we begin to witness his life in a roughly chronological order . His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash ; Oscar and Linda , devoted to each other , were sent to different foster homes ; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him ; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario , to Oscar 's distress ; Oscar increased the scope of his dealing operations and started using potent psychedelics — in particular , DMT — more frequently ; Alex discovered that Oscar slept with Victor 's mother ; and finally , we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs , only to be shot in the bathroom . 
 Afterwards , a disembodied Oscar floats over Tokyo and witnesses the aftermath of his death . Linda becomes withdrawn and despondent , especially after getting an abortion ; Oscar 's dealer , Bruno , destroys his stash ; Alex lives in hiding on the streets ; and Linda wishes she would have been with Alex instead of Mario , as Oscar had wanted . On one occasion , Linda wishes that Oscar would come back to life ; Oscar then enters Linda 's head , after which he wakes up at the morgue , from which his body is taken to be cremated . 
 Meanwhile , Victor and his mother scream at each other because she had had sex with Oscar , and because of that Victor had informed the police about Oscar 's drug dealing ; Victor is then thrown out of his parents ' home . He shows up at Linda 's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed , but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps . This angers Linda , who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself . 
 The perspective now hovers high above Tokyo and enters an airplane , where Oscar 's mother breast @-@ feeds a baby to whom she whispers Oscar 's name . The view then drops to Linda and Alex , who take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex . The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions . Each couple emanates a pulsating electric @-@ like pink glow from their genitals . Oscar enters Alex 's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex 's point of view . He then travels inside Linda 's vagina to witness Alex 's thrusting , then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister 's ovum . The final scene is shot from the perspective of a baby being born to Oscar 's mother . ( According to the director , this is a flashback to Oscar 's own birth in the form of a false memory ) . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The cinematic experience itself is the main focus of the film , but there is also a central theme of emptiness . Noé describes the film 's subject as " the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience . " The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead , and ends with the spirit 's search for a way to reincarnate . The director , who opposes all religious beliefs , says that " the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead , and heard about it before being [ shot by a gun ] . It 's not the story of someone who dies , flies and is reincarnated , it 's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream . " Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar 's recollection of " the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth " . The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar 's life starts over again in an endless loop , due to the human brain 's perception of time . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The idea for the film had been growing since Noé 's adolescence , when he first became interested in matters of death and existence . In his early twenties — while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms — he saw Robert Montgomery 's Lady in the Lake , a 1947 film shot entirely in a first @-@ person perspective . He then decided that , if he ever made a film about the afterlife , that was the way in which it would be filmed . Noé had been working on different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production . The story had initially been more linear , and the drafts were set in different locations , including the Andes , France , and New York City . Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film 's hallucinogenic aspects , and because Japan 's repressive drug laws add to the drama , explaining the intensity of the main character 's fear of the police . 
 Noé first tried to get the film funded in the early 2000s . Several producers responded positively to the script , and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer 's German company X @-@ <unk> Creative Pool . It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out . Prospects changed when Irréversible ( 2002 ) became a commercial success . Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal , and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary , Wild Bunch . When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé what he wanted to do next , he answered Enter the Void . The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential , but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them , they said that they were willing to fund it . Since development went slowly at Pathé , Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch 's offer . 
 Enter the Void was produced under Fidélité Films , with 70 % of the budget invested by Wild Bunch . French co @-@ producers included Noé 's company Les <unk> de la Zone and the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie . It received pre @-@ sales investment from Canal + and funding from Eurimages . Additional co @-@ production support was provided by Essential <unk> of Germany and <unk> <unk> of Italy . The total budget was 12 @.@ 38 million euro . In retrospect , Noé called Irréversible a bank robbery , a film made in order to finance Enter the Void . He also saw it as a helpful technical exercise . 
 = = = Cast = = = 
 The decision to use English @-@ speaking actors was made early . Since the film would be very visual , the director wanted audiences to be able to focus on the images , and not have to rely on subtitles . He later expressed his approval of the use of dubbed voice tracks in non @-@ English speaking countries . 
 The role of Linda was the first to be cast . Noé found Paz de la Huerta after holding auditions in New York City . " I met Paz and I really liked her . She had the profile for the character because she likes screaming , crying , showing herself naked — all the qualities for it . " Due to a desire that Linda and Oscar should be believable as siblings , Nathaniel Brown , a non @-@ professional , was cast because of his resemblance to Huerta . Noé feared that a professional actor would be frustrated by being shown almost exclusively from behind , but he felt that Brown , an aspiring director , would find it stimulating to merely be present on the set . Auditions were held for westerners living in Japan for other Tokyo @-@ based roles . Cyril Roy went to an audition with a friend only because he wanted to talk with the director , whose previous films he admired . Roy was cast as Alex , since Noé found his talkative personality suitable for the role . Noé said about Brown and Roy : 
 The thought of acting in a film had never even entered their minds . They 're easy @-@ going people , they have a good time in front of the camera and I don 't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working . Paz , however , was definitely conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role . 
 = = = Visual conception = = = 
 Noé had tried various hallucinogens in his youth , and used those experiences as inspiration for the visual style . Later , when the director was already planning the film , he tried the psychoactive brew <unk> , in which the active substance is DMT . This was done in the Peruvian jungle , where the brew is legal due to its traditional use as an entheogen . Noé described the experience as very intense , and said he regarded it " almost like professional research . " Since few on the design team had ever taken a hallucinogen , it was necessary for Noé to collect and provide visual references in the forms of paintings , photographs , music videos , and excerpts from films . One reference used was the works of biologist Ernst Haeckel , whose drawings influenced the organic patterns seen during Oscar 's visions . 
 Another important stylistic influence was the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger , and in particular Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome . Noé saw Anger 's films in the early 1990s , while promoting the short film Carne , and quickly became a fan . Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter <unk> . Noé 's favourite film , 2001 : A Space Odyssey , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films ; Noé wanted to become a filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven . Brian De Palma 's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely from such a perspective . 
 There were two reasons for showing Oscar 's head and shoulders within the frame during the flashback scenes , rather than letting the camera be the character 's eyes . The first was that this is the way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events . He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible , as many point @-@ of @-@ view films , in his opinion , look unintentionally funny . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The crew filmed in Tokyo from 19 October to 15 December 2007 . Flashback scenes were shot in Montreal over the course of four weeks the following spring , until 16 May 2008 . The team went back to Tokyo twice for additional footage , once before the Montreal session and once when principal photography was complete . Only four persons on the Tokyo set were French ; the rest of the crew was Japanese . Marc Caro worked as the supervisor of set designs in Tokyo . According to Noé , Caro had three months free after finishing Dante 01 , his first effort as a solo director , so Noé asked him to come to Japan . 
 The 100 @-@ page screenplay detailed plot developments and many of the visual traits , but very little dialogue was scripted , so the actors were asked to improvise their lines . Noé explained this approach : " For me , directing actors is just finding the right people and putting them in the right mood on the set and letting them go . ... I think the energy has to come on the set at the very last minute . " Locations were used in <unk> and other parts of Shinjuku . Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution , the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on @-@ location scenes . Criminal organisations were not involved in the actual production . Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios . More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements . Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film . The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location , but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio ; this included revisits to some of the previous locations , which were replicated as large indoor sets . Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city . Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography , and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual @-@ effects team . 
 The film was mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 <unk> film stock . Scenes where Oscar is alive were shot in the super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras , and the rest in super 16 with an <unk> <unk> Prod . The cinematographer was Benoît Debie , who also shot Irréversible . As in Irréversible , Noé was reluctant to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around . Thanks to Tokyo 's many neon signs , very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes , despite the fact that many were shot late at night . For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical , in @-@ frame light sources . Some exceptions were made . One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours , ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens . For this , Debie used a set of red , green , and blue programmable disco lights , which allowed for all different hues . The disco lights were easy to hide . They were also used for simulation of neon flashes , and to add a tint of red to the dressing @-@ room scenes . Another exception was the use of strobe lights , which were programmed together with the coloured lights . Blue colour was avoided throughout , since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams . Noé was the film 's camera operator , except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets , as they required a taller cameraman . In those scenes , the camera was held by Debie . 
 = = = Post @-@ production = = = 
 Enter the Void 's post @-@ production process lasted more than a year . Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre <unk> of BUF Compagnie . Every scene in the film includes computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) — even the flashback scenes , where the backdrops were digitally altered . Studio scenes , helicopter shots , and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which . For shots from high altitudes , the team started with helicopter footage from video , and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs . Neon lights , reflections , and dark areas were consistently accentuated . <unk> were created through a mixture of motion blur , chromatic aberration , and focus effects . For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens , the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments ' reflection values along with the lens effect . 
 Noé initially asked the Daft Punk member Thomas Bangalter , who had composed the music for Irréversible , to create an original soundtrack for Enter the Void . Bangalter was occupied with work on Tron : Legacy and had to decline . As a compromise , he provided Noé with an arrangement of ambient sounds and samples from existing experimental music , from which Noé compiled what he envisioned as " a maelstrom of sounds . " Bangalter is billed in the credits as sound effects director , and the film features his track " <unk> " originally composed for Irréversible . One of the sources of inspiration for the soundtrack was " Revolution 9 " by The Beatles , a sound collage which Noé describes as a work " where you catch the beginning of a note , or of a melody and then it 's already somewhere else . " The two main musical themes of the film are " Freak " by the British electro artist LFO , which is played during the opening credits , and a recording by Delia Derbyshire of Johann Sebastian Bach 's " Air on the G String " , which serves as the theme for Oscar 's childhood and his relationship with Linda . The beginning of " ANS " by the British band Coil is heard during Oscar 's first DMT trip . The Throbbing Gristle song " Hamburger Lady " plays as Oscar tries to deliver drugs to Victor at the bar . The soundtrack notably includes excerpts from nearly every part of Jean @-@ Claude Éloy 's two compositions , <unk> and <unk> @-@ no @-@ Michi . Other songs on the soundtrack include <unk> <unk> 's " Music for Baby " , Alvin Lucier 's " Music for Gamelan Instruments , Microphones , Amplifiers and Loudspeakers " , and works by Denis Smalley , <unk> , and Zbigniew <unk> . 
 When the film premiered at film festivals , it was initially shown in a version without any credits . As several people at the screenings complained about the length of the film , Noé decided that if the final version would have any opening titles , they would have to be " as fast as possible and as graphic as possible " . The German experimental filmmaker Thorsten Fleisch was hired to create the title logo . Noé discovered Fleisch through his 2007 film Energie ! , for which the technique of animated sparks had been developed . 
 = = Release = = 
 A 163 @-@ minute version of the film competed in the main competition of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival . The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film 's sound design , and some visual effects were not fully in place . Noé said about the version : " the film was like a baby of three months . I took it out of my belly to show it , flattered by [ festival general ] Thierry <unk> 's invitation , but it was still in gestation . So I had to put it back into my belly , that is to say to tweak many details . " 
 Festival screenings of subsequent versions followed throughout the year , including the Toronto , Sitges , London , and Stockholm international film festivals . The final 154 @-@ minute cut premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival . At the Cannes premiere , the film had alternatively been listed with the French title <unk> le vide , which means " Suddenly the void " . 
 When it was released in France , it used the English title . It premiered in France on 5 May 2010 through Wild Bunch Distribution . The Japanese release followed ten days later . 
 Distribution rights for the United States were picked up at Sundance by IFC Films . Trinity Filmed Entertainment was the British distributor . The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on 24 September 2010 . In both these countries , the film was distributed without the seventh of its nine reels . The running time was therefore 137 minutes at 25 frames per second , which the director had instructed that the film should be played at , or 142 minutes at the more common 24 frames per second . Noé says that none of the cut material is essential for the film . He describes it as " some astro @-@ visions , an orgy scene with Linda and the Japanese girl , the scene where you see [ Oscar ] waking up at the morgue and he thinks he 's alive but he 's not , and then the camera goes down the plughole where she 's tipping his ashes . " The reason the shorter version was made was that Noé had promised the investors to make an alternative edit if the film ended up being longer than two hours and 20 minutes . The film was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray Disc in France on 1 December 2010 . Each edition features both the complete version and the shorter cut .

 Thomas <unk> of Le Monde started his review by recalling the irritation the film caused upon its world premiere in Cannes , and compared the cut he had seen there to the final version : " In all honesty , the difference does not jump to my eyes . Of course , the film seems more consistent , but that may be because we 've already traveled this maze once . While leaving , we might remain calmer , but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and <unk> . " A positive review came from L 'Express , written by Laurent <unk> , who compared the film to 2001 : A Space Odyssey . He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising in a way that influenced the perception of time . " In 2010 , no other filmmaker [ in France ] than Gaspar Noé can shoot with such mastery , nor draw us into a vortex of sensations as vertiginous . " Ouest @-@ France 's critic , on the other hand , was immensely bored by the film , and called it " a padding of simple ideas , stereotypes and cliches in a heap of contrived and vain images which think they 're technical prowess . Soporific cinema . " 
 Upon the Japanese release , the critic writing for The Japan Times reflected : " If Lost in Translation is the film you 'd make when all you know about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5 @-@ star hotels , then Enter the Void is what you would make if you never got beyond the Roppongi pub @-@ crawl . " While the review was largely negative , the author was still impressed by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital : " Visually , much of the film is stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro ( Delicatessen ) takes Tokyo 's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme " . 
 Enter the Void holds a 70 % approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , based on 88 English @-@ language reviews , with a weighted average score of 6 @.@ 7 / 10 . On Metacritic , the film holds a normalized score of 69 out of 100 , based on 19 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 Peter Bradshaw included the film in The Guardian 's top 50 films of the decade so far , and gave it five stars out of five . He compared it to Irréversible , which he had disliked : 
 Enter the Void is , in its way , just as provocative , just as extreme , just as mad , just as much of an outrageous ordeal [ . ] ... But despite its querulous melodrama and crazed Freudian <unk> , it has a human purpose the previous film lacked , and its sheer deranged brilliance is magnificent . ... Love him or loathe him – and I 've done both in my time – Gaspar Noé is one of the very few directors who is actually trying to do something new with the medium , battling at the boundaries of the possible . 
 Andrew Male rated the film two out of five in Empire . Male called it " technically stunning " , but also " dreadfully acted , tediously ' profound ' and painfully overlong " , and accused the director of misogyny . The Village Voice 's Karina Longworth had several reservations about the film . She thought that the characters lacked emotional depth and called the story " a lame fusion of stoner lifestyle , sexual fetish , and philosophical inquiry " , but still ended the review : " I could stare at this movie for days and not get tired of the sensation . A mash @-@ up of the sacred , the profane , and the brain @-@ dead , Enter the Void is addictive . " Jen Chaney of The Washington Post thought that the film was successful as an " attempt to transport moviegoers to a hallucinatory version of the hereafter unlike anything they 've ever witnessed on film " , but added : " The problem is that it 's also the most excruciating sit in recent cinematic memory . And no , the fact that it 's intentionally excruciating doesn 't make it less excruciating . "

 Indonesia ( / <unk> / IN @-@ də @-@ NEE @-@ <unk> or / <unk> / IN @-@ <unk> @-@ NEE @-@ zee @-@ ə ; Indonesian : [ <unk> ] ) , officially the Republic of Indonesia ( Indonesian : Republik Indonesia [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , is a country in Southeast Asia . Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans , it is the world 's largest island country , with more than thirteen thousand islands . It has an estimated population of over 258 million people and is the world 's fourth most populous country as well as the most populous Muslim majority country . The world 's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country 's population . 
 Indonesia 's republican form of government includes an elected legislature and president . Indonesia has 34 provinces , of which five have Special Administrative status . Its capital and most populous city is Jakarta . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor , and Malaysia . Other neighbouring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , Palau , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G @-@ 20 major economies . The Indonesian economy is the world 's 16th largest by nominal GDP and the 8th largest by GDP at PPP . 
 The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century , when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India . Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural , religious and political models from the early centuries CE , and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . Muslim traders and Sufi scholars brought the now @-@ dominant Islam , while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism starting from Amboina and Batavia , and eventually all of the archipelago including Timor and West Papua , at times interrupted by Portuguese , French and British rule , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , mass slaughter , corruption , separatism , a democratisation process , and periods of rapid economic change . 
 Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups . The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the Javanese . A shared identity has developed , defined by a national language , ethnic diversity , religious pluralism within a Muslim @-@ majority population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . Indonesia 's national motto , " Bhinneka Tunggal Ika " ( " Unity in Diversity " literally , " many , yet one " ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . The country has abundant natural resources like oil and natural gas , tin , copper and gold . Agriculture mainly produces rice , tea , coffee , spices and rubber . Indonesia 's major trading partners are Japan , the United States and the surrounding nations of Singapore , Malaysia and Australia . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Indonesia derives from the Greek translation of the Indus River and the word <unk> , meaning " Indian island " . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . In 1850 , George Windsor Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms <unk> — and , his preference , <unk> — for the inhabitants of the " Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago " . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( <unk> <unk> ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and <unk> . 
 After 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularised the name through his book <unk> oder die <unk> des <unk> <unk> , 1884 – 1894 . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was <unk> <unk> ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name <unk> Pers @-@ bureau in 1913 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Fossils and the remains of tools show that the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by Homo erectus , popularly known as " Java Man " , between 1 @.@ 5 million years ago and 35 @,@ 000 years ago . Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45 @,@ 000 years ago . Austronesian peoples , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan . They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and as they spread through the archipelago , confined the indigenous Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions . 
 Ideal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet @-@ field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE , allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE . Indonesia 's strategic sea @-@ lane position fostered inter @-@ island and international trade , including links with Indian kingdoms and China , which were established several centuries BCE . Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . 
 From the 7th century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Borobudur , Sewu and Prambanan . This period marked a renaissance of Hindu @-@ Buddhist art in ancient Java . 
 Around the first quarter of the 10th century , the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Mataram area in Central Java to <unk> River valley in East Java by Mpu <unk> , who established the <unk> Dynasty . Subsequently , series of Javanese Hindu @-@ Buddhist polities rise and fall , from <unk> kingdom ruled by <unk> to Kadiri and <unk> . In West Java , Sunda Kingdom was re @-@ established circa 1030 according to <unk> <unk> inscription . In Bali , the <unk> established their rule on the Kingdom of Bali in the 10th century . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia . 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 Although Muslim traders first traveled through Southeast Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of <unk> populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam , and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . 
 The first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of Indonesia began in 1512 , when Portuguese traders led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . Dutch and British traders followed . In 1602 , the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) , and in following decades , the Dutch has gained foothold in Batavia and Amboina . Throughout 17th and 18th centuries , the Company became the dominant European power in the archipelago . 
 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous outside of coastal strongholds ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . Japanese occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule , and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labor during the Japanese occupation . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and an armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence ( with the exception of the Dutch territory of West New Guinea , which was incorporated into Indonesia following the 1962 New York Agreement , and the UN @-@ mandated Act of Free Choice of 1969 ) . 
 Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the military and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( Partai Komunis Indonesia , PKI ) . An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti @-@ communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Large @-@ scale killings took place which targeted communists , ethnic Chinese and alleged leftists . The most widely accepted estimates are that between 500 @,@ 000 and one million people were killed , with some estimates as high as two to three million . 
 The head of the military , General Suharto , outmaneuvered the politically weakened Sukarno and was formally appointed president in March 1968 . His New Order administration was supported by the US government , and encouraged foreign direct investment in Indonesia , which was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth . However , the authoritarian " New Order " was widely accused of corruption and suppression of political opposition . 
 Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the late 1990s Asian financial crisis . This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protest across the country . Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998 . In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty @-@ five @-@ year military occupation that was marked by international condemnation of repression of the East Timorese . 
 Since Suharto 's resignation , a strengthening of democratic processes has included a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 , which was won by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , who went on to win a second term in 2009 . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism slowed progress ; however , in the last five years the economy has performed strongly . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , sectarian discontent and violence have persisted . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the central government . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . 
 The president of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy @-@ making , and foreign affairs . The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice @-@ president . The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five @-@ year terms . 
 The highest representative body at national level is Majelis <unk> Rakyat ( People 's Consultative Assembly ) or MPR . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalising broad outlines of state policy . It has the power to impeach the president . The MPR comprises two houses ; Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat ( People 's Representative Council ) or DPR , with 560 members , and Dewan Perwakilan Daerah ( Regional Representative Council ) or DPD , with 132 members . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party @-@ aligned members are elected for five @-@ year terms by proportional representation . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . 
 Most civil disputes appear before Pengadilan Negeri ( State Court ) ; appeals are heard before Pengadilan Tinggi ( High Court ) . Mahkamah Agung is the country 's highest court , and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; Pengadilan Tata Negara ( State Administrative Court ) to hear administrative law cases against the government ; Mahkamah <unk> ( Constitutional Court ) to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and Pengadilan Agama ( Religious Court ) to deal with codified Sharia Law cases . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 Since 1999 Indonesia has had a multi @-@ party system . In the two legislative elections since the fall of the New Order regime , no political party has managed to win an overall majority of seats , resulting in coalition governments . 
 The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle is the party of Joko Widodo , the Indonesian President . The Great Indonesia Movement Party is the third largest political party . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 In contrast to Sukarno 's anti @-@ imperialistic antipathy to Western powers and tensions with Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations since the New Order era have been based on economic and political co @-@ operation with the Western world . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbours in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . The country restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti @-@ communist purges early in the Suharto era . 
 Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , and was a founder of the Non @-@ Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , the Cairns Group , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , and a member of OPEC . Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966 , in particular from the United States , western Europe , Australia , and Japan . 
 The Indonesian government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al @-@ Qaeda . The deadliest bombing killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 Indonesia 's Armed Forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI – AD ) , Navy ( TNI – AL , which includes Marine Corps ) , and Air Force ( TNI – AU ) . The army has about 400 @,@ 000 active @-@ duty personnel . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . One of the reforms following the 1998 resignation of Suharto was the removal of formal TNI representation in parliament ; nevertheless , its political influence remains extensive . 
 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . Following a sporadic thirty @-@ year guerrilla war between the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005 . In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Administratively , Indonesia consists of 34 provinces , five of which have special status . Each province has its own legislature and governor . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( <unk> ) and cities ( <unk> ) , which are further subdivided into districts ( <unk> or <unk> in Papua and West Papua ) , and again into administrative villages ( either desa , <unk> , kampung , <unk> in West Sumatra , or <unk> in Aceh ) . 
 The village is the lowest level of government administration in Indonesia . Furthermore , a village is divided into several community groups ( rukun <unk> ( RW ) ) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups ( rukun <unk> ( RT ) ) . In Java the desa ( village ) is divided further into smaller units called <unk> or <unk> ( hamlets ) , these units are the same as rukun <unk> . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected <unk> or <unk> desa ( village chief ) . 
 The provinces of Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system . In 2003 , it instituted a form of sharia ( Islamic law ) . 
 Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution and its willingness to join Indonesia as a republic . Papua , formerly known as Irian Jaya , was granted special autonomy status in 2001 and was split into Papua and West Papua in February 2003 . Jakarta is the country 's special capital region .

According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping ( <unk> ) , Indonesia has 13 @,@ 466 islands , about 6 @,@ 000 of which are inhabited . These are scattered over both sides of the equator . The largest are Java , Sumatra , Borneo ( shared with Brunei and Malaysia ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . Indonesia shares maritime borders across narrow straits with Singapore , Malaysia , the Philippines , and Palau to the north , and with Australia to the south . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . 
 At 1 @,@ 919 @,@ 440 square kilometres ( 741 @,@ 050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 15th @-@ largest country in terms of land area and world 's 7th @-@ largest country in terms of combined sea and land area . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometre ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometre ( 2 @,@ 435 per sq mi ) . 
 At 4 @,@ 884 metres ( 16 @,@ 024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1 @,@ 145 square kilometres ( 442 sq mi ) . Indonesia 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . 
 Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70 @,@ 000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167 @,@ 736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . 
 Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1 @,@ 780 – 3 @,@ 175 millimetres ( 70 @.@ 1 – 125 @.@ 0 inches ) , and up to 6 @,@ 100 millimetres ( 240 inches ) in mountainous regions . Mountainous areas – particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua – receive the highest rainfall . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26 – 30 ° C ( 79 – 86 ° F ) . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity after Brazil . Its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) were once linked to the Asian mainland , and have a wealth of Asian fauna . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku – having been long separated from the continental landmasses — have developed their own unique flora and fauna . Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . 
 Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species , with 36 % of its 1 @,@ 531 species of bird and 39 % of its 515 species of mammal being endemic . Indonesia 's 80 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 50 @,@ 000 miles ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , seagrass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world 's greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1 @,@ 650 species in eastern Indonesia only . 
 The British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north – south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian - moving east from Lombok they are increasingly Australian . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the area . The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea . 
 = = = Environment = = = 
 Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under @-@ resourced governance . Issues include large @-@ scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over @-@ exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . 
 Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world 's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Bali starling , Sumatran orangutan , and Javan rhinoceros . 
 Much of Indonesia 's deforestation is caused by forest clearing for the palm oil industry , which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion . Palm oil expansion requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems . Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities , but it can also degrade ecosystems and cause social problems . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Indonesia has a mixed economy in which both the private sector and government play significant roles . The country is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and a member of the G @-@ 20 major economies . Indonesia 's estimated gross domestic product ( nominal ) , as of 2014 , was US $ 887 billion while GDP in PPP terms is US $ 2 @.@ 685 trillion . It is the sixteenth largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and is the eighth largest in terms of GDP ( PPP ) . As of 2014 , per capita GDP in PPP was US $ 10 @,@ 651 ( international dollars ) while Nominal per capita GDP was US $ 3 @,@ 518 . 
 The debt ratio to GDP is 26 % . The industry sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 46 @.@ 4 % of GDP ( 2012 ) , this is followed by services ( 38 @.@ 6 % ) and agriculture ( 14 @.@ 4 % ) . Since 2012 , the service sector has employed more people than other sectors , accounting for 47 @.@ 9 % of the total labour force , this has been followed by agriculture ( 38 @.@ 9 % ) and industry ( 13 @.@ 2 % ) . Agriculture , however , had been the country 's largest employer for centuries . 
 Indonesia was the 27th biggest exporting country in the world in 2010 , moving up three places from the previous year . Indonesia 's main export markets ( 2009 ) are Japan ( 17 @.@ 28 % ) , Singapore ( 11 @.@ 29 % ) , the United States ( 10 @.@ 81 % ) , and China ( 7 @.@ 62 % ) . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Singapore ( 24 @.@ 96 % ) , China ( 12 @.@ 52 % ) , and Japan ( 8 @.@ 92 % ) . In 2014 , Indonesia ran a trade deficit with export revenues of US $ 176 billion and import expenditure of US $ 178 @.@ 2 billion . 
 Indonesia has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs , and the country 's major export commodities include oil and gas , electrical appliances , plywood , rubber , and textiles . In an attempt to boost the domestic mineral processing industry and encourage exports of higher value @-@ added mineral products , the Indonesian government implemented a ban on exports of unprocessed mineral ores in 2014 . 
 Palm oil production is important to the economy of Indonesia as the country is the world 's biggest producer and consumer of the commodity , providing about half the world supply . Oil palm plantations stretch across 6 million hectares ( roughly twice the size of Belgium ) . Indonesia plans by 2015 to add 4 million additional hectares towards oil palm biofuel production . As of 2012 , Indonesia produces 35 percent of the world 's certified sustainable palm oil ( <unk> ) . 
 The tourism sector contributes to around US $ 10 @.@ 1 billion of foreign exchange in 2013 , and ranked as the 4th largest among goods and services export sectors . Singapore , Malaysia , Australia , China and Japan are the top five source of visitors to Indonesia . 
 Corruption has been a persistent problem . Transparency International , for example , has since ranked Indonesia below 100 in its Corruption Perceptions Index . Since 2007 , however , with the improvement in banking sector and domestic consumption , national economic growth has accelerated to over 6 % annually and this helped Indonesia weather the 2008 – 2009 Great Recession . The Indonesian economy performed strongly during the financial crisis of 2007 – 08 and in 2012 , its GDP grew by over 6 % . Indonesia regained its investment grade rating in late 2011 after losing it in 1997 . As of 2014 , 11 % of the population lived below the poverty line and the official open unemployment rate was 5 @.@ 9 % . 
 Indonesia has a sizeable automotive industry , which produced almost 1 @.@ 3 million motor vehicles in 2014 , ranking as the 15th largest producer in the world . Nowadays , Indonesian automotive companies are able to produce cars with high ratio of local content ( 80 % - 90 % ) . With production peaking at 14 @.@ 5 billion packs in 2011 , Indonesia is the second largest producer of instant noodle after China which produces 42 @.@ 5 billion packs a year . <unk> is the largest instant noodle producer in the world . <unk> brand by <unk> is one of the Indonesia 's best known global brand . 
 Of the world 's 500 largest companies measured by revenue in 2014 , the Fortune Global 500 , two are headquartered in Indonesia i.e. Pertamina and Perusahaan <unk> Negara . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 Road transport is predominant , with a total system length of 437 @,@ 759 km in 2008 . Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well such as taxis . There are usually also bus services of various kinds such as the <unk> buses and the more sophisticated <unk> bus rapid transit system in Jakarta . The <unk> is the largest bus rapid transit system in the world , boasts some 194 km and carriers more than 300 @,@ 000 passengers daily . In addition , BRT systems exist in Yogyakarta , Palembang , Bandung , Denpasar , Pekanbaru , Semarang , Makassar , and Padang without segregated lane . Many cities also have motorised auto rickshaws ( <unk> ) of various kinds . Cycle rickshaws , called <unk> in Indonesia , are a regular sight on city roads and provide inexpensive transportation . 
 The rail transport system has four unconnected networks in Java and Sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long @-@ distance passenger traffic . The inter @-@ city rail network on Java is complemented by local commuter rail services in the Jakarta metropolitan area ( KA Commuter <unk> ) , Surabaya , Medan , and Bandung . In Jakarta , suburban rail services carry 700 @,@ 000 passengers a day . In addition , mass rapid transit and light rail transit systems are under construction in Jakarta and Palembang . 
 Sea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade . It is well developed , with each of the major islands having at least one significant port city . Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago , maritime shipping provides essential links between different parts of the country . Boats in common use include large container ships , a variety of ferries , passenger ships , sailing ships , and smaller motorised vessels . Traditional wooden vessel <unk> still widely used as the inter @-@ island freight service within Indonesian archipelago . Port of Tanjung Priok is Indonesia 's busiest port , and the 21st busiest port in the world in 2013 , handling over 6 @.@ 59 million TEUs . To boost the port capacity , two @-@ phase " New Tanjung Priok " extension project is currently ongoing . When fully operational in 2023 , it will triple existing annual capacity . 
 Frequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands , especially in the chain of islands stretching from Sumatra through Java to the Lesser Sunda Islands . On the busy crossings between Sumatra , Java , and Bali , multiple car ferries run frequently twenty @-@ four hours per day . There are also international ferry services between across the Strait of Malacca between Sumatra and Malaysia , and between Singapore and nearby Indonesian islands , such as Batam . A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands , especially in the eastern part of the archipelago . The national shipping line , <unk> , provides passenger service to ports throughout the country on a two to four week schedule . These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands . Still smaller privately run boats provide service between islands . 
 As of 2014 , there were 237 airports in Indonesia , including 17 international airports . Soekarno – Hatta International Airport is the 18th busiest airport in the world , serving 54 @,@ 053 @,@ 905 passengers , according to Airports Council International . Today the airport is running over capacity . After T3 Soekarno @-@ Hatta Airport expansion will be finished in August 2016 , the total capacity of three terminals become 43 million passengers a year . T1 and T2 also will be revitalised , so all the three terminals finally will accommodate 67 million passengers a year . When finished , Soekarno @-@ Hatta airport will be an aerotropolis . 
 Juanda Airport in Surabaya and Ngurah Rai in Bali are the country 's 2nd and 3rd busiest airport . Garuda Indonesia , flag carrier of Indonesia since 1949 , was selected by Skytrax as " The World 's Best Economy Class " in 2013 . In December 2014 , Garuda Indonesia was awarded as a " 5 @-@ Star Airline " by Skytrax and the eight best airlines in the world . As well as in June 2015 , it also was awarded with " The World 's Best Cabin Crew " . 
 = = = Science and technology = = = 
 Living in an agrarian and maritime culture the people in Indonesian 's archipelago have been famous in some traditional technologies , particularly in agriculture and marine . In agriculture , for instance , the people in Indonesia , and also in many other Southeast Asian countries , are famous in paddy cultivation technique namely <unk> . Bugis and Makassar people in Indonesia are also well @-@ known with their technology in making wooden sailing vessel called <unk> boat . 
 In aerospace technology , Indonesia has a long history in developing military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in Southeast Asia to produce and develop its own aircraft , also producing aircraft components for Boeing and Airbus , with its state @-@ owned aircraft company ( founded in 1976 ) , the Indonesian Aerospace ( Indonesian : PT . <unk> Indonesia ) , which , with EADS CASA of Spain developed the CN @-@ 235 aircraft , which has been exported to many countries . B. J. Habibie , a former Indonesian president played an important role in this achievement . While active as a professor in Germany , Habibie conducted many research assignments , producing theories on thermodynamics , construction , and aerodynamics , known as the Habibie Factor , Habibie Theorem , and Habibie Method respectively . Indonesia also hopes to manufacture the South Korean <unk> KF @-@ X fighter . 
 Indonesia has a well established railway industry , with its state @-@ owned train manufacturer company , the Indonesian Railway Industry ( Indonesian : PT . Industri Kereta Api ) , located in Madiun , East Java . Since 1982 the company has been producing passenger train wagons , freight wagons and other railway technologies and exported to many countries , such as Malaysia and Bangladesh . In the 1980s an Indonesian engineer , <unk> Raka <unk> invented a road construction technique named <unk> which becomes famous afterwards and widely used by many countries . The technology has been exported to the Philippines , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore and in 1995 , a patent was granted to Indonesia .

 The population is expected to grow to around 269 million by 2020 and 321 million by 2050 . An additional 8 million Indonesian live overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Most of them settled in Malaysia , Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates , South Korea , Japan , Singapore , Netherlands , United States , and Australia . 
 = = = Ethnic groups = = = 
 Indonesia is a very ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with around 300 distinct native ethnic groups , and 742 different languages and dialects . Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian @-@ speaking peoples whose languages can be traced to Proto @-@ Austronesian , which possibly originated in Taiwan . Another major grouping are the Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . 
 The largest ethnic group are the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and <unk> are the largest non @-@ Javanese groups . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities . 
 Social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered communal violence . Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising 3 – 4 % of the population . Much of the country 's privately owned commerce and wealth is Chinese @-@ Indonesian @-@ controlled . Chinese businesses in Indonesia are part of the larger bamboo network , a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties . This has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti @-@ Chinese violence .

 Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , and the Protestant denominations are largely a result of Dutch Reformed and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country 's colonial period . A large proportion of Indonesians — such as the Javanese <unk> , Balinese Hindus , and Dayak Christians — practice a less orthodox , syncretic form of their religion , which draws on local customs and beliefs . 
 Most of indigenous native Indonesian beliefs could be categorised as animism , shamanism as well ancestral worship .

 The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century . Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . In written poetry and prose , a number of traditional forms dominate , mainly syair , pantun , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Some of these works are Syair Raja Siak , Syair Abdul Muluk , Hikayat Abdullah , Hikayat Bayan <unk> , Hikayat Hang Tuah , <unk> <unk> , and Babad Tanah Jawi . 
 Early modern Indonesian literature originates in Sumatran tradition . Balai Pustaka , the government bureau for popular literature , was instituted around 1920 to promote the development of indigenous literature , it adopted Malay as the preferred common medium for Indonesia . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include : Dutch author Multatuli , who criticised treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Mohammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre @-@ independence nationalist writers and politicians ; and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . Pramoedya earned several accolades , and was frequently discussed as Indonesia 's and Southeast Asia 's best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature . 
 Indonesian literature and poetry flourished even more in the first half of the 20th century . Chairil Anwar was considered as the greatest literary figure of Indonesia by American poet and translator , Burton Raffel . He was among those youngsters who pioneered in changing the traditional Indonesian literature and modifying it on the lines of the newly independent country . Some of his popular poems include <unk> @-@ Bekasi , Diponegoro and Aku . Other major authors include Marah Roesli ( Sitti Nurbaya ) , <unk> Siregar ( Azab dan Sengsara ) , Abdul Muis ( Salah Asuhan ) , Djamaluddin Adinegoro ( Darah Muda ) , Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana ( Layar Terkembang ) , and Amir Hamzah ( Nyanyi Sunyi ) whose works are among the most well known in Maritime Southeast Asia .

 = M @-@ 119 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 119 is a 27 @.@ 548 @-@ mile ( 44 @.@ 334 km ) state trunkline highway entirely within Emmet County in the US state of Michigan . The highway follows the shore of Lake Michigan and the Little Traverse Bay , with its southern terminus at US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) near Bay View , about four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of Petoskey ; the northern terminus is at a junction with county roads C @-@ 66 and C @-@ 77 in Cross Village . North of Harbor Springs , the highway is known as the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route . This section of highway lacks a centerline and is known for its scenic beauty . On an average day , between 2 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 vehicles use various parts of the highway . 
 The first highways along the route of the modern M @-@ 119 was a section of the original M @-@ 13 designated by July 1 , 1919 . This highway was later redesignated M @-@ 131 in late 1926 , a designation it held until 1979 . During this timeframe , another highway bore the M @-@ 119 moniker in the southern part of the state near Paw Paw from the 1930s until the early 1970s . In between 1926 and 1979 , M @-@ 131 was extended and truncated on both its northern and southern ends at various times . Since the M @-@ 119 designation was applied to the current highway , no changes have been made to the routing . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 119 starts at an intersection with US 31 about four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) northeast of Petoskey near the community of Bay View in Bear Creek Township . The highway runs north between Petoskey State Park on the west and Round Lake on the east as it rounds the east end of Little Traverse Bay . The trunkline passes the eastern and northern edges of the Harbor Springs Municipal Airport as it turns westward near the junction with C @-@ 81 ( Pleasantview Road ) . Through this area , M @-@ 119 runs through the community of <unk> and forests just inland from the bay 's northern shore . As it passes into the city limits of Harbor Springs , the highway follows Main Street into downtown . It turns north and then westward along State Street in the middle of town , intersecting the southern end of C @-@ 77 in the central business district . M @-@ 119 continues westward , passing through a residential area on Bluff Drive as it leaves the city . 
 From Harbor Springs on , M @-@ 119 is the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route , one of the Pure Michigan Byways in the state . Bluff Drive becomes Lake Shore Drive near the Harbor Point Golf Course , and M @-@ 119 turns northward to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline at the mouth of Little Traverse Bay . The roadway meanders through oaks , maples , birch and cedars along an old Ottawa trail . The writers at National Geographic said that " only sometimes can you catch glimmers of Lake Michigan through the trees , but the dense foliage lends beauty to the winding road . " Along this area of the routing , the highway narrows in width and continues through the forest without a centerline most of the remainder of the way . As the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) states on their website , " M @-@ 119 is not a road for those in a hurry . " the trunkline continues through the community of Good Hart up the Lake Michigan shoreline to the community of Cross Village . M @-@ 119 , and state maintenance , end at the intersection between Lake Shore Drive and C @-@ 66 / C @-@ 77 ( State Road ) in the middle of town . 
 As part of the state 's maintenance of M @-@ 119 , MDOT tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 119 were the 14 @,@ 647 vehicles daily near the southern terminus ; the lowest counts were the 2 @,@ 036 vehicles per day at the northern terminus . None of M @-@ 119 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The Discovery Channel named the roadway as one of the " Top 10 Motorcycle Rides in North America " .

 The first incarnation c . 1930 of the M @-@ 119 designation ran four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south from US 12 in Paw Paw south to Lawton in Van Buren County . By the middle of 1936 , it had been extended further south to US 112 near Mottville . In 1971 , all of M @-@ 119 was redesignated as M @-@ 40 .

 The current highway was designated in 1979 , replacing the former route of M @-@ 131 ; the routing has remained unchanged since . This section of highway had been part of M @-@ 13 on July 1 , 1919 , when the state trunkline highway system debuted . Later on November 11 , 1926 , M @-@ 13 south of Fife Lake was redesignated as part of US 131 , and the remainder of M @-@ 13 was designated as M @-@ 131 . 
 Until 1933 , M @-@ 131 had terminated in Harbor Springs ; the highway was extended to the north along Little Traverse Bay and the Lake Michigan shoreline through the community of Good Hart before terminating in Cross Village . This section of highway would be stripped of its designation in 1937 and truncated back to Harbor Springs . In late 1938 or early 1939 , the State Highway Department extended US 131 along the M @-@ 131 corridor to Petoskey . This allowed US 131 to finally connect to its parent , US 31 for the first time since their inception in 1926 . The MSHD re @-@ extended M @-@ 131 back to Cross Village in 1945 . The highway remained as such until 1967 when a slight realignment was made in Emmet County along the lakeshore as M @-@ 131 is routed on to its final alignment .

 The episode was written by show runner and executive producer Shonda Rhimes , while filmmaker Daniel Minahan directed it . Sara Ramirez began receiving star billing in the season premiere , after numerous appearances during the last episodes of the second season . Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle , Washington , it was filmed in Los Angeles , California . Fisher Plaza , which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher 's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle , is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter 's helipad . This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle , which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza , the Seattle Monorail , and other local landmarks . However , the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle , are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills , California . Most scenes are primarily filmed in Los Feliz , Los Angeles , at the Prospect Studios , and the set occupies two stages , including the hospital pieces , but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G.

Rhimes disclosed that the main concept for the episode was to " go in places the audience can imagine , but doesn 't expect " , in an attempt to " freshen up " the series for the new season . Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season , but the process did not occur , due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character 's complex lives . " I feel like so much happened at the end of last season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath . And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath " , stated Rhimes , in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off . Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey 's underwear has in the first episode of the season , noting how they are " a key element " in the development of her character : " Meredith never put them back on . She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant , and she never had a chance to put those panties back on . " Prior to the episode 's broadcast , Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character . In addition , she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists , stating : " It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny , as well as deal with Meredith 's love triangle . Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show . Because things aren 't neat and clean in real life . "

 Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV had a generally mixed to positive perspective on the episode , expressing hope in its further development .

Highly praising the " big and attractive " cast , Dahl positively received the interaction between the characters , noting the " smart " dialogue that helps each character evolve . However , Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes , describing them as " off @-@ putting " and " not believable " , while comparing them to real life interactions between people who emote in a more <unk> manner than displayed on television . " Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying " , stated Dahl , but noted that the dialogue , who he had previously been worried would be " too cutesy " , was not bothering , and rather realistic , noting how the show is " smartly written " . He also described the Pompeo and Heigl 's as " worthy of attention " . After the episode 's broadcast , Robert Rorke of the New York Post deemed Stevens " the heart and soul " of the series , due to the episode mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person . Rorke named her the show 's heroine , and wrote that " Izzie is a welcome , calming presence , despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette " , considering her to have been more prominent than the title character , Grey , whose storyline received negative critiques : " She used to be the queen of the romantic <unk> . But lately , she 's been a little dopey , with that endless McDreamy soliloquies . " Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity had a positive outlook on the episode . She praised the storyline of Izzie lying on the bathroom floor , describing at as " a perfect opportunity for flashbacks " , which proved the strong friendship the five interns share . Montgomery 's reaction to the discovery of Grey 's underwear was deemed by Chao " hilarious " , whereas Bailey 's interaction with the quarantined patient was described as " touching " . " Now it 's Meredith 's turn to be feckless and indecisive " , stated Chao , noting the lack of realism in Grey 's love triangle with Shepherd and Dandridge . However , she praised the interaction of the three characters , who she deemed " lovely adolescents " .

 " Peterotica " was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Kurt Dumas . The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show 's producers . For instance , the original title of the episode was " A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur 's Butt " , but broadcasting standards objected . A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version ; one entitled " Catcher in the Eye " was removed from the television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover , which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation . The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing , although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it , as it is the second semen joke of the episode . When Lois ' father , Carter , sits down at the breakfast table , Lois states : " Daddy , did you remember to clean up ? " Originally , she was meant to say , " Daddy , did you remember to wipe yourself ? " , but broadcasting standards objected , so it was modified to " Daddy , did you remember to clean yourself ? " However , standards still objected , so it was changed to its current version . 
 Stewie is seen practicing for the Olympics and is disturbed by Chris ; this scene was originally meant to be the start of a subplot in which Stewie would build a machine to make Chris intelligent . Although it would be successful , Chris would become more clever than Stewie . The subplot was scrapped because it was deemed not funny enough . The gag in which Peter is a landlord over a rat family in the Griffin family basement was removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes . The " thinking grenade " sketch , in which Peter uses live grenades to help him think , was originally intended to be used in " PTV " in a scene in The Drunken Clam , but there were no windows in the Clam nearby for Peter to throw the grenades through , so instead of adding windows to the building 's design for that episode , the gag was moved to this episode . The " naughty flapper girl " gag was included in the original draft of the episode . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode features multiple references to popular culture . The song Quagmire sings in the sex shop is a part of " Make ' Em Laugh " from the 1952 musical film Singin ' in the Rain . The erotic book Peter buys at the sex shop is Much Ado About Humping , a parody of the William Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing . The four porn books shown on screen are references to works of literature : Angela 's Asses to Angela 's Ashes by Frank McCourt , Catcher in the Eye to Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger , Shaved New World to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley , and Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Black Chick to Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince by J. K. Rowling . 
 After returning from the porn shop , Peter is shown watching an episode of Blind Justice . The lawyer who attempts to sue Carter is forced into a battle with a rancor in a scene that mirrors Luke Skywalker 's fight with the Rancor in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi . When Peter and Carter are trying to make money , they start their own sitcom called Quahog Creek , a ripoff of WB 's Dawson 's Creek . The theme song " I Don 't Want to Wait " uses misinterpreted lyrics of the actual theme song performed by Paula Cole . While Peter and Carter try to steal money from Lois ' purse , Peter balances on a unicycle and hums Aram Khachaturian 's " Sabre Dance " . When waiting in line at the movies , Peter tells Carter about a new movie , The Picnic , starring Jude Law and Renée Zellweger . The song used is " Roll to Me " , by Del <unk> . 
 A reference to The Simpsons ' appearance in The Tracey Ullman Show is made when the Griffins are shown as characters in the show . Family Guy producer David A. Goodman comments that , contrary to what some think , the show was not trying to criticize The Simpsons , but rather trying to show the differences in voices and character appearance .

 In a review of the Family Guy , Volume Four DVD collection , Mike Drucker of IGN singled out " Peterotica " and " PTV " as " new classics . " In a review of the episode , Bob Sassone of TV Squad commented on the scene where Peter acts as a landlord over a rat , writing , " to be honest , I 'm not even sure what the hell was going on there , it was so disturbing . " Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews criticized the episode , writing that " the story is thin and the laughter absent . " The episode sparked controversy over a depiction of the <unk> cleaning character , a character used by Carol Burnett in The Carol Burnett Show that was used in the episode without her consent . Burnett sued , but the case was later dismissed .

The ship was converted into an ironclad monitor during 1862 – 63 ; the first ship with more than two gun turrets in history . Her conversion was not very successful as she rolled excessively and the weight of her armor and turrets strained her hull . Her deep draft meant that she could not operate off shallow Confederate ports and she was relegated to harbor defense at Hampton Roads , Virginia for the duration of the war .
