 The Alliance was known under various sponsored names following deals with companies including Baker @-@ Joiner , <unk> Services , Harvey World Travel , Travel Factory , and Aspire . In July 2008 , it was announced that 23 teams would compete in the Alliance in the 2008 – 09 season , however the following week it was announced that Stapenhill had folded , leaving 22 teams in the league . The league was contested on a double round @-@ robin basis , with each team playing each of the other teams in the division once at home and once away . Three points were awarded for a win , one for a draw and zero for a defeat . Goal difference was used to separate teams on the same points . 
 As the Alliance was a Step 5 league , its member clubs were eligible to take part in the FA Cup and FA Vase as long as their grounds met the required standards . The league also operated two cup competitions of its own , the knock @-@ out League Cup , which was staged every season , and the Joe <unk> Cup , which was contested between the previous season 's League Cup winners and league champions and which was first contested in 1996 . 
 According to official FA regulations , clubs from the Alliance were eligible for promotion to a Step 4 league , provided their grounds met the required standard . Clubs promoted from Step 5 leagues were placed in the most geographically appropriate Step 4 leagues as determined by the FA 's Leagues Committee . The number of clubs promoted from the Alliance each season could vary , as regulations stated that the " ten most suitable clubs from the leagues at Step 5 " will gain promotion . All clubs gaining promotion from the Alliance were placed in either the Southern League or the Northern Premier League . Teams finishing at the bottom of the Alliance table could be relegated to an appropriate feeder league , depending on the number of teams remaining in the division after other promotion and relegation issues have been resolved . 
 = = Attendance = = 
 Attendances at Midland Alliance matches were generally small , with many matches attracting fewer than 100 spectators . In the 2006 – 07 season the average attendance across the league was 124 , but in the 2007 – 08 season this fell to 87 . The best supported team in that season was Atherstone Town , whose average home attendance was 162 . The worst supported team was Oldbury United whose matches drew an average of only 39 spectators . The highest attendance for a single match was 411 , for the match between Stratford Town and Barwell . Barwell also took part in the match with the lowest attendance , when their game away to Oldbury United drew only 20 spectators . 
 The largest crowd ever registered for an Alliance match was 1 @,@ 280 , for the match between Racing Club Warwick and local rivals Leamington on 26 December 2005 . The smallest crowd recorded was 10 , for a match between <unk> and Biddulph Victoria on 19 April 2003 .

 = Carl Linnaeus = 
 Carl Linnaeus ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; 23 May 1707 – 10 January 1778 ) , also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné ( Swedish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ) , was a Swedish botanist , physician , and zoologist , who formalised the modern system of naming organisms called binomial nomenclature . He is known by the epithet " father of modern taxonomy " . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linnæus ( after 1761 Carolus a Linné ) . 
 Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland , in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University , and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published a first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden , where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , and published several volumes . At the time of his death , he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe . 
 The Swiss philosopher Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : " Tell him I know no greater man on earth . " The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : " With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly . " Swedish author August Strindberg wrote : " Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist " . Among other compliments , Linnaeus has been called Princeps <unk> ( Prince of Botanists ) , " The Pliny of the North , " and " The Second Adam " . He is also considered as one of the founders of modern ecology . 
 In botany , the author abbreviation used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for species ' names is L. In older publications , sometimes the abbreviation " Linn . " is found ( for instance in : Cheeseman , T.F. ( 1906 ) – Manual of the New Zealand Flora ) . Linnaeus ' remains comprise the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens , following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , since the sole specimen he is known to have examined when writing the species description was himself . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Linnæus was born in the village of <unk> in Småland , Sweden , on 23 May 1707 . He was the first child of Nicolaus ( Nils ) <unk> ( who later adopted the family name Linnæus ) and Christina <unk> . His siblings were Anna Maria Linnæa , Sofia Juliana Linnæa , Samuel Linnæus , and Emerentia Linnæa . 
 One of a long line of peasants and priests , Nils was an amateur botanist , a Lutheran minister , and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland . Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult , Samuel <unk> . 
 A year after Linnæus ' birth , his grandfather Samuel <unk> died , and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult . The family moved into the rectory from the curate 's house . Carl had one brother , Samuel ( who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping ) . and three sisters . 
 Even in his early years , Linnæus seemed to have a liking for plants , flowers in particular . Whenever he was upset , he was given a flower , which immediately calmed him . Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names . Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants . 
 Carl 's father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname . Before that , ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of Scandinavian countries : his father was named <unk> after his father <unk> Bengtsson . When Nils was admitted to the University of Lund , he had to take on a family name . He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant linden tree ( or lime tree ) , <unk> in Swedish , that grew on the family homestead . This name was spelled with the æ ligature . When Carl was born , he was named Carl Linnæus , with his father 's family name . The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature , both in handwritten documents and in publications . Carl 's patronymic would have been Nilsson , as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus . 
 = = = Early education = = = 
 Linnaeus ' father began teaching him basic Latin , religion , and geography at an early age . When Linnaeus was seven , Nils decided to hire a tutor for him . The parents picked Johan <unk> , a son of a local yeoman . Linnaeus did not like him , writing in his autobiography that <unk> " was better calculated to extinguish a child 's talents than develop them . " 
 Two years after his tutoring had begun , he was sent to the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717 . Linnaeus rarely studied , often going to the countryside to look for plants . He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen , which was taught by the headmaster , Daniel <unk> , who was interested in botany . <unk> noticed Linnaeus ' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden . 
 He also introduced him to Johan Rothman , the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at <unk> ( a gymnasium ) in Växjö . Also a botanist , Rothman broadened Linnaeus ' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine . By the age of 17 , Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature . He remarks in his journal " read day and night , knowing like the back of my hand , <unk> <unk> 's <unk> Book of Herbs , <unk> 's Flora <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> Gothica and <unk> Hortus <unk> .... " 
 Linnaeus entered the Växjö <unk> in 1724 , where he studied mainly Greek , Hebrew , theology and mathematics , a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood . In the last year at the gymnasium , Linnaeus ' father visited to ask the professors how his son 's studies were progressing ; to his dismay , most said that the boy would never become a scholar . Rothman believed otherwise , suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine . The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany . Nils accepted this offer . 
 = = = University studies = = = 
 = = = = Lund = = = = 
 Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject . He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to Tournefort 's system . Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants , according to Sébastien Vaillant . In 1727 , Linnaeus , age 21 , enrolled in Lund University in Skåne . He was registered as Carolus Linnæus , the Latin form of his full name , which he also used later for his Latin publications . 
 Professor Kilian <unk> , natural scientist , physician and historian , offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging , as well as the use of his library , which included many books about botany . He also gave the student free admission to his lectures . In his spare time , Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne , together with students sharing the same interests . 
 = = = = Uppsala = = = = 
 In August 1728 , Linnaeus decided to attend Uppsala University on the advice of Rothman , who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany . Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala : Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg . Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors , by then they were older and not so interested in teaching . Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures , and had others stand in for him . The botany , zoology , pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state . In Uppsala , Linnaeus met a new benefactor , Olof Celsius , who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist . He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library , which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden . 
 In 1729 , Linnaeus wrote a thesis , <unk> <unk> Plantarum on plant sexual reproduction . This attracted the attention of Rudbeck ; in May 1730 , he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second @-@ year student . His lectures were popular , and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people . In June , Linnaeus moved from Celsius ' house to Rudbeck 's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children . His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions . Over that winter , Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort 's system of classification and decided to create one of his own . His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils . He began writing several books , which would later result in , for example , Genera Plantarum and Critica Botanica . He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden , Adonis <unk> . 
 Rudbeck 's former assistant , Nils Rosén , returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine . Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus ' botany lectures , but Rudbeck prevented that . Until December , Rosén gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine . In December , Linnaeus had a " disagreement " with Rudbeck 's wife and had to move out of his mentor 's house ; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer . That Christmas , Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years . His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest , but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University . 
 = = = Expedition to Lapland = = = 
 During a visit with his parents , Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland ; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695 , but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards . Linnaeus ' hope was to find new plants , animals and possibly valuable minerals . He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people , reindeer @-@ herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia 's vast <unk> . In April 1732 , Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey . 
 Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on May 12 , 1732 , just before he turned 25 . He travelled on foot and horse , bringing with him his journal , botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants . Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula <unk> , later known as Linnaea borealis , the twinflower that would become his favourite . He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens , the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer , a common and economically important animal in Lapland . 
 Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia , making major inland incursions from Umeå , Luleå and Tornio . He returned from his six @-@ month @-@ long , over 2 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) expedition in October , having gathered and observed many plants , birds and rocks . Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity , Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants . These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica . However , on the expedition to Lapland , Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system . 
 In Flora Lapponica Linnaeus ' ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way , making this the first proto @-@ modern Flora . The account covered 534 species , used the Linnaean classification system and included , for the described species , geographical distribution and taxonomic notes . It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing . Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as " the most classic and delightful " of Linnaeus 's works . 
 It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals . Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was traveling , Linnaeus remarked : " If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had , how many teats and where they were placed , I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds . " 
 In 1734 , Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna . Funded by the Governor of Dalarna , the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones , but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at Røros . 
 = = = Doctorate = = = 
 Back in Uppsala , Linnaeus ' relations with Nils Rosén worsened , and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg 's family . Sohlberg 's father was a mining inspector , and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun . Sohlberg 's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary . At that time , the Dutch Republic was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree ; Linnaeus , who was interested in both of these , accepted . 
 In April 1735 , Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the Netherlands , with Linnaeus to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk . On the way , they stopped in Hamburg , where they met the mayor , who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed : the taxidermied remains of a seven @-@ headed hydra . Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake : jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together . The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation . As much as this may have upset the mayor , Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor 's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined . Fearing his wrath , Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly . 
 When Linnaeus reached Harderwijk , he began working toward a degree immediately ; at the time , Harderwijk was known for awarding " instant " degrees after as little as a week . First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden , which he then defended in a public debate . His dissertation , submitted on 23 June , was titled Dissertatio medica <unk> in qua <unk> hypothesis nova de <unk> <unk> causa ( " Inaugural thesis in medicine , in which a new hypothesis on the cause of intermittent fevers is presented " ) . He concluded that malaria arose only in places with clay @-@ rich soil . He is now known to have been wrong about the cause , not having a microscope good enough to see malarial parasites , which were spread by mosquitoes breeding in the water that collected in ruts and puddles . But he was right in predicting that traditional Chinese medicine , including the use of wormwood ( Artemisia ) , is a potential source of antimalarial drug . ( Artemisinins , derived from wormwood , are now the principal antimalarial drugs . ) 
 The next step was to take an oral examination and to diagnose a patient . After less than two weeks , he took his degree and became a doctor , at the age of 28 . During the summer , Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala , Peter Artedi . Before their departure from Uppsala , Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die , the survivor would finish the other 's work . Ten weeks later , Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam , and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete . 
 = = = Publishing of Systema Naturae = = = 
 One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was Johan Frederik Gronovius to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden . The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants . When Gronovius saw it , he was very impressed , and offered to help pay for the printing . With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson , the manuscript was published as Systema Naturae ( 1735 ) . 
 Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands , Herman Boerhaave , who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there . Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America , but Linnaeus declined , stating he would not stand the heat . Instead , Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist Johannes Burman . After his visit , Burman , impressed with his guest 's knowledge , decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter . During his stay , Linnaeus helped Burman with his Thesaurus <unk> . Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working : Fundamenta Botanica and Bibliotheca Botanica . 
 = = = George Clifford , Philip Miller , and Johann Jacob Dillenius = = = 
 In August , during Linnaeus ' stay with Burman , he met George Clifford III , a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in <unk> . Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus ' ability to classify plants , and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden . Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter , and could thus not accept immediately . However , Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane 's Natural History of Jamaica , a rare book , if he let Linnaeus stay with him , and Burman accepted . On 24 September 1735 , Linnaeus moved to Hartekamp to become personal physician to Clifford , and curator of Clifford 's herbarium . He was paid 1 @,@ 000 florins a year , with free board and lodging . Though the agreement was only for a winter of that year , Linnaeus practically stayed there till 1738 . It was here that he wrote a book Hortus Cliffortianus , in the preface of which he described his experience as " the happiest time of my life . " ( A portion of Hartekamp was declared as public garden in April 1956 by the <unk> local authority , and was named " <unk> " . It eventually became , as it is claimed , the biggest playground in Europe . ) 
 In July 1736 , Linnaeus travelled to England , at Clifford 's expense . He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane , a collector of natural history , and to see his cabinet , as well as to visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper , Philip Miller . He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants , as described in Systema Naturae . Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature , preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first . Linnaeus , nevertheless , applauded Miller 's Gardeners Dictionary , The conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre @-@ Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists . He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768 . Miller ultimately was impressed , and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus ' system . 
 Linnaeus also traveled to Oxford University to visit the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius . He failed to make Dillenius publicly fully accept his new classification system , though the two men remained in correspondence for many years afterwards . Linnaeus dedicated his Critica <unk> to him , as opus botanicum quo <unk> mundus non <unk> . Linnaeus would later name a genus of tropical tree <unk> in his honor . He then returned to Hartekamp , bringing with him many specimens of rare plants . The next year , he published Genera Plantarum , in which he described 935 genera of plants , and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with <unk> Generum Plantarum , with another sixty ( <unk> ) genera . 
 His work at Hartekamp led to another book , Hortus Cliffortianus , a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp . He wrote it in nine months ( completed in July 1737 ) , but it was not published until 1738 . It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes , which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants . 
 Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 ( new style ) , when he left the house to return to Sweden . Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland . In May 1738 , he set out for Sweden again . On the way home , he stayed in Paris for about a month , visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu . After his return , Linnaeus never left Sweden again . 
 = = = Return to Sweden = = = 
 When Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738 , he went to Falun , where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth <unk> . Three months later , he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician , and thus to make it possible to support a family . Once again , Linnaeus found a patron ; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin , who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty . During this time in Stockholm , Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science ; he became the first <unk> in the academy by drawing of lots . 
 Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family , he received permission to marry his fiancée , Sara Elisabeth <unk> . Their wedding was held 26 June 1739 . Seven months later , Sara gave birth to their first son , Carl . Two years later , a daughter , Elisabeth Christina , was born , and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena , who died when 15 days old . Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children : Lovisa , Sara Christina , Johannes and Sophia . 
 In May 1741 , Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University , first with responsibility for medicine @-@ related matters . Soon , he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine , Nils Rosén , and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden ( which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand ) , botany and natural history , instead . In October that same year , his wife and nine @-@ year @-@ old son followed him to live in Uppsala . 
 = = = Öland and Gotland = = = 
 Ten days after he was appointed Professor , he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of Öland and Gotland with six students from the university , to look for plants useful in medicine . First , they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June , when they sailed to Visby in Gotland . Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month , and then returned to Uppsala . During this expedition , they found 100 previously unrecorded plants . The observations from the expedition were later published in <unk> och <unk> Resa , written in Swedish . Like Flora Lapponica , it contained both zoological and botanical observations , as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland . 
 During the summer of 1745 , Linnaeus published two more books : Flora Suecica and Fauna Suecica . Flora Suecica was a strictly botanical book , while Fauna Suecica was zoological . Anders Celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742 . Celsius ' scale was inverted compared to today , the boiling point at 0 ° C and freezing point at 100 ° C. In 1745 , Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard . 
 = = = Västergötland = = = 
 In the summer of 1746 , Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition , this time to the Swedish province of Västergötland . He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August . On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf <unk> , a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey . Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book <unk> @-@ Resa , published the next year . After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania . This journey was postponed , as Linnaeus felt too busy . 
 In 1747 , Linnaeus was given the title <unk> , or chief physician , by the Swedish king Adolf Frederick — a mark of great respect . The same year he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin . 
 = = = Scania = = = 
 In the spring of 1749 , Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania , again commissioned by the Government . With him he brought his student , Olof Söderberg . On the way to Scania , he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year . The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects , but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees ; these trees were used by the military to make rifles . The journey was successful , and Linnaeus ' observations were published the next year in <unk> Resa . 
 = = = Rector of Uppsala University = = = 
 In 1750 , Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University , starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed . Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach ; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples . Linnaeus called the best of these students his " apostles " . His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden . He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody , not even him . Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer , where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala . 
 = = = Philosophia Botanica = = = 
 Linnaeus published Philosophia Botanica in 1751 . The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works . It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden .

 During Linnaeus ' time it was normal for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies . Linnaeus joined an ongoing campaign to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast @-@ feeding by mothers . In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg , a physician student , based on their experiences . In the tradition of the period , this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer ( <unk> ) expounded upon by the student . Linnaeus ' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. <unk> in 1770 as La <unk> <unk> , ou Dissertation sur les suites <unk> du <unk> <unk> . Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk . He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses . He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their <unk> . It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms . 
 = = = Species Plantarum = = = 
 Linnaeus published Species Plantarum , the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature , in 1753 . The first volume was issued on 24 May , the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year . The book contained 1 @,@ 200 pages and was published in two volumes ; it described over 7 @,@ 300 species . The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star , the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order . He was then seldom seen not wearing the order . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy , so he bought two farms in 1758 : Hammarby and <unk> . The next year , he bought a neighbouring farm , <unk> . He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby ; initially it only had a small one @-@ storey house , but in 1762 a new , larger main building was added . In Hammarby , Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala . He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766 , where he moved his library and collection of plants . A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move . 
 Since the initial release of Systema Naturae in 1735 , the book had been expanded and reprinted several times ; the tenth edition was released in 1758 . This edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature , the equivalent of Species Plantarum . 
 The Swedish king Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus nobility in 1757 , but he was not ennobled until 1761 . With his ennoblement , he took the name Carl von Linné ( Latinized as Carolus a Linné ) , ' Linné ' being a shortened and <unk> version of ' Linnæus ' , and the German nobiliary particle ' von ' signifying his ennoblement . The noble family 's coat of arms prominently features a twinflower , one of Linnaeus ' favourite plants ; it was given the scientific name Linnaea borealis in his honour by Gronovius . The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds : red , black and green for the three kingdoms of nature ( animal , mineral and vegetable ) in Linnaean classification ; in the centre is an egg " to denote Nature , which is continued and perpetuated in ovo . " At the bottom is a phrase in Latin , borrowed from the Aeneid , which reads " <unk> <unk> <unk> " : we extend our fame by our deeds . Linnaeus inscribed this personal motto in books that were gifted to him by friends . 
 After his ennoblement , Linnaeus continued teaching and writing . His reputation had spread over the world , and he corresponded with many different people . For example , Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country . He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli , " the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire " , who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija , Duchy of Carniola ( nowadays Slovenia ) . Scopoli communicated all of his research , findings , and descriptions ( for example of the olm and the dormouse , two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus ) . Linnaeus greatly respected him and showed great interest in his work . He named a <unk> genus , <unk> , the source of scopolamine , after him . Because of a great distance , they never met . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Linnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763 , but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after . He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772 , mostly due to his declining health . 
 Linnaeus ' last years were troubled by illness . He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764 , but survived thanks to the care of Rosén . He developed sciatica in 1773 , and the next year , he had a stroke which partially paralysed him . He suffered a second stroke in 1776 , losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory ; while still able to admire his own writings , he could not recognise himself as their author . 
 In December 1777 , he had another stroke which greatly weakened him , and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby . Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby , he was buried in Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January . 
 His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children . Joseph Banks , an English botanist , wanted to buy the collection , but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala . However , in 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection , having outlived both her husband and son . She tried to sell it to Banks , but he was no longer interested ; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection . The acquaintance was a 24 @-@ year @-@ old medical student , James Edward Smith , who bought the whole collection : 14 @,@ 000 plants , 3 @,@ 198 insects , 1 @,@ 564 shells , about 3 @,@ 000 letters and 1 @,@ 600 books . Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later . 
 The von Linné name ended with his son Carl , who never married . His other son , Johannes , had died aged 3 . There are over two hundred descendants of Linnaeus through two of his daughters . 
 = = Apostles = = 
 During Linnaeus ' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University , he taught many devoted students , 17 of whom he called " apostles " . They were the most promising , most committed students , and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world , often with his help . The amount of this help varied ; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition . To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys . Abroad , the apostles collected and organised new plants , animals and minerals according to Linnaeus ' system . Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished . Thanks to these students , the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland . The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus ' new system , it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens . Many of the apostles died during their expeditions . 
 = = = Early expeditions = = = 
 Christopher Tärnström , the first apostle and a 43 @-@ year @-@ old pastor with a wife and children , made his journey in 1746 . He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China . Tärnström never reached his destination , dying of a tropical fever on <unk> Sơn Island the same year . Tärnström 's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless , causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger , unmarried students after Tärnström . Six other apostles later died on their expeditions , including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr <unk> . 
 Two years after Tärnström 's expedition , Finnish @-@ born Pehr Kalm set out as the second apostle to North America . There he spent two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey and Canada . Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned , bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds . At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in Species Plantarum had been brought back by Kalm . 
 = = = Cook expeditions and Japan = = = 
 Daniel Solander was living in Linnaeus ' house during his time as a student in Uppsala . Linnaeus was very fond of him , promising Solander his oldest daughter 's hand in marriage . On Linnaeus ' recommendation , Solander travelled to England in 1760 , where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks . With Banks , Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768 – 71 . Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook ; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772 – 75 bound for , among other places , Oceania and South America . Sparrman made many other expeditions , one of them to South Africa . 
 Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg , who embarked on a nine @-@ year expedition in 1770 . He stayed in South Africa for three years , then travelled to Japan . All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of Dejima outside Nagasaki , so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora . He did , however , manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants , and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima . He returned to Sweden in 1779 , one year after Linnaeus ' death . 
 = = Major publications = = 
 = = = Systema Naturae = = = 
 The first edition of Systema Naturae was printed in the Netherlands in 1735 . It was a twelve @-@ page work . By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758 , it classified 4 @,@ 400 species of animals and 7 @,@ 700 species of plants . In it , the unwieldy names mostly used at the time , such as " <unk> annua <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> " , were supplemented with concise and now familiar " binomials " , composed of the generic name , followed by a specific epithet – in the case given , <unk> angulata . These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species . Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner . Although the system , now known as binomial nomenclature , was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers ( see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin ) almost 200 years earlier , Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work , including in monospecific genera , and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community . 
 After the decline in Linnaeus ' health in the early 1770s , publication of editions of Systema Naturae went in two different directions . Another Swedish scientist , Johan Andreas Murray issued the Regnum Vegetabile section separately in 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium , rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition . Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793 . It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus ' work became widely known in England , following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society as A System of Vegetables ( 1783 – 1785 ) . 
 = = = Species Plantarum = = = 
 Species Plantarum ( or , more fully , Species Plantarum , <unk> <unk> rite <unk> , ad genera <unk> , cum <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , secundum systema <unk> <unk> ) was first published in 1753 , as a two @-@ volume work . Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of plant nomenclature as it exists today . 
 = = = = Genera Plantarum = = = = 
 Genera plantarum : eorumque <unk> <unk> secundum <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , et <unk> omnium <unk> partium was first published in 1737 , delineating plant genera . Around 10 editions were published , not all of them by Linnaeus himself ; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition . In it Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 24 classes . One , <unk> , included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts ( algae , fungi , mosses and liverworts and ferns ) . 
 = = = = Philosophia Botanica = = = = 
 Philosophia Botanica ( 1751 ) was a summary of Linnaeus ' thinking on plant classification and nomenclature , and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in Fundamenta Botanica ( 1736 ) and Critica Botanica ( 1737 ) . Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his Classes Plantarum and Bibliotheca Botanica : all were printed in Holland ( as well as Genera Plantarum ( 1737 ) and Systema Naturae ( 1735 ) ) , the Philosophia being simultaneously released in Stockholm . 
 = = Linnaean collections = = 
 At the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden . Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala , which was supplied by material donated by Carl <unk> ( in 1744 – 1745 ) , crown @-@ prince Adolf Fredrik ( in 1745 ) , Erik <unk> ( in 1746 ) , Claes Grill ( in 1746 ) , Magnus <unk> ( in 1748 and 1750 ) and Jonas <unk> ( in 1749 ) . The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalized and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum . Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 ' the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all @-@ wise creator 's masterpieces , divided into three chambers ' . He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that ' world museum ' . 
 In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town , and shortly afterwards to a single @-@ room stone building close to his <unk> at Hammarby near Uppsala . This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections , the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university . Some material which needed special care ( alcohol specimens ) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum . 
 In Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects . Carl von Linné 's son ( Carl Linnaeus ) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783 . Shortly after Carl von Linné 's death his son confirmed that mice had caused " horrible damage " to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage . He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father 's later years , and also added further specimens . This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material . 
 In 1784 the botanist James Edward Smith purchased nearly all of the Linnean private scientific effects from the widow and daughter of Carl Linnaeus and transferred them to London . Not all material in Linné 's private collection was transported to England . Thirty @-@ three fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent and were later lost . 
 In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection , he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away . Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection , and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels , added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material . 
 Much material which had been intensively studied by Linné in his scientific career belonged to the collection of Queen Lovisa Ulrika ( 1720 – 1782 ) ( in the Linnean publications referred to as " Museum <unk> <unk> " or " M. L. U. " ) . This collection was donated by his grandson King Gustav IV Adolf ( 1778 – 1837 ) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804 . Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband King Adolf Fredrik ( 1710 – 1771 ) ( in the Linnean sources known as " Museum <unk> Friderici " or " Mus . Ad . Fr . " ) , the wet parts ( alcohol collection ) of which were later donated to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and is today housed in the Swedish Museum of Natural History at Stockholm . The dry material was transferred to Uppsala . 
 = = Linnaean taxonomy = = 
 The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus ' main contribution to taxonomy — his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature . During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge , Linnaeus also developed what became known as the Linnaean taxonomy ; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences . A previous zoologist Rumphius ( 1627 @-@ 1702 ) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus . 
 The Linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy , starting with three kingdoms . Kingdoms were divided into classes and they , in turn , into orders , and thence into genera ( singular : genus ) , which were divided into Species ( singular : species ) . Below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower ( unnamed ) rank ; these have since acquired standardised names such as variety in botany and subspecies in zoology . Modern taxonomy includes a rank of family between order and genus and a rank of phylum between kingdom and class that were not present in Linnaeus ' original system . 
 Linnaeus ' groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics , and not simply upon differences . Of his higher groupings , only those for animals are still in use , and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception , as have the principles behind them . Nevertheless , Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships . While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid " observable characteristics " have changed with expanding knowledge ( for example , DNA sequencing , unavailable in Linnaeus ' time , has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships ) , the fundamental principle remains sound . 
 = = Influences and economic beliefs = = 
 Linnaeus ' applied science was inspired not only by the instrumental utilitarianism general to the early Enlightenment , but also by his adherence to the older economic doctrine of <unk> . Additionally , Linnaeus was a state interventionist . He supported tariffs , levies , export bounties , quotas , embargoes , navigation acts , subsidised investment capital , ceilings on wages , cash grants , state @-@ licensed producer monopolies , and cartels . 
 = = Views on mankind = = 
 According to German biologist Ernst Haeckel , the question of man 's origin began with Linnaeus . He helped future research in the natural history of man by describing humans just as he described any other plant or animal . 
 = = = Anthropomorpha = = = 
 Linnaeus classified humans among the primates ( as they were later called ) beginning with the first edition of Systema Naturae . During his time at Hartekamp , he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man . He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy ; except for speech , he found no other differences . Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category , Anthropomorpha , meaning " <unk> . " This classification received criticism from other biologists such as Johan Gottschalk <unk> , Jacob Theodor Klein and Johann Georg Gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe a human as ' like a man ' . In a letter to Gmelin from 1747 , Linnaeus replied : 
 It does not please [ you ] that I 've placed Man among the Anthropomorpha , perhaps because of the term ' with human form ' , but man learns to know himself . Let 's not quibble over words . It will be the same to me whatever name we apply . But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [ follows ] from the principles of Natural History . I absolutely know of none . If only someone might tell me a single one ! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa , I would have brought together all the theologians against me . Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline . 
 The theological concerns were twofold : first , putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being , and second , because the Bible says man was created in the image of God ( <unk> ) , if monkeys / apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed , that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well . This was something many could not accept . The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater , and still ongoing , creation – evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859 . 
 After such criticism , Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly . The 10th edition of Systema Naturae introduced new terms , including Mammalia and Primates , the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens . The new classification received less criticism , but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place to rule over nature , not be a part of it . Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it . In his book <unk> Naturalis , he said , " One should not vent one 's wrath on animals , Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere ' <unk> <unk> , ' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility . " 
 = = = Strange people in distant lands = = = 
 Linnaeus added a second species to the genus Homo in Systema Naturae based on a figure and description by Jacobus Bontius from a 1658 publication : Homo troglodytes ( " caveman " ) and published a third in 1771 : Homo lar . Swedish historian Gunnar <unk> states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers , whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus . 
 In early editions of Systema Naturae , many well @-@ known legendary creatures were included such as the phoenix , dragon and manticore as well as <unk> like the satyrus , which Linnaeus collected into the catch @-@ all category <unk> . <unk> thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition . Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures , as he had with the hydra ; regarding the purported remains of dragons , Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays . For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one , but they did not find any signs of its existence . Homo lar has since been reclassified as <unk> lar , the lar gibbon . 
 = = = Four races = = = 
 In the first edition of Systema Naturae , Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties based on continent and skin colour : " <unk> albus " ( white European ) , " Americanus rubescens " ( red American ) , " Asiaticus fuscus " ( brown Asian ) and " Africanus Niger " ( black African ) . In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed stereotypical characteristics for each variety , based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity , and changed the description of Asians ' skin tone to " luridus " ( yellow ) . Additionally , Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon " <unk> " for " wild and monstrous humans , unknown groups , and more or less abnormal people " . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 Anniversaries of Linnaeus ' birth , especially in centennial years , have been marked by major celebrations . Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes . There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world . The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888 . Following approval by the Riksdag of Sweden , Växjö University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University . Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea , the crater Linné on the Earth 's moon , a street in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and the cobalt sulfide mineral <unk> . 
 = = Commentary on Linnaeus = = 
 Andrew Dickson White wrote in A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom ( 1896 ) : 
 Linnaeus ... was the most eminent naturalist of his time , a wide observer , a close thinker ; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology , and this permeated all his thinking . ... Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species ; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species , which he had insisted upon in his earlier works . ... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides . 
 The mathematical <unk> algorithm , applied to 24 multilingual Wikipedia editions in 2014 , published in PLOS ONE in 2015 , placed Carl Linnaeus at the top historical figure , above Jesus , Aristotle , Napoleon , and Adolf Hitler ( in that order ) .

 Ray Banks was born in Kirkcaldy , Scotland , and spent two years studying performance art and theatre at Warwick University . Banks said in an interview with the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that leaving Warwick University led him to become a published writer . Banks said , " If I 'd stayed on , I probably would have gone down the acting route instead of writing . University isn 't for everyone and I discovered that the other writers I know didn 't finish their courses either . It was certainly the best thing that happened to me . " 
 Banks ' first novel was released in 2004 , titled The Big Blind . The Big Blind was inspired by Banks ' prior employment as a croupier . His work Saturday 's Child was published in 2006 in the UK by Polygon , and in the US by Harcourt . Protagonist character , private investigator Callum Innes , first appeared in Saturday 's Child , and was the focus of Donkey Punch . Subsequent books include No More Heroes ( 2008 ) , Gun ( 2008 ) , Beast of Burden ( 2009 ) , California ( 2011 ) , and Dead Money ( 2011 ) . Banks has also contributed short stories for collected works and to a website called Noir Originals .

 = The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs = 
 The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs , Being the first part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle , under the command of Capt. Fitzroy , R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836 , was published in 1842 as Charles Darwin 's first monograph , and set out his theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls . He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America , before he had seen a coral island , and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean , completing his draft by November 1835 . At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed , and Captain Robert FitzRoy 's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage . FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean . The results supported Darwin 's theory that the various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth 's crust under the oceans . 
 The book was the first volume of three Darwin wrote about the geology he had investigated during the voyage , and was widely recognised as a major scientific work that presented his deductions from all the available observations on this large subject . In 1853 , Darwin was awarded the Royal Society 's Royal Medal for the monograph and for his work on barnacles . Darwin 's theory that coral reefs formed as the islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided has been supported by modern investigations , and is no longer disputed , while the cause of the subsidence and uplift of areas of crust has continued to be a subject of discussion . 
 = = Theory of coral atoll formation = = 
 When the Beagle set out in 1831 , the formation of coral atolls was a scientific puzzle . Advance notice of her sailing , given in the Athenaeum of 24 December , described investigation of this topic as " the most interesting part of the Beagle 's survey " with the prospect of " many points for investigation of a scientific nature beyond the mere occupation of the surveyor . In 1824 and 1825 , French naturalists Quoy and Gaimard had observed that the coral organisms lived at relatively shallow depths , but the islands appeared in deep oceans . In books that were taken on the Beagle as references , Henry De la Beche , Frederick William Beechey and Charles Lyell had published the opinion that the coral had grown on underwater mountains or volcanoes , with atolls taking the shape of underlying volcanic craters . The Admiralty instructions for the voyage stated : 
 The circularly @-@ formed Coral Islands in the Pacific occasionally afford excellent land @-@ locked harbours , with a sufficient entrance , and would be well adapted to any nice astronomical observations which might require to be carried on in undisturbed tranquillity . While these are quietly proceeding , and the chronometers rating , a very interesting inquiry might be instituted respecting the formation of these coral reefs .... A modern and very plausible theory has been put forward , that these wonderful formations , instead of ascending from the bottom of the sea , have been raised from the summits of extinct volcanoes ... 
 As a student at the University of Edinburgh in 1827 , Darwin learnt about marine invertebrates while assisting the investigations of the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant , and during his last year at the University of Cambridge in 1831 , he had studied geology under Adam Sedgwick . So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the Beagle expedition , as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy 's aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while the ship 's complement carried out its hydrographic survey . FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell 's Principles of Geology before they left . On their first stop ashore at St Jago island in January 1832 , Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell 's uniformitarian concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time , and thought that he could write his own book on geology . Lyell 's first volume included a brief outline of the idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters , and the second volume , which was sent to Darwin during the voyage , gave more detail . Darwin received it in November 1832 . While the Beagle surveyed the coasts of South America from February 1832 to September 1835 , Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising . After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship , he experienced an earthquake on 20 February 1835 . In the following months he speculated that as the land was uplifted , large areas of the ocean bed subsided . It struck him that this could explain the formation of atolls . 
 Darwin 's theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated , but can only live within a limited depth of water , starting just below low tide . Where the level of the underlying land stays the same , the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs , and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef . Where the land is rising , fringing reefs can grow around the coast , but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone . If the land subsides slowly , the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral , and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land . A barrier reef can encircle an island , and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level , forming a central lagoon . Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast , the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth . 
 = = Darwin 's investigations to test his theory = = 
 By the time that the Beagle set out for the Galápagos Islands on 7 September 1835 , Darwin had thought out the essentials of his theory of atoll formation . While he no longer favoured the concept that atolls formed on submerged volcanos , he noted some points on these islands which supported that idea : 16 volcanic craters resembled atolls in being raised slightly more on one side , and five hills appeared roughly equal in height . He then considered a topic which was compatible with either theory , the lack of coral reefs around the Galápagos Islands . One possibility was a lack of calcareous matter around the islands , but his main proposal , which FitzRoy had suggested to him , was that the seas were too cold . As they sailed on , Darwin took note of the records of sea temperature kept in the ship 's " Weather Journal " . 
 He had his first glimpse of coral atolls as they passed <unk> Island on 9 November and sailed on through the Low or Dangerous Archipelago ( Tuamotus ) . Arriving at Tahiti on 15 November , Darwin saw it " encircled by a Coral reef separated from the shore by channels & basins of still water " . He climbed the hills of Tahiti , and was strongly impressed by the sight across to the island of <unk> , where " The mountains abruptly rise out of a glassy lake , which is separated on all sides , by a narrow defined line of breakers , from the open sea . – Remove the central group of mountains , & there remains a Lagoon <unk> . " Rather than recording his findings about the coral reefs in his notes about the island , he wrote them up as the first full draft of his theory , an essay titled Coral Islands , dated 1835 . They left Tahiti on 3 December , and Darwin probably wrote his essay as they sailed towards New Zealand where they arrived on 21 December . He described the polyp species building the coral on the barrier wall , flourishing in the heavy surf of breaking waves particularly on the windward side , and speculated on reasons that corals in the calm lagoon did not grow so high . He concluded with a " remark that the general horizontal uplifting which I have proved has & is now raising upwards the greater part of S. America & as it would appear likewise of N. America , would of necessity be compensated by an equal subsidence in some other part of the world . " 
 = = = Keeling Islands = = = 
 FitzRoy 's instructions set detailed requirements for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed , particularly if they rose from the bottom of the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes , and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges . FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean , and on arrival there on 1 April 1836 , the entire crew set to work , first erecting FitzRoy 's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore . Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey , and despite being impeded by strong winds , they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon . FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock @-@ like outer wall of the atoll , with most life thriving where the surf was most violent . He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral , as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors , hooks , grappling irons , and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up . He had more success using a sounding line with a bell @-@ shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime ; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom ; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand . 
 These soundings were taken personally by FitzRoy , and the tallow from each sounding was cut off and taken on board to be examined by Darwin . The impressions taken on the steep outside slope of the reef were marked with the shapes of living corals , and otherwise were clean down to about 10 fathoms ( 18 m ) ; then at increasing depths , the tallow showed fewer such impressions and collected more grains of sand until it was evident that there were no living corals below about 20 – 30 fathoms ( 36 – 55 m ) . Darwin carefully noted the location of the different types of coral around the reef and in the lagoon . In his diary , he described , " examining the very interesting yet simple structure & origin of these islands . The water being unusually smooth , I waded in as far as the living mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks . In some of the gullies & hollows , there were beautiful green & other colored fishes , & the forms & tints of many of the <unk> were admirable . It is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of organic beings with which the sea of the tropics , so prodigal of life , teems " , though he cautioned against the " rather exuberant language " used by some naturalists . 
 As they left the islands after eleven days , Darwin wrote out a summary of his theory in his diary : 
 Throughout the whole group of Islands , every single atom , even from the most minute particle to large fragments of rocks , bear the stamp of once having been subjected to the power of organic arrangement . Capt. FitzRoy at the distance of but little more than a mile from the shore sounded with a line 7200 feet long , & found no bottom . Hence we must consider this <unk> as the summit of a lofty mountain ; to how great a depth or thickness the work of the Coral animal extends is quite uncertain .... Under this view , we must look at a Lagoon <unk> as a monument raised by myriads of tiny architects , to mark the spot where a former land lies buried in the depths of the ocean .

 When the Beagle returned on 2 October 1836 , Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles , as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil 's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin 's geological letters . Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October , enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism , and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was " very full of Darwin 's new theory of Coral Islands , and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting . I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever , though it cost me a pang at first , for it accounted for so much ... the whole theory is knocked on the head , and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes , nor even with a <unk> bottom .... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water . Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs . " Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837 . 
 Darwin 's first literary project was his Journal and Remarks on the natural history of the expedition , now known as The Voyage of the Beagle . In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory , emphasising how the presence or absence of coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding . At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species , and taking on other projects . He finished writing out his journal around the end of September , but then had the work of correcting proofs . 
 His tasks included finding experts to examine and report on his collections from the voyage . Darwin proposed to edit these reports , writing his own forewords and notes , and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book . When a Treasury grant of £ 1 @,@ 000 was allocated at the end of August 1837 , Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage . He selected Smith , Elder & Co. as the publisher , and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations . He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value , as the publisher would only require a small commission profit , and he himself would have no profit . From October he planned what became the multi @-@ volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle on his collections , and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands . 
 In January 1838 , Smith , Elder & Co. advertised the first part of Darwin 's geology book , Geological observations on volcanic islands and coral formations , as a single octavo volume to be published that year . By the end of the month Darwin thought that his geology was " covering so much paper , & will take so much time " that it could be split into separate volumes ( eventually Coral reefs was published first , followed by Volcanic islands in 1844 , and South America in 1846 ) . He also doubted that the treasury funds could cover all the geological writings . The first part of the zoology was published in February 1838 , but Darwin found it a struggle to get the experts to produce their reports on his collections , and overwork led to illness . After a break to visit Scotland , he wrote up a major paper on the geological " roads " of Glen Roy . On 5 October 1838 he noted in his diary , " Began Coral Paper : requires much reading " . 
 In November 1838 Darwin proposed to his cousin Emma , and they married in January 1839 . As well as his other projects he continued to work on his ideas of evolution as his " prime hobby " , but repeated delays were caused by his illness . He sporadically restarted work on Coral Reefs , and on 9 May 1842 wrote to Emma , telling her he was 
 gloomy & tired — the government money has gone much quicker than I thought & the <unk> of the coral @-@ volume are greater being , as far as we can judge from 130 £ to 140 £ . — How I am publish the remainder I know not , without taking 2 or 300 £ out of the funds — & what will you say to that . — I am <unk> & be blue deviled — I am daily growing very very old , very very cold & I <unk> very sly . I will give you statistics of time spent on my coral @-@ volume , not including all the work on board the Beagle — I commenced it 3 years & 7 months ago , & have done scarcely anything besides — I have actually spent 20 months out of this period on it ! & nearly all the remainder sickness & visiting ! ! !

 The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was published in May 1842 , priced at 15 shillings , and was well received . A second edition was published in 1874 , extensively revised and rewritten to take into account James Dwight Dana 's 1872 publication Corals and Coral Islands , and work by Joseph Jukes . 
 = = = Structure of book = = = 
 The book has a tightly logical structure , and presents a bold argument . Illustrations are used as an integral part of the argument , with numerous detailed charts and one large world map marked in colour showing all reefs known at that time . A brief introduction sets out the aims of the book . 
 The first three chapters describe the various types of coral reef , each chapter starting with a section giving a detailed description of the reef Darwin had most information about , which he presents as a typical example of the type . Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example . In the first chapter , Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands , taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands . The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others , and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs . Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail , his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much . An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island , and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon . 
 The fourth chapter on the distribution and growth of coral reefs examines the conditions in which they flourish , their rate of growth and the depths at which the reef building polyps can live , showing that they can only flourish at a very limited depth . In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters , overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level , by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides , and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated . This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level . 
 In the sixth chapter he examines the geographical distribution of types of reef and its geological implications , using the large coloured map of the world to show vast areas of atolls and barrier reefs where the ocean bed was subsiding with no active volcanos , and vast areas with fringing reefs and volcanic outbursts where the land was rising . This chapter ends with a recapitulation which summarises the findings of each chapter and concludes by describing the global image as " a magnificent and harmonious picture of the movements , which the crust of the earth has within a late period undergone " . A large appendix gives a detailed and exhaustive description of all the information he had been able to obtain on the reefs of the world . 
 This logical structure can be seen as a prototype for the organisation of On the Origin of Species , presenting the detail of various aspects of the problem , then setting out a theory explaining the phenomena , followed by a demonstration of the wider explanatory power of the theory . Unlike the Origin which was hurriedly put together as an abstract of his planned " big book " , Coral Reefs is fully supported by citations and material gathered together in the Appendix . Coral Reefs is arguably the first volume of Darwin 's huge treatise on his philosophy of nature , like his succeeding works showing how slow gradual change can account for the history of life . In presenting types of reef as an evolutionary series it demonstrated a rigorous methodology for historical sciences , interpreting patterns visible in the present as the results of history . In one passage he presents a particularly Malthusian view of a struggle for survival – " In an old @-@ standing reef , the corals , which are so different in kind on different parts of it , are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy , and hold their places , like other organic beings , by a struggle one with another , and with external nature ; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow , except under peculiarly favourable circumstances . "

 Having successfully completed and published the other books on the geology and zoology of the voyage , Darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles . Two volumes on Lepadidae ( goose barnacles ) were published in 1851 . While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles , Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the Royal Society had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science . Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote telling him that " <unk> proposed you for the Coral Islands & Lepadidae , Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone , & then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles that you would have [ smiled ] to hear . " 
 = = = Late 19th Century controversy and tests of the theory = = = 
 A major scientific controversy over the origin of coral reefs took place in the late 19th Century , between supporters of Darwin 's theory ( such as the American geologist James Dwight Dana , who early in his career had seen coral reefs in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838 @-@ 42 United States Exploring Expedition ) , and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer John Murray , who participated in the 1872 – 76 Challenger expedition . Murray 's theory challenged Darwin 's notion of subsidence , proposing instead that coral reefs formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals . Amongst Murray 's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist Alexander Agassiz , who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean , Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine coral reefs in search of evidence to support Murray 's theory , and to discredit Darwin . 
 A series of expeditions to test Darwin 's theory by drilling on Funafuti atoll in the Ellice Islands ( now part of Tuvalu ) was conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating whether basalt or traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral . Drilling occurred in 1896 , 1897 and 1898 , attaining a final depth of 1 @,@ 114 feet 6 inches ( 339 @.@ 70 m ) , still in coral . Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 expedition and leader of the 1897 expedition . At the time these results were regarded as inconclusive and it was not until the 1950s when , prior to carrying out nuclear bomb tests on Eniwetok , deep exploratory drilling through 4 @,@ 200 feet ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) of coral to the underlying basalt finally vindicated Darwin 's theory . 
 = = Darwin 's findings and modern views = = 
 Darwin 's interest on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence ; in particular , he was looking for confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths . FitzRoy 's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20 fathoms ( 37 m ) , and taking into account numerous observations by others , Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30 fathoms ( 55 m ) . Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100 m , still a small fraction of the depth of the ocean floor at 3000 – 5000 m . Darwin recognised the importance of red algae , and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs . He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths , but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s . Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef . He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae ; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level . He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity . These ecological ideas are still current , and research on the details continues . 
 In assessing the geology of the reef , Darwin showed his remarkable ability to collect facts and find patterns to reconstruct geological history on the basis of the very limited evidence available . He gave attention to the smallest detail . Having heard that parrotfish browsed on the living coral , he dissected specimens to find finely ground coral in their intestines . He concluded that such fish , and coral eating invertebrates such as <unk> , could account for the banks of fine grained mud he found at the Keeling Islands ; it showed also " that there are living checks to the growth of coral @-@ reefs , and that the almost universal law of ' consume and be consumed , ' holds good even with the <unk> forming those massive bulwarks , which are able to withstand the force of the open ocean . " 
 His observations on the part played by organisms in the formation of the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies . To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs , he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level , and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land . He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) , as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through <unk> ft ( 1 @,@ 405 m ) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations . In Darwin 's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents , and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation . It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements , but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) thick . While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding , his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level . 
 In Darwin 's global hypothesis , vast areas where the seabed was being elevated were marked by fringing reefs , sometimes around active volcanoes , and similarly huge areas where the ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes . These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s . His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics , which he did not anticipate .

 Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan ( Russian : <unk> ́ с Ива ́ нович <unk> ́ н ; Armenian : <unk> <unk> <unk> Anastas <unk> Mikoyan ; English pronunciation : / <unk> / ; 25 November [ O.S. 13 November ] 1895 – 21 October 1978 ) was an Old Bolshevik and Soviet statesman during the mandates of Lenin , Stalin , Khrushchev , and Brezhnev . He was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , as that power oscillated between the Central Committee and the Politburo , from the latter days of Lenin 's rule , throughout the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev , until his peaceful retirement after the first months of Brezhnev 's rule . 
 Mikoyan became an early convert to the Bolshevik cause . Mikoyan was a strong supporter of Stalin during the immediate post @-@ Lenin years . During Stalin 's rule , Mikoyan held several high governmental posts , including that of Minister of Foreign Trade . By the end of Stalin 's rule , Mikoyan began to lose favour with him . In 1949 , Mikoyan lost his long @-@ standing post of foreign trade minister . At the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously . When Stalin died in 1953 , Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy @-@ making . He backed Khrushchev and his de @-@ Stalinization policy , and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev . Mikoyan 's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time . 
 Mikoyan made several key trips to communist Cuba and to the United States , acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene , especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests . In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power . Mikoyan served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , the nominal Head of State , from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Mikoyan was born to Armenian parents in the village of Sanahin , then a part of the Yelizavetpol Governorate of the Russian Empire ( presently a part of <unk> in Armenia 's Lori Province ) in 1895 . His father , Hovhannes , worked as a carpenter and his mother was a rug weaver . He had one younger brother , Artem Mikoyan , who would go on to become the co @-@ founder of the MiG aviation design bureau which became one of the primary design bureaus of fast jets in Soviet military aviation . 
 Mikoyan received his education at the <unk> School in Tiflis and the <unk> Seminary in Echmiadzin . Religion , however , played an increasingly insignificant role in his life . He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism : " I had a very clear feeling that I didn 't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty ; the more I studied religious subjects , the less I believed in God . " Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled in the study of liberalism and socialism . 
 At the age of twenty , he formed a workers ' soviet in Echmiadzin . In 1915 Mikoyan formally joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( later known as the Bolshevik Party ) and became a leader of the revolutionary movement in the Caucasus . His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to Baku , where he became the co @-@ editor for the Armenian @-@ language newspaper <unk> @-@ <unk> and later for the Russian @-@ language paper Izvestia <unk> <unk> . During this time , he is said to have robbed a bank in Tiflis with TNT and had his nose broken in street fighting . 
 = = = Russian Revolution = = = 
 After the February 1917 revolution that toppled the Tsarist government , Mikoyan and other Bolsheviks fought against anti @-@ Bolshevik elements in the Caucasus . Mikoyan became a commissar in the newly formed Red Army and continued to fight in Baku against anti @-@ Bolshevik forces . He was wounded in the fighting and was noted for saving the life of fellow Party @-@ member Sergo Ordzhonikidze . Afterwards , he continued his Party work , becoming one of the co @-@ founders of the Baku Soviet , which lasted until 1918 , when he and twenty @-@ five other commissars fled Baku and were captured by the <unk> Government . Known as the Baku 26 , all the commissars were executed with the sole exception of Mikoyan ; the circumstances of his survival are shrouded in mystery . In February 1919 Mikoyan returned to Baku and resumed his activities there , helping to establish the Baku Bureau of the Caucasus Regional Committee ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Politburo member = = 
 Mikoyan supported Stalin , whom he had first met in 1919 , in the power struggle that followed Lenin 's death in 1924 ; he had become a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923 . As People 's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926 , he imported ideas from the West , such as the manufacture of canned goods . In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo , and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation . Mikoyan spent three months in the United States , where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy 's in New York . When he returned , Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union , including American hamburgers , ice cream , corn flakes , popcorn , tomato juice , grapefruit , and corn on the cob . 
 Mikoyan spearheaded a project to produce a home cookbook , which would encourage a return to the domestic kitchen . The result , The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food ( <unk> о <unk> и <unk> <unk> , <unk> o <unk> i <unk> <unk> ) , was published in 1939 , and the 1952 edition sold 2 @.@ 5 million copies . Mikoyan helped initiate the production of ice cream in the USSR and kept the quality of ice cream under his own personal control until he was dismissed . Stalin made a joke about this , stating , " You , Anastas , care more about ice cream , than about communism . " Mikoyan also contributed to the development of meat production in the USSR ( particularly , the so @-@ called Mikoyan cutlet ) , and one of the Soviet @-@ era sausage factories was named after him . 
 In the late 1930s Stalin embarked upon the Great Purge , a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated against members of the Communist Party , as well as the peasantry and unaffiliated persons . In assessing Mikoyan 's role in the purges , historian Simon Sebag @-@ Montefiore states that he " enjoyed the reputation of one of the more decent leaders : he certainly helped the victims later and worked hard to undo Stalin 's rule after the Leader 's death . " Mikoyan tried to save some close @-@ knit companions from being executed , though he was not without his faults . In 1936 he enthusiastically supported the execution of Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev , claiming it to be a " just verdict . " As with other leading officials in 1937 , Mikoyan signed death @-@ lists given to him by the NKVD . The purges were often accomplished by officials close to Stalin , giving them the assignment largely as a way to test their loyalty to the regime . 
 In September 1937 Stalin dispatched Mikoyan , along with Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria , with a list of 300 names to Yerevan , the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( ASSR ) , to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia ( CPA ) , which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks . Mikoyan tried , but failed , to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia . That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria . Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office . In several instances , he intervened on behalf of his colleagues ; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR . 
 = = World War II and de @-@ Stalinization = = 
 In September 1939 , Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union each carved out their own spheres of influence in Poland and Eastern Europe via the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact . The Soviets arrested 26 @,@ 000 Polish officers in the eastern portion of Poland and in March 1940 , after some deliberation , Stalin and five other members of the Politburo , Mikoyan included , signed an order for their execution as " nationalists and counterrevolutionaries " . When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Mikoyan was placed in charge of organizing the transportation of food and supplies . His son Vladimir , a pilot in the Red Air Force , died in combat when his plane was shot down over Stalingrad . Mikoyan 's main assignment throughout the war was supplying the Red Army with materials , food , and other necessities . Mikoyan became a Special Representative of the State Defense Committee in 1941 by Stalin 's orders ; he was until that point not a member because Beria believed he would be of better use in government administration . Mikoyan was decorated with a Hero of Socialist Labor in 1943 for his efforts . In 1946 he became the Vice @-@ Premier of the Council of Ministers . 
 Shortly before his death in 1953 , Stalin considered launching a new purge against Mikoyan , Vyacheslav Molotov , and several other Party leaders . Mikoyan and others gradually began to fall out of favor and , in one instance , were accused of plotting against Stalin . Stalin 's plans never came to fruition , however , as he died before he could put them into motion . Mikoyan originally argued in favor of keeping Stalin 's right @-@ hand man Beria from punishment but later gave in to popular support among Party members for his arrest . Mikoyan remained in the government after Stalin 's death , in the post of Minister of Trade , under Malenkov . He supported Khrushchev in the power struggle to succeed Stalin , and became First Deputy Premier in recognition of his services . 
 In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev organize the Secret Speech , which Khrushchev delivered to the 20th Party Congress , that denounced Stalin 's personality cult . It was he , and not Khrushchev , who made the first anti @-@ Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress . Along with Khrushchev , he helped roll back some of the stifling restrictions on nationalism and culture imposed during Stalin 's time . In 1954 , he visited his native Armenia and gave a speech in Yerevan , where he encouraged Armenians to republish the works of Raffi and the purged writer Yeghishe Charents . 
 In 1957 Mikoyan refused to back an attempt by Malenkov and Molotov to remove Khrushchev from power ; he thus secured his position as one of Khrushchev 's closest allies . He backed Khrushchev because of his strong support for de @-@ Stalinization and his belief that a triumph by the plotters might have given way to purges similar to the ones in the 1930s .

 In October 1956 Mikoyan was sent to the People 's Republic of Hungary to gather information on the developing crisis caused by the revolution against the communist government there . Together with Mikhail Suslov , Mikoyan traveled to Budapest in an armored personnel carrier , in view of the shooting in the streets . He sent a telegram to Moscow reporting his impressions of the situation . " We had the impression that Ernő Gerő especially , but the other comrades as well , are exaggerating the strength of the opponent and underestimating their own strength , " he and Suslov wrote . Mikoyan strongly opposed the decision by Khrushchev and the Politburo to use Soviet troops , believing it would destroy the Soviet Union 's international reputation , instead arguing for the application of " military intimidation " and economic pressure . The crushing of the revolution by Soviet forces nearly led to Mikoyan 's resignation . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 Khrushchev 's liberalization of hard @-@ line policies led to an improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States during the late 1950s . As Khrushchev 's primary emissary , Mikoyan visited the United States several times . Despite the volatility of the Cold War between the two superpowers , many Americans received Mikoyan amiably , including Minnesota Democrat Hubert Humphrey , who characterized him as someone who showed a " flexibility of attitude " and New York governor Averell Harriman , who described him as a " less rigid " Soviet politician . 
 During November 1958 Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent , demilitarized " free city " , giving the United States , Great Britain , and France a six @-@ month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin , or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans . Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev 's actions , claiming they violated " Party principle . " Khrushchev had proposed the ultimatum to the West before discussing it with the Central Committee . Ruud van <unk> , a historian , believed Mikoyan was angry because of Khrushchev didn 't consult him about the proposal . When asked by Khrushchev to ease tension with the United States , Mikoyan responded , " You started it , so you go ! " 
 However , Mikoyan eventually left for Washington , which was the first time a senior governing member of the USSR 's Council of Ministers visited the United States on a diplomatic mission to its leadership . Furthermore , Mikoyan approached the mission with an unprecedented informality , beginning with phrasing his visa request to US Embassy as " a fortnight 's holiday " to visit his friend , Mikhail Menshikov , the then Soviet Ambassador to the United States . While the White House was taken off guard by this seemingly impromptu diplomatic mission , Mikoyan was invited to speak to numerous elite American organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Detroit Club in which he professed his hopes for the USSR to have a more peaceful relationship with the US . In addition to such well received engagements , Mikoyan indulged in more informal opportunities to meet the public such as having breakfast at a Howard Johnson 's restaurant on the New Jersey Turnpike , visiting Macy 's Department Store in New York City and meeting celebrities in Hollywood like Jerry Lewis and Sophia Loren before having an audience with President Dwight Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles . Although Mikoyan failed to alter the US ' Berlin policy , he was hailed in the US for easing international tensions with an innovative emphasis on soft diplomacy that largely went over well with the American public . 
 Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev 's walkout from the 1960 Paris Summit over the U @-@ 2 Crisis of 1960 , which he believed kept tension in the Cold War high for another fifteen years . However , throughout this time , he remained Khrushchev 's closest ally in the upper echelons of the Soviet leadership . As Mikoyan later noted , Khrushchev " engaged [ in ] inexcusable hysterics " . 
 In November 1963 Mikoyan was asked by Khrushchev to represent the USSR at President John F. Kennedy 's funeral . At the funeral ceremony , Mikoyan appeared visibly shaken by the president 's death and was approached by Jacqueline Kennedy , who took his hand and conveyed to him the following message : " Please tell Mr. Chairman [ Khrushchev ] that I know he and my husband worked together for a peaceful world , and now he and you must carry on my husband 's work . " 
 = = = Cuba and the Missile Crisis = = = 
 The Soviet government welcomed the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista by Fidel Castro 's pro @-@ socialist rebels in 1959 . Khrushchev realized the potential of a Soviet ally in the Caribbean and dispatched Mikoyan as one of the top diplomats in Latin America . He was the first Soviet official ( discounting Soviet intelligence officers ) to visit Cuba after the revolution , and secured important trade agreements with the new government . He left Cuba with a very positive impression , saying that the atmosphere there made him feel " as though I had returned to my childhood . " 
 Khrushchev told Mikoyan of his idea of shipping Soviet missiles to Cuba . Mikoyan was opposed to the idea , and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles . In early November 1962 , at the height of Cuban Missile Crisis , the Soviet leadership dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the removal of the nuclear missiles and bombers the Soviet Union had placed on the island . Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro , Mikoyan was informed about the death of his wife , <unk> , in Moscow ; rather than return there for the funeral , Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead . 
 Castro was adamant that the missiles remain but Mikoyan , seeking to avoid a full @-@ fledged confrontation with the United States , attempted to convince him otherwise . He told Castro , " You know that not only in these letters but today also , we hold to the position that you will keep all the weapons and all the military specialists with the exception of the ' offensive ' weapons and associated service personnel , which were promised to be withdrawn in Khrushchev 's letter [ of October 27 ] . " Castro balked at the idea of further concessions , namely the removal of the Il @-@ 28 bombers and tactical nuclear weapons still left in Cuba . But after several tense and grueling weeks of negotiations , he finally relented and the missiles and the bombers were removed in December of that year . 
 = = Head of state and coup involvement = = 
 On 15 July 1964 , Mikoyan was appointed as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , replacing Leonid Brezhnev , who received a promotion within the Party . Mikoyan 's new position was largely ceremonial ; it was noted that his declining health and old age were being considered . 
 Some historians are convinced that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev had turned into a liability to the Party , and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power . However , William Taubman disputes this , as Mikoyan was the only member of the Presidium ( the name for the Politburo at this time ) to defend Khrushchev . Mikoyan , however , did vote to force Khrushchev 's retirement ( so as , in traditional Soviet style , to make the vote unanimous ) . Alone among Khrushchev 's colleagues , Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement , though he never spoke to him again . Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev 's funeral in 1971 . 
 Due to his partial defense of Khrushchev during his ouster , Mikoyan lost his high standing with the new Soviet leadership . The Politburo forced Mikoyan to retire from his seat in the Politburo due to old age . Mikoyan quickly also lost his post as head of state and was succeeded in this post by Nikolai Podgorny on 9 December 1965 . Brezhnev <unk> Mikoyan 's retirement by awarding him an Order of Lenin . 
 = = Death , personality , and legacy = = 
 As with Khrushchev and other companions , Mikoyan in his last days wrote frank but selective memoirs from his political career during Stalin 's rule . Mikoyan died on 21 October 1978 , at the age of 82 , from natural causes and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow . He received six commendations of the Order of Lenin . Mikoyan , in a description by Simon Sebag @-@ Montefiore , was " slim , circumspect , wily and industrious " . He has been described as an intelligent man , understanding English , having learned German on his own by translating the German version of Karl Marx 's Das Kapital to Russian . Unlike many others , Mikoyan was not afraid to come into a heated argument with Stalin . " One was never bored with Mikoyan " , <unk> <unk> notes , while Khrushchev called him a true cavalier . However , Khrushchev warned of trusting " that shrewd fox from the east . " In a close conversation with Vyacheslav Molotov and Nikolai Bukharin , Stalin referred to Mikoyan as a " duckling in politics " ; he noted , however , that if Mikoyan ever took a serious shot he would improve . Mikoyan had so many children , five boys and the two sons of the late Bolshevik leader Stepan Shahumyan , that he and his wife faced economic problems . His wife <unk> would borrow money from Politburo wives who had fewer children . If Mikoyan had discovered this he would , according to his children , have become furious . 
 Mikoyan was defiantly proud of his Armenian identity , pointing out : " I am not a Russian . Stalin is not a Russian . " He and Stalin were said to share a toast : " To hell with all these Russians ! " However , in post @-@ Soviet Armenia he is a divisive and controversial figure like some other Soviet @-@ era Armenian officials . His critics argue that he , as a loyal servant to Stalin , is responsible for the deaths of thousands during the 1930s purges when many Armenian intellectuals were assassinated . According to academician <unk> <unk> , he " symbolizes evil , mass murders , and an atmosphere of fear . " His supporters argue that he was a major figure on global political stage and usually point out to his role in the Cuban missile crisis . 
 Dubbed the Vicar of Bray of politics and known as the " Survivor " during his time , Mikoyan was one of the few Old Bolsheviks who was spared from Stalin 's purges and was able to retire comfortably from political life . This was highlighted in a number of popular sayings in Russian , including " From Ilyich [ Lenin ] to Ilyich [ Brezhnev ] ... without heart attack or stroke ! " ( Ot <unk> do <unk> bez <unk> i <unk> ) . One veteran Soviet official described his political career in the following manner : " The rascal was able to walk through Red Square on a rainy day without an umbrella [ and ] without getting wet . He could dodge the raindrops . "

 The Lion , the Fox & the Eagle : A Story of Generals and Justice in Rwanda and Yugoslavia is a non @-@ fiction book by Canadian journalist Carol Off . The hardcover edition was published in November 2000 by Random House Canada . The writing was favourably received and the book was short @-@ listed for the Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing . With numerous interviews and extensive research behind it , the book presents biographies of three Canadians in United Nations roles in the 1990s : Roméo Dallaire ( the " lion " ) , Lewis MacKenzie ( the " fox " ) , and Louise Arbour ( the " eagle " ) . 
 The book praises Dallaire 's commitment to his peacekeeping mission , but is critical of MacKenzie , who is depicted as being ignorant of the Bosnian political situation . In response to Off 's portrayal of him , MacKenzie considered sue for libel , but opted not to . The book praises Arbour 's efforts at building the legitimacy of International Criminal Tribunals and her efforts in indicting alleged war criminals from the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia . Through these biographies , the book addresses themes of morality and UN effectiveness . 
 = = Background = = 
 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Carol Off began research to write a biography of Louise Arbour . Following input from fellow journalist and author Stevie Cameron , she broadened the book 's scope to include profiles of Roméo Dallaire and Lewis MacKenzie . Along with her research assistant Sian <unk> , they compiled twenty binders of research and conducted over a hundred interviews , including with the three subjects . For the historical background on Rwanda , she consulted the works of Gérard Prunier , Philip <unk> , Alison Des Forges , and the Human Rights Watch . For background on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia , she consulted , amongst others , the works of Noel Malcolm , David <unk> , Roy Gutman . Living in Toronto with husband Linden MacIntyre , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old author wrote the book in the spring and summer of 2000 . 
 = = Content = = 
 Roméo Dallaire , from October 1993 to August 1994 , served as the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda . In January 1994 he passed along information to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers . After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant , or seize any weapons , Dallaire made a plea to the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance . Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence . The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere . Dallaire , believing the order unethical and unlawful , disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers , protected Tutsi hideouts . He received help from non @-@ governmental organizations , foreign journalists , and the Canadian government . With the media reporting on the massacre , the UN authorized 5 @,@ 500 troops to protect civilians . Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders . In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of posttraumatic stress disorder . Once back in Canada , he became appalled at how little the general public knew , and how much the world leaders knew , of what happened . In the aftermath , blame was assigned to various people , including Dallaire , but Off argues that blame lies with the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon . 
 Lewis MacKenzie , in 1992 , served in the Sarajevo division of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated to keep the peace in Croatia . Off describes MacKenzie as being indifferent as hostilities began in Sarajevo because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs . MacKenzie 's distrust of all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange , the Breadline Massacre , and broken ceasefire arrangements . MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the Sarajevo International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments . MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and the Bosnians as aggressors and recommending against intervention . 
 Louise Arbour began her job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996 . She was unexpectedly selected by her predecessor , Richard Goldstone , as he believed she processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN . At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , contrary to Goldstone 's tactic of publicizing indictments , which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire , Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests . In Rwanda she achieved several high @-@ profile prosecutions , including the first conviction for rape as a war crime . By time she left in Fall 1999 , her office had Slobodan Milošević , a head of state , indicted and arrested . 
 = = Style = = 
 The book is divided into four sections : one for each biography and one to provide background context for the conflicts in Rwanda and Bosnia . There are also sections entitled Introduction , Conclusion , Acknowledgments , Source Notes , and Index . The three biographies of the Canadians focus on their involvement in international conflicts through the United Nations , but also includes aspects of their backgrounds and follow events after they leave the UN . In the profiles Off avoids describing places and events but provides a chapter to " a Grapes of Wrath @-@ style description of her two locales " . The biographies compare and contrast the strategy and effect of each person 's approach to their mission . One reviewer compared the profiles of Dallaire and MacKenzie to Suetonius 's biographies of Athenian generals Nicias and Alcibiades . Suetonius portrayed Nicias as honourable , moderate , and effective but over @-@ shadowed by the more vocal and polarizing Alcibiades . Likewise , Off portrayed Dallaire as the more honourable commander but over @-@ shadowed by the more media savvy and callous MacKenzie . Off 's focus on moral choices was called " a feminist approach " by several members of the Department of National Defence . 
 In the Introduction , Off explains the animal metaphors . Roméo Dallaire is the ' lion ' because he acted courageously with an appearance of control and confidence . Lewis MacKenzie compared to a ' fox ' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport , and was trusted by outside observers , his actions in recommending against intervention were based on the cunning logic that all sides were , at least , partly responsible for the conflict . Louise Arbour is portrayed as the ' eagle ' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT @-@ like arrests . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Reviewers identified two themes : morality and the UN effectiveness . Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong . In Rwanda , Dallaire lobbied the UN to intervene to stop the genocide . In Yugoslavia , MacKenzie is accused of being an apologist for the Serbs . In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son 's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers . 
 She identifies the UN as the book 's villain and criticizes the UN 's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though one side is clearly dominant and brutally oppressive . It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed . The book treats this as a reality of international relations , which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights , and a factor in making the UN slow , ineffectual , and inappropriately bureaucratic . She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene . 
 = = Publication and Reception = = 
 Random House Canada published the hardcover in November 2000 . An excerpt was published in the weekly general interest magazine Saturday Night . It appeared on Maclean 's best @-@ seller list for 4 weeks , peaking at # 3 . A Random House imprint , Vintage Canada , published the trade paperback a year later . The Writers ' Trust of Canada short @-@ listed the book for its 2000 Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing . 
 Reviewers described Off 's writing as strong , clear , and sometimes elegant . Reviewing for the Quill & Quire , Derek Weiler wrote that the book 's strength is its " informative outlines of [ the ] conflicts , with gripping and readable summary enhanced by evocative scene @-@ setting . " Weiler and other reviewers found the chapters on Arbour , where the narrative <unk> , to be the weakest part of the book . 
 While Arbour was pleased with her profile , MacKenzie was not . Reviewers noted Off 's critical portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel . Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting his point of view concerning the mission and events . In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off 's book . While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict 's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict , MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision @-@ making , not his opinions , that led the UN to not intervene . 
 = Madman Muntz = 
 Earl William " Madman " Muntz ( January 3 , 1914 – June 21 , 1987 ) was an American businessman and engineer who sold and promoted cars and consumer electronics in the United States from the 1930s until his death in 1987 . He was a pioneer in television commercials with his oddball " Madman " persona – an alter ego who generated publicity with his unusual costumes , stunts , and outrageous claims . Muntz also pioneered car stereos by creating the Muntz Stereo @-@ Pak , better known as the 4 @-@ track cartridge , a predecessor to the 8 @-@ track cartridge developed by Lear Industries . 
 He invented the practice that came to be known as <unk> , which involved simplifying otherwise complicated electronic devices . Muntz produced and marketed the first black @-@ and @-@ white television receivers to sell for less than $ 100 , and created one of the earliest functional widescreen projection TVs . He was credited with coining the abbreviation " TV " for television , although the term had earlier been in use in call letters for stations such as WCBS @-@ TV . A high school dropout , Muntz made fortunes by selling automobiles , TV receivers , and car stereos and tapes . A 1968 Los Angeles Times article noted that in one year he sold $ 72 million worth of cars , that five years later he sold $ 55 million worth of TV receivers , and that in 1967 he sold $ 30 million worth of car stereos and tapes . 
 After his success as a used car salesman and with Kaiser @-@ Frazer dealerships in Los Angeles and New York City , Muntz founded the Muntz Car Company , which made the " Muntz Jet " , a sports car with jet @-@ like contours . The car was manufactured between 1951 and 1953 , although fewer than 400 were produced . 
 Muntz married seven times . His wives included actress Joan Barton ( who appeared in Angel and the Badman with John Wayne ) and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens Finishing Schools . Phyllis Diller was among his many girlfriends . He was friends with celebrities such as singer Rudy Vallee , comedian Jerry Colonna , actor Bert Lahr , television presenter Dick Clark , and cowboy actor Gene Autry . 
 = = Early career : 1922 – 1953 = = 
 Muntz was fascinated by electronics from an early age . He built his first radio at age 8 and built another for his parents ' car at age 14 . During the Great Depression , at age 15 , he dropped out of Elgin High School to work in his parents ' hardware store in Elgin , Illinois . 
 = = = Car sales = = = 
 In 1934 , Muntz opened his first used car lot , in Elgin , with a $ 500 ( $ 9 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) line of credit . He was only 20 years old , and his mother had to sign the car @-@ sale papers because legally he was too young to close his own deals . During a vacation in California , Muntz discovered that used cars sold there for far higher prices ; so he moved to California in 1940 at age 26 to open a used car lot in Glendale . On a hunch , he purchased 13 brand @-@ new right @-@ hand @-@ drive vehicles to resell . These vehicles had been built for customers in Asia , but could not be delivered due to World War II . One vehicle was a custom @-@ made Lincoln built for Chiang Kai @-@ shek . Local newspapers ran stories about the unusual cars , and Muntz sold them all within two weeks , still in their original shipping crates . Muntz soon opened a second lot in Los Angeles and closed his lot in Elgin . 
 Muntz rejected the then common opinion that used car salesmen should project a staid image . He realized the possibilities of generating publicity with odd stunts , and developed a " Madman " persona as a result . His flamboyant billboards and oddball television and radio commercials soon made him famous . In his used auto commercials , he marketed one model as the " daily special " ; Muntz claimed that if the car did not sell that day , he would smash it to pieces on camera with a sledgehammer . Another infamous Muntz used @-@ car TV pitch was " I buy ' em retail and sell ' em wholesale ... it 's more fun that way ! " His commercials generated so much publicity that comedians such as Bob Hope , Jack Benny , and Steve Allen often tried to outdo each other during television appearances by telling " Madman " Muntz jokes . University of Southern California fans would spell out Muntz 's name during halftime as a prank . 
 Muntz 's car lots became tourist attractions due to the widespread publicity from his television commercial appearances . A 1946 survey by <unk> Motor Tours revealed that they ranked seventh among tourist attractions in Southern California . Muntz was willing to take large risks in his attempts to generate publicity . During the era of McCarthyism , he asked one of his advisers , " Do you think I 'd make the front pages if I joined the Communist Party ? " 
 = = = Muntz Jet = = = 
 In 1948 , race car designer and Kurtis @-@ Kraft founder Frank Kurtis attempted to market a new sports car , the two @-@ seater Kurtis Kraft Sport . Only 36 units had been sold by 1950 . In 1951 , for just $ 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 @.@ 8 million in 2016 ) Kurtis sold the cars ' manufacturing license to Muntz , who quickly rebadged them as the " Muntz Jet " . Initial production of the Jet took place in Glendale , where Muntz extended the two @-@ seater Kurtis Kraft Sport 's body by 13 inches ( 33 cm ) , making it a four @-@ seater , and exchanged the Ford V8 engine for a larger Cadillac V8 . Later , after making just 28 Jets in California , Muntz moved production to a new factory in Evanston , Illinois , extended the body further by 3 inches ( 8 cm ) , and replaced the Cadillac V8 with a less expensive Lincoln <unk> V8 . 
 The Jet was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of Popular Science along with a Jaguar and an MG . It featured its own design , with aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top . Paint schemes were extravagant , with names like " Mars Red " , " Stratosphere Blue " , and " Lime Mist " , and interior options included alligator or Spanish leatherette . The backseat armrests contained a full cocktail bar . 
 The Jet was capable of a top speed of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km / h ) and acceleration of 0 – 50 mph ( 0 – 80 km / h ) in 6 seconds , a significant achievement for a road car at the time . The fastest production car in 1953 was the Pegaso Z @-@ 102 Supercharged sports car at 155 miles per hour ( 249 km / h ) . Jet owners included then @-@ CEO of CBS Frank Stanton , and actors Mickey Rooney and Lash La Rue . 
 The labor and materials required to produce the Jet resulted in a high price for the end product and , in 1954 , after selling about 400 cars and losing about $ 1 @,@ 000 ( $ 9 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) on each , Muntz closed the company . Today , Muntz Jets are prized collector cars and are recognized as predecessors to the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird .

 Muntz started plans to sell television receivers in 1946 , and sales began in 1947 . Muntz played the madman in his unorthodox television commercials , but in fact he was a shrewd businessman and a self @-@ taught electrical engineer . By trial and error , taking apart and studying Philco , RCA , and DuMont televisions , he figured out how to reduce the devices ' electrical components to their minimum functional number . This practice became known as " <unk> " . 
 In the 1940s and 1950s , most brands of television receivers were complicated pieces of equipment , commonly containing about 30 vacuum tubes , as well as <unk> , transformers , and other heavy components . As a result , they were usually very expensive : the cheapest <unk> receiver made before World War II used a 3 @-@ inch ( 8 cm ) screen and cost $ 125 ( $ 2 @,@ 126 in 2016 ) ; the cheapest model with a 12 @-@ inch ( 30 cm ) screen cost $ 445 ( $ 7 @,@ 570 in 2016 ) . By 1954 , although broadcast television in the United States had existed in various forms since 1928 , only 55 percent of U.S. households owned a receiver . By contrast , eight years later , 90 percent of U.S. households had one . 
 Muntz developed a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17 tubes . He often carried a pair of wire clippers , and when he thought that one of his employees was " <unk> " a circuit , he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working . At that point , he would tell the engineer " Well , I guess you have to put that last part back in " and walk away . 
 Marketed under the name " Muntz " by his company Muntz TV , Inc . , the simplified units were the first black and white TV receivers to retail in the U.S. for less than $ 100 . Muntz was also the first retailer to measure his screens from corner to corner rather than by width . The receivers sold well and were reliable partly because fewer tubes created less heat . The sets worked well in metropolitan areas that were close to television transmission towers where signals were strong . They worked poorly with weaker signals , as most of the components that Muntz had removed were intended to boost performance in fringe areas . This was a calculated decision : Muntz preferred to leave the low @-@ volume , high @-@ performance television receiver market to firms such as RCA and Zenith Electronics , as his intended customers were primarily urban dwellers with limited funds . Additionally , many urban apartment buildings had rules prohibiting external television aerials , and installation of an aerial , even if allowed , cost as much as $ 150 . Muntz solved this problem by adding a built @-@ in aerial to his receivers . In 1952 , Muntz TV Inc. grossed $ 49 @.@ 9 million ( $ 445 million in 2016 ) . 
 Muntz continued with his " Madman " persona in many of his advertisements . In one TV commercial that normally aired after The Ed Sullivan Show , Muntz , dressed in red long johns and a Napoleon hat , promoted his new 14 @-@ inch ( 36 cm ) televisions by saying , " I wanna give ' em away , but Mrs. Muntz won 't let me . She 's crazy ! " Another TV commercial presented a marching @-@ band song with lyrics about Muntz TVs and incorporated animations by Oskar Fischinger . His radio commercials , which Muntz ran up to 170 times a day , initially followed a classical music theme built around the spelling of Muntz 's name . However , he soon convinced radio stations to run ads more in line with his persona . In one spot , Muntz screamed " Stop staring at your radio ! " He followed up his radio ads with a direct mail campaign , collecting thousands of TV knobs and mailing them to prospective customers with a note saying , " Call us and we 'll show up with the rest of the set ! " 
 Some sources credit Muntz with inventing the abbreviation " TV " . Muntz used skywriting as one of his marketing tactics , but , after watching one of his ads being created , he noted that the letters began to blur and dissipate before the pilot could finish spelling out " Muntz Televisions " . So Muntz came up with the abbreviation " TV " . However , " TV " had earlier been used in the call letters of television stations , such as WCBS @-@ TV , which adopted those call letters in 1946 . Muntz also named his daughter " Tee Vee " , although she normally went by " Teena " and , later , " Tee " .

 Despite his early success , sales later declined and Muntz 's creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954 . Muntz admitted his business lost $ 1 @,@ 457 @,@ 000 from April to August 1953 , and although he tried to reorganize , Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and went out of business in 1959 . ( The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s , but without its namesake at the helm . ) However , Muntz 's success continued in the sales of cars and general consumer electronics . 
 = = = 4 @-@ track cartridge = = = 
 Attempting to combine his two main product lines , cars and stereos , Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo @-@ Pak 4 @-@ track tape cartridge . 4 @-@ track was the direct predecessor of the Stereo 8 cartridge , also known as the 8 @-@ track , later developed by American inventor Bill Lear . The Stereo @-@ Pak cartridge was based on the endless @-@ loop <unk> cartridge , which was being used by radio stations , designed by inventor George <unk> . Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability . Before Muntz developed the Stereo @-@ Pak , the only in @-@ car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph @-@ based players , such as the Highway Hi @-@ Fi invented by Peter Goldmark . These units played special 162 ⁄ 3 rpm records or 45 rpm records , however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road , and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely . 
 Muntz designed a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars and had it inexpensively manufactured in Japan . The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over , did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph @-@ based players did , and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver to concentrate on the road . The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences , because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements , unlike radio broadcasts . Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas . 
 Muntz audio products were so profitable by 1962 that he cancelled his agreements with tape @-@ duplicating companies and founded his own company to manufacture prerecorded Stereo @-@ Pak cartridges . Most record companies did not manufacture Stereo @-@ Pak cartridges themselves ; however , the Muntz Electronics Corporation licensed music from all the major record labels and issued hundreds of different tapes in the mid to late 1960s . Muntz exhibited his Autostereo players and Stereo @-@ Pak cartridges under the trade name Stereo @-@ Pak at the 1967 Consumer Electronics Show . 
 The Autostereo player , which retailed from $ 129 in 1963 ( $ 1 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) was a popular aftermarket addition to cars among the Beverly Hills rich and famous . Frank Sinatra used one in his Buick Riviera , Dean Martin in his Corvette , and Peter Lawford in his Ghia . James Garner , Red Skelton , and Lawrence Welk also used Autostereo players in their cars . Barry Goldwater purchased one for his son , and Jerry Lewis recorded his scripts onto Stereo @-@ Pak cartridges to learn his lines while driving . 
 Muntz attempted to establish a modern , trendy image for his players and cartridges . His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young , attractive model with a suggestive tagline . Most of his employees in his California shops were attractive young women dressed in <unk> clothing . 
 Bill Lear distributed the Stereo @-@ Pak in 1963 , intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft . However , he soon decided to re @-@ engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes , the result of which became the Stereo 8 system . The market for Muntz 's 4 @-@ track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8 , which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less @-@ complex cartridge mechanism . Although the 4 @-@ track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double the speed of the Stereo 8 system ( and the 4 @-@ track had wider heads for better bandwidth ) , the Stereo 8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s . Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo 8 players in their 1965 automobiles , and it became a standard option by 1966 . 
 In a 1979 interview in The <unk> newsletter , Muntz revealed the biggest problem for the Stereo @-@ Pak business was returned merchandise . He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles , the Stereo @-@ Pak plant had to make hundreds of thousands of cartridges . But once a popular album became less popular , retailers would return the unsold cartridges , expecting credit towards new titles . Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo @-@ Pak business unprofitable . 
 = = = Home video = = = 
 In late 1970 , Muntz closed his Stereo @-@ Pak audio business after a fire severely damaged his main offices . He then entered the growing home @-@ video market . During the mid @-@ 1970s , Muntz thought of taking a 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) Sony color cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television receiver , fitting it with a special lens and reflecting mirror , then projecting the magnified image onto a larger screen . He housed these primitive units in a large wooden console , making it one of the first successful widescreen projection TV receivers marketed for home use . 
 The receivers were built in Muntz 's headquarters in Van Nuys , California . Sony 's U.S. sales division was unaware that Muntz was dealing directly with Sony 's Tokyo original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) department , which shipped him the TV chassis directly . Thanks to Muntz 's talent for mass @-@ market advertising and self @-@ promotion , by 1977 the projection receivers were a multimillion @-@ dollar business . Muntz was quick to feature Sony 's Betamax as well as JVC 's and RCA 's VHS recorders in his store , setting up a showroom to demonstrate the potential for a " theater experience in the home " . 
 In 1979 , Muntz decided to sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract customers to his showroom , where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems . His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette ( CVC ) , a 1 / 4 in ( 0 @.@ 6 cm ) system designed to compete with Betamax , VHS , and the Super 8 film home @-@ movie system . The CVC format failed in the marketplace , sales quickly eroded , and Muntz 's store closed soon after . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Shortly before dying of lung cancer in 1987 , Muntz centered his retail business on cellular phones , satellite dishes , a motorhome rental company dubbed " Muntz Motor Mansions " , and prefabricated aluminum houses . He made headlines in February 1985 as the first retailer to offer a Hitachi cellular phone for less than $ 1 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @,@ 200 in 2016 ) , when just two years earlier most cellular phones had cost about $ 3 @,@ 000 ( $ 7 @,@ 100 in 2016 ) . At the time of his death , he was the leading retailer of cellular phones in Los Angeles . During his final years , Muntz drove a customized Lincoln Continental with a television installed in the dashboard : Muntz claimed it helped him " drive better " . 
 After he died , his children , James and Tee , continued to operate two Muntz stores in Van Nuys and Newhall ; the remainder of the stores were franchised businesses . James employed his father 's advertising techniques to create splashy ads featuring prices that annoyed his competitors so much that they referred to them as " cutthroat " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The " Madman " method pioneered by Muntz was later copied by other retailers , including California car salesman Cal Worthington and New York area electronics chain Crazy Eddie . In Crazy Eddie TV commercials , radio personality Jerry Carroll leapt at the camera and jumped around while jabbering at high speed , always ending with the line , " Crazy Eddie : Our prices are <unk> ! " As a result of his Crazy Eddie commercials , Carroll became a significant 80s icon , even appearing in the film Splash . 
 Muntz 's cultural impact was such that he was mentioned in novels , including children 's book The <unk> : How Neddie Took The Train , Went To Hollywood , And Saved Civilization by Daniel Manus <unk> , The Lost Get @-@ Back Boogie by James Lee Burke , and Franklin Mason 's Four Roses in Three Acts . 
 A production called Madman Muntz : American Maverick was screened at film festivals through 2007 . Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver <unk> , it was produced by Jim <unk> , an owner of an original Muntz Jet . The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival . The film documents Muntz 's life , paying particular attention to his colorful career , and includes interviews with people who knew him and home movie footage contributed by his children . 
 The <unk> 1997 documentary More Things That Aren 't Here Anymore has a segment on Muntz and is broadcast by the station regularly during pledge periods . 
 In 2001 , Madman Muntz was posthumously inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame . 
 = Les Clisby = 
 Leslie Redford ( Les ) Clisby , DFC ( 29 June 1914 – 15 May 1940 ) was an Australian fighter ace of World War II . Serving with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , he was credited with sixteen aerial victories before being killed in action during the Battle of France . In a combat career lasting a matter of months , he was Australia 's first ace of the war . Born in South Australia , Clisby joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a mechanic in 1935 , but was later accepted for flying training . He graduated as a pilot in 1937 , and chose to take a commission with the RAF . After arriving in Britain , he was assigned to No. 1 Squadron , flying the recently introduced Hawker Hurricane . Posted to France following the outbreak of World War II , he achieved his first aerial victory on 1 April 1940 . Clisby became known as a highly aggressive fighter pilot , who threw himself into combat irrespective of the odds . In a five @-@ day period , commencing on 10 May 1940 , he was credited with destroying at least eight German aircraft . Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for these and earlier victories , he was himself shot down in flames on 15 May . He was buried in France . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Born in McLaren Vale , South Australia , on 29 June 1914 , Clisby was the second of four children to carpenter Albert Clisby and his wife Mabel , née Chapman . While attending Nailsworth Junior Technical School , Les also studied engineering in evening classes at the South Australian School of Mines and Industries in Adelaide . He joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as a mechanic in 1935 , but was later accepted into the flying training course at Point Cook , Victoria . 
 On 24 April 1936 , Clisby was flying in formation when he encountered problems and bailed out ; a subsequent inquiry found that the plane 's loss was due to his lack of experience . He nevertheless graduated in 1937 and , under a pre @-@ war arrangement between the British and Australian governments , volunteered for transfer to the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) ; he sailed for Europe that July . On 26 August , he was granted a five @-@ year short @-@ service commission as a pilot officer , and assigned to No. 1 Squadron at RAF Tangmere in Sussex . The unit operated the new Hawker Hurricane , a monoplane with a top speed of over 300 miles per hour ( 480 km / h ) and four machine guns in each wing . In amongst training and an active social life , Clisby wrote to his family of a young lady back home in Adelaide becoming his fiancée . 
 = = World War II = = 
 By the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 , Clisby was a flying officer . Five days later , No. 1 Squadron deployed to Le Havre in northern France with the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force that accompanied the British Expeditionary Force . Through the autumn and winter of 1939 – 40 , amidst the so @-@ called Phoney War , a succession of small and indecisive clashes took place between the Allied air forces and the Luftwaffe . Clisby achieved his first aerial victory on 1 April 1940 , a Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin @-@ engined fighter over Moselle . The following day in the same vicinity , he claimed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 . As the Battle of France opened on 10 May , Clisby began to score heavily , estimates for his remarkable run of " kills " in the next five days ranging from eight to thirteen or more . 
 Clisby destroyed two Dornier Do 17 bombers on 10 May , after which his aircraft was struck by friendly fire from a French anti @-@ aircraft battery . He became an ace the following day , when he shot down three German fighters before the rudder of his Hurricane was damaged by enemy gunfire . Breaking off combat , he found a Heinkel He 111 bomber drifting in front of him and instinctively took a shot at it , forcing it to land in a paddock . Clisby himself landed nearby and , when they tried to escape , chased the German crewmen across the field , firing his revolver . Capturing one in a rugby tackle , he forced the others to surrender at gunpoint . He then proceeded to march them over to French authorities before rejoining his squadron , whose diarist recorded : " He wanted their autographs ! " According to Time magazine , reporting on the exploit some weeks later , " Clisby 's commanding officer remarked it was a bit uncommon for pilots to bring back prisoners " . 
 By now Clisby had become known for his extreme aggression in the air , rushing headlong into combat irrespective of the odds and often alone . On 12 May , he was credited with the destruction of six aircraft , claiming three Bf 109s and three Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance planes ( also identified as <unk> ) during action in support of Fairey Battles in their historic raid on the Albert Canal bridges near Maastricht , on the Dutch @-@ Belgian border . For his achievements that day , as well as his earlier successes , Clisby was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) . The citation would be promulgated in the London Gazette on 14 June : 
 Flying Officer Leslie Redford <unk> ( <unk> ) ( now reported missing ) . 
 One day in April , 1940 , this officer was the pilot of one of three Hurricanes which attacked nine Messerschmitt 109 's , one of which he shot down . The following day he destroyed another Messerschmitt 109 . In May , 1940 , this officer was engaged in six combats against the enemy in which he shot down eight enemy aircraft . Flying Officer Clisby has displayed great courage on all occasions . 
 Described as being " extrovert , profane , perpetually cheerful and addicted to flying " , Clisby also had " premature lines " on his face . At twenty @-@ five , and with only a few months of air @-@ to @-@ air combat experience , he was considered a seasoned campaigner and had become No. 1 Squadron 's top @-@ scoring ace . He was also the first Australian @-@ born ace of the war , and was well known for giving vent to patriotic feelings for his homeland in another way . All RAAF personnel who served with the RAF were permitted to continue wearing their original dark @-@ blue Australian uniform until it wore out , after which they were to exchange it for the lighter @-@ coloured British variety . Clisby flatly refused to give up his RAAF uniform , regardless of how shabby it became . When teased about its condition , he would simply respond , " It will see me through " . 
 Clisby was still wearing his RAAF uniform on 15 May when he went into action with his flight against more than thirty Bf 110s over Reims . Having destroyed two of the German heavy fighters , Clisby 's Hurricane was seen going down with its cockpit trailing smoke and flames , evidently hit by cannon fire . He was initially posted as " missing " , along with one of his comrades , Flying Officer Lorimer , whose plane was also seen losing height in the same action . The French later found two burnt @-@ out Hurricanes in the vicinity , which were identified as Clisby 's and Lorimer 's . Clisby died without knowing that he had been awarded the DFC . A fellow pilot later said , " He was an Australian and had thrown himself into the fray with a reckless abandon that was magnificent in its way " . 
 Estimates of Clisby 's total number of victories in his short career range from nine to twenty or more , but the most common — and official — score attributed to him is sixteen . The loss of much of the RAF 's documentation in the chaotic retreat through France and across the English Channel in May 1940 meant that many squadron records and combat claims had to be reconstructed from the memory of surviving personnel . Even the date of Clisby 's death is unclear , some sources ( including the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ) claiming 14 May rather than the following day . Regardless of the exact date , he was the first RAF ace of the war to be lost in action . Clisby was buried in the military cemetery at <unk> in north @-@ eastern France . His name appears on Supplementary Panel 12 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial , Canberra . 
 = Say Somethin ' ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " Say Somethin ' " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . It was written by Carey , Snoop Dogg , Chad Hugo , and Pharrell Williams , and produced by The Neptunes as the seventh overall single from Carey 's tenth studio album , The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . The song is one of few from Carey 's catalog in which she does not share production credits . " Say Somethin ' " features Dogg as a guest artist , and is influenced by R & B and hip @-@ hop music genres . Lyrically , the song is a dialogue in between and male and female , that discuss sexual themes and acts of which they plan to engage in a restroom . 
 The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics , many of which both praised and dismissed its production and vocals . Some reviewers felt Carey 's performance was too typical for a singer of her stature , while others felt the song 's complex instrumentation distracted from the artists . As the fifth international single from the album , the song performed weakly on the singles charts on which it appeared , peaking at number seventy @-@ nine on the Billboard Hot 100 . Internationally , " Say Somethin ' " failed to achieve strong chart success , peaking outside the top @-@ twenty in Australia and top @-@ forty in Europe . 
 " Say Somethin ' " was accompanied by a high profile and budget music video , filmed by Paul Hunter in Paris , France , and featuring appearances by Carey , Williams , Dogg and fashion designer and Vogue editor , André Leon Talley . The video features Carey and Williams as love interests being chased by several paparazzi vehicles down a populated Paris road . Other scenes feature Carey trying on several outfits in Louis Vuitton 's flagship store on Champs @-@ Élysées , as well as close @-@ up shots of Snoop Dogg . The video concluded with the duo walking together down the Le Pont de Paris bridge , over @-@ looking the Seine river .

 Following record @-@ breaking success throughout the 1990s , Carey departed from Columbia Records after the release of Rainbow ( 1999 ) . Almost a year later , she signed an unprecedented $ 100 million five @-@ album record contract with Virgin Records , and began work on a film and soundtrack project titled Glitter . Prior to its release on September 11 , 2001 , Carey suffered an " emotional and physical breakdown " , and was subsequently hospitalized over a period of several weeks . Glitter became a box @-@ office bomb , earning less than eight million dollars , and receiving scathing reviews . The soundtrack , while faring slightly better , failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of Carey 's previous releases , and eventually lead to the annulment of her record contract with Virgin . 
 Following the events , as well as the release of Carey 's succeeding album , Charmbracelet ( 2002 ) , she began working on new material for The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . Towards the end of 2004 , Carey was already conceptualizing and writing music for her upcoming album . During a studio rendezvous with Pharrell Williams , Carey was once again introduced to Snoop Dogg , having worked with him on a single from her seventh studio album Rainbow ( 1999 ) titled , " Crybaby " . Following a brief meeting with the pair , Carey showed them the yet unfinished version of " Say Somethin ' " , and had Dogg complete a rap verse for the song . 
 = = Recording = = 
 " Say Somethin ' " had been the second time the pair had collaborated , the first had been on " Crybaby " from Carey ninth studio album Rainbow in 1999 . Following the song 's completion in November 2004 , Snoop Dogg made several comments regarding his work with Carey in an interview with MTV News , even re @-@ calling past sentiments towards her many years prior : 
 She 's so soft . She 's beautiful too . I always tell her this story : When I was locked up in jail , that song ' Vision of Love ' was the hottest song in the world . I used to always say , ' Man , if I could meet her ! ' So I worked with her , then Pharrell hooked it up for me to work with her again this time . 
 After Carey finished writing and producing the track alongside Williams , Dogg added his rap verse , and added some ulterior beats and components . Before taking the still @-@ uncompleted song to the studio , Dogg described the song and beat " The beat was just sick and it was bangin ' . I was like , ' All right , give me that , M.C. ' I took [ the song ] down to my studio and flipped my style to it . " After slightly altering the song , as well as adding his verses , Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song , " When I played [ the finished version ] for her , she was like , ' Oh , I love it ! ' I said , ' OK , give me a hug , baby . ' She was just as soft as a cotton swab ! Lord have mercy ! Jesus , M.C. ! What I wouldn 't ... Let me stop . "

 As January 2005 drew near , Carey had already completed many tracks for her yet @-@ untitled studio album . However , after releasing the album 's title , The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) , " Say Somethin ' " leaked , and was to be promoted as the project 's lead single . While the song was universally chosen as Carey 's next single , former Island Records head L.A. Reid suggested Carey travel to Atlanta for a period of three days to work with Jermaine Dupri . In an interview with MTV , Carey recalled the decision with Reid : " L.A. was like , ' You and Jermaine Dupri make magic together , why aren 't you in the studio with him ? I said , ' I love Jermaine , is he free ? I know he 's doing a million things , Usher and this and that . ' But Jermaine said , ' Come on down . ' " During the following interval of three days , the pair helmed the album 's eventual third and fourth singles , " Shake It Off " and " Get Your Number " . During her trip to Atlanta , Carey began second guessing the album 's direction , and described her feelings regarding the decision in an interview with MTV News : 
 I really started second @-@ guessing myself . And then I realized , like , all right , I have to go with my gut . Because everybody 's got an opinion , and so many people 's opinions about me are like polar opposites . They 're like , ' We love it when she does ballads , make her do the ballads . ' Then they 're like , ' We want to hear a hip @-@ hop record . ' ' Why is she dressing like this ? She should show less skin . ' ' She should show more . ' You know what I mean ? I 'm like , ' Stay in your lane , and I 'll figure it <unk> 
 After returning to home to re @-@ arrange the album with Reid , Carey once again traveled to Atlanta in an attempt to create a few more strong singles for the album 's roster . On her second stay in Dupri 's hometown , the duo completed " We Belong Together " and " It 's Like That " , with the latter of the two replacing " Say Somethin ' " as the albums 's lead single . " Say Somethin " was then chosen to become the third single from the album , however , those plans were scrapped as well . Following the extended chart success of The Emancipation of Mimi , " Fly Like a Bird " was released as the sixth single from the project and " Say Somethin " was released as seventh and final single from the album . " Fly Like a Bird " was released on April 3 , 2006 to urban radio and gospel stations , while " Say Somethin ' " was serviced to mainstream Top 40 radio . Tom Ferguson from Billboard did not agree with releasing both singles concurrently , as he had given " Say Somethin ' " a negative review . According to Ferguson , while the latter had radio appeal , its " scantily produced drum 'n'bass " only distracted , concluding " ' Fly Like A Bird ' is a classic : why muddy the water with this release . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Say Somethin ' " is a mid @-@ tempo song lasting three minutes and forty @-@ four seconds , while drawing influence from R & B and hip @-@ hop music genres . It incorporates its beat from several musical instruments , including the organ , bass drum and several electronic and computerized sound effects . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing , the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute . Written by Carey , Snoop Dogg , Chad Hugo , and Pharrell Williams , and produced by The Neptunes , the song is composed in the key of E minor , with Carey 's vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of F ♯ 3 to the high @-@ note of B5 . The song 's chorus has a chord progression of Emaj7 to <unk> , while altering to a B minor during the bridge . Dimitri Ehrlich from Vibe called the song " a musical oddity " and described its production as " strange instrumentation , weird melodic shifts , and hectic drum patters " . 
 In his review for The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) , Jozen Cummings from PopMatters described the song 's production and instrumentation : " The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects , and Carey adds to the breezy , easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy , but subtle , like a shy woman who doesn ’ t need to say anything at all to get a man ’ s attention . " Lyrically , " Say Somethin ' " recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female , while she agrees and responds " If its worth you 're while / Say somethin ' good to me " . In an interview with Newsweek , Carey described how she felt regarding the song : " You 're right . It is a totally different approach for me musically . When I heard it at first I thought it was a cool and interesting track , but I didn 't know if it was very me . " Additionally , Carey outed the lines " Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets " as " <unk> " , but claimed she " loved it " .

 " Say Somethin ' " garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics , many of which praised Carey for broadening her musical palette with the release , however criticizing its production and hook . Michael Paoletta from Billboard described the song 's production as a " series of gimmicks " , and felt it was reminiscent of melodies used to boost the careers of " lesser artists " . Concluding the review on a mixed note , Paoletta wrote " the melody line is palpable and Carey 's voice is appreciable , but " Say Somethin ' " is mostly a reminder of a time when Carey required others to boost her chart heft . " USA Today critic Elysa Gardner called the song " breezy and playful " , while Jim Abbott from the Orlando Sentinel classified it as a " high point " on The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . 
 Writer Barry Walters from Rolling Stone felt the song failed to produce a significant and memorable hook , though noting its dance appeal : " it has a beat that makes you move , but the songs ' pop hook doesn 't stick . " While New York Times columnist Jon Pareles called the song an " earthy delight " , Glenn Gamboa from Newsday felt Carey 's vocals could have easily been replaced by a less skilled singer , and wrote " she sounds like a hook girl in her own song . Her vocals could have been delivered by Kelis or Amerie and no one would have been the wiser . "

 " Say Somethin ' " was released to rhythmic and Top 40 radio stations in the United States on April 3 , 2006 , during the same period that " Fly like a Bird " was released to Urban radio stations .

 The label initially wanted " Say Somethin " to become the fourth single from the album after " Shake It Off " . The videos for " Shake It Off " and " Say Somethin " were originally supposed to be directed by Brett Ratner . However , Carey later chose director Jake Nava instead . Jake Nava was set to film " Shake It Off " and " Say Somethin " back @-@ to @-@ back in June 2005 , however , as filming of the " Shake It Off video ended , the video shoot for " Say Somethin " was suddenly cancelled due to the label deciding not to release it as the fourth single . 
 The high profile music video for " Say Somethin ' " was directed by Paul Hunter , who had previously worked with Carey on videos for both " Honey " and " Don 't Forget About Us " , and was predominately shot in Paris , France in March 2006 . Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams are both featured in the video , with the latter playing Carey love interest . Additionally , a cameo appearance is made by André Leon Talley , a retired fashion designer and Vogue editor . In an interview with MTV News , Carey described the trip to France , as well as the video 's behind @-@ the @-@ scenes moments : 
 You know what was so great about being in Paris ? Usually I 'm inside a hotel room and I don 't get to see anything . This time , I finally got to drive around the city , walk around the city and hang out . I love Paris ; I love the electricity this city has . And it gave me a new perspective on this song , which is one of the first songs I recorded for [ The Emancipation of Mimi ] . It 's got a hot vibe to it , when you 're driving around in the car on a normal , rainy day in Paris , driving around in circles in a Maserati — who doesn 't do that every day ? 
 Aside from the several actors playing paparazzi throughout the video , Hunter included several shots of actual French paparazzi on scooters , who attempted to photograph Carey during the video 's filming . Hunter claimed the additions made the video feel more realistic . For the video 's primary filming locations , Carey had Louis Vuitton 's flagship store on Champs @-@ Élysées , one of the most prestigious avenues in Paris , shut down . When describing the experience filming in the boutique , Carey explained : " Obviously , being able to take your pick of anything in the store and have the whole store shut down for you is every girl 's dream . You know , just a pretty standard day in the life of anybody . No , just joking . There was a time in my life I only had one pair of shoes , so that 's my justification for having that little perk on the job . " After filming concluded in France , Snoop Dogg 's scenes were filmed on a Sunday in Los Angeles . When asked why Dogg was not present during the Paris shoot , Carey jokingly stated : 
 If you guys think I 'm a diva and I have requirements , Snoop is the next level . He 's the hip @-@ hop king ! So his requirements to get to Paris are , like , beyond platinum editions ; they 're , like , beyond ultra @-@ platinum editions ; they 're like diamond editions . So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here , but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we 'll have more time , more control . He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway .

 = History of surface weather analysis = 
 The history of surface weather analysis concerns the timetable of developments related to surface weather analysis . Initially a tool of study for the behavior of storms , surface weather analyses became a work in progress to explain current weather and as an aid for short term weather forecasting . Initial efforts to create surface weather analyses began in the mid @-@ 19th century by using surface weather observations to analyze isobars , isotherms , and display temperature and cloud cover . By the mid @-@ 20th century , much more information was being placed upon the station models plotted on weather maps and surface fronts , per the Norwegian cyclone model , were being analyzed worldwide . Eventually , observation plotting went from a manual exercise to an automated task for computers and plotters . Surface analysis remains a manual and partially subjective exercise , whether it be via hand and paper , or via a workstation . 
 = = Mid @-@ Nineteenth century = = 
 The use of weather charts in a modern sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century . Weather map pioneers include William Charles Redfield , William Reid , Elias Loomis , and Sir Francis Galton , who created the first weather maps in order to devise a theory on storm systems . The invention of the telegraph in 1837 made it possible to gather weather information from multiple distant locations quickly enough to preserve its value for real @-@ time applications . The Smithsonian Institution developed its network of observers over much of the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm . Beginning in 1849 , the Smithsonian started producing surface analyses on a daily basis using the 150 stations in their network . The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress , and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards . Three times daily , all stations would telegraph in their observations to the central office which would then plot the information on a map upon which isobars , or lines of equal pressure , would be drawn which would identify centers of high and low pressure , as well as squall lines . At first , all the data on the map was not taken at exactly the same time in the early days of these analyses because of a lack of time standardization . The first attempts at time standardization took hold in the Great Britain by 1855 . However , in the United States , standard time did not come to pass until 1883 , when time zones started to come into use across America for railroad use . The entire United States did not finally come under the influence of time zones until 1905 , when Detroit finally established standard time . 
 = = Late Nineteenth century = = 
 The earliest surface analyses from the United States featured a map of the continental U.S. with indications of cloud cover and wind direction arranged on an early form of what has become a station model . A general indication of the weather for various cities around the country was also included on the bottom of the map . Within a short time , the Signal Corps added a tables showing eight @-@ hour pressure change , 24 @-@ hour temperature change , relative humidity , and 24 @-@ hour precipitation . The Signal Office also added a general discussion of synoptic weather features and forecast , before adding isobars and isotherms onto the maps . By the end of 1872 , the maps had established the format it would use until the introduction of frontal analysis . By the 20th century , most of the weather @-@ related functions under the U. S. Signal Corps branched off into a new civilian agency known as the U. S. Weather Bureau , the forerunner of today 's National Weather Service . 
 Internationally , other countries followed the lead of the United States , in regards to taking simultaneous weather observations , starting in 1873 . Other countries then began preparing surface analyses . In Australia , the first weather map showed up in print media in 1877 . Japan 's Tokyo Meteorological Observatory , the forerunner of the Japan Meteorological Agency , began constructing surface weather maps in 1883 . 
 The London Times published the first weather map on April 1 , 1875 . In the United States , the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania demonstrated that daily weather map transmission via telegraph could be accomplished . The New York Daily Graphic published weather maps from mid @-@ 1879 through the summer of 1882 . By 1894 , there were four daily newspapers publishing weather maps in Boston , New Orleans , Cincinnati , and San Francisco . 
 = = Twentieth century = = 
 The use of frontal zones on weather maps did not appear until the introduction of the Norwegian cyclone model in the late 1910s , despite Loomis ' earlier attempt at a similar notion in 1841 . Since the leading edge of air mass changes bore resemblance to the military fronts of World War I , the term " front " came into use to represent these lines . An increasing amount of newspapers published weather maps early in the century across the United States , before the fad passed in 1912 . While the number of newspapers carrying weather maps decreased beyond 1912 , many continued publishing them until interest in flight increased interest in the maps once more in the 1930s . Beginning in 1930 , <unk> broadcasts of weather information and forecasts were broadcast for use by ships at sea , emanating from the United States military and the United States Weather Bureau on a cooperative basis . Starting in 1935 , Weather Bureau / National Weather Service weather maps were published in newspapers via the Associated Press in a slightly processed format as <unk> weather maps . 
 Despite the introduction of the Norwegian cyclone model just after World War I , the United States did not formally analyze fronts on surface analyses until August 1 , 1941 , just before the WBAN Analysis Center opened in downtown Washington , D.C .. The effort to automate map plotting began in the United States in 1969 , with the process complete in the 1970s . Hong Kong completed their process of automated surface plotting by 1987 . By 1999 , computer systems and software had finally become sophisticated enough to allow for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery , radar imagery , and model @-@ derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis . In the United States , this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n @-@ AWIPS workstations . 
 = = Twenty @-@ First century = = 
 By 2001 , the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis , which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers . Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm . Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail . For instance , icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network . This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years .

 Dishonored is a 2012 stealth action @-@ adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks . It was released worldwide in October 2012 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . Set in the fictional , plague @-@ ridden industrial city of Dunwall , Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano , bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles . He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin , seeking revenge on those who conspired against him . Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists — a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall , and the Outsider — a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities . Several noted actors including Susan Sarandon , Brad Dourif , Carrie Fisher , Michael Madsen , Lena Headey , and Chloë Grace Moretz provided voice work for the game . 
 The game is played from a first @-@ person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways , with an emphasis on player choice . Missions can be completed through stealth , combat , or a combination of both . Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals , and it is possible to complete all missions , eliminating all of Corvo 's targets , in a non @-@ lethal manner . The story and missions are changed in response to the player 's violent actions or lack thereof . Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects . 
 During its three years in production , several versions of Dishonored were developed . Before the creation of Dunwall — inspired by late nineteenth @-@ century London and Edinburgh — the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth @-@ century London . During development , test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes ; instead of restricting these techniques , the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them . Dishonored 's music score was produced by composer Daniel Licht to represent London in the nineteenth century . 
 Dishonored received positive reviews , focusing on the missions ' individual narratives and the freedom available in completing them . Criticism fell on the overarching narrative , which was considered predictable , and problems in controlling the player 's character . Following its release , the game won several awards , including the 2012 Spike Video Game award for Best Action @-@ Adventure Game and the 2013 BAFTA award for Best Game , and was repeatedly recognized as the best action @-@ adventure game of 2012 and one of that year 's best games . Following its release , Dishonored was supplemented with additional content focusing on the assassin Daud and his quest for redemption . PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released in August 2015 . A sequel , Dishonored 2 , was announced in June 2015 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Dishonored is an action @-@ adventure game played from a first @-@ person perspective with an emphasis on stealth action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces . The game world is a series of self @-@ contained , mission @-@ focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in @-@ game movement and powers . Between missions , the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies , receive mission briefings and alternate objectives , and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades . In @-@ game areas include loading docks , royal estates , poverty @-@ stricken streets , and a bathhouse . The player can save their progress anywhere , and the game includes a checkpoint save system . Saving is disabled during combat . The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of health and mana ( magic ) potions , and enemies ' awareness , damage delivered , and responsiveness . In the easy setting , health regeneration is possible . 
 Dishonored features role @-@ playing game elements , such as the ability to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non @-@ linear consequences . The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non @-@ player characters ( NPC ) , including boss characters and mission targets . An example of a non @-@ lethal situation given by co @-@ creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character , and in return that character had two of Corvo 's targets kidnapped and enslaved . Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets . Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character 's abilities , rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style , such as hacking or sneaking . Specific elements of missions , such as changes to the color of a target 's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized , requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played . 
 The player 's actions are not judged to be good or evil , but instead are tracked by a " chaos " system that records the amounts of friendly fire , violence , and deaths the player causes . This modifies the game world , affecting the story without punishing the player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another . For example , an NPC who disapproves of violence may refuse to support the player , or may even betray them . The game reacts to the chaos caused in scripted ways , such as changing dialogue , and dynamic ways , such as increasing the presence of rats and plagued citizens and adding new scenes . This can affect the active mission and future missions . The system also influences which of the game 's two endings is reached , with variations based on which characters live or die . Using violence allows missions to be completed in less time than using a stealth approach , but violence consumes more in @-@ game resources such as health and mana potions , which are required more often in direct combat . 
 = = = Abilities and powers = = = 
 Dishonored features six active powers , four passive powers or enhancements , and forty bone charms which grant the player supernatural perks , such as the ability to increase the duration of rat possession . Initially , only three bone charms can be active at any time ; up to six can be active through optional upgrades . Smith and designer Raphaël Colantonio stated that it is impossible for a player to accrue all of the powers and abilities in a single playthrough . The player requires mana to use these abilities ; mana partially regenerates after use to allow " Blink " and " Dark Vision " powers to be used , but mana potions are required to regenerate more mana , restricting the use of higher cost abilities like " Possession " and " Bend Time " . Magic and ranged weapons are assigned to the player character 's left hand control and a sword is assigned to the right hand control . 
 The main supernatural powers are unlocked and purchased using runes — artifacts carved from whale bone — and each can be upgraded . Powers include " Dark Vision " , which allows the player to see enemies through walls , their field of view and highlights interactive objects ; " Blink " , a short @-@ distance teleportation ability ; " Possession " , that allows the player to temporarily inhabit and possess other characters ; " <unk> Swarm " , which summons a swarm of deadly rats ; " Bend Time " , that slows or freezes time ; " Wind Blast " , a gust of wind that can knock down enemies ; and " Shadow Kill " that turns dead enemies to ash , preventing their discovery by opposing forces . The player can use weapons including a sword , grenades , a crossbow , and pistols . Coins must be collected to upgrade weapons and gadgets . 
 Stealth is based on limiting the player character 's visibility ; hiding behind objects and buildings , avoiding the enemies ' cone of vision , and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection . When hiding behind an object , the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop , and as long as Corvo remains hidden , his enemies will not see him . The player can also look through <unk> to gain insight into closed rooms . Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them , and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden . 
 Guards have several states of alertness , ranging from normal to suspicious ; they can become aware of the player 's presence or can actively search for them . Enemy artificial intelligence ( AI ) will respond to sound and can be distracted using sound to lure guards away from their positions . If the player remains concealed from guards , their alertness will drop to " aware " , but it will not return to normal in that mission . Enemies communicate their states of alertness to their allies , increasing the alertness level throughout the mission .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Dishonored takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall , where technology and otherworldly forces coexist . The city 's design is modeled on London and Edinburgh between the late 1800s and the early 1900s . The capital of the Empire of the Isles , Dunwall is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter . The city is a center for fishing and whaling ; whale oil is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city . After a philosopher discovered that whale oil — known in the city as trans — can be used as a fuel , the government used it to develop powerful weaponry , which in turn bred government corruption . The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats , which is killing the poor and isolating the rich . The infected , known as " <unk> " , cry blood and can become violent . The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish . Order is maintained by the Tallboys , heavily armored officers on tall , mechanical legs , and districts are separated by barriers known as " Walls of Light " , which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized people who try to cross them . A covert group of activists , the Loyalists , plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress ' daughter as the new Empress . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The main character of Dishonored , whom the player controls , is Corvo Attano , the former bodyguard to Dunwall 's Empress Jessamine <unk> ( April Stewart ) . Corvo becomes an infamous assassin after he is framed for the empress ' murder . He is skilled in stealth and combat , is armed with unusual gadgets , and possesses great supernatural powers . The game designers chose Corvo to remain silent so that players could project themselves onto the character . Corvo is aided by the Loyalists , led by Admiral Havelock ( John Slattery ) , and members : Piero Joplin ( Brad Dourif ) — an inventor who builds Corvo 's mask and supplies him with gadgets ; <unk> Pendleton ( Derek Phillips ) — a member of parliament ; Samuel ( Ryan <unk> ) — a commoner who ferries Corvo to and from his missions ; Overseer Teague Martin ( Joel Johnstone ) ; and Callista Curnow ( Lena Headey ) — the caretaker for the Empress ' daughter Young Lady Emily ( Chloë Grace Moretz ) . Other characters include Granny Rags ( Susan Sarandon ) — a former aristocrat now blind and deranged after years of living on the streets ; Daud ( Michael Madsen ) — leader of a group of assassins known as " the Whalers " ; and Slackjaw ( Al Rodrigo ) — a gang leader . Carrie Fisher and Gregg Berger provide the voices of the loudspeakers found throughout the city relaying government propaganda . 
 The Outsider ( Billy Lush ) offers to help Corvo in his quest . Described as a mixture of God and the Devil , The Outsider imprints his mark on Corvo , imbuing him with magical abilities , and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart ( April Stewart ) that tells Corvo secrets . The Outsider also grants his mark , and special abilities , to other characters . Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities , but leaves the choice of how to use them up to the recipient . 
 Corvo 's targets include the Lord Regent Hiram Burrows ( Kristoffer Tabori ) — the Empress ' former spymaster who masterminded her death and framed Corvo , and now controls Dunwall ; Burrows ' lover Lady Boyle ( Anna Graves ) — an aristocrat funding the military ; Lords Custis and Morgan known as the Pendleton Twins ( Zach Hanks ) — members of parliament ; High Overseer Campbell ( Daniel Hagen ) — leader of the city 's religious order ; and Anton Sokolov ( Roger Jackson ) — a genius inventor responsible for the creation of many advanced technologies including the Wall of Light . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 After returning from a foreign voyage to seek aid with the deadly plague ravaging the city , Corvo Attano travels to the tower of Dunwall and meets with the Empress . After delivering a message , they are attacked by teleporting assassins led by Daud ; they magically restrain Corvo , kill the Empress and kidnap her daughter Emily . The Empress ' Spymaster arrives and has Corvo imprisoned for her murder and Emily 's abduction . Six months later , the Spymaster has seized control of Dunwall as Lord Regent . <unk> Corvo , the Lord Regent confesses that he masterminded the assassination and framed Corvo . The following day , Corvo is due to be executed . In his cell , a letter from Empire Loyalists is smuggled to Corvo , and he is given the means to escape . After escaping , Samuel ferries Corvo to the Hound Pits pub to meet the Loyalists , led by Admiral Havelock . 
 While resting at the pub , Corvo is taken to a dream world where he meets the Outsider , who brands Corvo with his mark . Corvo is sent by the Loyalists to eliminate the conspirators behind the Lord Regent 's plot , and the player is given the option to kill or otherwise neutralize Corvo 's targets , the first of which is High Overseer Campbell . During the mission , Corvo meets Granny Rags and Slackjaw . Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers Emily in a brothel called the Golden Cat under the supervision of twins Custis and Morgan Pendleton . Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers . After returning to the pub , Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress , while Corvo is sent to abduct the genius scientist Sokolov , who is responsible for the Lord Regent 's powerful technologies . Sokolov is taken to the pub for interrogation , under which he divulges the identity of the Lord Regent 's financier , Lady Boyle . Corvo infiltrates Boyle 's masquerade ball , deduces which of the three sisters is the Lord Regent 's mistress , and disposes of her . 
 After returning to the pub , Havelock confirms they have done enough damage to move on the Lord Regent . Corvo infiltrates the tower of Dunwall and removes the Lord Regent from power and , in the process , learns that the Lord Regent intentionally imported the plague to decimate the lower classes of society , though things quickly got out of hand . Corvo returns to the Hound Pits pub where the Loyalists celebrate their success . After sharing a drink , Corvo goes to his room and collapses . Upon waking he learns that his drink was poisoned by Samuel at the behest of Havelock and his Loyalist allies <unk> Pendleton and Teague Martin to prevent him interfering in their plan to install Emily as Empress and rule through her . Samuel remains loyal to Corvo and had given him a non @-@ lethal dose of poison . Samuel sets Corvo adrift on the river and flees . When Corvo wakes , he is a prisoner of the assassin Daud and his men , who killed the Empress and intend to claim the bounty placed on Corvo 's head by the now Lord Regent Havelock . 
 Corvo defeats Daud and his assassins before traveling through Daud 's territory and into the sewers where he finds Granny Rags attempting to cook Slackjaw . Corvo can eliminate either Slackjaw or Granny Rags , who is revealed to be a witch called Vera Moray . Corvo returns to the pub to find it overrun with guards and that Havelock has killed many of the Loyalists . He discovers where Havelock has taken Emily , and can save Piero , Sokolov and Calista . Corvo signals to Samuel , who ferries him to the former Lord Regent 's lighthouse . He infiltrates the lighthouse and either subdues Pendleton and Martin or finds that Havelock , to ensure the Loyalists ' actions are never known , has already killed them . Once finished with Havelock , Corvo may or may not rescue Emily . Havelock 's journal reveals that the Lord Regent suspects that Emily is Corvo 's daughter . 
 The ending varies depending upon the level of chaos the player has caused throughout the game . If Corvo saves Emily , she ascends the throne as Empress with Corvo at her side . If only a small amount of chaos has been caused , a golden age dawns and the plague is finally overcome . After many decades , Corvo dies of natural causes and Empress Emily <unk> I the Wise buries him beside Empress Jessamine . If much chaos is caused , the city remains in turmoil and is overrun with the plague . If Corvo fails to save Emily , Dunwall crumbles and Corvo flees the city by ship .

 Bethesda Softworks first announced Dishonored as a first @-@ person , stealth , action @-@ adventure game for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 platforms on 7 July 2011 . Dishonored is the first Arkane Studios game Bethesda published after Bethesda parent ZeniMax Media bought Arkane in August 2010 . Arkane Studios founder Raphaël Colantonio and Deus Ex developer Harvey Smith were the game 's creative directors , and Deus Ex designer Ricardo Bare was its Lead Designer . Visual design director Viktor Antonov , who designed Half @-@ Life 2 's City 17 , and art director Sebastien Mitton led the art team . Smith , Colantonio , Antonov , and Mitton spent three years in pre @-@ production . Bethesda approached Arkane and asked them to develop a new game and a new intellectual property . The team already had ideas for developing a similar game , but until Bethesda approached them , Arkane had no specific ideas . Mitton contacted Antonov in May 2009 to ask for his help to establish an artistic identity for a new intellectual property . The full Arkane team — including their offices in Lyon , France , and Austin , Texas — worked on the game . 
 The game supports a different interface for Microsoft Windows users to that for the console versions , and also supports the use of Xbox 360 controllers on Windows PCs . Smith described the team 's philosophy of allowing its developers who are passionate about a particular release platform to develop software for it ; those passionate about PC will work on developing that interface , while Xbox 360 aficionados were allowed to develop the Achievements for that platform . Dishonored was officially released to manufacturing on 28 September 2012 . 
 = = = Gameplay = = = 
 The development team researched unexpected ways the player could combine Corvo 's special powers , such as combining a high jump with the ability to teleport in order to travel greater distances than either ability allowed independently . Instead of restricting these exploits , the team tried to design levels to accommodate them . The designers did not consider all of the powers they conceived during development , such as a power to become a shadow that could move along walls , to be suitable for the game . Some existing powers went through several revisions : a version of " Bend Time " caused the player to unfreeze enemies when touched ; " Possession " allowed the player to control a victim remotely without inhabiting their body , but this offered less challenge . Balancing the effectiveness of the player 's powers was considered difficult . Colantonio said , " we wanted to give [ the player ] very strong powers , to make [ the player ] really a badass , but at the same time we didn 't want the game to be too easy . " Each power has a duration , mana cost , and other variable properties that allowed the team to effectively scale even the most destructive of abilities by making them costly to use frequently or limiting the time they remain active . 
 Dishonored 's stealth system was originally based on that of the Thief series , which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character 's presence . However , it was decided that it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them . It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers ' work and contrasted poorly with well @-@ lit areas . Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time . Conversely , main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking . 
 To design the missions , the designers began with a cohesive area , which they filled with activities for the player . They defined paths to the target areas , and developed and expanded them . They then populated the areas with NPCs , which they assigned to patrol routes and functions . The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level , using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers , and then redesigned the level as needed . At first , the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player 's ability to traverse them as they choose , but in testing , players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area , leaving them unable to proceed . In response , the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players . Some features and ideas were removed during the design process , including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound @-@ sensitive patients . Discussing the use of violence and the consequences of in @-@ game freedom , developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball ; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions , but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level , which Houston found disconcerting . The team came under pressure to excise a scene from the end of the game where Samuel , in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game , can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence . Smith explained " Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you ’ re great , no matter what you do . If you slaughter everybody – you killed the maids , you killed the old people , you killed the beggars – you ’ re great , here ’ s a medal , you ’ re a hero ... We decided that sounds psychotic . It doesn ’ t match our values ... What we wanted was to let you express yourself in the game , but to have the world react to that , at least in some way . [ Samuel ] , betraying you and firing off that flare , was something we had to fight for . " 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Dishonored was originally set in medieval Japan , but the idea was dropped early in the game 's development because of the difficulties presented in marketing the setting , and because no member of the design team knew much about the culture . Arkane moved the setting to London in 1666 , considering that the city was recognizable to Europeans and Americans . Later designs inspired by added gameplay mechanics such as floodlights , electrified barriers and 20th @-@ century technologies that it no longer resembled London , and Arkane opted to develop a fictional city . The city of Dunwall , designed to be a " contemporary and cool " " period piece " , was inspired by late @-@ 19th and early @-@ 20th @-@ century London and Edinburgh . Describing why London had been an initial setting and remained a significant inspiration , Smith said : 
 Because it was the last year of the plague , and the year of the great fire of London , which of course ended the plague by burning the slums down ... In this kind of game you ’ re always looking for a way to up the tension and frankly make the world a little more perilous , and justify why there aren ’ t giant crowds of people at the market . Then people had the idea for swarms of rats , and we were talking independently about possession , and we wondered if you should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you don ’ t have to hide them . All these pieces just worked together . 
 Antonov described his inspiration from London as " a big metropolis , it 's messy , it 's chaotic and intense ... and it 's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans " . He highlighted the importance of that familiarity to different cultures because " you want to communicate to a lot of people when you make a new piece of fiction " . He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs , which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass , rivets , and steam of steampunk design . Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research , taking photographs of people , places , and objects . The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game 's world . Mitton stated : " We were trying to design the game from a rat 's viewpoint ... if we have a small city , from a constrained viewpoint , what are all the different angles that we can explore ? " . Inspiration also came from the artwork of John Atkinson Grimshaw , Canaletto , and Gustave Doré . The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place . 
 In @-@ game characters were inspired by illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as Captain Blood ( 1922 ) , the work of Charles Dana Gibson , and <unk> from Edwardian London and Australia . An anatomy expert helped ensure the morphology of character faces represented Great Britain , while Arkane maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness . Mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich , poor , and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs , and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions . The city guards , for example , have small heads , low shoulders , and big hands , with animations that blend human and monkey movements . Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in @-@ game art . 
 The designers conceived the Tallboys as town <unk> . <unk> were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts ; the town crier role was replaced with loudspeakers throughout Dunwall . The Tallboy design evolved into a <unk> that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks , but after further development , the designers considered that their tall , mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague @-@ infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection , leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow . Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys ' backs for aesthetic reasons , but Smith suggested whale oil , which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city . For other technologies , designers conceptualized using 18th @-@ century technology to build modern items and vehicles , and creating 18th @-@ century items using modern tools . 
 The Heart is a human heart modified with technology and the supernatural , that helps the player to find collectible items in the levels , and " plays a part related to informing [ the player 's ] decisions about when to apply violence or not , making it a really interesting , more subtle part of the power fantasy . " The Heart provides contextual verbal feedback to the player , offering insight into a particular location , the secrets or history of a character , and its own origins . The Heart was originally designed as a method of identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics . The design then developed into the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda . As a result of player @-@ conducted testing of the game , the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required . The Heart 's gameplay role continued to change , and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters , which helped to reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city 's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialogue . Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides , but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play . 
 The Hound Pits pub , which acts as a base for the player , was initially a larger structure . Filling out the interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms , and the large amount of climbing made navigation confusing . The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging . The pub 's exterior was shrunk to resemble an Edwardian building , but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo 's bedroom , allowing him to reach the roof quickly . In frustration , the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely . The art team continued to receive requests throughout development , requiring them to extend pre @-@ production until the end of the development cycle . Each design was hand drawn . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Daniel Licht composed the game 's score — an ambient , violin @-@ heavy presentation designed to represent 19th @-@ century London . Licht 's score is designed to make the player feel unsettled , and not provide comfort . He described the music as an " evil fog " that fades in and out of the game without being initiated by any scripted moments or to warn of impending danger , instead creating the impression of ever @-@ present danger . As Dishonored features few cinematic scenes that allowed for long interactions with any particular character , Licht found himself limited in developing specific character themes , and instead focused largely on composing ambient music . Samples of Licht 's ambient themes were used in the game 's few cinematic scenes , although Licht was not involved in scoring them . Licht conceived the score as a mixture of older music befitting the period setting , and 20th @-@ century techniques such as reversed sounds . Dishonored 's credit song , " Honor for All " , was written by Licht and his nephew Jon , who also provided the track 's vocals . It was written as a reward for players who had finished the game .

 Bethesda Softworks developed a spin @-@ off iOS game , Dishonored : Rat Assassin , which it released free of charge on 30 August 2012 . The game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs . Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided , but received some criticism for dark visuals , that made it difficult to see the rats . The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game , Fruit Ninja . 
 As part of the game 's promotion , Bethesda employed Copilot Strategic Music + Sound to develop the ominous " The Drunken Whaler " , a modified version of the sea shanty " Drunken Sailor " . Copilot decided to use ordinary children to sing the lyrics instead of a professional youth choir , aiming to achieve a dark , haunting quality to the music . However , they found it difficult to recruit children from local schools to sing about slit throats and hungry rats , and instead used child actors , adult singers who could imitate children , and the children of their friends . Instruments included violins , detuned and distorted guitars , and a " whaler stomp " created by the team , who stamped on wooden boards to create a pulsating sound . " The Drunken Whaler " appeared in the game 's trailer and attracted a positive reception during its presentation at the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) . Following its debut , the trailer was watched over 850 @,@ 000 times on YouTube , and it was awarded the Machinima Best Trailer award . 
 A set of three animated videos , titled Tales from Dunwall , serving as a prequel to Dishonored , were released in September 2012 . The videos show the discovery of whale @-@ oil fuel , the Outsider granting his mark to a small boy in search of revenge , and Piero creating Corvo 's mask . All three videos were created by animation studio <unk> and marketing firm <unk> , narrated by Chloë Grace Moretz , and scored by Daniel Licht . Each Tales from Dunwall episode received a gold Clio Award for achievement in advertising . In the same month , the game was used as inspiration for prosthetic makeup effects on the television reality show Face Off .

 A variety of pre @-@ order incentives were announced for the game , including a Dishonored @-@ themed , 72 @-@ card deck of Tarot cards , a USB whale @-@ oil lamp , and a smartphone decal . DLC incentives offered in @-@ game packs for the player character , including the " Arcane Assassin " , " Shadow Rat " , " Backstreet Butcher " , and " Acrobatic Killer " packs that offer enhancements for the player character 's abilities , money , and a statue of one of the game 's creatures . " Dunwall City Trials " , the game 's first post @-@ release DLC , was released on 11 December 2012 , and contains 10 challenge maps . The player must defeat waves of enemies , complete time @-@ trial challenges , and perform a series of drop assassinations in which the player kills a target by dropping from a location above the target . 
 Two story @-@ based campaign DLC packs were announced in October 2012 for release in 2013 , and follow the assassin Daud as he seeks redemption for murdering Empress Jessamine in Dishonored 's main story . The first expansion , The Knife of Dunwall was released on 16 April 2013 , on PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows . It features Daud ( again voiced by Michael Madsen ) as a playable character , with his own abilities including : " Void Gaze " , which combines the functions of Corvo 's " Dark Vision " with those of The Heart , guiding Daud to runes and bone charms ; his own version of " Blink " , which allows him to pause time ; and an ability which allows Daud to summon his assassin followers . Additionally , Daud also has his own gadgets , such as stun mines , a concealed wrist @-@ mounted bow , " <unk> " grenade , which dazes enemies ; and arc mines that disintegrate enemies . The Knife of Dunwall 's plot runs parallel to that of Dishonored 's , providing Daud 's perspective on events , and introduces new locations , such as a whale slaughterhouse and Dunwall 's affluent legal district . The Knife of Dunwall also features an additional difficulty level , " Master Assassin " , which is made available after completing the content . Dishonored designer Ricardo Bare served as the content 's creative director . The second and final expansion is titled The Brigmore Witches and was released on 13 August 2013 . The Brigmore Witches follows Daud 's quest to stop the eponymous witches from enacting a powerful ritual that will doom him , and concludes with Daud 's ultimate fate at the hands of Corvo in the core game . The DLC carries over player choices and upgrades from a The Knife of Dunwall saved game .

 Dishonored received positive reviews from critics . Aggregating review website GameRankings provides an average rating of 90 @.@ 57 % based on 14 reviews for the Microsoft Windows version , 89 @.@ 61 % based on 32 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version , and 89 @.@ 09 % based on 38 reviews for the Xbox 360 version .

 Dishonored 's plot received a polarized response , with many reviewers praising the standalone stories driving each mission , but criticizing the game 's overarching narrative . IGN 's Cam Shea said it is " a shame that Dishonored 's story isn 't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts " , and added , " Dishonored is a game you 'll talk with your friends about " . Eurogamer 's Dan Whitehead , The Verge 's Arthur Gies , and Giant Bomb 's Patrick Klepek criticized the end of the game for its generic missions , " late narrative missteps " , and abrupt ending . Klepek also criticized the repetitive ambient dialogue in the missions . Whitehead also stated that the unique , inventive , and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story . Joystiq 's Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed by the abrupt ending , and that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall , but said that the overall experience left him wanting more . In contrast , The Escapist 's Susan Arendt wrote that the story was well paced , and Shacknews 's John Keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is " role @-@ playing at its story @-@ driven finest " , but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed . 
 The gameplay was generally praised for giving players freedom to use differing methods to complete objectives and to explore the levels . Keefer wrote that in @-@ game mechanics like the powers and equipment are not essential and did not detract from the story , but served as optional bonuses in levels that can be completed with creativity and cleverness . He also said that some missions offered too much freedom without guidance , leaving the player lost on how to proceed . According to Gies , the game can initially seem unstructured from a level @-@ design perspective , but after exploring them it becomes clear about how much thought went into different actions a player can take , allowing them to experiment instead of focusing on rigid objective @-@ driven design . GameSpot 's Chris Watters enjoyed the various pathways and methods of traversing each level with " compelling abilities " , particularly the " Blink " power , and the freedom of choice which he said made Dishonored " one of the truly remarkable games of [ 2012 ] " . Arendt said that the game 's flexibility was also a shortcoming , with certain playing styles favoring certain abilities that when fully upgraded , preclude the desire to explore levels for further enhancements and resources . Game Informer 's Joe Juba also wrote that the game punishes players for taking certain paths , particularly one of violence , which results in more difficult gameplay and a perceived less satisfying ending , encouraging stealth over alternatives . Kotaku 's Jason Schreier contrasted Dishonored with other contemporary video games , and said that where other games may require a player to find a specific solution to defeat an enemy or solve a puzzle , Dishonored " feels like entering a designer 's playpen " , providing the player with an array of tools and then allowing them to experiment with how they interact with , or break , the world . 
 Reviewers also said that the game 's variety encourages replaying . Computer and Video Games ' Alex Dale praised the variety and replayability of the game , and said , " Dishonored doesn 't demand you see everything it has to offer , although it is compulsive enough to ensure you will " . News.com.au 's William Colvin wrote that the game 's only shortcoming could be that it offered too many options , and Watters stated the game achieves a rare feat of being " compulsively replayable " . Problems in the player 's control of Corvo were raised ; Whitehead noted the controls were unresponsive when used in contextual situations . Sliwinski said that the controls worked well . 
 Reviewers criticized the AI , which some found inconsistent . Whitehead criticized his experience of enemies that can see Corvo from a great distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies ' peripheral vision . Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth @-@ focused players into a combat situation , for which their character is not built . According to G4 's Jake Gaskill , the AI worked well in combat , with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks , but when not alerted , enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them . Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence , but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable . 
 The game 's visuals and design were generally praised ; Gaskill said that the art style is unique and the game world is both vivid and fully realized , and Gies stated that the game has a " unifying vision and design that stands apart from its contemporaries as something different " . Colvin described Dishonored as " a triumph for the medium ... that sets the benchmark for visuals , story , and character performance " , and that it is " easily the best looking game you 'll play this year . " Juba found the " steampunk @-@ inspired " technology designs fascinating , and stated that the visual style and art direction offer a distinct aesthetic that accompanies the " dark and disturbing " lore found in the city . 
 Reviewers likened Dishonored to well @-@ received games from the early 2000s such as Deus Ex and the Thief video game series . The Telegraph 's Tom Hoggins said it is like the " thinking man 's games [ from ] the turn of the century which cherished player choice and control " , comparing it against contemporary " noisy , brash thrill @-@ rides obsessed with military ooh @-@ rah and barely interactive set pieces " . Dale called Dishonored " one of the greatest games of this generation " , and wrote that it excelled by drawing inspiration from older games and allowing players to figure out solutions without advice . Dale also called it the first true stealth game for a long time , and the closest comparison to Thief in the current generation of games . Schreier stated that the game " [ blends ] the do @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want structure of Deus Ex with the masterful world design of BioShock . " 
 The first installment of the story @-@ based DLC The Knife of Dunwall was praised for its level design , which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas . The modifications to certain abilities , particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game . The story , however , was generally criticized . Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption , and allowing him to be played as a non @-@ lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative . IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game , lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion . The Brigmore Witches ' story received a mixed response , with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative , while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as The Knife of Dunwall , and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying . However , the gameplay was generally considered an improvement , providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach . PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme , and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay , while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC , introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players .

 Computer Space is a space combat arcade game developed in 1971 as one of the last games created in the early history of video games . Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering , it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game . Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar , possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations . It features a rocket , controlled by the player , engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying saucers set against a background starfield . The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period , which awards a free round of gameplay . The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors , which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic . 
 The game was designed by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970 – 71 to be a coin @-@ operated version of Spacewar . After the pair were unable to find a way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova , they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom @-@ designed hardware created just to run that game . After they built an early proof of concept and founded Syzygy Engineering , Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates . Working in partnership with Nutting , the pair ran their first location test in August 1971 , one month prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game , also based on Spacewar . After encouraging initial results , though mixed responses from distributors , Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1 @,@ 500 units with the anticipation of a hit game . While the game was successful and validated Syzygy 's belief in the future of arcade video games , selling over 1 @,@ 000 cabinets by mid @-@ 1972 and ultimately 1 @,@ 300 – 1 @,@ 500 units , it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for . The game spawned one clone game , Star Trek ( 1972 ) , and Nutting produced a two @-@ player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Syzygy before closing in 1976 . Syzygy went on to be incorporated as Atari , with their next arcade game the successful Pong ( 1972 ) . Although not as influential as Pong , Computer Space 's release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry .

 At the beginning of the 1970s , video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers , primarily at research institutions and large companies . One of these games was Spacewar , created in 1962 for the Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) PDP @-@ 1 minicomputer by Steve Russell and others in the programming community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The two @-@ player game has the players engage in a dogfight between two spaceships , set against the backdrop of a starfield , with a central star exerting gravitational force upon the ships . The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions after its initial release , making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute . Spacewar was extremely popular in the small programming community in the 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of the time , later migrating to early microcomputer systems . Early computer scientist Alan Kay noted in 1972 that " the game of Spacewar blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer , " and contributor Martin Graetz recalled in 1981 that as the game initially spread it could be found on " just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT " . Although the game was widespread for the era , it was still very limited in its direct reach : the PDP @-@ 1 was priced at US $ 120 @,@ 000 and only 55 were ever sold , most without a monitor , which prohibited the original Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow , academic audience . The original developers of Spacewar considered ways to monetize the game , but saw no options given the high price of the computer it ran on . The first commercial video game based on Spacewar would not be released until Computer Space in 1971 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Computer Space , the player controls a rocket as it attempts to shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire . The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two @-@ dimensional plane , set against the backdrop of a starfield . Missiles are fired one at a time , and there is a cooldown period between launches . The player 's rocket follows Newtonian physics , remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating , though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia . The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig @-@ zag pattern around the screen in tandem , with one staying a constant distance directly below the other . If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen , it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect . While the missile is in flight , the player can turn it left or right instead of turning their rocket . 
 Player controls are clockwise and counterclockwise rotation , forward thrust , and firing missiles . Whenever the player is hit by a missile or flying saucer , the screen flashes and the player 's rocket spins rapidly and disappears , then reappears in the same location . If a flying saucer is hit by a missile , the screen flashes and the saucer briefly disappears . Counters on the right side of the screen keep count of the number of times the player 's rocket has been destroyed and the saucers have been destroyed , as well as how long that round of gameplay has lasted . A round has an adjustable time limit of 60 to 150 seconds , with a default of 90 ; when the time limit is reached , the game ends if the player 's score is lower than the computer 's . If it is higher , the black and white colors invert in a " hyperspace " feature , and another round begins for free ; the game continues on to new rounds with the display colors inverting indefinitely if the player continues to win . One round costs a quarter , or two quarters if the machine is adjusted against the instruction manual 's recommendations . The game displays distorted characters if the player or computer scores pass 9 , and scores restart at 0 if they reach 16 . 
 In the two @-@ player version of the game , a second game mode is added featuring two player @-@ controlled rockets fighting each other instead of computer @-@ controlled ships . The modified control panel contains two sets of controls , with joysticks replacing the movement buttons on some machines .

 In the late 1960s , Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar running on a mainframe at the University of Utah where he was a student . Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games , and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular . The high price of computers capable of running the game , however , meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible . After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex , an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology . He also met researcher Jim Stein , who worked for Stanford University 's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project ; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory 's PDP @-@ 6 , and played the game against him there when visiting . Soon after , he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer , which cost only US $ 4 @,@ 000 , and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea ; he believed that at that price , if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously , the game would be economically viable . He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory , and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game ; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering , while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering , as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies . 
 After agreeing on an initial idea , Bushnell and Dabney began trying to design a prototype based on a Data General Nova . Initially they were joined by Larry Bryan , a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex . Bushnell and Dabney put US $ 100 each into a partnership , named Syzygy by Bryan . They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design ; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable . Bryan realized this early on , when trying to design the code needed to run the games , and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money , but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months . The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines — such as displaying the background stars — with specialized hardware , but it proved insufficient ; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough . By the end of November 1970 , Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable , while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before . It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova , sold for US $ 8 @,@ 000 , running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968 , though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game , which typically cost US $ 1 @,@ 000 at the time . Unable to put the game idea out of his mind , however , Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it , and from there Syzygy came up with the idea of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead . 
 Bushnell and Dabney began to design custom hardware to run the game 's functions , and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game 's computing systems would be much lower . As a result , they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine in order to be profitable . On the other hand , however , the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer , which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications . Spacewar was a two @-@ player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star ; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making , so the game was cut down to a single @-@ player game wherein the player would fight against two computer @-@ controlled spaceships in open space . By January 1971 , the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor , with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat , but they were still far away from turning what was then a dot moving on a screen into a full Spacewar @-@ like game cabinet . 
 In January 1971 , Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an official company , now with a cash amount of US $ 350 . They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney 's with their prototype , but found no interest . The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time , limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm . During a dentist appointment in early 1971 , Bushnell told the dentist about the game and that he was looking for a manufacturer ; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his , Dave <unk> , the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View , California . Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz , an analog quiz arcade game , and by 1971 was looking for another hit game . After meeting with Bushnell , Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates , as they had not had a hit game since . Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer , as they had no real engineering team at the time . Furthermore , Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game , even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete . Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold . Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game . Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer , when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting , as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he 'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success . 
 = = Location tests and release = = 
 Once he moved to Nutting , Bushnell took over the majority of the engineering work for the game ; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design , and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow , an intern at Ampex . There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet , with Dabney claiming credit for the controls , sound , power supply , initial wooden cabinet , and invention of the hyperspace color inversion , while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound , cabinet , power supply , and monitor . By August 1971 , an initial prototype of the game — now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz — was complete , and Syzygy moved on to location testing . They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University , where it met with great success . Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America ( MOA ) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October . Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls , and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players . 
 The final Computer Space design uses no microprocessor or memory ; the entire computer system is a state machine made of 74 @-@ series TTL chips , with graphic elements held in diode arrays . The array designs , which Bushnell designed to let him rotate the rocket in 16 directions with only 4 arrays , are laid out in the shape of the ships , which made it obvious to game operators what would need to be replaced if something broke . The ships themselves are projected on the screen as a pattern of dots , rather than connected lines , and the monitor they are projected on is a General Electric 15 @-@ inch black and white television screen , specially modified for the game . The rudimentary artificial intelligence constructed by Bushnell has the enemy ships firing towards the quadrant of the screen that the player 's rocket is in , rather than a more complicated tracking algorithm . 
 As Syzygy and Nutting prepared for the MOA show , Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar . In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck , operating as Computer Recreations , so that they could meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer . Pitts and Tuck were almost finished with a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell ; the game , however , while a faithful recreation of Spacewar , ran on an externally @-@ connected DEC PDP @-@ 11 with a Hewlett @-@ Packard <unk> Electrostatic Display , and the total cost of the prototype unit was US $ 20 @,@ 000 . The Syzygy duo were relieved , though also somewhat disappointed , to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically @-@ competitive arcade game . Pitts and Tuck , conversely , felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar , while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game . They eventually produced two game prototypes , both displayed in the Stanford student union building , but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet . 
 Computer Space debuted at the MOA show on October 15 – 17 , 1971 . Dabney 's wooden cabinet for the initial prototype was replaced with a curvy , futuristic fiberglass cabinet designed by Bushnell with modelling clay and built by a swimming pool manufacturer . A control panel extended from the main body of the cabinet and contained the four control buttons ; Syzygy had hoped to use a joystick to control the rocket 's movement , but found that it broke too easily , failing to last a single night in a location test . The Galaxy Game designers had run into the same issue , but had solved it with expensive customized military surplus joysticks . The cabinet displayed the Nutting Associates name and logo , along with the term " Syzygy engineered " . Nutting displayed four cabinets at the MOA show , one each in red , blue , white , and yellow , with the implication that the game was already in production , though they were in fact the only four cabinets then produced . These initial cabinets were in solid colors , though later ones would use a sparkle finish . The cabinets were damaged during transport , and one monitor was broken ; Syzygy repaired the three working cabinets and opened up the fourth to demonstrate the internals to attendees . Game distributors were hesitant about the game , with concerns raised about the game 's potential , reliability , and the embedded monitor 's attractiveness to thieves ; recollections are mixed as to whether Nutting took a handful or no orders at the show . Nutting , however , ordered a large production run regardless , on the expectation that the distributors would come around with further exposure . The game was displayed again at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions show from November 9 – 12 , and then entered production later that month . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1 @,@ 500 units of Computer Space , an optimistic decision given that a hit arcade game at the time would sell around 2 @,@ 000 units , though a handful had reached 10 @,@ 000 . Reception to the game from distributors was mixed ; while some were excited by the game , others felt it to be confusing and part of a passing video game fad . By spring 1972 the game had sold over 1 @,@ 000 units , and according to Bushnell in 1976 ended up selling between 1 @,@ 300 and 1 @,@ 500 units . While this was a commercial success , making over US $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , it was a disappointment to Nutting , who had been hoping for a large @-@ scale success like Computer Quiz . The game 's relative lack of success was attributed to the complexity of its controls and a steep learning curve , which pushed away customers used to less complex games . Bushnell noted that the locations that the game did well in , like the Dutch Goose playtest location , were generally located near university campuses ; the general market for coin @-@ operated games , however , was in working @-@ class bars , where the patrons were less interested in deciphering a complicated game . In the documentary Video Game Invasion : The History of a Global Obsession , Bushnell explained , " Sure , I loved it , and all my friends loved it , but all my friends were engineers . It was a little too complicated for the guy with the beer in the bar . " Bushnell has also stated that part of the difficulty lay in the novelty of the game ; he has said that even a few years later the controls and gameplay would have been more understandable to players who would have seen other video games by then . Conversely , Bushnell and Dabney have said that the game 's novelty was also part of its appeal to players — most people had never seen a television screen displaying images being controlled by a person in front of it , rather than playing video from a remote television station . 
 While the game did not meet the high hopes of Nutting , it was successful enough that Nutting produced a two @-@ player version of the game in July 1973 with a green fiberglass cabinet , built by Steve Bristow ; the design was initially contracted to Bushnell , but was either uncompleted or unused . The game had no further involvement from Bushnell or Dabney , and was not a large success . Additionally , although the biggest successes in arcade games at the time generally spawned a dozen copycat games , Computer Space had only a single clone , produced in 1972 by For @-@ Play Manufacturers as Star Trek . The game and its cabinet bore little resemblance to the television show itself . A custom white Computer Space cabinet appeared in the 1973 film Soylent Green as a futuristic entertainment device , marking the first appearance of a video game in a movie . 
 By May 1972 , Bushnell and Dabney quit Nutting Associates and moved to incorporate Syzygy Engineering ; they instead named it Atari due to another company with a similar name . Bushnell later stated that he was encouraged by the success of Computer Space in regards to future game ideas , as he had never before created something that made so much money , and additionally felt that his time at Nutting gave him confidence in running his own company because he " couldn 't screw it up more than they did " . Nutting Associates did not make any further Computer Space games before closing in 1976 . Bushnell 's enthusiasm was soon substantiated , as Atari 's first game , Pong , went on to substantially greater success than Computer Space . Although not as influential as Pong , Computer Space 's release marked the beginning of the commercial video game industry . 
 = Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field = 
 The Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field , also called the Clearwater Cone Group , is a potentially active monogenetic volcanic field in east @-@ central British Columbia , Canada , located approximately 130 km ( 81 mi ) north of Kamloops . It is situated in the Cariboo Mountains of the Columbia Mountains and on the Quesnel and Shuswap Highlands . As a monogenetic volcanic field , it is a place with numerous small basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows . 
 Most of the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is encompassed within a large wilderness park called Wells Gray Provincial Park . This 5 @,@ 405 km2 ( 2 @,@ 087 sq mi ) park was established in 1939 to protect <unk> Falls and the unique features of the Clearwater River drainage basin , including this volcanic field . Five roads enter the park and provide views of some of the field 's volcanic features . Short hikes lead to several other volcanic features , but some areas are accessible only by aircraft . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Pleistocene epoch = = = 
 Based on radiocarbon and potassium @-@ argon dating , volcanic activity in the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field began in the early Pleistocene epoch , creating valley @-@ filling and plateau @-@ capping lava flows that have a total volume of approximately 25 km3 ( 6 cu mi ) . The emplacement of these lava flows spanned at least three periods of glaciation , evidence for which is preserved in the form of tuyas , ice @-@ ponded valley deposits , and subglacial mounds . The few tuyas in the region , such as Gage Hill , <unk> Ridge , McLeod Hill and Mosquito Mound , were formed when magma intruded into and melted a vertical pipe in the overlying glacial ice . The partially molten mass cooled as a large block , with gravity flattening its upper surface . The glacial erosion of the tuyas suggests they erupted during the early Pleistocene epoch . 
 At least one explosive subaqueous volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch . This subaqueous volcano , known as White Horse Bluff , is thought to have formed in three phases . Its first phase of activity was involved with water , possibly dammed by glacial ice which filled the Clearwater River valley . The volcano heated glacial water then flooded down the volcano 's vent , creating violent steam explosions and broken lava fragments . Once the steam explosions had subsided , the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water , creating the <unk> @-@ like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite . The volcano ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the glacial water . 
 Other volcanic events elsewhere interacted with groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters . Many of these pit craters have been filled with water creating several crater lakes . In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows that form the volcanic field . <unk> are found , but are rare . Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over nearly all of the volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to <unk> exposures in several valleys . 
 = = = Holocene epoch = = = 
 At the end of the last ice age approximately 10 @,@ 000 years ago , massive floods from the melting glacial ice carved deep canyons into the underlying plateau @-@ capping lava flows . Most of these canyons contain rivers such as the <unk> and Clearwater , and waterfalls such as <unk> Falls , <unk> Falls , <unk> Falls and the 141 m ( 463 ft ) high <unk> Falls . The faces of the basaltic lava flows and waterfalls remain vertical due to the nature of the basaltic lava flows . Basaltic lava shrinks as it cools and forms vertical columns of rock called columnar basalt . More recently , the southern end of the volcanic field has experienced continuous volcanic activity since the end of the last ice age . This volcanic activity occurred in three areas ; Spanish Creek , Ray Lake and Kostal Lake which were followed by lava fountain eruptions creating cinder cones and lava flows . 
 Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake areas were <unk> but continued after the glacial ice had melted away . Two cinder cones , known as <unk> Cone and Pointed Stick Cone , were created in the Spanish Creek area . Lava flows from the two cinder cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening <unk> , indicating an early Holocene age . 
 Eruptions near Ray Lake built a cinder cone known as Dragon Cone and concluded with an approximately 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) long ʻaʻā lava flow that has been radiocarbon dated at about 7 @,@ 600 years old . This lava flow , known as " Dragon 's Tongue " , is at least 15 m ( 49 ft ) thick at the proximal end , but thins to 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) at the distal end , damming the southern end of Clearwater Lake . Tree molds are maintained within the lava flow at the lower end . 
 The latest volcanic eruption created a small tree @-@ covered basaltic cinder cone at the east end of Kostal Lake called Kostal Cone perhaps as recently as 400 years ago , making it one of the youngest volcanoes in Canada based on tree @-@ growth data . 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field began forming approximately 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 years ago and has grown steadily since then . The tectonic causes of the volcanism that have produced the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field are not yet clear and are therefore a matter of ongoing research . It is approximately 250 km ( 160 mi ) inland from the north @-@ south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is along @-@ strike from the Nootka Fault on the British Columbia Coast , which has been subducting under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone . The Wells Gray volcanics are mostly alkali olivine basalt , with some lava flows comprising mantle xenoliths . Basalts of the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field have been considered to be the easternmost expression of the Anahim Volcanic Belt . However , its relationship is unknown because the age @-@ location trend does not reach into the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater area , and the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is not along trend with the Anahim Volcanic Belt . The Wells Gray volcanics were thought to have formed by crustal thinning and the existence of crustal penetrating structures . 
 More recent studies by volcanologists associated with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the <unk> Fault may be the primary cause of the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field . The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the transform fault . If the transform fault had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates , the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge . Similarly , if the displacement had a section of extension , a horizontal slab window @-@ like gap would have developed , again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma . In either case , the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of <unk> melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions . 
 = = = Lava composition = = = 
 The composition of some lava flows in the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small , angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals that come from the mantle . These green nodules are known as <unk> because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine . These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine , plagioclase , and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth 's crust and mantle . The lavas and nodules they contain are similar to those erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon . The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like . 
 Holocene lava flows are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and comprise several xenoliths of chromium @-@ spinel <unk> , spinel <unk> , and rare <unk> <unk> and spinel <unk> . <unk> do not exist in the older lava flows . However , chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting . The melts originally came from the upper mantle which , over time , was progressively depleted by every following melting event . 
 = = = Current activity = = = 
 The Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is one of the 10 volcanic areas in Canada associated with recent seismic activity ; the others are Castle Rock , Mount Edziza , Mount Cayley , Hoodoo Mountain , The Volcano , Crow Lagoon , Mount Meager , Mount Garibaldi and Nazko Cone . Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma plumbing systems , indicating possible future eruptive activity . Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion , these observations are further indications that some of Canada 's volcanoes are potentially active , and that their associated hazards may be significant . Beneath areas of monogenetic cinder cone activity , such as the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field , the seismicity appears to be more dispersed . In a few cases earthquakes are clustered in time and space , suggestive of volcanic earthquake swarms . 
 = = Volcanic hazards = = 
 = = = Lava eruptions = = = 
 Because the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is in a remote location , danger from lava eruptions would be low to moderate . Magma with low levels of silica ( as in basalt ) commonly extend tens of kilometers from the volcano 's vent . The leading edges of basalt flows can travel as fast as 10 kilometres per hour ( 6 @.@ 2 mph ) on steep slopes but they typically advance less than 1 kilometre per hour ( 0 @.@ 62 mph ) on gentle slopes . But when basalt lava flows are confined within a channel or lava tube on a steep slope , the main body of the flow can reach velocities more than 30 kilometres per hour ( 19 mph ) . Based on past volcanic activity , the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field has a long history of producing quiet lava fountaining @-@ style eruptions . Such eruptions consist of ejection of incandescent cinder , lapilli and lava bombs to altitudes of tens to hundreds of metres . They are small to medium in volume , with sporadic violence . Since the region is mostly forested and lava flows are likely to travel long distances , it is possible lava eruptions could start large forest fires and some river valleys might be dammed . 
 = = = Explosive eruptions = = = 
 More violent eruptions are possible only in unique circumstances , such as an eruption into a lake . Any future eruption is most likely to affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano . Poisonous substances , such as volcanic gas , includes a variety of substances . These include gases trapped in cavities ( vesicles ) in volcanic rocks , dissolved or <unk> gases in magma and lava , or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action . The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people , animals , agriculture , and property are sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride . Locally , sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano . 
 = = Monitoring = = 
 Currently the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcanic field 's magma system is . The existing network of seismographs has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the volcanic field . It may sense an increase in activity if the volcanic field becomes very restless , but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption . It might detect activity only after the volcanic field has started erupting . 
 A possible way to detect an eruption is studying the volcanic field 's geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behaviour , in terms of its eruption style , magnitude and frequency , so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions . But this would likely be abandoned in part because of the volcanic field 's remoteness . 
 While there is a likelihood of Canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required . Benefit @-@ cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards . However , a benefit @-@ cost examination needs correct data about the hazard types , magnitudes and occurrences . These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required . 
 Other volcanic techniques , such as hazard mapping , displays a volcano 's eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future . At present no hazard maps have been created for the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field because the level of knowledge is insufficient due to its remoteness . A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada . The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy , separate way from the support of several employees , such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists . Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project . Knowledge at the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field and other volcanic areas in British Columbia is not as established , but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley . An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts . 
 The existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975 , although it remained small in population until 1985 . Apart from a few short @-@ term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada , no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes . Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , and frequently within 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors , particularly for earthquake depth . Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption , offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk . Currently the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field does not have a seismograph closer than 59 kilometres ( 37 mi ) . With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity , the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location accuracy and depth decreases , and the network becomes not as accurate . However , at least one possible volcanic earthquake swarm has been noticed east of the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field . The inaccurate earthquake locations in the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field are a few kilometers , and in more isolated northern regions they are up to 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . The location magnitude level in the Wells Gray @-@ Clearwater volcanic field is about magnitude 1 to 1 @.@ 5 , and elsewhere it is magnitude 1 @.@ 5 to 2 . At carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption . Undetected events are not recorded or surveyed in British Columbia immediately , nor in an easy @-@ to @-@ access process . 
 In countries like Canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected , particularly if no events were observed ; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature , or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice .

 = Presidential elections in Singapore = 
 Presidential elections in Singapore , in which the President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote , were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991 . Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications set out in the Constitution . Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee ( PEC ) . In particular , the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity , good character and reputation ; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or acted as chairman of the board of directors or chief executive officer of a company incorporated or registered under the Companies Act ( Cap . 50 , 2006 Rev. Ed . ) with a paid @-@ up capital of at least S $ 100 million , they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs . The strictness of these qualifications led to the 1999 and 2005 elections being walkovers as only one candidate , S.R. Nathan , received a certificate of eligibility from the PEC . The stringent criteria , the transparency of the PEC 's decision @-@ making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism . 
 The office of President falls vacant upon the expiry of the incumbent 's six @-@ year term or if the President is for some reason unable to complete his or her term ; for example , due to death , resignation or removal from office for misconduct or mental or physical infirmity . If the office of President becomes vacant before the incumbent 's term expires , a poll for an election must be held within six months . In other cases , an election can take place any time from three months before the expiry of the incumbent 's term of office . 
 The procedure for elections is laid out in the Presidential Elections Act ( Cap . 240A , 2007 Rev. Ed . ) . The process begins when the Prime Minister issues a writ of election to the returning officer specifying the date and place of nomination day . Potential candidates must then obtain certificates of eligibility from the PEC , obtain political donation certificates from the Registrar of Political Donations stating that they have complied with the Political Donations Act ( Cap . 236 , 2001 Rev. Ed . ) and file their nomination papers with and pay a deposit to the returning officer on nomination day . If there is only one candidate nominated , he or she is declared to have been elected President . Otherwise , the returning officer issues a notice of contested election specifying when polling day will be . 
 During the election period , a candidate may not spend more than $ 600 @,@ 000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register , whichever is greater . Permits must be obtained to hold election meetings and display posters and banners . A number of acts are unlawful , including bribery , dissuading electors from voting , making false statements about candidates , treating and undue influence . Legal changes introduced in 2010 made the eve of polling day a " cooling @-@ off day " – campaigning must not take place on that day or on polling day itself . 
 = = The Elected President scheme = = 
 The President of Singapore is the nation 's head of state . The President was originally indirectly elected by Parliament and had a largely ceremonial role . The Elected President scheme was instituted in 1991 through a constitutional amendment , which transformed the office of President into one directly elected by the people . The scheme conferred additional powers on the President that enabled him to act as a safeguard or " second key " over Singapore 's rich financial reserves built up by the Government . Additionally , the President exercises a custodial role over the integrity of the public service with the power to veto public appointments and check against abuses of power by the government . 
 = = Qualifications = = 
 The qualifications required for a person to be elected as President are set out in the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and are as follows : 
 He or she must be a citizen of Singapore . 
 He or she must not be less than 45 years of age . 
 His or her name must appear in a current register of electors . 
 He or she must be resident in Singapore at the date of his or her nomination for election and must have been so resident for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than 10 years prior to that date . 
 He or she must not be subject to any of the disqualifications specified in Article 45 of the Constitution , which include matters such as being of unsound mind , being an undischarged bankrupt , holding an office of profit , having a criminal record and being a citizen of a foreign country . 
 He or she must satisfy the Presidential Elections Committee ( PEC ) that he or she is a person of integrity , good character and reputation . 
 He or she must not be a member of any political party on the date of his or her nomination for election . 
 He or she must have been one of the following for not less than three years : 
 A Minister , Chief Justice , Speaker of Parliament , Attorney @-@ General , Chairman of the Public Service Commission , Auditor @-@ General , Accountant @-@ General or a Permanent Secretary . 
 Chairman or chief executive officer of the Central Provident Fund Board , the Housing and Development Board , the Jurong Town Corporation or the Monetary Authority of Singapore ; 
 Chairman of the board of directors or chief executive officer of a company incorporated or registered under the Companies Act with a paid @-@ up capital of at least S $ 100 million or its equivalent in foreign currency . 
 In any other similar or comparable position of seniority and responsibility in any other organization or department of equivalent size or complexity in the public or private sector which , in the PEC 's opinion , has given him / her such experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs as to enable him / her to carry out effectively the functions and duties of the office of President . 
 There is no restriction on the number of times a qualified person can be elected President . 
 = = = <unk> of qualifications = = = 
 The strict qualifications required of presidential candidates resulted in walkovers during the elections of 1999 and 2005 . The incumbent President Ong Teng Cheong did not run for a second term at the 1999 presidential election , saying that he had no compelling reason to do so . In addition to the eventual winner , <unk> Ramanathan ( better known as S.R. Nathan ) , the other potential candidates were Tan Soo <unk> , a member of the opposition Workers ' Party of Singapore ; and Ooi Boon Ewe , a private tutor turned real estate executive . Both of them were found not to have met the criteria to stand for election . As a result , Nathan , a former civil servant and Ambassador to the United States , was deemed to have been elected President . At the presidential election of 2005 , the persons who applied for a certificate of eligibility to contest the election were Nathan , Ooi and Ramachandran <unk> Naidu . However , as Nathan was again the only candidate issued with a certificate , he was elected by default on nomination day . 
 The strict requirements have been justified on the basis that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing , with the ability to monitor the financial affairs of the state and the management of the public service sector . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee . He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People 's Action Party ( PAP ) . 
 The qualifying criteria have been criticised as elitist and pro @-@ establishment in nature . The argument against allowing the electorate to elect as President a candidate of their choice without the need for candidates to meet detailed qualification criteria has been said to be " unconvincing " and predicated on " the government 's paternalistic distrust of the electorate " . 
 It has been pointed out that the stringent criteria severely limit the pool of available candidates . In 2005 , the Prime Minister 's press secretary estimated that only 700 to 800 people potentially satisfied the criteria . This may be contrary to the principle of equality under the law as it " impairs the equal right of candidature " . It also runs contrary to the principle of democracy which " demands that a broad selection of people should be able to stand for high public office " . However , the press secretary wrote that the dignity of the office of the President and Singapore 's reputation would be diminished by elections in which " manifestly unfit candidates participate , just for the sake of having one " . 
 = = = Political endorsement = = = 
 Singapore law does not prevent political parties , the Government , or non @-@ governmental bodies with close government ties from endorsing candidates . The first presidential election in Singapore in 1993 pitted Ong Teng Cheong , a former PAP Member of Parliament who had been Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the National Trades Union Congress ( NTUC ) , against the former Accountant @-@ General , Chua Kim <unk> . Chua showed initial reluctance , accepting the nomination only as his " national duty " and even proclaiming Ong to be the far superior candidate . He declined to campaign , saying he could not afford it . However , he did address the populace via two ten @-@ minute broadcasts offered by state @-@ owned television and radio stations . His appeal was based on preventing an over @-@ concentration of powers – he asked Singaporeans whether they wanted the PAP to dominate the Presidency as well . In contrast , Ong invested $ 50 @,@ 000 to $ 60 @,@ 000 of his own money in the campaign . He was assisted by the NTUC which mobilized its 230 @,@ 000 members to canvass at least five votes each for their former union boss . Ong was backed by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong who appealed to Singaporeans to vote for him . On polling day , 28 August 1993 , Ong received 952 @,@ 513 votes ( 58 @.@ 7 % ) and Chua 670 @,@ 358 votes ( 41 @.@ 3 % ) out of a total of 1 @,@ 756 @,@ 517 votes . Ong was thus declared the first Elected President of Singapore . Ironically , Ong himself said that his links to the PAP might have cost him a few percentage points in votes . Given the strong show of government support for Ong , commentators expressed the view that Ong 's victory meant a victory for the PAP and the continuation of its values and style of governance . Although the votes for Ong fell short of the PAP 's expected 60 – 70 % range , the result was not seen as a repudiation of the PAP but as indicative of Singaporeans ' appetite for stronger checks and balances . 
 At both the 1999 and 2005 presidential elections , S.R. Nathan was elected by default as the only eligible candidate on nomination day . While being a member of a minority community worked to his advantage , he was unanimously endorsed by the 1999 Cabinet because of the merit of his overall qualities . Similarly , Nathan 's decision to run for a second term in 2005 was accompanied by declarations of support from Government ministers and organizations like the NTUC . 
 The practice of the PAP endorsing a candidate has led to criticisms that this is improper as the Government is essentially " revealing who they would rather have as their supervisor " . Ong , who received the PAP 's endorsement during the 1991 elections , revealed in a later interview : 
 [ T ] here was a swing of support over to my opponent 's side , especially in the educated class ... The issue was whether they wanted a PAP man as president to check on a PAP government , or whether it would be better to have a neutral independent like Chua . That 's why they voted against me because I had the PAP government support . I would have been happier without the PAP 's open support . 
 Furthermore , such endorsements can be said to undermine the principle that a candidate for President should not be beholden to any political formation , which is reflected in the requirement for a candidate not to be a member of any political party . 
 = = Election procedure = = 
 The President holds office for a term of six years from the date on which he assumes office . The office of President becomes vacant when the term of the incumbent expires , or before this event if , among other things , the President dies , resigns , or is removed from office for misconduct or mental or physical infirmity . If the office of President falls vacant before the incumbent 's term expires , a poll for an election is to be held within six months . In other cases , the election must take place not more than three months before the date of expiration of the incumbent 's term of office . Article 17 ( 2 ) of the Constitution provides that " [ t ] he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature " . The Presidential Elections Act lays out the election procedure in Singapore . 
 = = = Issuance of writ of election = = = 
 To initiate the election process , the Prime Minister issues a writ addressed to the returning officer , who is responsible for overseeing the election . The writ of election states when nomination day will be ( which must not be less than five days nor more than a month after the date of the writ ) , and the place of nomination . The returning officer is required to notify the public that the writ of election has been issued and the day , time and place of nomination of candidates by publishing a notice in the Government Gazette at least four clear days before nomination day . 
 = = = Application for certificate of eligibility = = = 
 A potential candidate for President must apply to the Presidential Elections Committee for a certificate of eligibility ( " COE " ) . This can be done any time after the office of the President falls vacant before the end of the incumbent 's term , or within three months before the expiry of the incumbent 's term . The deadline for applications is three days after the date when the writ of election is issued . 
 The PEC is tasked to ensure that a candidate fulfils the necessary qualifications set out in the Constitution . The Committee consists of the Chairman of the Public Service Commission ( PSC ) , the Chairman of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority , and a member of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights . The Chairman of the PSC chairs the committee . The PEC must be satisfied that the candidate " is a person of integrity , good character and reputation " and , if the candidate indicates that he wishes to qualify on the basis that he has held office in an organisation or department that has given him such experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs as to enable him to effectively carry out the President 's functions and duties , that he possesses the necessary experience and ability . To demonstrate his good character and reputation , the candidate must submit to the PEC three references from persons who are not his immediate relatives . If the candidate satisfies the PEC , the Committee must issue a COE no later than the day before nomination day . 
 The PEC 's decision as to whether a candidate fulfils the two requirements mentioned above is final and not subject to appeal or judicial review in any court . The PEC is not constitutionally required to provide any justification for its decision . In the absence of malice , the Committee is immune from a defamation suit when it discharges its functions under the Presidential Elections Act . 
 The non @-@ justiciable nature of the PEC 's decisions has been criticised as contrary to the rule of law as the PEC is not accountable to any external body and its operations are " less than transparent " . If the PEC thinks fit , it may request that an applicant for a COE or his referees appear before the Committee before it makes its decision , and may ask an applicant to provide information . However , if the PEC takes neither of these steps , a candidate has no right to insist that the Committee hear submissions or consider information tendered by him . 
 One of the potential candidates during the 2005 presidential election was Andrew Kuan , then running his own executive search firm , Blue Arrow International . He had been a grassroots leader in Pasir Ris and a PAP member , as well as Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) of the Jurong Town Corporation ( JTC ) and the <unk> joint venture . Kuan was thrust into the media limelight after announcing his bid . While Kuan was financially sound , reports reflecting a range of reactions towards his bid surfaced . Whereas some saw him as " conceited " and " arrogant " , there were others who spoke of him warmly . This was followed by reports of him having been ousted from his position as chairman of his condominium 's management committee in May 2001 . Reports of Kuan 's performance from his former employers also surfaced . JTC reported that Kuan had needed more " handholding " than was appropriate for a CFO and had been asked to resign thrice . Kwan asserted that his performance had been rated " good " for eight months and had received performance bonuses . Another former employer , Inderjit Singh , a PAP Member of Parliament and founder of United Test & Assembly Centre , said Kuan 's performance as a consultant had been unsatisfactory . Kuan lodged a defamation suit against Singh , but eventually withdrew it . 
 The PEC eventually denied Kuan a COE on the grounds that he lacked the requisite financial credentials and responsibility required by the Constitution . Kuan was not given an opportunity to be interviewed by the PEC despite the negative media reports , which were speculated to have contributed to the PEC 's decision not to issue him a COE . The Prime Minister 's press secretary said that public hearings would " politicise the decision " and therefore affect the independence of the PEC . It has been argued that since the PEC 's decision not to issue a COE may cast aspersions on an applicant 's character , the lack of a procedure for the candidate to respond to negative findings in a public setting is contrary to the principles of natural justice . This is even more so given that the PEC is immune from defamatory actions . 
 In addition , it has been said that the independence of the PEC 's decision @-@ making process could be affected by political endorsements of a candidate expressed prior to the issuance of his COE . 
 = = = Political donations = = = 
 Under the Political Donations Act , candidates for presidential elections may only receive political donations from Singapore citizens who are at least 21 years old , or Singapore @-@ controlled companies which carry on business wholly or mainly in Singapore . The receipt of anonymous donations is prohibited , except for anonymous donations totalling less than $ 5 @,@ 000 received during a period starting with the date 12 months before the date when the candidate makes the declaration referred to below and ending with nomination day . 
 After the date of the writ of election and at least two clear days before nomination day , a candidate or prospective candidate must provide the Registrar of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from permissible donors that amount to at least $ 10 @,@ 000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence . He must also submit to the Registrar a declaration stating , to the best of his knowledge and belief , that he did not receive any other donations required to be mentioned in the donation report , and that only donations from permissible donors or allowable anonymous donations were accepted . If this paperwork is in order , the Registrar will issue a political donation certificate not later than the eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act . 
 = = = Nomination = = = 
 A person who has received a certificate of eligibility is entitled to be nominated as a presidential candidate . He must submit a nomination paper to the returning officer between 11 : 00 a.m. and 12 : 00 noon on nomination day , together with a political donation certificate . In addition , at some time between the date of the writ of election and 12 : 00 noon on nomination day , he or someone on his behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8 % of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year , rounded to the nearest $ 500 . At the 2011 presidential election , the deposit was $ 48 @,@ 000 . The deposit is returned if the person is not nominated as a candidate , withdraws his candidature or is eventually elected . If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election , he is only repaid the deposit if he polled more than one @-@ eighth of the total number of votes polled , not including rejected votes . 
 If on nomination day only one candidate stands nominated , he shall be declared elected to the office of President . This occurred at both the 1999 and 2005 elections , at which S.R. Nathan was deemed elected because he was the only candidate considered eligible by the PEC . The desirability of this state of affairs has been questioned on the basis that " [ i ] f an elected President is to have a mandate to protect the reserves and to veto proposed public appointments , it is desirable that he should receive a minimum percentage of votes cast by the electorate , as an endorsement of him " . Allowing election by default arguably places the PEC 's decision as to the eligibility of the candidates above the electorate 's choice . One commentator has said that a true contest is needed to legitimise the institution of the Elected Presidency . On the other hand , it has been argued that if there is no contest for the Presidency it does not affect the President 's right or legitimacy to hold this office : 
 [ A ] s long as Singaporeans believe that the Constitution is the principal source of political legitimacy , a candidate who occupies the office by virtue of a walkover , as is consistent with the Constitution , has as much moral authority as one who wins in a contested election . 
 If , on nomination day , there are two or more candidates nominated for election , the returning officer must immediately adjourn the election so that a poll can be taken . He must assign each candidate an approved symbol to be printed on the candidate 's ballot paper and announce by publishing a notice of contested election in the Government Gazette with information about the forthcoming poll , including the candidates ' names and symbols , the date of polling day ( which must be not earlier than the 10th day or later than the 56th day after the date of the notice ) and the locations of polling stations . 
 = = = Campaigning = = = 
 During the election period , a candidate is not permitted to spend more than $ 600 @,@ 000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register , whichever is the greater amount . It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll ; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice , unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business . It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend , hire or rent out , or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll . <unk> an illegal practice is a criminal offence , the penalty for which is a fine of up to $ 2 @,@ 000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President . 
 The following acts are also prohibited : 
 Bribery . Doing any one of a number of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so , such as giving or lending money ; and giving or procuring an office or employment , amounts to bribery . It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement ; to give money to someone else , knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election ; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so ; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate , or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement . The penalty is a fine of up to $ 5 @,@ 000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both ; and disqualification from being registered as a voter , voting at any election , or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years . 
 <unk> from voting . <unk> or attempting to dissuade a person from voting verbally or in writing between nomination day and polling day is a criminal offence punishable with a fine of up to $ 2 @,@ 000 or up to 12 months ' jail or both . 
 False statements . Offenders who make or publish false statements of fact regarding the personal character or conduct of a candidate , or false statements about a candidate 's withdrawal from the election , are liable on conviction to a fine or jail of up to 12 months or both , and to the disqualifications referred to above . 
 Treating . Treating is the act of corruptly giving or providing , or paying in whole or part for , any food , drink , refreshment , cigarette , entertainment or other thing , or any money or ticket or other means to enable such things to be obtained , in order to corruptly influence a person to vote or refrain from voting , or to induce the person to attend an election meeting , or to reward him for having done so . The penalty is a fine of up to $ 5 @,@ 000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both , and the disqualifications referred to above . 
 <unk> influence . When a person makes use of or threatens to make use of force , violence or restraint , or inflicts or threatens to inflict temporal or spiritual injury , damage , harm or loss on a person to induce him to vote or refrain from voting , or to punish him for having done so ; or uses abduction , duress or some fraudulent scheme to impede or prevent a person 's free exercise of his vote , or to compel or induce him to vote or refrain from voting , this amounts to the offence of undue influence . The penalty is a fine of up to $ 5 @,@ 000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both , and the disqualifications referred to above . 
 A permit from the Commissioner of Police is required if a candidate wishes to hold an election meeting between nomination day and the day before the eve of polling day . The display of banners and posters by candidates during the campaigning period must also be authorized by the returning officer , who may impose conditions as to the places where or objects or things on which , and the manner in which , banners or posters may or may not be displayed . The returning officer also determines the maximum number of banners and posters that may be put up , bearing in mind the number of electors and the need to treat candidates equally . Further authorization is required if a candidate wishes to display a banner or poster or its contents in some other medium , such as the Internet ; a newspaper , magazine or periodical ; or a television broadcast . Election banners and posters may not be displayed in such a way that they obscure the view of other banners and posters , or within 200 metres ( 660 ft ) ( or a shorter distance if so determined by the returning officer ) of a polling station . Making inscriptions on buildings or roads is prohibited . It is an offence to display any banner or poster in breach of the law or the terms imposed by the returning officer ; and to deface , destroy or remove any authorized banner or poster . 
 = = = Eve of polling day and polling day = = = 
 In 2010 , legal changes were introduced to turn the eve of polling day for both presidential and parliamentary elections into a " cooling @-@ off day " on which no campaigning would be permitted . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong justified the changes as enabling voters to think dispassionately about the candidates ' stands on issues raised and reducing the chance of public disorder . On the eve and on polling day itself , election advertising is prohibited , though the following activities remain unaffected : 
 distributing a book or promoting the sale of a book for not less than its commercial value if the book was planned to be published regardless of whether there was to be an election ; 
 publishing news relating to an election in a licensed newspaper in any medium or in a licensed radio or television broadcast ; 
 conveying one 's own political views on a non @-@ commercial basis to another individual by telephonic or electronic transmission ; 
 election advertising lawfully published or displayed before the start of the eve of polling day on the Internet which is not changed after its publication or display ; and 
 the continued lawful display of posters and banners already displayed before the start of the eve of polling day . 
 Badges , favours , flags , rosettes , symbols , sets of colours , advertisements , handbills , placards , posters and replica voting papers may not be carried , worn , used or displayed by any person or on any vehicle as political propaganda , although candidates may wear replicas of the symbols allotted to them for election purposes . In addition , holding election meetings and canvassing are not permitted on the day before polling day or on polling day itself . Canvassing involves trying to persuade a person to vote or not to vote in a particular way ; or visiting a voter for an election @-@ related purpose at home or at his or her workplace . It is an offence to exercise undue influence on any person at or near a polling station : for example , trying to find out the identity of any person entering a polling station ; recording voters ' particulars ; and waiting outside or loitering within 200 metres ( 660 ft ) of polling stations . 
 Polling day is a public holiday and voting is compulsory . Unless the returning officer decides otherwise , polling stations are open from 8 : 00 a.m. to 8 : 00 p.m. on polling day . To vote , voters must go to the polling stations assigned to them . Applying for a ballot paper or voting in the name of someone else amounts to the offence of <unk> . If a person claiming to be a voter named in the electoral register turns up at a polling station after someone else claiming to be that voter has already voted , the second person is permitted to cast what is called a " tendered vote " using a ballot paper of a different colour after taking an oath to confirm his identity . 
 After the poll closes , the presiding officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them . Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes . The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres to be opened and the ballots counted . A candidate or his counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if the difference between the number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate 's number of votes is 2 % or less , excluding rejected and tendered votes . After all counts , and recounts if any , have been completed , the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes . If so , the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President . If not , the overseas votes may be decisive . The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted . 
 All officers , clerks , interpreters , candidates and candidates ' agents at polling stations must maintain the secrecy of voting in stations . Before the poll is closed , they must not communicate to anyone the name of any elector who has not yet voted or his or her or identification number on the electoral register . They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes as to which candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper . Furthermore , no person is allowed to try to find out from within a polling station who a voter intends to vote for or has voted for , or to communicate with a voter after he has been given a ballot paper but before he has placed it in a ballot box . 
 = = = Declaration that election is void = = = 
 A person claiming to have been a candidate at a presidential election or to have had a right to be elected , or a person who voted or had a right to vote at a presidential election , may apply to an election judge for a candidate 's election as President to be declared void on any of the following grounds : 
 The majority of voters was or might have been prevented from electing their preferred candidate due to a general occurrence of bribery , treating , intimidation or some other form of misconduct or circumstances . 
 There was a failure to comply with the Presidential Elections Act and this affected the result of the election . 
 A corrupt or illegal practice in connection with the election was committed by the candidate , or by an agent of the candidate with his knowledge or consent . 
 The candidate personally hired someone as an election agent , canvasser or agent while aware that the person had been found guilty of a corrupt practice within the seven years before he was engaged . 
 At the time the candidate was elected , he was disqualified from standing for election . 
 The Chief Justice or a Supreme Court judge nominated by him acts as the election judge . 
 The applicant for an election to be avoided may ask for a declaration that the election is void , that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected , and / or that another candidate was duly elected . The applicant may also request for a scrutiny – that is , a re @-@ examination of the ballot papers – if he alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes . When a scrutiny is conducted , the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station ; if the vote was obtained by bribery , treating or undue influence ; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of <unk> ; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known . During a scrutiny , a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added . On the other hand , a registered elector 's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he was not qualified to be on the electoral register , and the returning officer 's decision as to whether or not a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned . 
 The election judge is empowered to exempt from being an illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate , his election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum , incurring an expense or entering into a contract if it was done in good faith and was due to inadvertence , accidental miscalculation or the like . Similarly , the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his principal election agent shows that he acted in good faith and that there is a reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as his inadvertence or illness , or the absence , death , illness or misconduct of some other agent , clerk or officer . In particular , the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his principal election agent if he did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it . 
 The election judge certifies his decision , which is final , to the Prime Minister . The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his agent . If a judge intends to report a person who was neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he should have been declared elected , that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him . However , where a candidate 's agents are found to have been guilty of treating , undue influence or an illegal practice , but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his orders and without his or his election agents ' sanction or connivance , that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election , that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature , and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice , the election is not void . 
 Depending on whether the judge has determined that the election was valid or void , the election return is confirmed or altered . If the election is declared void , the Prime Minister is empowered to order that another election be held within six months of the determination .

 = 2001 FA Cup Final = 
 The 2001 FA Cup Final was a football match between Arsenal and Liverpool on 12 May 2001 at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff . It was the final match of the 2000 – 01 FA Cup , the 119th season of the world 's oldest football knockout competition , the FA Cup , and the first in the competition 's history to be staged outside England , due to the ongoing reconstruction of its usual venue , Wembley Stadium . Arsenal appeared in their fourteenth final to Liverpool 's twelfth . 
 Given both teams were in the highest tier of English football , the Premier League , they entered the competition in the third round . Each needed to progress through five rounds to reach the final . Arsenal 's progress was relatively comfortable ; after scoring six past Queens Park Rangers , they knocked out holders Chelsea in the fifth round and later came from behind to beat local rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the semi @-@ final . Liverpool by contrast made hard work of overcoming lower @-@ league opponents Tranmere Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers in the latter rounds of the competition . The final marked the first time that two managers born outside of the British Isles had met in an FA Cup final – French compatriots Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier . 
 The match followed a familiar pattern of Arsenal dictating the pace and creating chances , but failing to breach the Liverpool defence . Arsenal had a penalty appeal turned down in the first half , when defender Stéphane Henchoz handled the ball to deny Thierry Henry a goalscoring opportunity . Henchoz 's partner Sami Hyypiä made a series of goalline clearances during the second half , but was helpless to stop Arsenal taking the lead in the 72nd minute . Liverpool responded by making changes and equalised in the 83rd minute ; Arsenal 's failure to deal with a free @-@ kick presented Michael Owen the chance to score . Owen then outpaced Lee Dixon and Tony Adams to score his second and the match winner , two minutes before the end of normal time . Liverpool 's victory marked the second part of their unique treble of the 2000 – 01 season : they had won the Football League Cup in late February and added the UEFA Cup four days later . 
 = = Route to the final = = 
 The FA Cup is English football 's primary cup competition . Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a hat with the remaining clubs . If a match is drawn , a replay comes into force , ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game . As with league fixtures , FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions . This was the first season that The Football Association introduced guidelines to prevent the withdrawal of clubs from the competition . The final was scheduled a week before the final weekend of the Premier League , to aid any successful club playing European football . 
 = = = Arsenal = = = 
 Arsenal entered the competition in the third round and their cup run started with an away tie against Carlisle United . Although the home side created numerous chances in the opening minutes and looked likeliest to score , Arsenal took the lead in the 22nd minute through Sylvain Wiltord . Poor finishing from both teams thereafter meant Arsenal progressed by a slender scoreline . In the fourth round , Arsenal faced Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road . The visitors ' first goal came around the half @-@ hour mark ; defender Ashley Cole cleared Peter Crouch 's goal @-@ bound header and from that Arsenal launched a counterattack . Lee Dixon 's cross inadvertently met Chris Plummer who scored an own goal . Wiltord extended Arsenal 's lead a minute later , and QPR conceded another own goal early in the second half which sealed the tie in the visitors ' favour . Arsenal finished as comfortable 6 – 0 winners , representing the club 's best away win in the FA Cup for 64 years . 
 In the fifth round Arsenal played the cup holders Chelsea at home . Throughout the tie Arsenal 's centre @-@ back partnership of Oleh Luzhny and Igors Stepanovs struggled against the pace of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink , who equalised for Chelsea after Thierry Henry gave the home side the lead . Wiltord replaced Robert Pirès in the second half and scored twice to settle the match . In the sixth round Arsenal enjoyed a comfortable win against Blackburn Rovers of the First Division , where Wiltord continued his run scoring in each round of the competition . 
 Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi @-@ final and it was their local rivals who had taken the lead in the 14th minute . Patrick Vieira equalised just after Tottenham captain Sol Campbell was taken off the pitch to receive treatment . Tottenham managed to withstand pressure from Arsenal for most of the second half , but came unstuck in the 73rd minute when Pirès scored the decisive goal . 
 = = = Liverpool = = = 
 Liverpool entered the competition in the third round , where they were drawn against Second Division side Rotherham United at home . Igor Bišćan was sent off in the tie for a second bookable offence , moments after Emile Heskey had scored . Dietmar Hamann extended Liverpool 's lead in the 73rd minute and a further goal by Heskey ensured their progress in the competition . 
 Liverpool 's opponent in the fourth round was Leeds United . The match was played at Elland Road on 27 January 2001 in front of a near @-@ capacity crowd of 37 @,@ 108 . The home team enjoyed much of the possession , but struggled to find a breakthrough as Liverpool 's defence stood firm . Two minutes before the 90 , Barmby – on as a substitute – scored the winning goal , rebounding a shot that came off the post . Barmby then turned provider for Liverpool 's second , setting up Heskey to score . 
 Anfield hosted Manchester City in the fifth round ; it was the start of a decisive week for Liverpool as they faced Roma midweek in the UEFA Cup and then Birmingham City in the 2001 Football League Cup Final . Liverpool were awarded a penalty after five minutes , as goalkeeper Nicky Weaver fouled Vladimír Šmicer inside the 18 @-@ yard box . Jari Litmanen converted the spot kick to give Liverpool the lead , which quickly became 2 – 0 when Heskey 's shot found its way past Weaver . Andrei Kanchelskis 's goal in the 28th minute halved the scoreline , but Šmicer and Markus Babbel each scored in the second half to put Liverpool in a commanding lead . City persisted and in stoppage time scored their second goal of the match ; Shaun Goater 's deflected shot did enough to beat goalkeeper Sander Westerveld . 
 Liverpool travelled to Prenton Park to play Tranmere Rovers in the sixth round . Danny Murphy and Michael Owen each scored in a first half in which the visitors dominated play . Steve Yates pulled a goal back for Tranmere after half @-@ time , but in the 52nd minute Steven Gerrard headed @-@ in a cross to restore Liverpool 's two @-@ goal advantage . A mistake by Robbie Fowler gifted substitute Wayne Allison the chance to score , but the striker made amends as he converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute . In the semi @-@ final , Liverpool faced Wycombe Wanderers at Villa Park . Goals from Heskey and Fowler and a consolation scored by Wycombe 's captain Keith Ryan ensured Liverpool won 2 – 1 and earnt a place in the final .

 = = = Stadium changes = = = 
 In October 2000 , Wembley Stadium , the final 's traditional venue , was closed in anticipation of major redevelopment . Having considered alternative venues such as Twickenham , Murrayfield and Villa Park , the FA announced in January 2001 that the next three Cup finals would be staged at Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium . This therefore marked the first time the showpiece event was held outside England . In the lead @-@ up to the final , FA chief executive Adam Crozier acknowledged concerns over transport and the quality of the pitch , adding : " We 've done a lot of work with Cardiff and hopefully it will be a great occasion , but we 'll take a view about how it 's worked after the final and decide whether to still hold the match there . " A new pitch was re @-@ laid in May , and the police made attempts to ease traffic on the M4 by opening three more turn @-@ offs than they did for the League Cup final .
