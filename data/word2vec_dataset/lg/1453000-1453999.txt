 Germany ( / <unk> / ; German : Deutschland , pronounced [ <unk> ] ) , officially the Federal Republic of Germany ( German : <unk> Deutschland , listen ) , is a sovereign state and federal parliamentary republic in central @-@ western Europe . It includes 16 constituent states , covers an area of 357 @,@ 021 square kilometres ( 137 @,@ 847 sq mi ) , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate . Its capital and largest city is Berlin . With about 81 @.@ 8 million inhabitants , Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union . After the United States , it is the second most popular human migration destination . 
 Various Germanic tribes have occupied the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD . During the Migration Period the Germanic tribes expanded southward . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . 
 In 1871 most of the German states unified into the Prussian @-@ dominated German Empire . After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918 – 1919 , the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic . The establishment of the national socialist dictatorship in 1933 led to World War II and systematic genocide . After a period of Allied occupation , two German states were founded : the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic . In 1990 , the country was reunified . 
 In the 21st century , Germany is a great power and has the world 's fourth @-@ largest economy by nominal GDP , as well as the fifth @-@ largest by PPP . As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors , it is both the world 's third @-@ largest exporter and importer of goods . Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society . It upholds a social security and universal health care system , environmental protection and a tuition @-@ free university education . 
 Germany was a founding member of the European Union in 1993 . It is part of the Schengen Area , and became a co @-@ founder of the Eurozone in 1999 . Germany is a member of the United Nations , NATO , the G8 , the G20 , and the OECD . The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world . Known for its rich cultural history , Germany has been continuously the home of influential artists , philosophers , musicians , sportspeople , entrepreneurs , scientists and inventors . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania , which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine . The German term Deutschland , originally <unk> land ( " the German lands " ) is derived from deutsch ( cf. dutch ) , descended from Old High German <unk> " popular " ( i.e. belonging to the <unk> or <unk> " people " ) , originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants . This in turn descends from Proto @-@ Germanic * <unk> " popular " ( see also the Latinised form <unk> ) , derived from * <unk> , descended from Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European * <unk> ₂ - " people " . 
 = = History = = 
 The discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600 @,@ 000 years ago . The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in <unk> where three 380 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old wooden javelins were unearthed . The <unk> Valley was the location where the first ever non @-@ modern human fossil was discovered ; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal . The Neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40 @,@ 000 years old . Evidence of modern humans , similarly dated , has been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm . The finds include 42 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found , the 40 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered , and the 35 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old Venus of <unk> Fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered . The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artifact created during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra , Saxony @-@ Anhalt . It is part of UNESCO 's Memory of the World Programme . 
 = = = Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire = = = 
 The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre @-@ Roman Iron Age . From southern Scandinavia and north Germany , they expanded south , east and west from the 1st century BC , coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian , Baltic , and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe . Under Augustus , Rome began to invade Germania ( an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains ) . In 9 AD , three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the <unk> leader Arminius . By 100 AD , when Tacitus wrote Germania , Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube ( the Limes Germanicus ) , occupying most of the area of modern Germany ; Austria , Baden Württemberg , southern Bavaria , southern Hessen and the western Rhineland , however , were Roman provinces . 
 In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged : Alemanni , Franks , Chatti , Saxons , Frisii , <unk> , and <unk> . Around 260 , the Germanic peoples broke into Roman @-@ controlled lands . After the invasion of the Huns in 375 , and with the decline of Rome from 395 , Germanic tribes moved further south @-@ west . Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced or absorbed smaller Germanic tribes . Large areas known since the Merovingian period as Austrasia , Neustria , and Aquitaine were conquered by the Franks who established the Frankish Kingdom , and pushed further east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria . Areas of what is today the eastern part of Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes of <unk> , Veleti and the <unk> confederation . 
 = = = East Francia and Holy Roman Empire = = = 
 In 800 , the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the Carolingian Empire , which was later divided in 843 among his heirs . Following the break up of the Frankish Realm , for 900 years , the history of Germany was intertwined with the history of the Holy Roman Empire , which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne 's original empire . The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps . 
 The Ottonian rulers ( 919 – 1024 ) consolidated several major duchies and the German king Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962 . In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope , appointed by his cousin Otto III , whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor . The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors ( 1024 – 1125 ) , although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy . 
 In the 12th century , under the Hohenstaufen emperors ( 1138 – 1254 ) , German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs ; they encouraged German settlement in these areas , called the eastern settlement movement ( <unk> ) . Members of the Hanseatic League , which included mostly north German cities and towns , prospered in the expansion of trade . In the south , the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation ( Große <unk> <unk> ) served a similar function . The edict of the Golden Bull issued in 1356 by Emperor Charles IV provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince @-@ electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics . 
 Population declined in the first half of the 14th century , starting with the Great Famine in 1315 , followed by the Black Death of 1348 – 50 . Despite the decline , however , German artists , engineers , and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city @-@ states as Venice , Florence and Genoa . Artistic and cultural centers throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son , and Albrecht Dürer . Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable @-@ type printing to Europe , a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses . 
 In 1517 , the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety @-@ Five Theses , challenging the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation . In 1555 , the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism , but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects , a principle called Cuius regio , eius religio . The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed : for example , the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler , such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583 . From the Cologne War until the end of the Thirty Years ' Wars ( 1618 – 1648 ) , religious conflict devastated German lands . The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 percent , and in some places , up to 80 percent . The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states . German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism , Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648 . 
 In the 18th century , the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1 @,@ 800 territories . The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms ( approximately 1450 – 1555 ) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical , secular , and hereditary states , reflected in Imperial Diet . The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740 . Having no male heirs , he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction . This was finally settled through the War of Austrian Succession ; in the Treaty of Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle , Maria Theresa 's husband became Holy Roman Emperor , and she ruled the Empire as Empress Consort . From 1740 , dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German states in the 18th century . As a consequence of the French Revolutionary Wars , and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet , most of the secular Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories ; the ecclesiastical territories were secularized and annexed . In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved ; German states , particularly the Rhineland states , fell under the influence of France . Until 1815 , France , Russia , Prussia and the Habsburgs competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars . 
 = = = German Confederation and Empire = = = 
 Following the fall of Napoleon , the Congress of Vienna ( convened in 1814 ) founded the German Confederation ( Deutscher Bund ) , a loose league of 39 sovereign states . The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress 's failure to accept Prussia 's influence among the German states , and <unk> the long @-@ standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests . Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements , followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich . The Zollverein , a tariff union , furthered economic unity in the German states . National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many , especially young , Germans . The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity , freedom and democracy . In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe , which established a republic in France , intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states . King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor , but with a loss of power ; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution , leading to a temporary setback for the movement . 
 King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Minister President of Prussia in 1862 . Bismarck successfully concluded war on Denmark in 1864 , which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula . The subsequent ( and decisive ) Prussian victory in the Austro @-@ Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation ( Norddeutscher Bund ) which excluded Austria from the federation 's affairs . After the French defeat in the Franco @-@ Prussian War , the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871 at Versailles , uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria . Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire ; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor , and Berlin became its capital . 
 In the <unk> period following the unification of Germany , Bismarck 's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany 's position as a great nation by forging alliances , isolating France by diplomatic means , and avoiding war . Under Wilhelm II , Germany , like other European powers , took an imperialistic course , leading to friction with neighbouring countries . Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed . This resulted in creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of Austria @-@ Hungary , promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support . Subsequently , the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy , completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German , Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and / or Russia . Similarly , Britain , France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France . 
 At the Berlin Conference in 1884 , Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa , German South @-@ West Africa , Togo , and Cameroon . Later , Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include German New Guinea , German Micronesia and German Samoa in the Pacific . In what became known as the " First Genocide of the Twentieth @-@ Century " , between 1904 and 1907 , the German colonial government in South @-@ West Africa ( present @-@ day Namibia ) ordered the annihilation of the local <unk> and Namaqua peoples , as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule . In total , around 100 @,@ 000 people — 80 % of the <unk> and 50 % of the Namaqua — perished form imprisonment in concentration camps , where the majority died of disease , abuse , and exhaustion , or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water . 
 The assassination of Austria 's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for the Austrian Empire to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare , in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed , a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 November , and German troops returned home . In the German Revolution ( November 1918 ) , Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities . Germany 's new political leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 . In this treaty , Germany , as part of the Central Powers , accepted defeat by the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time . Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler . After the defeat in the First World War , Germany lost around thirteen percent of its European territory ( totaling more than 27 @,@ 000 square miles ) and all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the South Sea . 
 = = = Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany = = = 
 Germany was declared a republic at the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918 . On 11 August 1919 President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution . In the subsequent struggle for power , the radical @-@ left Communists seized power in Bavaria , but conservative elements in other parts of Germany attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch . It was supported by parts of the Reichswehr ( military ) and other conservative , nationalistic and monarchist factions . After a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centers , the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 1922 – 23 , a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties , an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life . Underneath it all , though , lay a current of animosity and frustration over the Treaty of Versailles , widely perceived as a stab in the back , which provided the basis of much of the anti @-@ <unk> rife in the next two decades . The economic situation remained volatile . Historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of " partial stabilization . " The world @-@ wide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929 . After the federal election of 1930 , Chancellor Heinrich Brüning 's government was enabled by President Paul von Hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval . Brüning 's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30 % by 1932 . 
 The Nazi Party won the special federal election of 1932 . After a series of unsuccessful cabinets , Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 . After the Reichstag fire , a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened . The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power ; subsequently , his government established a centralised totalitarian state , withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum , and began military rearmament . 
 Using deficit spending , a government @-@ sponsored program for economic renewal focused on public works projects . In public work projects of 1934 , 1 @.@ 7 million Germans immediately were put to work , which gave them an income and social benefits . The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway , the <unk> , known as the German autobahns . Other capital construction projects included such hydroelectric facilities as the Rur Dam , such water supplies as <unk> Dam , and such transportation hubs as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof . Over the next five years , unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose . 
 In 1935 , the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities . Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935 , annexed Austria in 1938 , and occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1939 . 
 In August 1939 , Hitler 's government signed the Molotov – Ribbentrop pact with Stalin that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence . Following the agreement , on 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland , marking the beginning of World War II . In response to Hitler 's actions , Britain and France declared war on Germany . In the spring of 1940 , Germany conquered Denmark and Norway , the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , and France forcing the French government to sign an armistice after German troops occupied most of the country . The British repelled German air attacks in the same year . In 1941 , German troops invaded Yugoslavia , Greece and the Soviet Union . By 1942 , Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa , but following the Soviet Union 's victory at the Battle of Stalingrad , the allies ' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943 , German forces suffered repeated military defeats . In June 1944 , the Western allies landed in France and the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe . By late 1944 , the Western allies had entered Germany despite one final German counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest . Following Hitler 's suicide during the Battle of Berlin , German armed forces surrendered on 8 May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . 
 In what later became known as The Holocaust , the German government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across Europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior races . In total , over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered , including 6 million Jews , between 220 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 Romani , 275 @,@ 000 persons with disabilities , thousands of Jehovah 's Witnesses , thousands of homosexuals , and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition . Nazi policies in the German occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 2 @.@ 7 million Poles , 1 @.@ 3 million Ukrainians , and an estimated 2 @.@ 8 million Soviet war prisoners . German military war casualties were estimated at between 3 @.@ 2 million and 5 @.@ 3 million soldiers , and up to 2 million German civilians . German territorial losses resulted in the expulsion of circa 12 million of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe . Germany ceded roughly one @-@ quarter of its pre @-@ war territory . Strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites . After World War II , former members of the Nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials .

 After Germany surrendered , the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany 's remaining territory into four military occupation zones . The western sectors , controlled by France , the United Kingdom , and the United States , were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany ( <unk> Deutschland ) ; on 7 October 1949 , the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic ( Deutsche <unk> Republik ) . They were informally known as " West Germany " and " East Germany " . East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital , while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital , to emphasise its stance that the two @-@ state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo . 
 West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a " social market economy " . Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan and used this to rebuild its industry . Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor ( Bundeskanzler ) of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963 . Under his and Ludwig Erhard 's leadership , the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s , that became known as an " economic miracle " ( <unk> ) . West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957 . 
 East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact . Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy , political power was exercised solely by leading members ( Politbüro ) of the communist @-@ controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany , supported by the Stasi , an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society . A Soviet @-@ style command economy was set up and the GDR later became a Comecon state . While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR 's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion , many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity . The Berlin Wall , built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany , became a symbol of the Cold War . It was the site of Ronald Reagan 's " Mr. <unk> , Tear down this wall ! " speech of 12 June 1987 , which echoed John F. Kennedy 's famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech of 26 June 1963 . The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism , German Reunification and Die Wende . 
 Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt 's Ostpolitik . In summer 1989 , Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders , causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary . This had devastating effects on the GDR , where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support . The East German authorities eased the border restrictions , allowing East German citizens to travel to the West ; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state , the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process . This culminated in the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990 , under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender , and Germany regained full sovereignty . This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990 , with the accession of the five re @-@ established states of the former GDR . 
 = = = <unk> Germany and EU = = = 
 The united Germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state . As such , it retained all of West Germany 's memberships in international organizations . Based on the Berlin / Bonn Act , adopted in 1994 , Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany , while Bonn obtained the unique status of a <unk> ( federal city ) retaining some federal ministries . The relocation of the government was completed in 1999 . Following the 1998 elections , SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red – green coalition with the Alliance ' 90 / The Greens party . 
 The modernisation and integration of the eastern German economy is a long @-@ term process scheduled to last until the year 2019 , with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $ 80 billion . 
 Since reunification , Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union . Together with its European partners Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 , established the Eurozone in 1999 , and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 . Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban . These deployments were controversial since Germany was bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles . 
 In the 2005 elections , Angela Merkel became the first female Chancellor of Germany as the leader of a grand coalition . In 2009 the German government approved a € 50 billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn . 
 In 2009 , a liberal @-@ conservative coalition under Merkel assumed leadership of the country . In 2013 , a grand coalition was established in a Third Merkel cabinet . Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration , the energy transition ( Energiewende ) for a sustainable energy supply , the " Debt Brake " for balanced budgets , measures to increase the fertility rate significantly ( <unk> ) , and high @-@ tech strategies for the future transition of the German economy , summarized as Industry 4 @.@ 0 . 
 Germany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for most migrants entering the EU . The country took in over a million refugees and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Germany is in Western and Central Europe , with Denmark bordering to the north , Poland and the Czech Republic to the east , Austria to the southeast , Switzerland to the south @-@ southwest , France , Luxembourg and Belgium lie to the west , and the Netherlands to the northwest . It lies mostly between latitudes 47 ° and 55 ° N and longitudes 5 ° and 16 ° E. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and , at the north @-@ northeast , by the Baltic Sea . With Switzerland and Austria , Germany also shares a border on the fresh @-@ water Lake Constance , the third largest lake in Central Europe . German territory covers 357 @,@ 021 km2 ( 137 @,@ 847 sq mi ) , consisting of 349 @,@ 223 km2 ( 134 @,@ 836 sq mi ) of land and 7 @,@ 798 km2 ( 3 @,@ 011 sq mi ) of water . It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 62nd largest in the world . 
 Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps ( highest point : the Zugspitze at 2 @,@ 962 metres or 9 @,@ 718 feet ) in the south to the shores of the North Sea ( <unk> ) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea ( Ostsee ) in the northeast . The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany ( lowest point : <unk> at 3 @.@ 54 metres or 11 @.@ 6 feet below sea level ) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine , Danube and Elbe . Germany 's alpine glaciers are experiencing deglaciation . Significant natural resources include iron ore , coal , potash , timber , lignite , uranium , copper , natural gas , salt , nickel , arable land and water . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Most of Germany has a temperate seasonal climate dominated by humid westerly winds . The country is situated in between the oceanic Western European and the continental Eastern European climate . The climate is moderated by the North Atlantic Drift , the northern extension of the Gulf Stream . This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea ; consequently in the northwest and the north the climate is oceanic . Germany gets an average of 789 mm ( 31 in ) of precipitation per year ; there is no consistent dry season . Winters are mild and summers tend to be warm : temperatures can exceed 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) . 
 The east has a more continental climate : winters can be very cold and summers very warm , and longer dry periods can occur . Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental . In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country , the Alpine regions in the extreme south and , to a lesser degree , some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate , with lower temperatures and more precipitation . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two ecoregions : European @-@ Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast @-@ Atlantic shelf marine . As of 2008 the majority of Germany is covered by either arable land ( 34 % ) or forest and woodland ( 30 @.@ 1 % ) ; only 13 @.@ 4 % of the area consists of permanent pastures , 11 @.@ 8 % is covered by settlements and streets . 
 Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe . Beeches , oaks , and other deciduous trees constitute one @-@ third of the forests ; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation . Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains , while pine and larch are found in sandy soil . There are many species of ferns , flowers , fungi , and mosses . Wild animals include roe deer , wild boar , mouflon ( a subspecies of wild sheep ) , fox , badger , hare , and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver . The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol . 
 The 14 national parks in Germany include the <unk> National Park , the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park , the <unk> National Park , the Wadden Sea National Parks , the Harz National Park , the <unk> National Park , the Black Forest National Park , the Saxon Switzerland National Park , the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park . In addition , there are 14 Biosphere Reserves , as well as 98 nature parks . More than 400 registered zoos and animal parks operate in Germany , which is believed to be the largest number in any country . The Berlin Zoo , opened in 1844 , is the oldest zoo in Germany , and presents the most comprehensive collection of species in the world .

 Germany has a number of large cities . There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions in Germany . 34 cities have been identified as <unk> . The largest conurbation is the Rhine @-@ Ruhr region ( 11 @.@ 7 million in 2008 ) , including Düsseldorf ( the capital of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia ) , Cologne , Bonn , Dortmund , Essen , Duisburg , and Bochum . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Germany is a federal , parliamentary , representative democratic republic . The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the <unk> ( Basic Law ) . Amendments generally require a two @-@ thirds majority of both chambers of parliament ; the fundamental principles of the constitution , as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity , the separation of powers , the federal structure , and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity . 
 The president , Joachim Gauck ( 18 March 2012 – present ) , is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers . He is elected by the <unk> ( federal convention ) , an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates . The second @-@ highest official in the German order of precedence is the <unk> ( President of the Bundestag ) , who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body . The third @-@ highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor , who is appointed by the <unk> after being elected by the Bundestag . 
 The chancellor , Angela Merkel ( 22 November 2005 – present ) , is the head of government and exercises executive power , similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies . Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag ( Federal Diet ) and Bundesrat ( Federal Council ) , which together form the legislative body . The Bundestag is elected through direct elections , by proportional representation ( mixed @-@ member ) . The members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets . 
 Since 1949 , the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany . So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties . However , the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party ( in parliament from 1949 to 2013 ) and the Alliance ' 90 / The Greens ( in parliament since 1983 ) have also played important roles . 
 The debt @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio of Germany had its peak in 2010 when it stood at 80 @.@ 3 % and decreased since then . According to Eurostat , the government gross debt of Germany amounts to € 2 @,@ 152 @.@ 0 billion or 71 @.@ 9 % of its GDP in 2015 . The federal government achieved a budget surplus of € 12 @.@ 1 billion ( $ 13 @.@ 1 billion ) in 2015 . Germany 's credit rating by credit rating agencies Standard & Poor 's , Moody 's and Fitch Ratings stands at the highest possible rating AAA with a stable outlook in 2016 . 
 = = = Law = = = 
 Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law . The <unk> ( Federal Constitutional Court ) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters , with power of judicial review . Germany 's supreme court system , called <unk> <unk> des <unk> , is specialised : for civil and criminal cases , the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice , and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court , the Federal Social Court , the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court . 
 Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> respectively . The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public . Except for petty crimes , which are tried before a single professional judge , and serious political crimes , all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges ( <unk> ) sit side by side with professional judges . Many of the fundamental matters of administrative law remain in the jurisdiction of the states . 
 = = = Constituent states = = = 
 Germany comprises sixteen federal states which are collectively referred to as <unk> . Each state has its own state constitution and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation . Because of differences in size and population the subdivisions of these states vary , especially as between city states ( <unk> ) and states with larger territories ( <unk> ) . For regional administrative purposes five states , namely Baden @-@ Württemberg , Bavaria , Hesse , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia and Saxony , consist of a total of 22 Government Districts ( <unk> ) . As of 2013 Germany is divided into 402 districts ( <unk> ) at a municipal level ; these consist of 295 rural districts and 107 urban districts . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad and maintains relations with more than 190 countries . As of 2011 it is the largest contributor to the budget of the European Union ( providing 20 % ) and the third largest contributor to the UN ( providing 8 % ) . Germany is a member of NATO , the OECD , the G8 , the G20 , the World Bank and the IMF . It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighboring countries since 1990 . Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political , economic and security apparatus . 
 The development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy . It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations . The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community . It is the world 's third biggest aid donor in 2009 after the United States and France . 
 In 1999 , Chancellor Gerhard Schröder 's government defined a new basis for German foreign policy by taking part in the NATO decisions surrounding the Kosovo War and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since 1945 . The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies . Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in <unk> . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 Germany 's military , the Bundeswehr , is organised into Heer ( Army and special forces <unk> ) , Marine ( Navy ) , Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) , Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service and <unk> ( Joint Support Service ) branches . In absolute terms , German military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world . In 2015 , military spending was at € 32 @.@ 9 billion , about 1 @.@ 2 % of the country 's GDP , well below the NATO target of 2 % . 
 As of December 2015 the Bundeswehr employed roughly 178 @,@ 000 service members , including 9 @,@ 500 volunteers . Reservists are available to the Armed Forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad . Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction . About 19 @,@ 000 female soldiers are on active duty . According to SIPRI , Germany was the fourth largest exporter of major arms in the world in 2014 . 
 In peacetime , the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence . In state of defence , the Chancellor would become commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Bundeswehr . 
 The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only . But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term " defense " has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany , but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention , or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world . As of January 2015 , the German military has about 2 @,@ 370 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces , including about 850 Bundeswehr troops in the NATO @-@ led ISAF force in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan , 670 German soldiers in Kosovo , and 120 troops with <unk> in Lebanon . 
 Until 2011 , military service was compulsory for men at age 18 , and conscripts served six @-@ month tours of duty ; conscientious objectors could instead opt for an equal length of <unk> ( civilian service ) , or a six @-@ year commitment to ( voluntary ) emergency services like a fire department or the Red Cross .

Germany is committed to the Kyoto protocol and several other treaties promoting biodiversity , low emission standards , water management , and the renewable energy commercialisation . The country 's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world — at around 65 % . Nevertheless , the country 's greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in the EU in 2010 . The German energy transition ( Energiewende ) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy . 
 = = = Science and technology = = = 
 Germany 's achievements in the sciences have been significant , and research and development efforts form an integral part of the economy . The Nobel Prize has been awarded to 104 German laureates . In the beginning of the 20th century , German laureates had more awards than those of any other nation , especially in the sciences ( physics , chemistry , and physiology or medicine ) . 
 Notable German physicists before the 20th century include Hermann von Helmholtz , Joseph von Fraunhofer and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit , among others . Albert Einstein introduced the relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively . Along with Max Planck , he was instrumental in the introduction of quantum mechanics , in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions . Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X @-@ rays . Otto Hahn was a pioneer in the fields of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission , while Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch were founders of microbiology . Numerous mathematicians were born in Germany , including Carl Friedrich Gauss , David Hilbert , Bernhard Riemann , Gottfried Leibniz , Karl Weierstrass , Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein . 
 Germany has been the home of many famous inventors and engineers , including Hans Geiger , the creator of the Geiger counter ; and Konrad Zuse , who built the first fully automatic digital computer . Such German inventors , engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin , Otto Lilienthal , Gottlieb Daimler , Rudolf Diesel , Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology . German institutions like the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) are the largest contributor to ESA . Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket . Heinrich Rudolf Hertz 's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication . 
 Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society , the Helmholtz Association and the Fraunhofer Society . The <unk> 7 @-@ X in Greifswald hosts a facility in the research of fusion power for instance . The Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize is granted to ten scientists and academics every year .

However , Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s , particularly a rise in the number of well @-@ educated migrants . 
 Four sizable groups of people are referred to as " national minorities " because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries . There is a Danish minority ( about 50 @,@ 000 ) in the northernmost state of Schleswig @-@ Holstein .

 In 2014 , about seven million of Germany 's 81 million residents did not have German citizenship . Ninety @-@ six percent of these people lived in western Germany and mostly in urban areas . 
 In the 1960s and 1970s , the German governments invited " guest workers " ( <unk> ) to migrate to Germany for work in the German industries . Many companies preferred to keep these workers employed in Germany after they had trained them and Germany 's immigrant population has steadily increased . As of 2011 , about six million foreign citizens ( 7 @.@ 7 % of the population ) were registered in Germany . 
 The Federal Statistical Office classifies the citizens by immigrant background . Regarding immigrant background , 20 % of the country 's residents , or more than 16 million people , were of immigrant or partially immigrant descent in 2009 ( including persons descending or partially descending from ethnic German repatriates ) . In 2010 , 29 % of families with children under 18 had at least one parent with immigrant roots . 
 In 2015 , the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second @-@ highest number of international migrants worldwide , about 5 % or 12 million of all 244 million migrants .

 Since its foundation in 1871 , Germany has been about two @-@ thirds Protestant and one @-@ third Roman Catholic , with a notable Jewish minority . Other faiths were also present , but to a much lesser degree . The religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945 , with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies . It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990 . 
 According to the 2011 German Census , Christianity is the largest religion in Germany , claiming 66 @.@ 8 % of the total population .

 The main leading rivalry leading into the event was between the Raw and SmackDown brands as a whole , rather than individual wrestlers . The rivalry began on " WWE Homecoming , a special episode of Raw on October 3 when Raw 's general manager Eric Bischoff stopped a match involving SmackDown wrestlers by turning the lights off . In return , Bischoff 's SmackDown counterpart , Theodore Long , interrupted a Raw match . As a result , wrestlers from the two brands started a brawl and interfered in the other 's show before facing each other in a tag team match at Taboo Tuesday ; SmackDown 's Rey Mysterio , Jr. and Matt Hardy defeated Raw 's Chris Masters and Gene Snitsky . After Taboo Tuesday , Bischoff and Long agreed that teams from each brand would face each other in a 5 @-@ on @-@ 5 Survivor Series match , while the two managers would wrestle in a singles match at Survivor Series . The teams feuded on both shows , and Batista , the captain of the SmackDown team , suffered an injury after being attacked several times . Eddie Guerrero was originally scheduled to be on Team SmackDown , but due to his death on November 13 , 2005 , he was replaced by Randy Orton . 
 Another rivalry heading into the event was between John Cena and Kurt Angle , over the WWE Championship . Their feud began in August , when Bischoff chose Angle as the number one contender to the WWE Championship . Angle failed to win the title at Unforgiven , due to Cena being disqualified . The two squared off against each other again at Taboo Tuesday in a Triple Threat match that also included Shawn Michaels , and again Cena retained the title . On the November 7 edition of Raw , Angle refused to compete in a tag team match pitting him and Chris Masters against Cena and Michaels due to the " you suck " chants from the audience . Angle finally agreed to compete if Bischoff silenced the crowd and let him have a special guest referee . Angle chose Daivari , who favoured Angle and Masters throughout the match and ultimately disqualified Cena and Michaels for using a chair , which he had ignored earlier when it had been used by Masters . 
 The rivalry between Triple H and Ric Flair began at WWE Homecoming , when Triple H returned to WWE television after an absence of three months . The two had been aligned since 2002 , as members of Evolution , and were partners in a tag team match on the show . After they won the match , Triple H attacked Flair with a sledgehammer . The week after , Triple H explained his actions , saying that he realized Flair was no longer the legend he was , and he needed to stop Flair . Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday , which Flair won . A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series .

Triple H then hit Flair in the back with a sledgehammer , and Flair did not get to his feet before the referee 's ten count , giving Triple H the win . After the match , Edge and Lita came into the ring , and Edge announced that he would be hosting a new show on Raw entitled " The Cutting Edge " . Edge noted that Dmitri Young was in the audience , and proceeded to criticize the sports teams of Detroit . Young replied by insulting Edge and his lack of a world championship . 
 The fourth match saw John Cena defending the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle , with Daivari as the special guest referee . Early in the match , Angle was able to apply the Ankle lock on Cena . Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off . An angered Cena slapped Daivari , who tried to disqualify him as a result . Angle , however , stopped him , and both men were knocked out of the ring by Cena . As Daivari was knocked down outside , a Raw referee came out to officiate . After Cena gained the advantage , Angle knocked down the referee , and executed an illegal low blow .

 Due to the large interest in the group , the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them . Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase , all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from , amongst others , Victoria Beckham 's father , Anthony Adams . In March 1995 , because of the group 's frustration at their management 's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas , they parted from Heart Management . In order to ensure they kept control of their own work , the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices . The next week they were supposed to meet with Sheffield @-@ based producer Eliot Kennedy . The Herberts arranged the session weeks before the group 's departure . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 Without access to Herbert 's address book , the group knew nothing of Kennedy 's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield . Melanie Brown and Geri Halliwell drove to Sheffield the day after the departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across , Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called . That evening they went to his house and persuade him to work with them , the rest of the group travelled to Sheffield the next day . Kennedy commented about the session : 
 None of them played instruments , so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together . What I said to them was , ' Look , I 've got a chorus — check this out ' . And I 'd sing them the chorus and the melody — no lyrics or anything — and straight away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us . Ten minutes later the song was written . Then you go through and refine it . Then later , as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there . But pretty much it was a real quick process . They were confident in what they were doing , throwing it out there . 
 The group stayed at Kennedy 's house for the most part of the week . He named his studio Spice , after the group , because it had never been used before . Together , they composed two songs in the session : " Love Thing " and " Say You 'll Be There " . Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins — the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute — produced the song and recorded it for the most part at Olympic Studios in Barnes , London . At first , discussions were made about what song the group would release as their second single , originally it was going to be " Love Thing " , but in the end they decided to change it for " Say You 'll Be There " . 
 In December 1996 , while charting across Europe , " Say You 'll Be There " became the focus of a controversy when the Israeli soldier <unk> <unk> accused the group of copying her song " Bo <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> , " Come to me " ) , a highly similar song released two years earlier in Israel . <unk> hired lawyers and threatened to sue . A spokesman of the group later declared : " Where there 's a hit , there 's a writ . There 's always someone who crawls out of the woodwork claiming to have written a hit song . We look forward to seeing her in court . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Say You 'll Be There " is a mid @-@ tempo dance @-@ pop song , with influences from G @-@ funk and R & B. It is written in the key of D ♭ major , with a time signature set on common time , and moves at a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute . The song is constructed in a verse @-@ chorus form . It uses the sequence B ♭ m – E ♭ – G ♭ m – D ♭ as its chord progression during the verses and the chorus . The third verse includes an instrumental solo , that closes with a coda , which consists in the group singing the chorus repeatedly until the song gradually fades out , while Melanie Chisholm adds the high harmony . Absolute played the instruments , except for the harmonica , which was played by Judd Lander , who also played it on Culture Club 's " Karma Chameleon " . 
 The lyrics , according to Brown are about relationships , and to be there for each other . That it does not matter to say merely that you love them , the only thing that they care is that their lover give his promise that he will be there for them whenever they need him . In " Say You 'll Be There " , the group exuded a brash confidence that was attractive to their teenage and young adult fans . The Spice Girls decide to be friends , not lovers , the clear message is that the relationship can be channelled and controlled by the girl , with an emphasis on stating where they come from and what they stand for .

 The song received mixed reviews , some critics praised " Say You 'll Be There " as a catchy song , others dubbed it as merely a bid for credibility . Dele Fadele of the NME said that it is " another monstrously catchy tune from the fledging pop starlets " , and called it " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pop music for ' 96 " . Time magazine 's Christopher John Farley commented that the song 's " groove is penetrating , but the whole thing sounds suspiciously like an Earth , Wind and Fire song that 's just on the tip of one 's tongue " . Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch commented that the song " is a harmless , mid @-@ tempo foot @-@ tapper that will work just fine on Top 40 radio " . Edna Gundersen of the USA Today said that Spice " is assembly @-@ line dance @-@ pop " , adding that " only the funky ' Say You 'll Be There ' and touchingly cornball ' Mama ' hint at depth " . Steve Dollar of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution said of the song " it 's all pure confection more sugar really than spice " , adding that it " even includes a <unk> harmonica solo among other obvious sources " . 
 Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that their first album " is a compendium of slick secondhand urban pop encompassing [ ... ] G @-@ funk synths on ' Say You 'll Be There ' [ ... ] and Babyface 's guitar and strings balladry on ' 2 Become 1 ' " . Larry Flick of Billboard magazine compared it to " Wannabe " saying that it " is as immediately infectious , though it 's not nearly as silly and novelty @-@ driven " . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the song " a bid for street cred " , while David Browne from the same magazine commented about the confusing lyrics , " let 's see : She wants to be friends , he wants more , and yet she croons , ' I 'm giving you everything / All that joy can bring ' ? She 's as confused as I am . Better to revel in the delectably frothy girl @-@ group melody " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic , in a review of their debut album Spice , said that " what is surprising is how the sultry soul of ' Say You 'll Be There ' is more than just a guilty pleasure " . In a review of the group 's 2007 compilation album Greatest Hits , NME said that it is a " fine song in any age " .

The shots of male bondage are unexplained , and function as symbols of male disempowerment , just as the rest of the clip serves to assert the power and fighting abilities of the women . At the end the group captures a confused <unk> man who appears in his pick @-@ up truck . He is carried off on the roof of the car as a trophy . Another man with a cowboy hat is also captured and tied to his car . An alternate version of the video exists that removes the male bondage shots and replaces them with unseen shots of the girls .

Mullen turned to coaching in 2000 , serving as an assistant in Pittsburgh and briefly as head coach of the Wilkes @-@ Barre / Scranton Penguins . He is currently an assistant with the Philadelphia Flyers . 
 An undrafted player , Mullen was an all @-@ star for the Boston College Eagles before turning professional in the Blues ' organization . He was named the Central Hockey League ( CHL ) rookie of the year in 1980 and most valuable player in 1981 as a member of the Salt Lake Golden Eagles . He won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL 's most gentlemanly player on two occasions as a member of the Flames , as well as the NHL Plus @-@ Minus Award . Mullen was named to the First All @-@ Star Team in 1988 – 89 and played in three NHL All @-@ Star Games . 
 Mullen played with the United States National Team on several occasions , including three Canada Cup tournaments . He was the first American player to score 500 goals and to reach 1 @,@ 000 points in his career .

He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2000 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born February 26 , 1957 , in New York City , New York , Mullen grew up in the Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan when it was controlled by the Gambino crime family . It was a rough neighborhood ; Mullen later said that many of the people he grew up with fell into gangs and drug use , and several died before turning 21 . He has three brothers , Ken , Tom Jr. and Brian , and a sister , Debbie . 
 The Mullen family lived less than a block from Madison Square Garden , where Joe 's father Tom was a longtime employee on the ice and maintenance staffs . Joe and his brothers often hung around the arena with their father , taking old sticks to play with . He began playing roller hockey at the age of five , playing in a concrete schoolyard and using a sanded down roll of electrical tape as a puck . The boys ' schoolyard games served as a partial inspiration for New York Rangers ' general manager , Emile Francis , to create the Metropolitan Junior Hockey Association in 1966 . Mullen did not learn to ice skate until he was ten years old , but at the age of 14 joined the Metropolitan association as one of the league 's youngest players . Mullen played four seasons in the league between 1971 and 1975 . He scored 71 goals in 1973 – 74 , then 182 points in 40 games the following season . Mullen 's 110 goals in 1974 – 75 was 52 more than his nearest competitor . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = College = = = 
 Boston College offered Mullen a partial scholarship for the 1975 – 76 season to attend and play for the Eagles hockey program . He paid $ 700 out of his own pocket in the first year , but after scoring 34 points in 24 games as a freshman , the school gave him a full scholarship . Including tournament games , he led the Eagles in goals the following three seasons with 39 , 38 and 30 respectively , and points in 1977 – 78 with 68 and in 1978 – 79 with 56 . Mullen led the Eagles to the Eastern College Athletic Conference ( ECAC ) championship in 1977 – 78 , and was named an all @-@ star of the 1978 National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) tournament . He scored a goal in the championship game , but the Eagles lost to cross @-@ town rival Boston University , 5 – 3 . 
 In four seasons with Boston College , Mullen set school records of 110 goals and 212 points ( both subsequently broken ) . He was named to the All @-@ ECAC , All @-@ New England and NCAA All @-@ American teams in 1978 and 1979 . He won the Walter Brown Award in 1978 as the top American @-@ born player in New England , and was the team captain in 1978 – 79 . Boston College has twice honored Mullen ; He was inducted into the school 's Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1998 , while the hockey program retired his jersey number 21 the following year . 
 = = = St. Louis Blues = = = 
 While Mullen had a successful college career , he went undrafted by any National Hockey League ( NHL ) team . His small stature , coupled with a general bias against American players at the time , especially from non @-@ traditional development areas , contributed to his failure to be selected . However , he received interest as a free agent from several teams following graduation as well as the United States Olympic Team . He passed up the opportunity to play in the 1980 Winter Olympics and signed with the St. Louis Blues on August 16 , 1979 . The Blues assigned Mullen to their Central Hockey League ( CHL ) affiliate , the Salt Lake Golden Eagles for the 1979 – 80 season . In 75 games with the Golden Eagles , Mullen scored 40 goals and 72 points . He was named to the CHL 's second all @-@ star team and was voted rookie of the year . He made his NHL debut in the 1980 Stanley Cup Playoffs , appearing in one game for the Blues . 
 Mullen returned to Salt Lake for the 1980 – 81 season where he scored 59 goals and led the league with 117 points . He was named to the first all @-@ star team and won the CHL 's Most Valuable Player Award . Opening the 1981 – 82 season with Salt Lake , Mullen had 21 goals in 27 games before he was recalled to St. Louis . He scored his first two NHL goals on January 5 , 1981 , against the Minnesota North Stars . They came eight seconds apart and set a Blues ' franchise record for fastest two goals by one player . Mullen scored 25 goals for the Blues that season and became the first player in history to score at least 20 goals in both the minor leagues and the NHL in the same season . 
 Injuries reduced Mullen to 49 games with the Blues in 1982 – 83 , but he still scored 47 points . His 41 goals in 1983 – 84 set a record as the most scored by an American @-@ born player in NHL history ( broken by Bobby Carpenter the following season ) . He again reached the 40 @-@ goal plateau in 1984 – 85 , and had 92 points total . He missed the first three days of the Blues ' training camp prior to the 1985 – 86 season in a contract dispute before agreeing to a one @-@ year deal . On February 1 , 1986 , the Blues dealt him to the Calgary Flames as part of a six player trade . Mullen went to Calgary , along with Terry Johnson and Rik Wilson , for Eddy Beers , Charlie Bourgeois and Gino <unk> . 
 = = = Calgary Flames = = = 
 The Flames felt they needed a quality offensive player and expected Mullen to fulfill that role . As it was the first time in his career he had been traded , Mullen was initially upset at the move . He was awed by the reaction he received from fans in Calgary however ; fans greeted him warmly even as his flight landed to arrive in the city . Mullen described the experience as being " almost like ... an instant celebrity " . He quickly established himself as a fan favorite , scoring 38 points in 29 games to end the regular season . He then led the league with 12 goals in the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs . The Flames reached the final for the first time in franchise history , but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games . Mullen set a personal best of 47 goals in his first full year in Calgary , 1986 – 87 , and with only 14 penalty minutes on the season , was voted the winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL 's most gentlemanly player . 
 Mullen 's 40 goals in 1987 – 88 was the fifth consecutive season he reached that total . He won his first of three consecutive Molson Cups as the Flames player with the most three star selections during the season . 1988 – 89 was Mullen 's best season in the NHL . He reached the 50 goal and 100 point milestones , leading the Flames with 51 and 110 respectively , and won his second Lady Byng Memorial Trophy . He was named a First @-@ Team All @-@ Star at right wing and won the Plus @-@ Minus Award at + 51 . Additionally , he played in his first NHL All @-@ Star Game , appearing opposite his brother Brian . He led the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs with 16 goals as the Flames defeated the Canadiens to win their first Stanley Cup championship . 
 Though he played in his second All @-@ Star Game in 1990 , Mullen 's production fell by 41 points , to 69 , and he failed to score at least 40 goals for the first time in six seasons . Concerned about his age , the Flames chose to trade the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Mullen following the season . He was sent to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a draft day trade on June 16 , 1990 , in exchange for Pittsburgh 's second round selection . 
 = = = Pittsburgh and Boston = = = 
 The move to Pittsburgh brought Mullen closer to his New York home and fulfilled his desire to raise his family in his native United States . He also appreciated that the Penguins felt he could aid their team . Penguins ' coach Bob Johnson , who had previously coached him in Calgary , influenced the team 's decision to acquire him . Mullen played only 47 games in 1990 – 91 , scoring 17 goals and 39 points . He missed the last two months of the regular season after having surgery to remove a herniated disc in his back , an injury for which he could not identify a specific check or incident as the cause . He returned for the third game of the Penguins ' first @-@ round playoff series against the New Jersey Devils , scoring a goal . Mullen finished the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs with eight goals , including two in game six of the final , an 8 – 0 victory over the Minnesota North Stars that clinched Pittsburgh 's first Stanley Cup . 
 Healthy throughout the 1991 – 92 season , Mullen rebounded offensively to score 42 goals and 87 points in 77 games . Midway through the season , he became the first player in Penguins ' history to have consecutive four @-@ goal games , doing so against the New York Islanders on December 23 , 1991 , and the Toronto Maple Leafs three days later . He appeared in only nine playoff games , however , as he suffered a knee injury that required surgery to repair in the second game of Pittsburgh 's second @-@ round series against the New York Rangers . Mullen watched from the sidelines as the Penguins repeated as Stanley Cup champions . 
 Mullen tested free agency prior to the 1992 – 93 season , but ultimately chose to remain with the Penguins . He missed the first month of the season while recovering from his knee surgery , but finished the season with 33 goals and 70 points in 72 games . He added 6 points in 12 playoff games , but the Penguins ' attempt at a third consecutive championship ended with a second @-@ round loss to the New York Islanders . A 38 @-@ goal season in 1993 – 94 led to Mullen 's third All @-@ Star Game appearance . The game was a homecoming of sorts for Mullen , as it was played in Madison Square Garden . 
 In the lockout @-@ shortened 1994 – 95 season , Mullen scored 37 points in 45 games . He scored the 1,000th point of his career with a pair of assists on February 7 , 1995 , in a 7 – 3 victory over the Florida Panthers . He left the Penguins following the season , signing a one @-@ year contract as a free agent with the Boston Bruins . He missed the majority of the season after requiring surgery for another herniated disc , then suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament . He appeared in only 37 games , scoring 15 points . 
 Mullen rejoined the Penguins for the 1996 – 97 season , signing a one @-@ year contract . He appeared in 54 games and scored 22 points . He scored his 500th career goal on March 14 , 1997 , in a 6 – 3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche . He retired as a player following the season .

 Mullen made his first appearance with the United States National Team following his graduation from Boston College . He appeared in eight games at the 1979 World Ice Hockey Championships , scoring seven goals and adding an assist for the seventh place Americans . He was a member of three Canada Cup teams , appearing at the 1984 , 1987 and 1991 tournaments . He scored two goals in the 1991 tournament , both of which came in a 7 – 3 semi @-@ final victory over Finland that led the United States into their first tournament final . The Americans settled for second place , however , after losing to Canada in the championship series . 
 At the age of 41 , Mullen emerged from retirement to join the Americans for a qualifying tournament leading into the 1999 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships . The United States had a disastrous 12th @-@ place finish in the 1998 tournament , requiring them to go into a qualifying round to avoid relegation to the B division for 1999 . As the qualifying tournament was played in November , American NHL players were not available . Mullen recorded three assists in three games , and helped the Americans stay in the top division for the 1999 tournament .

 Mullen arrived in the NHL possessing great balance on his skates , an ability his teammates and coaches believed he gained from playing roller hockey . His coaches praised his willingness to play in the difficult areas of the ice , even though he stood only five foot nine inches tall and knew he would have to take a hit to make a play . Penguins ' play @-@ by @-@ play announcer Mike Lange nicknamed Mullen " Slippery Rock Joe " for his ability to evade opposing players .

He was retained by the organization , however , and named interim head coach of the Wilkes @-@ Barre / Scranton Penguins for the remainder of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) season . In 52 games , Mullen achieved a record of 28 wins , 16 losses , 3 ties and 5 overtime losses . The Penguins chose not to retain Mullen following the season .

 = History of the New York Jets = 
 The history of the New York Jets American football team began in 1959 with the founding of the Titans of New York , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) . The team had little success in its early years . After playing three seasons at the Polo Grounds , the team changed its name to the Jets , and moved into newly built Shea Stadium in 1964 . In January 1965 , the Jets signed University of Alabama quarterback Joe Namath to a then @-@ record contract . The team showed gradual improvement in the late 1960s , posting its first winning record in 1967 and winning its only American Football League championship in 1968 . By winning the title , New York earned the right to play in Super Bowl III against the champions of the National Football League ( NFL ) , the Baltimore Colts . The Jets defeated the Colts in the game ; in the aftermath of the upset , the AFL was deemed a worthy partner to the NFL as the two leagues merged . 
 Following the merger , the Jets fell into mediocrity ; Namath was dogged by injuries through much of his later career . In 1981 , New York qualified for the playoffs for the first time in the post @-@ Namath era . They reached the AFC Championship Game in 1982 ; they were defeated on a rain @-@ soaked Orange Bowl field by the Miami Dolphins . Beginning with the 1984 season , the team played in New Jersey 's Giants Stadium . The team started the 1986 season with a 10 – 1 record , but the injury @-@ plagued Jets lost their last five regular season games and relinquished a ten @-@ point fourth quarter lead to lose in double overtime to the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs . 
 In the following eleven seasons , New York had limited success , reaching the playoffs only once and enduring a string of disastrous seasons , including a 1 – 15 record in 1996 . The following year , the Jets hired two @-@ time Super Bowl winning coach Bill Parcells . The new coach guided the team to its most successful season since the merger in 1998 ; the Jets finished 12 – 4 and reached the AFC Championship Game , in which they fell to the Denver Broncos . The team made five playoff appearances in the 2000s , their most of any decade . In 2009 and 2010 , the Jets achieved back @-@ to @-@ back appearances in the AFC Championship Game , losing to the Indianapolis Colts and Pittsburgh Steelers . In 2010 , the team began to play in MetLife Stadium , constructed near the now @-@ demolished Giants Stadium .

 In 1959 , young oilmen Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams sought a National Football League franchise . They found that NFL expansion required a unanimous vote of existing team owners , so there was little likelihood of convincing the NFL to expand . The two men attempted to acquire the Chicago Cardinals , intending to move the franchise to Dallas , where there was no NFL team . Cardinals co @-@ owner Walter Wolfner , who owned the team with his wife , Violet <unk> Wolfner , was unwilling to sell majority control . During the discussions , Walter Wolfner mentioned the names of other wealthy bidders seeking to acquire the Cardinals . On the flight home , Hunt and Adams decided to recruit the other bidders as owners of teams in a new professional football league . 
 New York City attorney William Shea was attempting to create the Continental League , a rival league to Major League Baseball . Hunt met with him , and Shea suggested Harry Wismer , a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions , as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league . Wismer was willing ; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins ' principal owner , George Preston Marshall , and realized he would never own the Washington franchise . Wismer , while wealthy , was not nearly as rich as the other potential team owners . 
 On August 14 , 1959 , the league held an organizational meeting and announced its plans ; eight days later it announced its name : the American Football League ( AFL ) , the fourth league to take that name . On November 24 , 1959 , the AFL held its first draft ; the " Titans of New York " , as the franchise awarded to Wismer was dubbed , selected Notre Dame quarterback George <unk> as their first pick . The league announced a policy , formulated by Wismer , that it would negotiate with a network for a single television contract to cover all the teams , the first league to do so . On December 7 , the Titans hired Steve Sebo as general manager . Sebo had just been fired as coach at the University of Pennsylvania , despite taking the Quakers to the Ivy League championship . On December 17 , the Titans announced at a press conference that " one of the biggest names in the history of football " would be soon be named as their head coach . Although Wismer was prone to hyperbole , in this case he told the truth : New York had persuaded a former NFL great , quarterback and punter Sammy Baugh , to be its coach . Since his retirement as a player , Baugh had coached at tiny Hardin @-@ Simmons University , where he built a strong football program that sent a team to the 1958 Sun Bowl . Before appearing at the press conference , Baugh demanded his entire salary of $ 20 @,@ 000 for 1960 , in cash . The Titans accommodated him . 
 Wismer sought a place for his team to play , but was only able to secure the decrepit Polo Grounds , which had been without a major tenant since the departure of the New York Giants baseball team in 1957 . The stadium stood on the northern tip of Manhattan , across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium , where the New York Giants NFL team played . 
 Baugh invited some 100 players to the Titans ' first training camp , which opened at the University of New Hampshire on July 9 , 1960 . As NFL teams cut players from their training camps , many were invited to the Titans ' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35 @-@ man rosters . The franchise 's first preseason game took place on August 6 , 1960 , against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . The Titans kicked off to begin the game , and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105 yards for a touchdown . New York lost , 27 – 7 . On September 11 , 1960 , the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour , the remains of Hurricane Diana . Water poured off Coogan 's Bluff , situated above the Polo Grounds , swamping the field , which had poor drainage . The Titans ' offense was less affected by the mud than that of the visiting Buffalo Bills . The Titans won the game 27 – 3 before a crowd of 9 @,@ 607 ( 5 @,@ 727 paid attendance ) . The following week New York played another home game , against the Boston Patriots . On the first of many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead , the Titans were ahead 24 – 7 in the second half . With the lead reduced to 24 – 21 , the Titans punted from deep in their own territory with seconds left . The punter , Rick Sapienza , fumbled the snap , and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory . The following week , with the Titans playing at the Denver Broncos , New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game . In their fourth game , New York had a two @-@ point lead when it fumbled with fifteen seconds left against the Dallas Texans . This set off a scramble for the ball , which the Titans recovered as time ran out . Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending ; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later , the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6 : 30 p.m. Many viewers called to complain . 
 Five weeks into the season , guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers , and died a few hours later , becoming the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field . New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed , and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players . Several players had to play both offense and defense . Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross @-@ river rivals , the Giants , started their season . This meant the Titans had to play their final three games on the road , and Wismer claimed to have lost $ 150 @,@ 000 on the trip . The Titans finished their first season 7 – 7 ; according to attendance figures released by the team , the Titans drew an average of 16 @,@ 375 fans per game . This claim was mocked by the New York press , which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as empty seats . The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $ 450 @,@ 000 for the season ; in his autobiography , Wismer set the figure at $ 1 @.@ 2 million .

 New York City had proposed to build a new stadium for its franchise in baseball 's stillborn Continental League . When that league dissolved and the city was awarded a franchise , dubbed the New York Mets , in the National League , plans for a stadium continued . Wismer had hoped the Titans could play in the new stadium , to be built at Flushing Meadows in Queens , beginning with the 1961 season , but funding difficulties and legal problems delayed construction . Wismer signed a memorandum of understanding in late 1961 , although he was unhappy about the terms , which gave the Mets exclusive use of the stadium until they completed their season , and gave the Titans no revenue from parking . According to team doctor James Nicholas , " The lease that Harry signed cost the team quite a lot . It led to [ later team owner ] Leon Hess going to the Meadowlands . " Shea Stadium , as it came to be known , did not open until 1964 . 
 New York hoped to improve its fortunes through the AFL draft , but most Titans draftees signed with the NFL . The Titans won only one preseason game , before a crowd of 73 @,@ 916 against the Patriots in Philadelphia – free tickets had been given to anyone who bought $ 10 in groceries at an Acme Market . The New York Times columnist Howard <unk> described the crowd as " presumably well @-@ fed . " The 1961 season , which ended at 7 – 7 , was marked by financial difficulties , as the paychecks of many players bounced ; team members learned to hurry to the bank as soon as they received their pay . At the end of the season , Wismer announced that Clyde " Bulldog " Turner would be the Titans ' head coach in 1962 . Baugh had a contract for 1962 and would have to be paid unless he quit . Although Wismer did not fire Baugh , he also did not tell him where the team 's 1962 training camp would be . Baugh showed up anyway , and spent several days acting as kicking coach before Wismer came to the conclusion that Baugh would not quit . The team owner finally agreed to pay the coach his 1962 salary in monthly installments , although Baugh later stated that he was never paid . Baugh 's 14 – 14 record stood as the best mark by any Titans / Jets coach until bettered by Bill Parcells in 1997 – 1999 . In the offseason , Wismer hoped to bring a star to the Polo Grounds by drafting Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis of Syracuse , but Davis was drafted by the Bills instead , signed with the NFL , and died of leukemia before ever playing a professional game . 
 Turner had never been a head coach before ; he faced a team convinced that Baugh had been treated shabbily by Wismer and had difficulty uniting the players . After the Titans split their first two games against Oakland and the Chargers ( who had moved to San Diego ) , the team came home to no paychecks . The players refused to practice , though they worked out on their own on Friday . They then flew to Buffalo and defeated the winless Bills . Public attention in New York was focused on the established local teams , as well as the abysmal record of the fledgling Mets , who nevertheless attracted a cult following . The Titans received little publicity and attracted only 4 @,@ 719 fans to the home opener against Denver . They were required to wait until the end of the Mets ' season before they were allowed to use the Polo Grounds . The Broncos defeated the Titans , 32 – 10 , and Titans quarterback Dean Look suffered a career @-@ ending injury . New York 's financial and football woes continued through October 1962 , and at the beginning of November , Wismer informed AFL commissioner Joe Foss that he lacked the money to continue operations . The league assumed the cost of running the team for the rest of 1962 ; Wismer remained in nominal charge . The Titans had little success on the field ( the highlight was a 46 – 45 victory at favored Denver on Thanksgiving ) , and finished the season insolvent with a 5 – 9 record . 
 Wismer agreed to sell the team , but attempted to prevent the sale with a bankruptcy filing . He contended that the move into Shea Stadium would lead to sufficient revenue to make the team profitable . A bankruptcy referee granted the league the authority to sell the team to a five @-@ man syndicate composed of David A. " Sonny " Werblin , Townsend B. Martin , Leon Hess , Donald C. Lillis , and Philip H. Iselin . The sale of the team was approved by a court on March 15 and completed on March 28 , 1963 . The sale price was $ 1 million . 
 On April 15 , 1963 , the team named Wilbur " Weeb " Ewbank as their head coach and general manager . Ewbank had won back @-@ to @-@ back NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 with the Baltimore Colts , and was one of the most respected coaches in the game . The Colts had fired Ewbank in favor of Don Shula , an untested 33 @-@ year @-@ old . Werblin also announced a new name for his team , the Jets , which had been selected from among 500 candidates submitted by " friends , enemies , and advertising agencies " . The name was chosen over Dodgers , <unk> , and <unk> . The team 's colors were changed to green and white . In a press release , the team stated the reason for the selections : 
 The site of the new stadium between New York 's two major airports , symbols of this speedy , modern age , influenced the selection of the new name " Jets " . It reflects the spirit of these times and the eagerness of all concerned — players , coach , and owners — to give New York another worthy team . The new team 's colors of green and white were chosen for much the same reasons , plus the fact that down through the ages green has always signified hope , freshness and high spirits . 
 The new owners faced a chaotic situation . The team had few players under contract , and had made little effort to sign any of their draft picks , most of which had signed with the NFL . The league attempted to strengthen the Jets and the woeful Oakland Raiders by allowing them to select players from the other six teams , and by giving them the first opportunity to sign players cut from NFL rosters . Ewbank , who had discovered Colts great Johnny Unitas at an open tryout , held tryouts for the Jets . Only seven of the participants were invited to training camp , and one , Marshall Starks , made the team as a second @-@ teamer . In mid @-@ July , it was announced that the Jets could not move into Shea Stadium until 1964 . 
 Despite the offseason problems , New York contended for its first division title in a weak AFL East during the 1963 season . By early December , the Jets had compiled a record of 5 – 5 – 1 , and faced a game in Buffalo with the Bills only a half game ahead . The Jets lost the game , 45 – 14 , as well as their other two remaining games , and finished 5 – 8 – 1 . Although the Jets drew just over 100 @,@ 000 fans to the Polo Grounds in seven home games , they quickly sold 17 @,@ 500 season tickets for the first season in Shea Stadium . Running back Matt Snell was drafted by both New York teams , and the Jets were able to sign him . On September 12 , 1964 , New York played its home opener at Shea Stadium , defeating Denver 30 – 6 before a crowd of 52 @,@ 663 , which broke the AFL regular season attendance record by almost 20 @,@ 000 . On November 8 , 1964 , both the Jets and Giants played home games ; both teams sold out their games and the Jets drew 61 @,@ 929 fans . The Jets posted a home record of 5 – 1 – 1 in 1964 , but lost all seven road games to finish 5 – 8 – 1 again . 
 As the season concluded , the obvious standout draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath . The Houston Oilers , in last place in the AFL East , had the number @-@ one pick for the AFL . Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him ( as it turned out , the St. Louis Cardinals , formerly the Chicago Cardinals ) , and the Jets were able to acquire the number @-@ one pick . Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its final game of the season , the Orange Bowl , on January 1 , 1965 . Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath 's attorney , and when the price got too high for the Cardinals , the Giants secretly acquired Namath 's NFL rights . Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game . On January 2 , 1965 , the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath 's signing . 
 = = " Broadway Joe " era ( 1965 – 1976 ) = = 
 = = = Road to Super Bowl III = = = 
 Namath did not start the January 1965 Orange Bowl , as he was nursing an injured knee . He came off the bench in the second quarter with Alabama down by two touchdowns , and led his team to within a foot of victory , falling short in a run on the game 's final play . Despite the loss , he was voted the game 's Most Valuable Player . The following day , Namath officially signed with New York for an unprecedented contract worth $ 427 @,@ 000 over three years . The total included bonuses yet to be earned as well as a convertible given to Namath as a signing bonus . The Jets had been aware that Namath had knee problems , but when team doctor Nicholas examined Namath in the restroom at a party held to celebrate his signing , he told the quarterback that had he known Namath 's knees were that bad , he would have advised Werblin not to sign him . The Jets scheduled Namath for surgery amid considerable public interest ; the media asked to photograph the operation , but were refused permission . The Jets hedged their bets by signing three other quarterbacks for a total of $ 400 @,@ 000 , including Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte . There was an intense media spotlight on Namath , who became known for a playboy lifestyle ; he was dubbed " Broadway Joe " . 
 Ewbank maintained through training camp that second @-@ year Mike Taliaferro was the number @-@ one quarterback and disappointed a sellout crowd at Houston 's Rice Stadium by keeping Namath on the bench at the Jets ' season opener . Ewbank felt that Namath might not be ready for several more weeks , but Werblin intervened . Namath saw his first regular season action in the AFL the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs ( the former Dallas Texans ) , and he was starting quarterback the following week against the Buffalo Bills . Namath 's performance was inconsistent as he gained pro experience , but he was named AFL Rookie of the Year . The Jets finished the season 5 – 8 – 1 again . Beginning in 1966 , the Jets began to improve on the field behind Namath , who led them to a 6 – 6 – 2 record . That season , the NFL and AFL announced a merger , which would be effective in 1970 . A championship game ( it came to be known as the Super Bowl ) , played between the two league champions , would follow each season until the merger took place . 
 In 1967 , Namath threw a then @-@ record 4 @,@ 007 yards as the Jets posted their first winning record , 8 – 5 – 1 . The Jets led the division until running back Emerson Boozer was injured against the Chiefs on November 6 , which meant opposing teams were able to concentrate on the passing threat from Namath . 
 In 1968 , Werblin 's co @-@ owners gave him an ultimatum – either buy them out or be bought out . He chose the latter option , reportedly profiting $ 1 @.@ 4 million for his 1963 investment of $ 250 @,@ 000 . Prior to Werblin 's departure , the Jets had considered firing Ewbank . They attempted to secure Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi , but Lombardi decided to remain in Green Bay one more season . The season started with the usual three road games due to the team 's status as secondary tenant to the Mets at Shea Stadium . The Jets rose to the top of the AFL East ; they had lost only two games by mid @-@ November and built a three @-@ game lead over second @-@ place Houston . New York 's next game was at Oakland . In what became known as the Heidi Game , the Jets took a 32 – 29 lead with 68 seconds left , only to have Oakland score two touchdowns to win the game . However , the touchdowns went unseen by much of the national TV audience , as NBC had switched at 7 : 00 p.m. to a TV movie of Heidi . Nevertheless , the Jets won their remaining games to finish 11 – 3 . In the playoffs , the Jets defeated the Raiders for the AFL Championship at Shea Stadium , 27 – 23 , a game in which Namath threw three touchdowns , including the game winner to Don Maynard in the fourth quarter . 
 = = = Super Bowl III = = = 
 In the Super Bowl at the Miami Orange Bowl on January 12 , 1969 , the Jets faced the Baltimore Colts , who had dominated the NFL with a 13 – 1 record . In their 14 regular season games , the Colts permitted only 144 points . Their sole loss had been to the Cleveland Browns , who they then defeated 34 – 0 in the 1968 NFL Championship Game . <unk> Jimmy " The Greek " Snyder proclaimed the Colts as 17 @-@ point favorites over the Jets . Sports Illustrated 's top football writer , Tex Maule , predicted a 43 – 0 Colts victory . The first two Super Bowls had been dominated by the NFL champion Green Bay Packers ; most journalists expected the Colts to easily defeat the Jets . 
 From his arrival in Miami , Namath was outspoken about the Jets ' chances in the Super Bowl . He alleged that there were five AFL quarterbacks better than Colts quarterback Earl Morrall , who would be only the third @-@ best on the Jets . He was equally outspoken in a verbal confrontation with Colts kicker Lou Michaels in a Miami restaurant . Three days before the game , while accepting an award from the Miami Touchdown Club , Namath made the statement for which he would be remembered : " And we 're going to win Sunday , I 'll guarantee you . " 
 The game was a defensive struggle . At halftime , the Jets led 7 – 0 on a Matt Snell touchdown run ; New York 's defense frustrated Baltimore , and the Colts were scoreless despite repeated opportunities . Jim Turner added two field goals to make the score 13 – 0 , and Colts coach Don Shula inserted Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas in Morrall 's place . Unitas initially failed to move the Colts ' offense , and Turner gave the Jets a 16 – 0 lead with his third field goal . Unitas managed to lead the Colts to a touchdown with less than four minutes left . A second drive ( after a successful onside kick ) fell short , and the Jets were able to run out the clock for a 16 – 7 victory , one of the greatest upsets in football history . 
 Houston Post columnist Jack Gallagher traced the Jets ' progress from their early days to the Super Bowl : 
 I remember when the 1962 Titans drew 36 @,@ 161 — not the average attendance , mind you , but for the season ... I remember when a squirt of a Texan named Hayseed Stephens , instead of Broadway Joe Namath quarterbacked New York 's AFL entry ... As the thoughts keep rolling back I find it difficult to reconcile the Jets with the champions of pro football . But I do recall [ former AFL Commissioner Joe ] Foss once saying , " When sports historians chart the progress of this league they 'll find that no organization in sport went so far so fast . " Clearly , the franchise that went the farthest the fastest was the New York Jets . 
 = = = Decline and Namath 's departure = = = 
 Before the 1969 season , the Jets suffered offseason problems . Namath , faced with NFL claims that his Bachelors III bar was a hangout for gangsters , was told by the NFL to sell the bar . Instead , he briefly retired , feeling he had been badly treated . Six weeks following his announcement , Namath sold the bar and rejoined the team . A number of Super Bowl veterans were cut by the team , or had bitter contract disputes with Ewbank in his capacity as general manager . According to receiver Don Maynard , " When you get rid of veteran ballplayers and replace them with rookies , the level goes down . " 
 The Jets ' success in signing Namath and the rise of the team in the standings adversely affected their crosstown rivals , the Giants , who had played in five NFL championship games in six years to 1963 , but who thereafter declined in the standings . Giants owner Wellington Mara stated , " I think the Jets coming in when they did contributed to our bad years , because we tried to do everything for the short term rather than the long haul — we 'd trade a draft choice for a player , figuring he 'd give us one or two good years . We didn 't want to accept how the public might react if we had a bad year or two or three . " In 1968 , the Giants traded for star Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in the vain hopes he would lead them to renewed success and rival Namath in the public eye . In August 1969 , the Jets faced the Giants in a preseason game at the Yale Bowl . While the Jets ' Super Bowl win legitimized the AFL as a comparable league to the NFL in the eyes of many , others doubted the AFL 's standard of play , and the Jets were underdogs going into the game . Giants coach Allie Sherman approached the game as if it were a regular season contest , and the Jets sent the three remaining original Titans out for the coin toss . The Jets defeated the Giants 37 – 14 , and Sherman was fired a few weeks later . The Jets ' fellow tenants , the Mets , won a championship themselves ; the baseball team 's accomplishments forced the Jets to play their first five games on the road . The Jets recovered from a slow start to win their second consecutive Eastern Division championship , but fell to Kansas City in the divisional round of the playoffs , 13 – 6 . 
 The first NFL game for the Jets , as the leagues finalized their merger in 1970 , was also the first @-@ ever Monday Night Football game , a 31 – 21 loss to the Cleveland Browns . Three weeks later , they played the Colts for the first time since the Super Bowl . The Jets lost both the game and Namath , who fractured his wrist and was lost for the season as the Jets fell to a record of 4 – 10 , the worst mark yet of the Namath era . They did not have a winning record again until 1981 . After six years with the team , wide receiver George Sauer , a major contributor offensively , retired on April 16 , 1971 . Namath was injured again in a 1971 preseason game in Tampa , and missed much of the season . He returned on November 28 against the San Francisco 49ers and threw three touchdown passes ; the Jets lost by three points . The Jets finished the season at 6 – 8 . In 1972 , Namath had one of the best days of his career against the Baltimore Colts : he completed 15 of 28 passes for 496 yards and six touchdowns . Despite Namath 's performance , John Madden 's Oakland Raiders eliminated the Jets from contention in their second @-@ to @-@ last regular season game . New York finished the season with a record of 7 – 7 . 
 Before the 1973 season , the aging Ewbank announced that he would retire as coach after the season and as general manager after 1974 . The Mets unexpectedly qualified for the World Series , consigning the Jets to another long stay away from Shea . The Jets did not play a home game until the end of October . The team finished with a record of 4 – 10 , though their final game against the Bills attracted considerable media attention . The attention was not for Ewbank 's last game , but for Bills running back O. J. Simpson 's attempt to become the first NFL player to rush for 2 @,@ 000 yards in a season . Simpson gained 200 yards , finishing with 2 @,@ 003 for the season . Shortly after the 1973 season , the team hired Ewbank 's son @-@ in @-@ law , former Cardinals coach Charley Winner , as head coach . The new coach showed an initial inability to get his team to emulate his last name : the team started the season by losing seven of their first eight games . Namath , who had a reasonably healthy season behind a poor offensive line , predicted the Jets would win their final six games . The first NFL regular @-@ season overtime victory , over the Giants at the Yale Bowl , and the usual large number of home games towards the end of the season helped New York in its comeback , and a Namath prediction again came true . 
 Al Ward replaced Ewbank as general manager in 1975 . The Jets won four of their five preseason games , though sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi , in his history of the Jets , notes that the wins were secured by playing first @-@ string players while the other teams were trying out rookies and backups . When the regular season started , the Jets lost seven of their first nine games , and Winner was fired . Offensive coordinator Ken Shipp became interim head coach , and the Jets finished with a record of 3 – 11 . Running back John Riggins , who became the first 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard rusher in franchise history during the season and made the Pro Bowl , departed for the Washington Redskins as he felt the Jets ' Namath @-@ led offense passed the ball too often . New York hired North Carolina State coach Lou Holtz . With New York enduring the second of three consecutive 3 – 11 seasons ( two wins came over the 2 – 12 Bills and a third over the 0 – 14 expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers ) , Holtz — who went on to great success at Notre Dame — resigned with one game left in the season to become head coach at the University of Arkansas . 
 Following their disastrous 1976 season , the Jets hired longtime assistant Walt Michaels as their new head coach . In the offseason , the team made the difficult decision to part ways with Joe Namath , who had become ineffective on the field . Although Namath 's throwing abilities were unimpaired , his knees were so bad as to render him almost immobile ; Paul Zimmerman of the New York Post dubbed him the " million dollar statue " . The team attempted to trade him but was unsuccessful . On May 12 , 1977 , Namath was cut from the roster . He signed with the Los Angeles Rams , but retired at season 's end .

 Feeling that having to play road games until the Mets were done with Shea Stadium put the Jets at a disadvantage , the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year in September at the Giants ' new home at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey , Giants Stadium . Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue , and in the lawsuit 's settlement , the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets ' lease . In 1977 , the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea . Despite the favorable settlement , the Jets won only three of fourteen games . Rookies on the team , selected in the 1977 NFL Draft , included seven players who started for them in the late 1970s and early 1980s , such as tackle Marvin Powell , wide receiver Wesley Walker , and defensive lineman Joe Klecko . Klecko became part of a defensive line known as the New York Sack Exchange . 
 In Michaels ' second season , the Jets adopted new uniforms in a darker green and with a streamlined logo . When quarterback Richard Todd was injured , his backup Matt Robinson proved to be a deep @-@ throwing threat who led New York to eight wins in the first fourteen of the newly expanded sixteen @-@ game season , and into playoff contention . However , the team lost its final two contests and did not qualify for the playoffs . Michaels was named AFC Coach of the Year for keeping his young team in playoff contention so long . There was much media discussion as to whether Todd or Robinson should be the starting quarterback in 1979 . Todd emerged as the starter , as Robinson was injured while arm wrestling during the preseason . The injury — and his attempts to conceal it from Michaels — ended his career with the Jets . Todd led the Jets to another 8 – 8 record . Jimmy the Greek predicted the Jets would go to the Super Bowl in 1980 , but they ended that season with a 4 – 12 record . 
 There was fan pressure on the Jets to fire Michaels after 1980 ; it increased when the Jets lost their first three games of the 1981 season . Even so , Michaels described his team as being of " a championship , playoff caliber " . The Jets compiled a record of 10 – 2 – 1 in their remaining games — losing twice to the Seattle Seahawks — to finish the season with their first winning record and playoff appearance since 1969 . Their Week 16 victory over the Packers boosted the Jets into the playoffs and also gave the Giants their first playoff birth since 1963 with a victory over the Dallas Cowboys the prior day . The Jets fell behind the Bills 24 – 0 in the wild card game and lost 31 – 27 , as their potential game @-@ winning drive was stopped when the Bills intercepted a Todd pass near Buffalo 's goal line . One of the Jets ' bright spots was their defensive line . Mark Gastineau and Klecko anchored the Sack Exchange and combined for more than 40 quarterback sacks . 
 In the strike @-@ shortened 1982 season , the Jets finished 6 – 3 and upset the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the playoffs , as running back Freeman McNeil became the second player to rush for 200 yards in a postseason game . New York then defeated the top seeded Los Angeles Raiders 17 – 14 , based on the strong performances of McNeil and Wesley Walker in a game that saw numerous turnovers on both sides . The Jets next traveled to face the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game . The game was preceded by a series of storms that turned the Orange Bowl into a mud pit . The Dolphins stated that they did not own a tarpaulin , and that stadium maintenance was Dade County 's responsibility , so the field lay exposed to the elements . The muddy field slowed the Jets ' offense . In what was dubbed the " Mud Bowl " , neither team managed much offense ( both teams gained less than 200 yards ) . At the end of his best season , Todd threw five interceptions , the last being a screen pass deflected and returned by linebacker A.J. <unk> for a costly 4th @-@ quarter touchdown as New York fell to Miami 14 – 0 . On February 9 , 1983 , Michaels announced his resignation , and the following day the Jets elevated offensive coordinator Joe Walton to the head coaching position . 
 In Walton 's first months as head coach , the team made a decision which would long be discussed and criticized . In the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft , New York selected quarterback Ken O 'Brien . In drafting O 'Brien , the Jets passed up University of Pittsburgh quarterback Dan Marino , who went on to have a stellar career with the Dolphins , and would many times be a thorn in the Jets ' side . The 1983 season started with high expectations , but the Jets dropped to 7 – 9 . The Jets ' lease at Shea Stadium was due to expire after 1983 ; Jets majority owner Leon Hess and New York Mayor Ed Koch attempted to negotiate a new lease for the team . The Jets wanted the city to redevelop the stadium to expand its capacity to 67 @,@ 000 and to alleviate its rundown state . Hess felt that Koch was uninterested in the Jets ( he had attended one Jets game in his six years as mayor , and had left early ) . Negotiations soon reached an impasse , and in October 1983 , the team announced it would move to Giants Stadium beginning in the 1984 season . 
 = = = Early Meadowlands years = = = 
 Hess acquired full ownership of the Jets on February 9 , 1984 , when Helen Dillion sold her 25 % interest to him . Before the season , New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints . New York began its season with veteran Pat Ryan as starting quarterback ; O 'Brien was spending most weekdays waiting to testify about an altercation at the Studio 54 nightclub , at which Jets players had been present and , by some accounts , involved . The Jets had a second consecutive mediocre season , finishing 7 – 9 after starting the season 6 – 2 . 
 In 1985 , the Jets made the playoffs , accruing an 11 – 5 record , and hosted their first playoff game in four years . They were defeated in the first round by the eventual AFC champion New England Patriots after turning the ball over four times . Looking to improve on their 1985 performance , the Jets started the 1986 season 10 – 1 , including nine straight wins . In week three against Miami , the Jets won 51 – 45 in overtime as Ken O 'Brien and Dan Marino combined to pass for 884 yards , then an NFL record . Wracked by injuries , the Jets lost their final five regular season games , but still made the playoffs . In the wild card playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs , the Jets replaced O 'Brien with Pat Ryan , and won 35 – 15 . This victory sent the Jets to the divisional round in an away game against the Cleveland Browns . The Jets built a 20 – 10 lead and appeared to have stopped a late Cleveland drive — until Mark Gastineau was called for a roughing the passer penalty , a late hit on Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar that gave the Browns another opportunity . Cleveland went on to tie the game , and in the second overtime , defeated the Jets , 23 – 20 . The Browns went on to lose to the Denver Broncos ( beaten by the Jets earlier in the season ) in the AFC Championship Game ; the Broncos in turn lost to the Giants in Super Bowl XXI . Many Jets were convinced that given the opportunity to play the Giants , the Jets would have won . According to Eskenazi , the Giants " were the toast of New York , back in a championship game for the first time since the 1960s , while the Jets contemplated the late hit and what might have been " . 
 In 1987 , the Jets won their first two games . NFL players then staged a strike ; a team composed mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games . The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players , led by Gastineau , to cross the picket line . The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East through much of the season , but dropped all four games in December to finish 6 – 9 , in last place . In 1988 , the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived , linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp , and Mark Gastineau retired midseason , citing personal reasons . In spite of these departures , the Jets finished with an 8 – 7 – 1 record . They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants , which cost their in @-@ state rivals a playoff berth . The team performed badly in 1989 , finishing 4 – 12 . On December 18 , 1989 , the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager . Three days after New York 's final game of the season , a 37 – 0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium , Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team 's 10th coach . The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record , a statistic he later admitted he cared about deeply . 
 = = Search for success ( 1990 – 1996 ) = = 
 Dick Steinberg initially sought to hire Michigan State coach George <unk> as Jets head coach , but the university refused to release him from his contract . Steinberg then hired Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet . Coslet 's offensive schemes , described as " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art " by Sports Illustrated , had helped the Bengals to Super Bowl XXIII , following the 1988 season . The Jets ' poor record in 1989 had given them the second pick in the draft ; the team selected star Penn State running back Blair Thomas , who was expected to have a strong career with the Jets . Instead Thomas played on the team for four injury @-@ plagued , unproductive years and was cut before the 1994 season began . 
 Coslet 's first season proved only slightly better than Joe Walton 's last ; the Jets finished 6 – 10 . In the 1991 NFL Draft , the Jets lost another opportunity to draft a star quarterback , as a draft @-@ day deal that would have allowed them to select Brett Favre fell through . The Jets had more success in the 1991 season : they built a 7 – 8 record with one game remaining , and needed a win against Miami to clinch a playoff berth . New York kicker Raul Allegre ( recently signed to replace aging kicker Pat Leahy , who had been kicking for the Jets since the days of Joe Namath ) made one field goal to force overtime , and another to win in the extra period . The victory gave the Jets their first playoff berth since 1986 . In the wild card game , a Ken O 'Brien pass into the end zone in the final seconds of the game was intercepted , and the Jets lost to Houston , 17 – 10 . 
 After a strong performance by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team 's 5 – 0 1992 preseason , Coslet promoted him to the starting lineup . Despite throwing for a total of 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener , then the second @-@ highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut , the team lost 20 – 17 ; the Jets lost their first four games . Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27 , 1992 , having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season . Two days later , defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg stepped forward in the pocket as the two players were about to sandwich him . Mersereau managed to walk away and continue his career with New York , but Byrd suffered a fracture to his C @-@ 5 vertebra that left him partially paralyzed . Inspired by Byrd 's persistent high spirits , New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills . The Jets finished the season 4 – 12 . 
 Prior to the 1993 season , the Jets obtained Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason , who had worked with Coslet in Cincinnati . Steinberg signed veteran safety Ronnie Lott to shore up the defense . O 'Brien 's career with the Jets ended with an offseason trade to the Green Bay Packers , and running back Freeman McNeil retired after twelve seasons . The Jets suffered another December collapse : they lost four of their last five to finish 8 – 8 . The Jets would have made the playoffs by winning their last game , but were shut out at the Astrodome by the Oilers . Following the season , Steinberg fired Coslet and replaced him with defensive coordinator Pete Carroll . 
 Carroll 's first season , 1994 , started well . Going into a November home game against Miami , the Jets were 6 – 5 ; a victory over the Dolphins would tie them for the AFC East lead . The Jets built leads of 17 – 0 and 24 – 6 , but Dan Marino and the Dolphins cut the lead to 24 – 21 and got the ball for a final @-@ minute drive . Marino completed a pass into Jets territory with just over 30 seconds remaining . With the clock running , the Dolphins acted like Marino would spike the ball to stop the clock . However , Marino faked the spike and tossed the ball to Mark Ingram in the end zone for the winning touchdown . The loss started yet another December collapse ; the Jets would not win again for the rest of the season . Prior to the season finale , the Jets announced that Steinberg was ill with stomach cancer ; he died the following September . The team fired Carroll after the season and replaced him with former Philadelphia Eagles coach Rich Kotite . Hess also named Kotite as general manager as well . 
 At the press conference announcing Kotite 's hiring , Hess told the media , " I 'm 80 years old , I want results now . " However , the first game of the Kotite era proved to be a harbinger – a 52 @-@ 14 loss to the Dolphins . A month later , they lost to the Oakland Raiders 47 @-@ 10 in the Jets ' sole national television appearance of the season . The Jets defeated the Seattle Seahawks on the Sunday following Thanksgiving after an inspirational speech by Hess , but again had trouble in December , losing all four games in the month to finish 3 – 13 . In 1996 , the Jets brought in veteran quarterback Neil O 'Donnell , who had just led Pittsburgh to Super Bowl XXX , to lead the offense . The Jets , for the first time since the leagues merged , were in possession of the first pick overall in the NFL Draft , which they used to select wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson . O 'Donnell proved injury @-@ prone , and the Jets suffered the worst season in franchise history . They lost their first eight games , beat the Arizona Cardinals in Tempe , then proceeded to lose their remaining seven games . Two days before the season finale , on December 20 , 1996 , Kotite announced his resignation effective at season 's end . After the last game , a 31 – 28 home loss to the Dolphins , Kotite was hit with a full cup of beer as he left the field ; another fan ( fewer than 22 @,@ 000 attended the game ; almost 56 @,@ 000 ticketholders stayed home ) held up a sign , " The End of an Error " . 
 = = Return to respectability ( 1997 – present ) = = 
 = = = Bill Parcells era = = = 
 Hess and team president Gutman agreed on a top candidate as new coach — Patriots coach Bill Parcells , who had won two Super Bowls with the Giants and was in the process of taking the Patriots there as well . Parcells believed that he could void his contract and seek a position elsewhere ; New England owner Robert Kraft believed the Patriots would be entitled to compensation . NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled in the Patriots ' favor , and New England demanded the Jets give them the first pick overall in the upcoming draft . The Jets responded by hiring Parcells disciple Bill Belichick as head coach ; Parcells was to serve as a " consultant " in 1997 and head coach beginning in 1998 . The Patriots were unimpressed by what they saw as a subterfuge , and Tagliabue mediated the matter . He set Parcells free from the Patriots ; the Jets gave the Patriots four draft picks , including their first round pick in 1999 . The Jets put an end to Belichick 's six @-@ day reign ( he remained as assistant head coach and as defensive coordinator ) and hired Parcells as head coach . 
 The Parcells era started with a 41 – 3 victory over Seattle . The Jets were 9 – 6 in their first fifteen games and went into the season finale against the Detroit Lions needing a win to make the playoffs . Parcells , who never had full confidence in O 'Donnell , benched him in favor of Ray Lucas after O 'Donnell threw an early interception . Lucas was ineffective as well , as the Jets lost 13 – 10 . The eight @-@ game improvement in the standings , together with Parcells ' reputation as a winner , caused high expectations for 1998 . The team announced that it would adopt a modified version of the Jets ' 1963 – 1977 logo beginning in the 1998 season . 
 Parcells signed Patriots running back Curtis Martin as a restricted free agent , giving up <unk> and 3rd @-@ round picks . Parcells also signed Baltimore Ravens quarterback Vinny Testaverde as a free agent , which paved the way for O 'Donnell 's release from the team . After an 0 – 2 start , New York won six of the next seven games . The Jets lost only once the rest of the way , and clinched their first NFL division crown against the Bills on December 19 , 1998 . They set a franchise record for the number of victories in a season with a win over the Patriots in the season finale . The team finished 12 – 4 and were second seed in the playoffs with a first round bye . The Jets faced the Jacksonville Jaguars in their divisional playoff game , their first home playoff game since the 1986 season . New York defeated the Jaguars 34 – 24 and met the top @-@ seeded Broncos in the AFC Championship Game . Though the Jets possessed a 10 – 0 lead in the 3rd quarter , the Broncos , led by John Elway in his final home game , came back and defeated the Jets , 23 – 10 . 
 The Jets had high hopes for 1999 , but suffered a blow in the season opener when Testaverde ruptured his Achilles tendon and was lost for the season . New York suffered other injuries and fell to a 2 – 6 record before recovering to finish 8 – 8 . Two days after the end of the season , Parcells announced his resignation as coach ; he remained with the team for a year as chief of football operations . Belichick was slated to become head coach in Parcells ' place , but one day later , he announced his own resignation . Robert Kraft had gotten word to Belichick through intermediaries that he could have complete control of football operations and a $ 2 million salary if he got out of his contract with the Jets . After a lawsuit to void Belichick 's contract failed and Tagliabue refused to release him , the Jets and Patriots agreed on draft choice compensation for the Jets . 
 As a result of Leon Hess ' death in May 1999 , the team was put up for auction in January 2000 . In a bidding war between Charles F. Dolan and Woody Johnson , Johnson emerged victorious , and he purchased the team for $ 635 million . Johnson expressed interest in having Parcells return to his coaching role ; the team elevated linebackers coach Al Groh to the head coaching position when Parcells refused . 
 In April 2000 , New York traded wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson , a major offensive threat on the 1998 team , to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for two 1st @-@ round draft picks . Johnson wanted a renegotiated contract and was threatening to hold out . Having acquired New England 's pick in the Belichick compensation , and with their own pick , the Jets had four 1st @-@ round picks . They selected quarterback Chad Pennington as well as defensive linemen John Abraham and Shaun Ellis , and tight end Anthony Becht , all of whom would be key players on the Jets playoff teams of the 2000s . For the first time , the Jets won their first four games , including a victory over Johnson and the Buccaneers . They reached 6 – 1 following the " Monday Night Miracle " , the largest comeback in the history of Monday Night Football : the Jets overcame a 30 – 7 4th @-@ quarter deficit to defeat the Dolphins , 40 – 37 in overtime . The Jets went 3 – 6 after that , finishing at 9 – 7 , out of the playoffs . 
 After spending less than a year with the team , Groh resigned to accept a coaching job at his alma mater , the University of Virginia . Parcells resigned from his front @-@ office position and was replaced with Chiefs executive Terry Bradway on Parcells ' recommendation . 
 = = = Herman Edwards takes over = = = 
 On January 18 , 2001 , the Jets announced Herman Edwards as the new coach . Edwards , a former defensive back who had worked his way up through the NFL coaching system , had never served as head coach at any level . He was the first African @-@ American Jets head coach . Edwards lost his first game , two days before the September 11 attacks . In the wake of 9 / 11 , the NFL had to decide whether to play its games the following weekend . Testaverde and the Jets spoke out against playing on the weekend after 9 / 11 , and the Jets were prepared to forfeit the game rather than fly . The NFL decided to move that week 's games to the end of the regular season . The Jets needed to win that game , in Oakland against the Raiders , to reach the playoffs , and John Hall kicked a last @-@ minute 53 @-@ yard field goal for a 24 – 22 victory and a playoff berth . Edwards was the first coach to lead the Jets to the playoffs in his first year with the team . In the playoffs , the Jets again played at Oakland . New York could not stop the Raiders ' passing game , and Oakland won , 38 – 24 . 
 The Jets began the 2002 season 1 – 4 , but then put together a six @-@ game winning streak . On the final day of the season , the Jets beat the Packers following a New England victory over Miami . This gave the Jets a 9 – 7 record , their second post @-@ merger division title , and a playoff berth . Chad Pennington had an outstanding day against the Packers and finished the season the top @-@ rated passer in the league . The Jets began the playoffs against the Indianapolis Colts at home , and defeated them 41 – 0 . The Jets then played the Raiders , who again defeated them in Oakland , 30 – 10 . The Jets lost a number of key players to free agency in the offseason . Four signed with the Washington Redskins , including kicker Hall , wide receiver <unk> Coles , kick returner Chad Morton , and offensive lineman Randy Thomas . During a preseason game against the Giants , Pennington sustained a serious wrist injury , and required surgery . The aging Testaverde stepped in as starter , but led the Jets to only a 2 – 6 record , including losses to the Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys . The Jets split their remaining games and finished 6 – 10 . 
 In spite of the team 's poor 2003 record , Johnson retained Edwards as head coach and extended his contract through 2007 . With a healthy Pennington at quarterback , the Jets began their season at 5 – 0 for the first time and then lost two of their next three games . During the team 's second meeting with the Bills , Pennington suffered a tear in his rotator cuff that caused him to miss three starts . Pennington returned in a 29 – 7 rout of the Houston Texans . The team struggled toward the end of the regular season , winning only one of its final four games . Despite a final @-@ game loss to the St. Louis Rams , the Jets reached the playoffs . The team traveled to San Diego to play the Chargers in the wild card round and upset them 23 – 20 on a Doug Brien field goal in overtime . The win sent the Jets to the divisional round against the 15 – 1 Pittsburgh Steelers . The Jets again took their opponent to overtime , as Brien missed a field goal with two minutes remaining and the score tied . He missed a second field goal in overtime . Pittsburgh kicker Jeff Reed proved more accurate , and the Steelers beat the Jets , 20 – 17 . 
 In Week 3 of the 2005 season , both Pennington and backup quarterback Jay Fiedler were injured against the Jaguars . With both quarterbacks out for the season , third @-@ string quarterback Brooks Bollinger started ; the 41 @-@ year @-@ old Testaverde was brought out of retirement to serve as his backup . Bollinger played badly in a loss in week four , and Testaverde became the starter . Testaverde had little success , and Bollinger did not fare better when he was re @-@ inserted . Running back Curtis Martin chose to have arthroscopic surgery on his knee with four games left in the season . The Jets finished 4 – 12 . 
 = = = Eric Mangini : initial success , eventual firing = = = 
 On January 6 , 2006 , Herman Edwards announced his resignation as head coach to take the same position with Kansas City . The Jets received a 4th @-@ round draft pick as compensation for Edwards , who was still under contract with the team . On January 17 , New York announced the hiring of former Patriots defensive coordinator Eric Mangini . Three weeks later , General Manager Terry Bradway stepped down in favor of his assistant , Mike Tannenbaum . Although Pennington took back his starting position , the Jets only managed to split their first eight games . They began the second half with a victory over New England in Foxboro , and lost only two games the rest of the way to finish 10 – 6 and secure a playoff berth . In the wild card round , the Jets visited Foxboro again , but this time fell to the Patriots , 37 – 16 . For his success in leading the Jets to the playoffs , Mangini received the nickname " <unk> " and had a cameo appearance on The Sopranos . 
 After Mangini 's successful rookie season , New York had high hopes of further improvement . Following the team 's opening loss against New England , the Jets accused the Patriots of videotaping their signals . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell fined the Patriots and Bill Belichick , and stripped New England of its 1st @-@ round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft . Struggling to a 1 – 7 start , the Jets benched Pennington in favor of backup Kellen Clemens . The Jets won only three games the rest of the way and finished with a record of 4 – 12 . The Jets were again overshadowed by the Giants , who won their third Super Bowl by defeating the previously unbeaten Patriots . 
 Following the 2007 season , Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre had retired . He wished to return several months later , but found that the Packers had given Aaron Rodgers the starting spot . The subsequent trade talks and rumors were a major story leading up to the 2008 season , and the Jets unexpectedly won the bidding war to trade for Favre . With Favre 's acquisition , the Jets released Pennington , who signed with the Dolphins . Despite a good start to the season , the Jets began to falter in December after Favre tore his rotator cuff — he threw five interceptions in a three @-@ game span . The season came down to a final game against the Dolphins , led by Pennington , at Giants Stadium . The Dolphins won to take the division title and eliminate the 9 – 7 Jets from playoff contention . On December 29 , 2008 , Mangini was fired after three seasons as head coach , with an overall record of 23 @-@ 25 . Favre again briefly retired from football on February 11 , 2009 . 
 = = = Rex Ryan era ; Todd Bowles takes over = = = 
 Following Mangini 's departure , New York hoped to lure former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher out of retirement , suggesting that Cowher might be given control of football operations in addition to serving as coach . However , Cowher decided to remain retired for the season . On January 20 , 2009 , the Jets offered the position to Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan , who accepted . Tannenbaum engineered a draft @-@ day trade with Cleveland , which enabled New York to move up and select highly regarded USC quarterback Mark Sanchez . 
 New York won its first three games of 2009 , including their first home victory over the Patriots since 2000 , but lost six of its next seven games . The Jets recovered to 7 – 6 , but then lost to the Atlanta Falcons on December 20 , a defeat that caused Ryan to state that the Jets " were obviously out of the playoffs " . The next week , the Jets played the 14 – 0 Indianapolis Colts . The Colts removed many of their starting players from the game early in the second half with a 15 – 10 lead ; the Jets came back for the victory . The victory put the Jets ' fate in their own hands , and they defeated the Bengals ( who had also clinched a playoff spot and played few starters ) in the last game ever at Giants Stadium to secure a playoff berth . 
 The following week , the team played the Bengals in the playoffs , this time at Paul Brown Stadium , and secured a 24 – 14 victory over Cincinnati . That victory meant that the Jets would travel to San Diego to play the Chargers , who had won eleven straight games , in the divisional round . Strong performances by Sanchez , running back Shonn Greene , and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17 – 14 win over the Chargers . New York played the top @-@ seeded Colts in the AFC Championship Game and secured an early 17 – 6 lead . They had little luck in the second half as the Colts went to the Super Bowl with a 30 – 17 victory . 
 The Jets had hoped to move into what was termed the West Side Stadium , to be built in Manhattan , after their 25 @-@ year lease at Giants Stadium expired . In 2005 , it became clear that New York authorities would not permit the stadium to be built . After the West Side failure , the Jets and Giants entered into a joint venture to build a new $ 1 @.@ 6 billion facility alongside Giants Stadium , which was torn down after the new venue was completed . The Jets ' new home , MetLife Stadium , opened to the public in April 2010 . The stadium took 34 months to construct , and can seat 82 @,@ 500 . The Jets hosted the Giants in the first game of the preseason on August 16 , 2010 . 
 The Jets ' first regular season home game at the new stadium was on September 13 , 2010 and was shown nationwide on Monday Night Football . New York lost to the Ravens 10 – 9 , but built a 9 – 2 record , tied for the division lead with the Patriots ( whom the Jets had beaten once ) going into a Monday night game at New England . Expectations of a Jets victory were high , but the Jets were defeated , 45 – 3 . New York recovered to qualify for the AFC playoffs as the sixth and final seed . In the wild card round , the Jets defeated Indianapolis , 17 – 16 . This victory sent the Jets to a rematch with New England . The Jets upset the Patriots , 28 – 21 , setting up an AFC Championship Game at Pittsburgh . The Jets fell behind 24 – 0 , and mounted a second @-@ half comeback before losing to the Steelers , 24 – 19 . In 2011 , Ryan promised a Super Bowl appearance . The Jets played the Giants in the next @-@ to @-@ last week of the regular season with both teams still alive for playoff berths . The Jets lost to the Giants , and the following week to the Dolphins , finishing 8 – 8 and missing the playoffs , while the Giants used their victory over their in @-@ stadium rivals to launch a winning streak which culminated in the Super Bowl XLVI championship , again defeating the Patriots . 
 Sanchez did not perform as well in 2011 as he had the previous two years . In March 2012 , Colts quarterback Peyton Manning signed with Denver , making Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow expendable . Tebow had won considerable public attention in 2011 by leading the Broncos on an unexpected playoff run . On March 21 , 2012 , the Jets acquired Tebow from the Broncos in a trade involving lower @-@ round draft picks . Despite a season @-@ long quarterback controversy and a poor 2012 for Sanchez , Tebow was little @-@ used . Third @-@ string quarterback Greg McElroy started late in the year but was ineffective , as the Jets fell to 6 @-@ 10 , their first losing season under Ryan . On December 31 , 2012 , the Jets fired Tannenbaum , but announced that Ryan would remain as head coach . The Jets announced the hiring of Seahawks Vice President of Football Operations John Idzik as general manager on January 18 , 2013 . On April 29 , soon after the team took West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith in the 2013 NFL Draft , Tebow was released by the Jets . 
 The quarterback controversy between Smith and Sanchez was settled when Sanchez was injured in the 2013 preseason ; he subsequently had surgery that ended his year . The Jets were inconsistent behind Smith , and finished 8 – 8 , though knocking the Dolphins out of the playoff picture with a final @-@ week victory . Ryan 's contract was due to expire after 2014 , but the head coach was given a multi @-@ year extension on January 16 of that year . Sanchez was released on March 21 , 2014 , allowing the Jets to sign controversial former Falcons and Eagles quarterback Michael Vick . In 2014 , the Jets went 4 – 12 , last in passing until a final @-@ game victory at the Dolphins . Both Idzik and Ryan were fired on December 29 , 2014 , the day after the season ended . 
 On January 13 , 2015 , the Jets announced the hiring of Mike <unk> , scouting director of the Houston Texans , as general manager . The following day , the Jets announced they had hired Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator Todd Bowles as head coach . Smith was injured in a locker room brawl in training camp , and journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick took over . After a slow start , the Jets got hot late in the season and had their playoff fate in their own hands going into a final week game at the Bills , coached by Ryan . The Jets lost , and a victory by the Steelers over the Browns put the Jets out of the playoffs , though they finished 10 – 6 . 
 Sportswriter Eskenazi , in his history of the Jets , wrote : 
 The Jets are in that pantheon [ of teams that have won championships ] . And they are housed there despite having only one title , one defining image . Because they have never repeated , there is the constant of failed expectations . Unfair , perhaps ... But this is the nature of sports . The Jets achieved such fame , such notoriety , became such a product and symbol of their times , that they also became a frozen icon . They can have life breathed back into them only by another great success . In the meantime , they and their fans have had to live with their moment in the sun .

 Frank was born Barnett Frank in Bayonne , New Jersey , one of four children of Elsie ( née <unk> ) and Samuel Frank . His family was Jewish , and his grandparents had immigrated from Poland and Russia . Frank ’ s father ran a truck stop in Jersey City — a place Frank has described as " totally corrupt " — and when Frank was 6 or 7 , served a year in prison for refusing to testify to a grand jury against Frank ’ s uncle . Frank was educated at Harvard College , where he resided in Matthews Hall his first year and then in Kirkland House and Winthrop House . He graduated in 1962 . One of his roommates was Hastings Wyman of Aiken , South Carolina , later a political consultant who in 1978 began publishing The Southern Political Report . When Wyman invited Frank to visit in Aiken in the early 1960s , Frank made a point of drinking from the since @-@ abolished " colored @-@ only " water fountain then available to African Americans . 
 Frank ’ s undergraduate studies were interrupted by the death of his father , and Frank took a year off to help resolve the family ’ s affairs prior to his graduation . In 1964 , he was a volunteer in Mississippi during Freedom Summer . He taught undergraduates at Harvard while studying for a PhD in Government , but left in 1968 before having completed the degree , to become Boston mayor Kevin White ’ s Chief Assistant , a position he held for three years . He then served for a year as Administrative Assistant to Congressman Michael J. Harrington .

 In 1979 , Frank was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts . While in state and local government , he taught , part @-@ time , at the University of Massachusetts Boston , the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard , and at Boston University . He published numerous articles on politics and public affairs ; in 1992 , he published Speaking Frankly , an essay on the role the Democratic Party should play in the 1990s .

 In 1980 , Frank ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 4th congressional district , hoping to succeed Father Robert <unk> , who had left Congress , following a call by Pope John Paul II for priests to withdraw from political positions . In the Democratic primary held on September 16 , 1980 , Frank won 52 % of the vote in a four @-@ candidate field . As the Democratic nominee , he faced Republican Richard A. Jones in the general election and won narrowly , 52 % – 48 % . 
 For his first term , Frank represented a district in the western and southern suburbs of Boston , anchored by Brookline and his hometown of Newton . However , in 1982 , redistricting forced him to run against Republican Margaret Heckler , who represented a district centered on the South Coast , including Fall River and New Bedford . Although the newly configured district retained Frank ’ s district number — the 4th — it was geographically more Heckler 's district . Frank focused on Heckler 's initial support for President Ronald Reagan 's tax cuts , and won with 60 % of the vote . 
 Frank did not face another serious race again for a quarter @-@ century . From 1984 to 2008 , he won re @-@ election 12 times with at least 67 % of the vote . 
 In 2010 , Frank ran for his 16th term . Public opinion polling showed him facing his first credible challenge since defeating Heckler in 1982 . His opponent was Republican Sean Bielat , a U.S. Marine veteran and businessman . In mid @-@ September , an internal poll showed Frank leading 48 % – 38 % . In late October , he loaned his campaign $ 200 @,@ 000 . In early October , the Cook Political Report changed its assessment of the district from " solid Democratic " to " likely Democratic " — meaning that while Frank was favored , a victory by Bielat could not be entirely ruled out . While Frank had a 3 @-@ to @-@ 1 advantage in terms of cash on hand , Bielat outraised him in September . On October 25 , a Boston Globe survey showed Frank leading 46 % – 33 % . Frank won re @-@ election to his 16th term , 54 % – 43 % . 
 On November 28 , 2011 , Frank announced at a news conference that he would not seek re @-@ election in 2012 .

 In 1985 Frank was still publicly closeted . That year he hired Steve Gobie , a male prostitute , for sex , and they became " more friends than sexual partners . " Frank housed Gobie and hired him with personal funds as an aide , housekeeper and driver and paid for his attorney and court @-@ ordered psychiatrist . In 1987 , Frank evicted Gobie after being advised by his landlord that Gobie kept escorting despite the support and was doing so in the residence . Later that year , Gobie 's friends persuaded him that he had a gay male version of Mayflower Madam , a TV movie about an escort service . In 1989 , Gobie tried to initiate a bidding war for the story between WUSA @-@ TV ( Channel 9 ) , the Washington Times , and The Washington Post . He then gave the story to The Washington Times for nothing , in hopes of getting a book contract . Amid calls for an investigation , Frank asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate his relationship " in order to ensure that the public record is clear . " The Committee found no evidence that Frank had known of or been involved in the alleged illegal activity and dismissed all Gobie 's more scandalous claims ; they recommended a reprimand for Frank using his congressional office to fix 33 of Gobie 's parking tickets and for misstatements of fact in a memorandum relating to Gobie 's criminal probation record . The House voted 408 – 18 to reprimand Frank . The attempts to censure and expel Frank were led by Republican Larry Craig ( whom Frank later criticized for hypocrisy after Craig 's own arrest in 2007 for " propositioning an undercover cop in a Minneapolis @-@ St. Paul airport bathroom " ) . Despite the controversy , Frank won re @-@ election in 1990 with 66 percent of the vote , and by larger margins until the 2010 Mid @-@ term elections when his victory margin went down to eleven points .

 Frank is known for his quick wit and rapid @-@ fire speaking style . In one quip , he said he was unable to complete his review of the Starr Report detailing President Bill Clinton 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky , complaining that it was " too much reading about heterosexual sex " . In 2004 and again in 2006 , a survey of Capitol Hill staffers published in Washingtonian gave Frank the title of the " brainiest " , " funniest " , and " most eloquent " member of the House . In 2008 , the same survey named him " brainiest " , and runner up for " workhorse " , and " most eloquent " ; in 2010 , he was named " brainiest " , " workhorse " , and " funniest " . He is also widely considered to have been , during his tenure , one of the most powerful members of Congress . Democratic speech writer Josh <unk> , in his book Ripples of Hope : Great American Civil Rights Speeches , describes Frank as " one of the brightest and most energetic defenders of civil rights issues . "

 Frank was criticized by conservative organizations for campaign contributions totaling $ 42 @,@ 350 between 1989 and 2008 . Bill Sammon , the Washington managing editor for Fox News Channel , claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs , and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the years leading up to the Economic crisis of 2008 . In 2006 , a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they " did not participate in large amounts of these non @-@ traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005 . " In response to criticism , Frank said , " In 2004 , it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages , because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low @-@ income people . And I said at the time , ' Hey — ( a ) this is going to jeopardize their profitability , but ( b ) it 's going to put people in homes they can 't afford , and they 're gonna lose them . ' " 
 In 2009 Frank responded to what he called " wholly inaccurate efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats , and [ me ] in particular " for the subprime mortgage crisis , which is linked to the financial crisis of 2007 – 2009 . He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations , but met resistance from Republicans , with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush . The 2005 bill included Frank objectives , which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing . Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee , and it passed the House . But the Senate never voted on the measure , in part because President Bush was likely to veto it . " If it had passed , that would have been one of the ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing , " Oxley told Frank . In an op @-@ ed piece in the Wall Street Journal , Lawrence B. Lindsey , a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush , wrote that Frank " is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters . " Once control shifted to the Democrats , Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act ( H.R. 1427 ) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti @-@ Predatory Lending Act ( H.R. <unk> ) to passage in 2007 . Frank also said that the Republican @-@ led Gramm – Leach – Bliley Act of 1999 , which repealed part of the Glass – Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks , contributed to the financial meltdown . Frank stated further that " during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . In 2007 , a few months after I became the Chairman , the House passed a strong reform bill ; we sought to get the [ Bush ] administration 's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008 ; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush 's desk in July 2008 . Moreover , " we were able to adopt it in nineteen months , and we could have done it much quicker if the [ Bush ] administration had cooperated . "

 As former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , beginning in 2007 , Frank was " at the center of power " . Frank has been a critic of aspects of the Federal Reserve system , partnering with some Republicans in opposition to some policies . Frank says that he and Republican Congressman Ron Paul " first bonded because we were both conspicuous <unk> at the Temple of the Fed and of the High Priest Alan Greenspan . " 
 Frank has been involved in mortgage foreclosure bailout issues . In 2008 Frank supported passage of the American Housing Rescue & Foreclosure Prevention Act , intended to protect thousands of homeowners from foreclosure . This law , H.R. 3221 , is considered one of the most important and complex issues on which he worked . In an August 2007 op @-@ ed piece in Financial Times , Frank wrote , " In the debate between those who believe in essentially unregulated markets and others who hold that reasonable regulation diminishes market excesses without inhibiting their basic function , the subprime situation unfortunately provides ammunition for the latter view . " Frank was also instrumental in the passage of H.R. <unk> , the Credit Cardholders ' Bill of Rights Act of 2008 , a measure that drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates . In 2007 . Frank co @-@ sponsored legislation to reform the Section 202 refinancing program , which is for affordable housing for the elderly , and Section 811 disabled programs . Frank has been a chief advocate of the National Housing Trust Fund , which was created as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and was the first affordable housing program to be enacted by the Congress since 1990 . 
 During the subprime mortgage crisis , Frank was characterized as " a key deal @-@ maker , an unlikely bridge between his party 's left @-@ wing base and [ ... ] free market conservatives " in the Bush administration . Hank Paulson , the U.S. Treasury Secretary for the Bush administration , said he enjoyed Frank 's penchant for brokering deals , " he is looking to get things done and make a difference , he focuses on areas of agreement and tries to build on those . " 
 The New York Times noted that the Federal Housing Administration 's crucial role in the nation 's housing market , providing low @-@ down @-@ payment mortgages during the crisis of 2007 – 2010 when no mortgages would otherwise have been available , " helped avert full @-@ scale disaster " by helping people purchase or refinance homes and thereby putting a floor under falling home prices . However , due to the tighter flow of credit from the banks , total FHA loans in 2009 were four times that of 2006 , raising concern that year that if the economy were to dip back into recession , more Fed funds could be required to keep those loans afloat . Frank 's response was that the additional defaults — 2 @.@ 2 % more of the total portfolio in 2009 than the year before — were worth the economic stabilization of the broader policy , noting " It was an effort to keep prices from falling too fast . " In that context , he opined , " I don 't think it 's a bad thing that the bad loans occurred . " In fact , the unprecedented number of loans made since 2008 were noted to be performing far better than those in the prior two years .

 In 1987 , Frank was the Chair of the important House Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations in the 100th Congress . In this position , he was one of the staunchest supporters of redress and reparations for Japanese American internment during World War II . In 2001 , Frank co @-@ sponsored an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to apply equal rights based on gender differences .

 In 2006 , Frank was one of three Representatives to oppose the Respect for America 's Fallen Heroes Act , which restricted protests ( notably those of Fred Phelps ' Westboro Baptist Church ) at soldiers ' funerals . He opposed the bill , which passed unanimously in the Senate , on civil liberties and constitutional grounds . Frank said of the vote , " I think it 's very likely to be found unconstitutional . It 's true that when you defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things ... You play into their hand when you let them provoke you into overdoing it . I don 't want these thugs to [ make the ] claim [ that ] America is hypocritical . " The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People scored him at 100 % in 2006 indicating a pro @-@ affirmative @-@ action stance . 
 In 2007 , Frank co @-@ sponsored the " Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act " ( <unk> / <unk> ) to " provide benefits to domestic partners of Federal employees " . That same year , he co @-@ sponsored the " Equal Rights Amendment " ( <unk> / <unk> ) to " strengthen the ongoing efforts of women across the country to obtain equal treatment . " In 2009 , he signed bills recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots and the 100th anniversary of the NAACP . 
 Frank has been outspoken on many civil rights issues , including lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) rights . In 1987 , he publicly came out as gay . In 1990 , Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act , which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country . The act did not include " sexual preference exclusion [ s ] " , reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance " afflict [ ion ] " . He said in a 1996 interview : " I 'm used to being in the minority . I 'm a left @-@ handed gay Jew . I 've never felt , automatically , a member of any majority . " In 1995 , then @-@ Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey famously referred to Frank as " Barney Fag " in a press interview . Armey apologized and said it was " a slip of the tongue " . Frank did not accept Armey 's explanation , saying " I turned to my own expert , my mother , who reports that in 59 years of marriage , no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag . " In 1998 , Frank founded the National Stonewall Democrats , the national LGBT Democratic organization . 
 In 2006 , Frank and incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were accused by Rep. John Hostettler ( R @-@ IN ) of having a " radical homosexual agenda " ; Frank responded " I do have things I would like to see adopted on behalf of LGBT people : they include the right to marry the individual of our choice ; the right to serve in the military to defend our country ; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications . I acknowledge that this is an agenda , but I do not think that any self @-@ respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people 's rights to get married , join the army , and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform . " Frank 's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the " Frank Rule " whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power , position , or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed . The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006 , during which Frank clarified his position on HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher : " I think there 's a right to privacy . But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy . And people who want to demonize other people shouldn 't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves . " 
 In February 2009 , Frank was one of three openly gay members of Congress , along with Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Jared Polis of Colorado . In April 2009 , Frank was named in the LGBT magazine Out 's " Annual Power 50 List " , landing at the top spot .

 Frank has partnered with Ron Paul in support of online gambling rights .

To restore online gambling rights , in 2007 Frank sponsored H.R. 2046 , the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act . This bill would have established licensing and regulation of online gaming sites . It provided for age verification and protections for compulsive gamblers . In 2008 , he and Paul introduced H.R. 5767 , the Payment Systems Protection Act , a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 while the United States Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined " unlawful Internet gambling " . As a result of these efforts , Frank ( who does not gamble ) has been praised by poker players and online gamblers , including many Republicans .

 Frank has been a determined supporter of the State of Israel . " The Israeli government has been a wholly democratic one from the beginning , " he said in a lecture to students .

 In August 2009 , a confidential memo written by the consul general of Israel in Boston , <unk> Tamir , was leaked to the Israeli media . In the memo , Tamir said that Israel 's dealings with the Obama administration on differences over settlements were eroding US support .

 In the wake of the fiscal cliff legislation at the start of 2013 , Frank stated that he was interested in the interim appointment that Governor Deval Patrick was expected to make to fill John Kerry 's U.S. Senate seat once the latter resigns to serve as United States Secretary of State . Frank had initially said he was not interested in the seat , but went on to change his mind , noting that " that [ fiscal cliff ] deal now means that February , March , and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial history " . He has said he will not run in the special election which will be held to fill the seat for the remainder of Kerry 's term . At the end of January 2013 , Governor Patrick named associate Mo Cowan to the seat for the interim term .

On July 7 , 2012 , Frank married Ready , his longtime partner , at Boston Marriott Newton in suburban Boston . 
 As of 2010 , Frank 's net worth is estimated by the Center for Responsive Politics to be between $ 619 @,@ 024 and $ 1 @,@ 510 @,@ 000 . His sister , Ann Lewis , served as a senior adviser in Hillary Clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign . 
 On August 3 , 2013 , Frank expressed sympathy with the host 's atheism on the television program Real Time with Bill Maher . In his biography , however , Frank states unequivocally that he is not an atheist and is uncomfortable expressing firm views on question for which he is unable to provide an answer . Frank 's agnosticism led him to resolve ( if he had been appointed as interim Senator ) to take the Oath of office on the United States Constitution , rather than the Bible . For most of his life and entire Congressional career , Frank was known as a Jew . Frank continues to identify strongly with the Jewish community and has been careful throughout his career that his agnosticism not reflect negatively on other Jews . For example , when he stopped going to temple services on High Holy Days he was careful to remain at home and out of the public eye in order that other Jews would not be criticized using his example . 
 = = = Sexuality = = = 
 According to Stuart Weisberg 's 2009 biography Barney Frank : The Story of America 's Only Left @-@ Handed , Gay , Jewish Congressman , Frank dated women in an effort to deny his homosexuality . His last romance with a woman was a nearly two @-@ year @-@ long affair with Irish @-@ American Catholic Kathleen Sullivan , a Boston School Committee member and the daughter of New England Patriots owner Billy Sullivan , that began in 1974 . When the two split up , at Frank 's instigation , he admitted to her that he was gay . He was still closeted publicly . According to Frank , he " realized it was crazy " to try to have a romance with someone he cared for but was not compatible with due to his homosexuality . " That was the last effort to avoid being gay , " Weisberg quotes Frank as saying . Frank never again dated a woman . 
 Frank started coming out as gay to friends before he ran for Congress and came out publicly on May 30 , 1987 , " prompted in part by increased media interest in his private life " and the death of Stewart McKinney , " a closeted bisexual Republican representative from Connecticut " . Frank told The Washington Post after McKinney 's death that there was " An unfortunate debate about ' Was he or wasn 't he ? Didn 't he or did he ? ' I said to myself , I don 't want that to happen to me . " Frank 's announcement had little impact on his electoral prospects . Shortly after coming out , Frank met and began dating Herb Moses , an economist and LGBT activist ; their relationship lasted for eleven years until an amicable break @-@ up in July 1998 . Moses , who was an executive at Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998 , was the first partner of an openly gay member of Congress to receive spousal benefits and the two were considered " Washington 's most powerful and influential gay couple " .

The population was 190 @,@ 695 at the 2010 census ( 105 @,@ 486 in Potter County , and 85 @,@ 209 in Randall ) . The Amarillo metropolitan area has an estimated population of 236 @,@ 113 in four counties . 
 Amarillo , originally named Oneida , is situated in the Llano Estacado region . The availability of the railroad and freight service provided by the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad contributed to the city 's growth as a cattle marketing center in the late 19th century . 
 The city was once the self @-@ proclaimed " Helium Capital of the World " for having one of the country 's most productive helium fields . The city is also known as " The Yellow Rose of Texas " ( as the city takes its name from the Spanish word for yellow ) , and most recently " Rotor City , USA " for its V @-@ 22 Osprey hybrid aircraft assembly plant . Amarillo operates one of the largest meat packing areas in the United States . Pantex , the only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility in the country , is also a major employer . The location of this facility also gave rise to the nickname Bomb City . The attractions Cadillac Ranch and Big Texan Steak Ranch are located adjacent to Interstate 40 . U.S. Highway 66 also passed through the city .

 Large ranches exist in the Amarillo area : among others , the defunct <unk> Ranch and the still functioning JA Ranch founded in 1877 by Charles Goodnight and John George Adair . Goodnight continued the partnership for a time after Adair 's death with Adair 's widow , Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair , who was then the sole owner from 1887 until her death in 1921 . 
 During April 1887 , J.I. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well @-@ watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad , which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle . Berry and Colorado City , Texas merchants wanted to make their new town site the region 's main trading center . On August 30 , 1887 , Berry 's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County . Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast @-@ growing cattle marketing center . 
 The settlement originally was called Oneida ; it would later change its name to Amarillo , which probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek , named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores ( Amarillo is the Spanish word for the color yellow ) . Early residents originally pronounced the city 's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation / <unk> / ah @-@ mə @-@ REE @-@ <unk> , which later gave way to the current pronunciation . 
 On June 19 , 1888 , Henry B. Sanborn , who is given credit as the " Father of Amarillo , " and his business partner Joseph F. Glidden began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry 's site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms . Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city 's site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings . His incentives gradually won over people , who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district . Heavy rains almost flooded Berry 's part of the town in 1889 , prompting more people to move to Sanborn 's location . This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn 's town the new county seat in 1893 . 
 By the late 1890s , Amarillo had emerged as one of the world 's busiest cattle shipping points , and its population grew significantly . The city became a grain elevator , milling , and feed @-@ manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s . Discovery of gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area . 
 The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium plant two years later . The plant would be the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years . The U.S. National Helium Reserve is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility . 
 Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad , the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railroad established services to and from Amarillo . Each of these three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community . 
 In 1929 , Ernest O. Thompson , a decorated World War I general and a major businessman in Amarillo , was elected mayor to succeed Lee Bivins . Thompson instituted a major capital improvements project and worked to reduce utility rates . He joined the Texas Railroad Commission by appointment in 1933 and was elected to full terms in 1934 , 1940 , 1946 , 1952 , and 1958 . He became an international expert on national petroleum and natural gas production and conservation . The first Mrs. Thompson , May Peterson Thompson , a former Metropolitan Opera singer , was involved in the arts while in Amarillo and later when the couple lived in Austin . 
 Amarillo was hit by the Dust Bowl and entered an economic depression . U.S. Routes 60 , 87 , 287 , and 66 merged at Amarillo , making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels , restaurants , and curio shops . World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant , which produced bombs and ammunition . After the end of the war , both of the facilities were closed . The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War . 
 In 1951 , the army air base was reactivated as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded to accommodate a Strategic Air Command B @-@ 52 Stratofortress wing . The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city 's depression . Between 1950 and 1960 , Amarillo 's population grew from 74 @,@ 443 to 137 @,@ 969 . However , the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31 , 1968 , contributed to a decrease in population to 127 @,@ 010 by 1970 . 
 In 1970 , the Census Bureau reported Amarillo 's population as 6 @.@ 1 % Hispanic and 88 @.@ 5 % non @-@ Hispanic white . In the 1980s , ASARCO , Iowa Beef Processors ( present day Tyson Foods ) , Owens @-@ Corning and Weyerhaeuser built plants at Amarillo . The <unk> neighborhood houses many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam , Laos , and Burma . Many of them found employment at the nearby Iowa Beef Processors plant . The following decade , Amarillo 's city limits encompassed 60 square miles ( 155 km2 ) in Potter and Randall counties . Interstate 27 highway connecting Lubbock to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s . 
 In 2006 , the historian Paul H. Carlson , professor emeritus at Texas Tech University in Lubbock , published Amarillo : The Story of a Western Town . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle . It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas . Amarillo sits closer in proximity to Oklahoma , New Mexico , Colorado , and Wyoming state capitals than it does to Austin . The region has a surface that is relatively flat and has little soil drainage . Due to the lack of developed drainage , much of the rainfall either evaporates , infiltrates into the ground , or accumulates in playa lakes . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 90 @.@ 3 square miles ( 234 km2 ) , with 89 @.@ 9 sq mi ( 233 km2 ) of it land and 0 @.@ 4 sq mi ( 1 @.@ 0 km2 ) of it ( 0 @.@ 50 % ) water . The Amarillo metropolitan area is the 180th @-@ largest in the United States with a population of 236 @,@ 113 in four counties : Armstrong , Carson , Potter , and Randall . 
 About 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of Amarillo is the Canadian River , a central corridor of the Southwestern Tablelands ecological region , which divides the Western High Plains ecological region . The southern divide of the Western High Plains is the Llano Estacado or <unk> Plains geographical region . The river is dammed to form Lake Meredith , a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region . The city is situated near the Panhandle Field , in a productive gas and oil area , covering 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 81 @,@ 000 ha ) in Hartley , Potter , Moore , Hutchinson , Carson , Gray , Wheeler , and <unk> counties . The Potter County portion had the nation 's largest natural gas reserve . Approximately 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of Amarillo is the canyon system , Palo Duro Canyon . 
 The underground structures known as Amarillo Mountains are an extension of the <unk> of Oklahoma and the Ouachita of Arkansas and Oklahoma . They are some thousands of feet underground . The range was discovered by pioneer oilmen . Some of the peaks are believed to be 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) high . The tallest peak is reported to be 2 @,@ 500 feet underground in northeast Potter County under the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument .

 Most of Amarillo 's population growth and commercial development are occurring in the southern and northwestern parts of the city . Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle , the city 's downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years . To help revitalize it , the organization Center City of Amarillo was formed to establish partnerships with groups who have a large presence in the city . Since its conception in the 1990s , Center City has sponsored public art projects and started block parties in the downtown area . 
 The 31 @-@ story Chase Tower was opened in Amarillo 's downtown in 1971 . Completed in the same year as the Chase Tower , the Amarillo National Bank Plaza One building houses the headquarters of Amarillo National Bank , the city 's largest financial institution . The Santa Fe Building , completed in 1930 , was the regional offices of the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway , but was vacant for several years until Potter County bought the building for $ 426 @,@ 000 in 1995 to gain new office spaces . 
 Amarillo 's historic homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places reflect the economic growth from around 1900 to the start of World War II . Polk Street contains many of the city 's historic downtown buildings and homes . The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown , and homes were located on the west side of the street as a symbol of status because they would be greeted with the sunrise every morning . 
 The City of Amarillo 's Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks , including a skatepark west of the city . Amarillo 's largest parks are Medical Park , Thompson Memorial Park , and Memorial Park , near Amarillo College 's Washington Street Campus .
