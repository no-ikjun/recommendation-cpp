 On 5 March 1988 , Drummond and Cauty released The KLF 's debut single " Burn the Beat " , an instrumental house music version of " Burn the Bastards " , on their own KLF Communications label . The single also featured instrumental remixes of other tracks from Who Killed The JAMs ? . All 5 @,@ 000 pressed copies of the single — catalogue number JAMS <unk> — were exported . On 18 April 1988 , another single , " Burn the Bastards " , was released in the UK , to fill the hitherto overlooked catalogue number KLF 002 . This single , also by The KLF , featured the LP version of " Burn the Bastards " alongside another instrumental version , " Burn the Beat ( Club Mix ) " . The single releases marked a change in direction of Drummond and Cauty 's music , to an upbeat and uptempo house music tone . Indeed , the record label of " Burn the Bastards " stated , " This is a transition record " . Neither " Burn the Bastards " nor " Burn the Beat " entered the UK Singles Chart , although the release peaked at number 15 in the UK Indie Singles Chart . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Burn the Bastards " is a celebratory house music song based upon Sly Stone 's " Dance to the Music " : a trumpet break and drum line are sampled , and the lyrical structure of that song is also mirrored . Whereas " Dance to the Music " vocally introduces the instruments used , so " Burn the Bastards " has Drummond sing of The JAMs ' methods , such as " All we need is a beatbox , for people who only need a beat " . The choral line " Dance to the music " is modified to " JAMs have a party " . 
 Referring to the fate of the 1987 LPs , Drummond sings " Build a fire , stoke it good , throw them on , and watch the bastards burn " , accompanied by a stark , ring modulated chorus , " Mu Mu ! " . A later portion of the lyrics alludes to New Year 's Eve 1987 : " Five to twelve , almost gone . 1987 , what the fuck have we done ? " . 
 A driving 4 / 4 rhythm and a sampled Roland TB @-@ 303 loop provide acid house overtones . These elements are brought further to the fore in " Burn the Beat " , which dispenses with Drummond 's vocals . 
 Most of The KLF 's work was highly self @-@ referential : lyrics were usually enigmatic narratives of The KLF 's real and fictional exploits , and vocal samples were re @-@ used in a variety of musical contexts . The signatory " Mu Mu ! " refrain , which first appeared on this song , recurred throughout the duo 's music , including " What Time Is Love ? ( Live at Trancentral ) " ( 1990 ) , " Last Train to Trancentral ( Live from the Lost Continent ) " and " America : What Time Is Love ? " ( 1991 ) , and " Fuck the Millennium " ( 1997 ) . 
 The song also contains samples of " Bad " by Michael Jackson .

 Announcing a change of name in January 1988 , Bill Drummond had said " We might put out a couple of 12 " records under the name The <unk> , these will be rap free just pure dance music , so don 't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers " . As predicted , " Burn the Beat " and " Burn the Bastards " attracted little attention from the music press . 
 Reviewing Who Killed The JAMs ? , Sounds described " Burn the Bastards " as " a JAMs manifesto " which " assumes a sinister edge alongside the pile of blazing copies of 1987 pictured on the sleeve " , citing the track as evidence that The JAMs were " defiant , outspoken , still a wily step ahead " .

 = Skagen = 
 Skagen ( IPA / <unk> / , Danish pronunciation : [ <unk> ̊ <unk> ] ) , is Denmark 's northernmost town and the area surrounding it . Occasionally known in English as The <unk> , it is situated on the east coast of the Skagen Odde peninsula in the far north of Jutland , it is part of Frederikshavn Municipality in Region Nordjylland . It is located 41 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of Frederikshavn and 108 kilometres ( 67 mi ) northeast of Aalborg . With its well @-@ developed harbour , Skagen is Denmark 's main fishing port and also has a thriving tourist industry , attracting some 2 million people annually . 
 Originally the name was applied to the peninsula but it now usually refers to the town itself . The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village , renowned for its herring industry . Thanks to its seascapes , fishermen and evening light , towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of Impressionist artists now known as the Skagen Painters . In 1879 , the Skagen Fisherman 's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the Skagensbanen railway , which opened as a narrow @-@ gauged railway in 1890 . The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907 , and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark , tourism began to develop . 
 In the early 1910s , Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies . They built the summer residence Klitgården , completed in 1914 . Between the 1930s and 1950s the town grew rapidly , with the population more than doubling from 4 @,@ 048 in 1930 to 9 @,@ 009 in 1955 . Skagen reached a peak population of 14 @,@ 050 in 1980 , after which it gradually declined . As of 1 January 2014 it has a population of 8 @,@ 198 . Thanks to the artistic community which still remains in Skagen , the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries . Chains such as the international jeweller Skagen Designs have branches in the town , and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen , seafood forms a staple in Skagen 's restaurants . 
 St Lawrence 's Church was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century , but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by Skagen Church in 1841 designed by Christian Frederik Hansen . It was redeveloped in 1909 – 10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen , including Klitgården and the railway station . Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them , including Brøndums Hotel , Skagens Museum , Michael and Anna Ancher 's House , and Drachmann 's House . 
 Skagen 's first school was the <unk> , a grammar school , which was in operation from 1549 until 1739 . By the end of the 19th century , three schools had been established in Skagen , and in 1921 , Skagen 's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships , and in 1955 , the public school <unk> skole was opened on <unk> . The primary gymnasium of the town , Skagen <unk> og <unk> , opened in 1972 , and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities . Skagen 's <unk> was completed in 1974 , primary to accommodate badminton and tennis . The local football club , Skagen <unk> Klub , was founded in 1946 and plays in <unk> , one of the lower divisions in Danish football . The Hvide <unk> Golf Club is located some 17 km ( 11 mi ) south of the town . 
 Skagen station is the most northerly railway station in mainland Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen . Nordjyske <unk> operates the local train service between Skagen and Frederikshavn with onward national connections by DSB . From Frederikshavn , there are ferries to Gothenburg and Oslo . Aalborg Airport with flights to destinations across Europe is located some 100 km ( 62 mi ) southwest of Skagen . As in other Danish cities , cycling is popular .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 Skagen was mentioned as far back as the first century AD by Pliny the Elder : 
 " <unk> <unk> <unk> in maria longe <unk> <unk> quae Tastris <unk> " ( Book IV , 97 ) 
 " The promontory of the Cimbri running far out into the seas makes a peninsula , which is called Tastris . " 
 This is the only time the name Tastris is mentioned but Skagen itself , first documented as <unk> in 1284 , simply means narrow promontory . 
 The first building in the area , dating from the 12th century , was in Højen on the west side of the peninsula . It belonged to <unk> , a shepherd who also became Skagen 's first fisherman . Around 1340 , Vesterby , on the east coast ( to the south west of today 's harbour ) , developed into the main village . Further to the south west , St Lawrence 's Church was built at the end of the 14th century . In 1413 , Erik of Pommern granted Skagen the status of market town with the result that for a time it became Vendsyssel 's largest community with up to 2 @,@ 000 inhabitants . 
 In 1549 a grammar school was opened ( closing again in 1739 ) , and in 1561 Skagen 's first lighthouse was constructed . In 1568 , some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked off the coast of Skagen . In the 1590s , successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding , destroying many of the houses . In 1591 , 22 died in a flood and in 1593 , 14 houses were washed away . In 1595 , 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand . As a result , new housing was built in Østerby to the north east , away from the rapidly accumulating sand . 
 = = = 17th – 19th centuries = = = 
 In the 17th century , fishing suffered from a decline in herring stocks . Shortly after the beginning of the <unk> War , the Swedish army arrived in Skagen in January 1644 , plundering the town . Skagen 's White Lighthouse with adjoining accommodation for the keeper was built in 1747 . In 1775 , accumulations of drifting sand made it difficult to access St Lawrence 's Church , finally leading to its closure and partial demolition in 1795 . Its remaining artefacts were sold by auction in 1810 . St Lawrence 's was replaced by Skagen Church , completed in 1841 and redesigned in the local style by Ulrik Plesner in 1910 . 
 On a single day in 1825 , 23 ships were left stranded off the coast . In 1833 , Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen , almost half a century before the arrival of the Skagen Painters . Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841 , and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844 . In 1858 , the grey lighthouse was inaugurated . The same year , bye @-@ laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years . Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853 . 
 Hans Christian Andersen visited the town in 1859 . During his stay at Brøndums Hotel , the future painter Anna Ancher , daughter of the inn @-@ keeper , was born . In 1871 , the author Holger Drachmann and the painters Fritz Thaulow and Karl Madsen arrived in Skagen , the first of the colony of artists which became known as the Skagen Painters . They were followed by Carl Locher in 1872 , Michael Ancher in 1874 and Peder Severin Krøyer in 1882 . 
 In 1879 , the Skagen Fisherman 's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the railway . In 1890 , the Skagensbanen narrow @-@ gauge railway from Frederikshavn finally arrived in Skagen , connecting the town to the rest of Denmark . The tracks were widened in 1916 to avoid the need to transfer cargoes of fish in Frederikshavn . Many of the town 's typical yellow @-@ plastered houses with red roofs which grew up along Sankt Laurentii Vej from 1890 to 1930 were designed by Ulrik Plesner . He was also the architect behind many other buildings in the town , including the railway station , Brøndums Hotel and Skagen Museum . Skagen <unk> was opened in 1896 . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 In 1904 @-@ 7 , the fishing harbour was built with inner and outer sections under the patronage of hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun . It was inaugurated on 20 November 1907 , and later additions were made for cold storage and the fish processing industry . The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll . 
 In the early 1910s , Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen in the royal yacht <unk> Dannebrog . Occasionally they arrived by train and brought friends from other European monarchies and stayed at the Brøndums and Grenen hotels . They grew fond of the place , befriending many of the artists in Skagen . Christian X bought up land in the vicinity and built the summer residence Klitgården as a gift for his wife . Designed by Ulrik Plesner , with furniture provided by Marie Krøyer , the villa was inaugurated on 11 April 1914 , with the town celebrating the royal opening with many flags . Klitgården was further embellished inside by local artists . It passed to Prince Knud and Princess Caroline Mathilde , and after Caroline 's death in 1995 , it was converted into a villa retreat for scholars in 2000 . Composer Carl Nielsen also frequented Skagen in his youth , and he purchased a plot of land on Vestre <unk> at Vesterby in 1918 with his sculptor wife Anne Marie Carl @-@ Nielsen , using one of the two small half @-@ timbered houses there as a residence and studio . They named it " Finis Terrae " , meaning " end of the world " . The Nielsen family owned the property until 1957 when they sold it to Frode Jensen , a machinery manufacturer . 
 In the 1930s , development of the town as a tourist attraction led to the opening of new hotels . In 1931 , the residents of Skagen and their famous friends campaigned for a monument to be established on the square in the town , commemorating the fishermen and lifeboatmen of Jutland . Anne Marie Carl @-@ Nielsen was commissioned to erect a 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) bronze statue of a lifeboatman in garb , holding a lifeline . The monument was showcased at the Free Exhibition Hall in Copenhagen in the spring of 1931 , before fundraising enabled it to be brought by sea to Skagen on 10 November 1932 . In October 1938 , lightning struck the Skagens <unk> , affecting the wing with the salons and music rooms . During World War II , the hotel was taken over by the Germans , until it was demolished in 1943 . Further facilities were developed in the 1950s . From the 1960s , housing estates were constructed to the north , forming a built @-@ up area extending to Højen . Anna and Michael Ancher 's house was opened as a museum ( 1967 ) and the new town hall was completed in 1969 . The Skagen Festival was founded in 1971 , making it the oldest music festival in the country . The primary genre is folk music . In 1977 , <unk> House was broken into and four paintings were stolen , and then in 1980 , a painting by Christian Krohg was stolen from Skagens Museum . 
 Several fires and industrial incidents occurred in the 1980s . In 1981 , an oil slick affected the coastline of Skagen municipality , and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at <unk> School . Skagen ice factory was affected by a chemical incident in 1989 . A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991 , while the local cinema was closed in 1993 . There was a major fire on the <unk> Heath dunes in 1996 . 
 = = Skagen Painters = = 
 The Skagen Painters were a group of Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until the turn of the century . They were attracted by the scenery , the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School . They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies , preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris . 
 The group was reputed to have adopted a bohemian lifestyle . It encompassed not only painters , but also writers , and other influential people . While only a few were full @-@ time residents of the area , they were often joined by family and friends , especially during the summer months . The group initially revolved around Michael Ancher and his wife to be Anna , the only member of the group who was a native of Skagen . P.S. Krøyer , who arrived in 1882 , was perhaps the most colourful member of the group . His painting Hip , Hip , Hurrah ! shows several of the artists celebrating around a table out in the garden . The painters included the Swedes Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén , the Norwegians Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen , and the Danes Karl Madsen , Laurits Tuxen , Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén , Carl Locher , Viggo Johansen and Thorvald Niss . The group also included the writers Holger Drachmann , Georg Brandes and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén . They often gathered in Brøndums Hotel whose dining room now forms part of Skagens Museum . 
 In 1890 , the railway to Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists . It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists ' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings . However , some of them purchased homes in Skagen : P.S. Krøyer in 1894 , Laurits Tuxen in 1901 , Holger Drachmann in 1903 . Anna and Michael Ancher , Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends . Other painters , sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters , continued to visit the area . They included Jørgen <unk> , <unk> and Gad Frederik Clement , Ella Heide , Frederik Lange and Johannes <unk> , some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later . Skagens Museum 's has a large collection of works from all the recognized artists who painted in Skagen . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Skagen is Denmark 's northernmost town , located 41 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of Frederikshavn , 108 kilometres ( 67 mi ) northeast of Aalborg , and 226 kilometres ( 140 mi ) northeast of Aarhus by road . It takes its name from the peninsula which projects into the waters between the North Sea and the straits of Denmark . The oldest areas lie along the south coast . Gammel Skagen ( Old Skagen ) , also known as Højen , is located next to Nordstrand on the western side . Vesterby and Østerby are notable for their little fishermen 's cottages and narrow streets . Danish national road 40 to Frederikshavn passes through Skagen . 
 The Skagen Odde peninsula is bordered by Ålbæk Bay ( Ålbæk Bugt ) to the east on the Kattegat and Tannis Bay ( Tannis Bugt ) to the west on the Skagerrak . The area is picturesque , and distinguished by its low , yellow houses with red tile roofs nestled into the beach areas . The wild landscape was largely formed by a severe process of desertification in the 18th and 19th centuries . Problems with moving dunes and desertification were subsequently brought under control in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses , bushes and fir trees . Two significant migratory dunes remain in the area , one of which is the enormous <unk> Mile . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Being surrounded by the sea in three directions , Skagen has a cool oceanic climate with a lack of temperature extremes . Its maritime and moderated characteristics is shared with the rest of the country . Skagen is Denmark 's sunniest town with an average of 233 hours of sunshine in the holiday month of July , higher than the 222 hours recorded for Bornholm 's <unk> .

 = = Economy = = 
 For generations , Skagen 's economy has been based on its fishing industry which continues to prosper today , facilitated by its fishing harbour , the largest in Denmark . Skagen also has the country 's main herring processing facility and the world 's largest fish oil factory . The town 's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11 @,@ 500 in the 1960s . A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour , and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts . 
 Tourism has now become the town 's main industry . Initially attracted by its associations with the Skagen Painters , well @-@ to @-@ do visitors sought to benefit from its special light , colour and its fishermen . Their interest led to new hotels , summer houses and expensive villas . The old fishing village was transformed into a miniature city with fine streets lined with boutiques . From the 1960s , it became increasingly fashionable for the upper @-@ classes to spend their summers in Skagen . 
 Galleries selling local art and reproductions of Skagen 's most iconic paintings have spread across the town , making it one of the places in Denmark with most galleries . Thanks to the town 's growing reputation , sailing enthusiasts from Norway , Sweden and Denmark are now also among its frequent visitors . The quality brand name of Skagen has spread far afield , resulting in the establishment of the successful American watch company Skagen Designs which " set out to create a design driven company centred around the welcoming spirit of the city " . Currently a new tourist initiative " The Top of Denmark " targets Skagen as a year @-@ round attraction , not just a summer resort . The harbour is also being adapted to accommodate large international cruise ships . A new 450 @-@ meter berth will be completed by 2015 while the existing 170 @-@ meter berth will be extended to 200 meters . Skagen now attracts some 2 million visitors a year to its hotels , restaurants , shops and galleries , making tourism a major source of income and employment . An annual attraction is the Skagen Festival , Denmark 's oldest music festival , which is held the first weekend of July at various venues in Skagen and the harbour area . The largest campsite in the Skagen area is Grenen Camping , situated about 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) northeast of the centre , adjacent to the beach . 
 Until 2007 , Skagen was a municipality in its own right with a substantial local administration . With the reforms of 2007 , it became part of Frederikshavn Municipality with a resulting loss in administrative jobs . The Bank of Skagen was established in 1862 , and in 1865 a telegraph station was established in the town . The pharmacy opened in 1904 , a hospital in 1916 , and telephone services were automated in 1956 . <unk> School was established in 1955 . Recently , Skagen has seen developments in the offshore sector with an initiative to assist the Norwegian market through the establishment of Skagen <unk> in 2012 . On the shipbuilding front , <unk> Skibsværft continues to prosper with orders for trawlers from Norway . 
 Currently the harbour is being enlarged in order to accommodate larger vessels , especially cruise ships . From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present . The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2 @,@ 000 today to some 2 @,@ 600 on completion . Karstens Skibsværft , Danish Yacht , and the herring processing firm , Skagerrak <unk> , are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen , the world 's top producer of fish meal and fish oil . 
 = = = Shops and restaurants = = = 
 Thanks to Skagen 's reputation as an artistic community , the local arts and crafts trade is also an important source of income and employment . Artwork and handicrafts are sold in galleries such as the Galerie Skagen on <unk> . Sankt Laurentii Vej , one of the main streets away from the harbour area in Skagen , is a known for its glass and pottery shops ; of particular note are Skagen <unk> , which produces some of " Jutland 's finest glass pieces " , and Skagen <unk> . In addition to its arts and crafts stores , the town has a wide range of shops , including jewellery , clothes and shoes , handbags , souvenirs , flowers and gardening equipment . There are also a variety of food stores with butchers , bakers , a cheese shop , fishmongers , and several restaurants and cafés . Skagen has a 1 @,@ 000 square metres ( 11 @,@ 000 sq ft ) branch of the <unk> supermarket , opened in 1998 . Skagen <unk> A / S is a local cement firm which produces concrete , paving stones , tiles , granite and other items . 
 Given the abundance of fresh fish coming it at the port of Skagen , seafood forms a staple of cuisine in Skagen . Of particular note is the Skagen Fiske Restaurant , one of the most renowned seafood restaurants in Jutland which was established in 1907 at the side of the harbour . It serves shrimp , herring , grilled fillets of sole with lemon sauce and Norwegian lobster . Ruth 's Gourmet in Ruth 's Hotel on Hans Ruth Vej is also of note and has been cited to be one of the top five restaurants in Denmark outside of Copenhagen , serving French cuisine under head chef Michel Michaud . <unk> Hotel was originally built by Emma and Hans Christian Ruth in 1904 as a bath and guest house . It was purchased by J. Philip @-@ Sørensen in 2003 . The Restaurant <unk> , the restaurant of the Brøndums Hotel , and Jakobs Café are also popular ; Jakobs Café is a music venue and bar at night . True foodies are also bound to visit the famous butcher Slagter Munch who is known for their sausages and for their ham : Skagen <unk> .

 = = = Northern headland and lighthouses = = = 
 At the headland at Grenen , the northernmost point of Denmark , the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet . Because of their different densities , a clear dividing line can be seen . As a result of turbulent seas , beachings and shipwrecks were common . These frequent losses combined with the town 's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark 's earliest lighthouses , <unk> , a lever light constructed in 1627 . A faithful copy has now been constructed on the site of the original . 
 The White Lighthouse ( det Hvide <unk> ) just north of the town is Denmark 's oldest brick @-@ built lighthouse . With a height of 21 m ( 69 ft ) , it was designed by Philip de Lange and lit for the first time in 1747 . In 1858 , it was replaced by the Grey Lighthouse ( det <unk> <unk> ) 2 km further north . Restored in 1960 , the White Lighthouse now houses art exhibitions . 
 = = = Churches = = = 
 The old village church from the 14th century is now known as The Sand @-@ Covered Church as only its tower can still be seen . Sand began drifting in from <unk> Mile around 1600 , the area surrounding the church becoming affected by the desertification which destroyed the fields . In 1775 , the church door had to be dug free for the congregation to be able to attend the service , and for the following 20 years , the <unk> struggled to keep the church free from sand , without being allowed to close it down . In 1795 the church was closed by royal decree and the body of the church demolished . A new church was built in 1841 to the design of Christian Frederik Hansen . The design was adapted in 1909 – 10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen . Plesner collaborated with Thorvald Bindesbøll on the interior . Anne L. Hansen created interior decorations and a new colour scheme in 1989 . A highlight of the year is the celebration of Midsummer Eve or St. John 's Evening ( Sankt Hans Aften ) on the beach with blazing bonfire and song .

 Towards the end of the 19th century , Skagen became the summer venue of a group of artists who were attracted by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes . Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel . Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher , P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen , who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian <unk> , the local pharmacist , and Degn Brøndum , who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher .

There is an old life @-@ saving station , a smithy , an old Dutch windmill , pictures of ships in distress and related nautical artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town 's history over various periods . 
 = = Education = = 
 Skagen 's first school was the <unk> , a grammar school , which was in operation from 1549 until 1739 . By the end of the 19th century , three schools had been established in Skagen : one in Vesterby , another in Østerby and a third in Højen . As a result of evolving legislation , a new public primary school ( <unk> ) designed by A. <unk> was completed in 1901 . A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils . A secondary school ( <unk> ) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on <unk> . Laurentii vej . The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended . An additional two @-@ storey wing was completed in 1969 . 
 In 1921 , Skagen 's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships . It is now the only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff . In 2012 , the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat . In 1955 , the <unk> <unk> skole was opened on <unk> , initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes . It has been extended several times over the years , most recently when a new wing was added in 2003 . The private school <unk> , a so @-@ called free school , opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach . A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils , teachers and parents .

 = St. Vrain massacre = 
 The St. Vrain massacre was an incident in the Black Hawk War . It occurred near present @-@ day Pearl City , Illinois , in Kellogg 's Grove , on May 24 , 1832 . The massacre was most likely committed by Ho @-@ Chunk warriors who were unaffiliated with Black Hawk 's band of warriors . It is also unlikely that the group of Ho @-@ Chunk had the sanction of their nation . Killed in the massacre were United States Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain and three of his companions . Some accounts reported that St. Vrain 's body was mutilated . 
 St. Vrain and his party were attacked while en route from Dixon 's Ferry , Illinois ( now Dixon ) to Galena , Illinois . St. Vrain had been ordered by General Henry Atkinson to deliver dispatches to Fort Armstrong . Colonel Henry Dodge 's men interred the remains of St. Vrain and his companions after the massacre . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 United States Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain was traveling with several companions which included , John Fowler , William Hale , and Aaron Hawley . Those men , along with St. Vrain , were all reportedly killed in the attack ; also traveling with St. Vrain was Thomas Kenney , Aquilla Floyd , and Alexander Higginbotham . 
 The Native Americans that attacked the group were not part of Black Hawk 's band of warriors but they were en route to join that group when the massacre occurred . Older histories described the group as a band of Sac warriors while modern sources indicate that the band were associated with the Ho @-@ Chunk nation . Black Hawk asserted that the group was Ho @-@ Chunk and unaffiliated with his band in his autobiography . 
 In fact , most Ho @-@ Chunk sided with the United States during the Black Hawk War . The warriors that attacked St. Vrain 's party acted with no authority or oversight from the Ho @-@ Chunk nation . As the war began to be defined along racial terms most white settlers in the region did not notice the distinction . This led to unwarranted fear of all Native Americans in the area , even those friendly to the settlers ' cause . One example of this appeared in an article published in the New Galenian on May 30 , 1832 . While the article described the events of the massacre it also went on to associate the murders of St. Vrain and his companions with the Sauk and Fox of Keokuk 's band . 
 " It is supposed by many , that these Indians belong to Ke @-@ o @-@ <unk> band We know nothing about it . Although Ke @-@ o @-@ <unk> 's band is supposed to be friendly , and are supplied with corn at the public expense , we acknowledge we have but little confidence in them . " <unk> Galenian , May 30 , 1832 
 Keokuk and his band were not near the scene when the murders occurred and had actually volunteered to assist white settlers against Black Hawk and his band of warriors . 
 = = Massacre = = 
 The St. Vrain massacre occurred near present @-@ day Pearl City , Illinois , in an area known as Kellogg 's Grove . Felix St. Vrain , a U.S. Indian Agent to the Sauk and Fox tribes , was in Dixon 's Ferry , Illinois , under the command of General Henry Atkinson prior to the massacre . 
 A group composed of Aaron Hawley , John Fowler , Thomas Kenney and Alexander Higginbotham had been purchasing cattle in Sangamon County , Illinois when news of trouble with Black Hawk 's band reached them . They immediately decided to return to northern Illinois to protect their homes . On May 22 , 1832 the men left Dixon 's Ferry for Galena , Illinois . At Buffalo Grove they discovered the body of William Durley , who had been killed in the Buffalo Grove massacre . The men immediately returned to Dixon 's Ferry to report their find and remained in the town overnight . 
 The following day General Atkinson returned to Dixon 's Ferry on with dispatches destined for Fort Armstrong . Atkinson ordered St. Vrain to travel with the Hawley party and deliver the dispatches to the fort . The men traveled north from Dixon 's Ferry and back to Buffalo Grove , where they interred the remains of Durley . They then traveled another ten miles toward Fort Hamilton before camping for the night . 
 The next morning , May 24 , they set out again , but stopped for breakfast after about three miles . As they finished eating , about 30 warriors approached . The men retreated , but four were shot and killed . Slain with St. Vrain were John Fowler , William Hale , and Aaron Hawley . An account of the massacre from Gen. George W. Jones , who was St. Vrain 's brother @-@ in @-@ law and the man who identified his body , said the warriors had scalped the dead men , but also cut off the hands , head , and feet of St. Vrain and removed his heart . They reportedly passed around pieces of the heart for the braves to eat . At least one source indicated that the mutilation began before St. Vrain was dead . 
 Three men , Thomas Kenney , Aquilla Floyd , and Alexander Higginbotham , managed to escape . They eluded the warriors and arrived safely in Galena , Illinois three days later . It is said that Aaron Hawley was initially able to retreat from the scene , but apparently was later killed as he fled . 
 = = ' The Little Bear ' incident = = 
 Frank Stevens in his 1903 history of the war , The Black Hawk War stated the attacker were Sauk and led by The Little Bear , a chief who had purportedly adopted Felix St. Vrain as a " blood brother . " Noting The Little Bear 's presence , St. Vrain allegedly had assured his companions that there was nothing to fear . The same claims were included in an 1887 book by Nehemiah Matson , Memories of <unk> . Matson 's narrative described St. Vrain 's allegedly pleading for his life with The Little Bear . 
 Perry A. Armstrong 's 1887 history dismissed the idea that The Little Bear had adopted Felix St. Vrain . Armstrong wrote that The Little Bear had never existed as a Sauk or Fox chief and said it was preposterous to think that a Sauk chief would have adopted St. Vrain as a brother . Matson , Stevens and John H. Kinzie , whom Armstrong 's information was in part based on , all identified St. Vrain 's assailants as Sac . They were more likely Ho @-@ Chunk . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 According to the New Galenian the three men who evaded the band that attacked the St. Vrain party , Floyd , Higgenbotham and Kenney , arrived in Galena at 7 a.m. on May 26 , 1832 . They provided their own description of events which the newspaper account detailed . However , at least one source indicated that Floyd was a victim of the massacre and his remains are interred in the cemetery with the other victims of the massacre at a public park within Kellogg 's Grove near present @-@ day Kent , Illinois . 
 Following the massacre a detachment led by Colonel Henry Dodge buried the bodies of St. Vrain and some of the other victims . Though Dodge and his men recovered the remains of St. Vrain , Hale and Fowler , the body of Aaron Hawley was never recovered . 
 = Italian cruiser Partenope = 
 Partenope was a torpedo cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1880s , the lead ship of her class , which included seven other vessels . The ship was built by the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia ; she was laid down in June 1888 , was launched in December 1889 , and was completed in September 1890 . Her main armament were her five torpedo tubes , which were supported by a battery of ten small @-@ caliber guns . 
 Partenope spent most of her career in the main Italian fleet , where she was primarily occupied with training exercises . In 1906 – 08 , she was converted into a minelayer , losing her torpedo tubes . During the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , she provided gunfire support to Italian forces in Libya . She was used to lay a series of minefields in the Adriatic Sea after Italy entered World War I in 1915 . In March 1918 , Partenope was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine UC @-@ 67 off Bizerte . 
 = = Design = = 
 Partenope was 73 @.@ 1 meters ( 240 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 8 @.@ 22 m ( 27 @.@ 0 ft ) and an average draft of 3 @.@ 48 m ( 11 @.@ 4 ft ) . She displaced 821 metric tons ( 808 long tons ; 905 short tons ) normally . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple @-@ expansion steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by four coal @-@ fired locomotive boilers . Specific figures for Partenope 's engine performance have not survived , but the ships of her class had top speeds of 18 @.@ 1 to 20 @.@ 8 knots ( 33 @.@ 5 to 38 @.@ 5 km / h ; 20 @.@ 8 to 23 @.@ 9 mph ) at 3 @,@ 884 to 4 @,@ 422 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 896 to 3 @,@ 297 kW ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 1 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 96 – 121 . 
 Partenope was armed with a main battery of one 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) / 40 gun and six 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) / 43 guns mounted singly.α She was also equipped with three 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) / 20 guns in single mounts . Her primary offensive weapon was her five 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to 1 @.@ 6 in ( 41 mm ) thick ; her conning tower was armored with the same thickness of steel plate . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Partenope was laid down on 8 June 1888 at the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia ( Royal Dockyard in Castellammare di Stabia ) , and was launched on 23 December 1889 . After fitting @-@ out work was completed , the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 11 September 1890 . Throughout the first decade of her career , Partenope primarily served with the main Italian fleet in the 2nd Division , which was usually kept in reserve . The reserve ships were typically only kept in service for three months of the year for annual training maneuvers , while the 1st Division was on active status for nine months per year . 
 In 1893 , Partenope was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Italian fleet , along with the ironclad Enrico Dandolo and the protected cruiser Vesuvio . By 1895 , the 2nd Division consisted of the ironclads Sardegna and Ruggiero di Lauria , along with Partenope . Partenope joined the ironclads Re Umberto , Sardegna , Ruggiero di Lauria , and Andrea Doria and the cruisers Stromboli and Etruria for a visit to Spithead in the United Kingdom in July 1895 . All of the ships , save Sardegna and Ruggiero di Lauria , joined an international naval demonstration in late 1895 off Crete during a period of tension between Greece and the Ottoman Empire that culminated in the Greco @-@ Turkish War . By 1899 , the division consisted of the ironclads Affondatore , Castelfidardo , and Sicilia and her sister ship Urania in addition to Partenope . During 1901 , Partenope was joined by the ironclads Dandolo , Andrea Doria , and Francesco Morosini , the armored cruiser Carlo Alberto , and three torpedo boats . 
 By 1904 , the Italian fleet had expanded enough to increase the 1st Division to the 1st Squadron ; this unit spent seven months in commission for training and five in reserve . Partenope was transferred to the new unit , along with her sister Minerva . The 1st Squadron included six battleships , four other cruisers , and nine destroyers . Between 1906 and 1908 , the ship was modernized and converted into a minelayer . She received new oil @-@ fired boilers and had her armament reduced to two 3 in ( 76 mm ) guns , four 57 mm guns and two 37 mm guns . Partenope 's speed was reduced to 17 @.@ 05 knots ( 31 @.@ 58 km / h ; 19 @.@ 62 mph ) on 2 @,@ 481 ihp ( 1 @,@ 850 kW ) . The ship was now equipped to carry sixty naval mines , with a bank of thirty mines on a platform on each side of the ship . 
 At the start of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in September 1911 , Partenope was attached to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Italian fleet . By this time , she was being used as a minelayer . On 9 November , she , the armored cruiser Carlo Alberto , the protected cruiser Liguria , and the torpedo boat <unk> provided critical gunfire support that broke a series of Ottoman attacks on the city of Tripoli . A month later , Partenope , Liguria , and the torpedo boats <unk> and Euro conducted a series of bombardments on the ports of Zuwarah , Misrata , and <unk> . Partenope then returned to Tripoli , where she continued providing gunfire support to the defending Italian garrison there . She and the ironclads Sardegna and Re Umberto bombarded the oasis at Taguira , though no Turkish forces were present . The Italians then sent a garrison to protect the oasis . 
 Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I , but by July 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers . Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the Italian naval chief of staff , believed that the threat from Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way . Instead , Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Partenope was initially used to lay a series of defensive minefields , along with her sister Minerva and the cruiser Goito , in support of this strategy . On 24 March 1918 , the German U @-@ boat UC @-@ 67 torpedoed and sank Partenope north of Bizerte , Tunisia , at coordinates 37 ° 53 ′ N 10 ° 10 ′ E. 
 = HMS Tabard ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Tabard was a British submarine of the third group of the T class . She was built by Scotts , Greenock , and launched on 21 November 1945 . So far she has been the only boat of the Royal Navy to bear the name Tabard , after the item of clothing . Having been launched after the war , she was selected , along with a number of boats of her class , to try out new streamlining techniques based on the German Type XXIII submarine . In May 1963 , she was involved in a collision with HMAS Queenborough , and on 10 February 1964 she underwent exercises with HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager in the hours before their collision . When she returned to the UK , she became the static training submarine at the shore establishment HMS Dolphin , until 1974 when she was sold and broken up . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Tabard had been originally ordered from Vickers Armstrong , Barrow , but the orders were switched to Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company , Greenock . Ordered as P. 342 , she was named Tabard in May 1943 after the Tabard , the official dress of a herald , and she is the only boat of the Royal Navy to bear the name . She was laid down on 6 September 1944 , and launched on 21 November 1945 before being completed on 25 June 1946 . It was one of fourteen boats ordered under the 1942 Programme , and was one of the five which were completed . Unlike some of the earlier boats of its class , it was not equipped with a 4 inch gun with a full shield , rather than a standard open gun mounting . Further aft , she had an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mounting which was modified for boats by having holes cut in the pedestal for drainage . Being from the third group , she has an all – welded hull , which increased her diving depth to 350 feet ( 110 m ) . 
 Following post war tests by the British Navy on German Type XXIII submarines , it was decided by the Admiralty to modify eight T @-@ class submarines to enlarge the batteries , increase the power of the motors and streamline the hulls . In 1950 , <unk> 's pressure hull was cut at the after end of the engine room and the submarine was lengthened by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . This gave enough room to add an additional battery compartment and a second pair of electric motors . The propulsion system was changed from direct to diesel – electric transmission . Along with HMS Trump , Tabard was one of two boats which were further modified by incorporating their bridge into a streamlined fin . Other streamlining adjustments were made to the hull with all external fittings removed , including the external torpedo tubes and gun . The periscopes , radar masts , snort mast and wireless mast were all incorporated into the new bridge fin . 
 = = Service = = 
 Tabard was commissioned after the end of the Second World War , initially being sent for Mediterranean duties . In March 1949 , she was one of a number of ships to take part in Operation Two Step , a training exercise which combined the bulk of the Home Fleet with the Mediterranean Fleet to make up the biggest concentration of British ships since Operation Torch in November 1942 . On 17 January 1950 , along with HMS Chequers carrying Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , she escorted HMS Surprise carrying Admiral Sir Arthur Power to meet with Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia for talks at Jeddah . While being refitted in Malta during June 1950 , she was damaged by electrical cables being installed by a disgruntled workman . Reports in the British media arose a little over a month later , mistakenly attributing the damage to HMS Teredo . On 18 December 1950 , she rescued Roi Wilson , later captain of the Old Royal Naval College , after he and his observer James Hawker had downed their Fairey Firefly . 
 In 1960 , Tabard along with <unk> and Trump , joined the 4th Submarine Squadron in Sydney , Australia . She underwent a refit at Cockatoo Island in Sydney between 9 January 1961 and 26 March 1962 , becoming the submarine to be refitted there . There , they operated with units of the Far East Fleet , the Royal Australian Navy , and the Royal New Zealand Navy . In April 1963 she collided with a wharf when docking in Brisbane , damaging her ASDIC sonar equipment . On 8 May , Tabard was involved in a further minor collision with Royal Australian Navy frigate HMAS Queenborough , following a week of anti @-@ submarine training exercises . Tabard was at periscope depth when Queenborough passed above her , bending the submarine 's fin and the frigate 's keel and port propeller . Both vessels were able to safely return to Sydney , where they docked at naval base HMAS Kuttabul for repairs . 
 On 10 February 1964 , she participated in anti – submarine exercises with the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne and the destroyer HMAS Voyager , finishing at 1800 hours that day . Less than three hours later , Voyager sailed under Melbourne 's bow and was cut in two and sunk , killing 82 of her crew in what was to become known as the Voyager Incident . Later that year in June , she participated in the NEWS EX anti – submarine exercise in the Hauraki Gulf off the coast of New Zealand . 
 She underwent a second refit at Cockatoo Island between 9 October 1964 and 10 December 1965 , due to the extensive repairs required to her fin , casings and salt water systems . Following the establishment of the 1st Australian Submarine Squadron in 1967 , the 4th Submarine Squadron returned to the UK , however Tabard along with Trump remained behind on loan to the Royal Australian Navy . Tabard returned to the United Kingdom in March 1968 . She was permanently moored as a static training submarine at the HMS Dolphin shore @-@ establishment from 1969 until 1974 , when she was replaced by HMS Alliance . 
 Tabard was the last T @-@ class boat in service with Royal Navy , albeit non @-@ operationally . She was finally sold for scrap on 2 January 1974 , arriving at the breakers on 14 March 1974 . During her service , she spent two years in the Mediterranean and eight years in Australia , covering 253 @,@ 349 miles . 
 = Towel Power = 
 Towel Power is a term used by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) to describe the waving of rally towels by their fans . The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks . During game two of the series , head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel on the end of a hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating . Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4 – 1 . When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game . The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders . As part of the tradition , the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team .

 Late in the 1981 – 82 season the Vancouver Canucks played a game against the Quebec Nordiques in Quebec City . During the game Canucks ' enforcer , Tiger Williams was punched by a fan . In response Canucks ' head coach Harry Neale went into the crowd to " get the fan " and a few players followed suit . For his actions NHL President John Ziegler suspended Neale for eight games . Neale 's suspension began with four games remaining in the season and assistant coach Roger Neilson took over the head coaching duties for Neale . Vancouver finished the year with a 30 – 33 – 17 record , second in the Smythe Division and qualified them for the playoffs . Neale 's suspension then carried over for the first four games . Despite the losing record the Canucks finished the year with an eight @-@ game unbeaten streak , which continued into their first round match @-@ up with the Calgary Flames . Vancouver swept the Flames in three straight games advancing to the second round where they faced the Los Angeles Kings . With Canucks ' General Manager Jake Milford retiring and Neale set to replace him , Neale told Milford to keep Neilson as head coach for the remainder of the playoffs , believing the team had bonded under his guidance . With Neilson remaining as head coach , the Canucks eliminated the Kings in five games and advanced to the Campbell Conference Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks .

 Vancouver won the first game of the series in Chicago 2 – 1 in double overtime , but fell behind in game two 3 – 1 . During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making questionable calls against them . A series of events in the third period ignited tempers . First , Vancouver had a goal disallowed . Soon after , there was a perceived non @-@ call against Chicago , followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks . Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4 – 1 . This enraged the Canucks ' bench . Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out " We give up , we surrender , we give up . " Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest . Neilson noted that he had done that before , and he had a better idea . He proceeded to take a white towel and place it on the end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock surrender . Some of the Canucks ' players followed suit . Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players .

While NHL executive vice @-@ president Brian O 'Neill stated that the mock surrender " disgraced the championship series , " Canucks ' captain , Stan Smyl , noted that several players were " surprised " by Nielson 's action because the coach had always been " respectful " , and it was an " extreme way for him to react " . 
 When the Canucks returned home , they were greeted by fans at the airport waving towels in support of the team . During game three , fans waved towels to show support for the Canucks . Former professional football player , wrestler , and five time world belly flop champion Butts Giraud got permission from the team to start selling towels with the phrase " Canucks Take no Survivors " . He initially had 5 @,@ 000 of them made at $ 1 apiece and sold 1 @,@ 000 of them right away , proceeds going to charity . Giraud would sell 30 @,@ 000 towels personally , the proceeds for charity amounted to $ 23 @,@ 000 . Vancouver won game three 4 – 3 to take the lead in the series . For game four there were more fans waving towels as the Canucks won again 5 – 3 . Vancouver won game five in Chicago and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals , where they were swept by the New York Islanders . 
 To continue the tradition , the organization produces 20 @,@ 500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game . Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated " It looks like the fans are really into the game and the atmosphere out there is something else , people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places . It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building . " As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson . Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson 's mock surrender which started towel power . 
 The first use of rally towels in professional sports was the Pittsburgh Steelers football team 's Terrible Towel , in 1975 . Minnesota Twins first used Homer Hanky towels in 1987 . In recent years , other NHL hockey teams have used rally towels at home games , including Anaheim Ducks Fowl Towels . 
 = The Boat Race 1976 = 
 The 122nd Boat Race , an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames , took place on 20 March 1976 and was won by Oxford by six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in 16 minutes 58 seconds , the fastest time in the history of the race . The race was umpired by former Cambridge rower Farn Carpmael . It was the first race in the event for which an official weigh @-@ in was held , and featured the heaviest rower ever in Steve Plunkett . 
 Oxford 's Isis won the 12th running of the reserve race against Cambridge 's Goldie , in a record time of 17 minutes 37 seconds . In the 31st Women 's Boat Race , Oxford defeated Cambridge . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a " hotly contested point of honour " between the two universities . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1975 race by five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , and led overall with 68 victories to Oxford 's 52 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The umpire for the race was Farn Carpmael , who had rowed for Cambridge in 1930 and 1931 races . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 By invitation from the Oxford boat club president Graham Innes , Oxford were coached by former Blue Dan Topolski while Cambridge were led by Czechoslovakian former international rower Bohumil Janoušek ( more commonly known as Bob <unk> ) . Preparations during the week before the race were underwhelming for both crews . Oxford 's performance against a University of London crew was described by Jim Railton of The Times as " abysmal " while Cambridge " disgraced themselves " in a subsequent two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ length defeat by their own reserve crew , Goldie . Both crews had faced the " <unk> Laboratory " crew from Imperial College London , a " hotbed of rowing " , in the lead @-@ up to the official race , but changes in personnel and differences in conditions and race lengths did not demonstrate a clear favourite . 
 The day before the race , British bookmaking company Ladbrokes announced that they would sponsor the race from the following year . From 1977 , each boat club would be awarded £ 10 @,@ 000 and would compete for The Ladbroke Cup . 
 = = Crews = = 
 For the first time in the history of the event , an official weigh @-@ in was held , organised by The Sunday Times and weighing machine manufacturers W & T Avery Ltd . Oxford 's crew was the heaviest of all time , at an average of just under 14 st 1 lb ( 89 @.@ 0 kg ) per rower , 4 @.@ 5 pounds ( 2 @.@ 0 kg ) more than their opposition , and the first time in the race history , a crew weighed more than an average of 14 st ( 88 @.@ 7 kg ) . The Dark Blue crew also included Steve Plunkett who , at 16 st 5 lb ( 103 @.@ 6 kg ) was the heaviest rower in the history of the race . The Cambridge crew were inexperienced , their only Blue being the Cambridge University Boat Club president Henry Clay who had rowed in the 1975 race . In contrast , Oxford welcomed back five of their 1975 crew including cox Ashton Calvert , and also included two from the victorious 1975 Isis crew . Two non @-@ British rowers participated , Americans Dick Cashin ( of Harvard ) for Cambridge and Ken Brown ( of Cornell ) for Oxford .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . Leading from the outset , and in calm river conditions , Oxford were a length ahead within a minute . Four lengths up by the Mile Post , which they reached in a record 3 minutes 35 seconds , the Dark Blues reduced their rating . Further milestone records were broken at Hammersmith Bridge , Chiswick Steps and Barnes Bridge . Oxford reduced their rating but still extended their lead to six lengths by the finishing post , in a record @-@ breaking time of 16 minutes 58 seconds , 37 seconds quicker than their 1974 colleagues who had previously held the record . Although Cambridge also beat the existing record , they finished a distant 22 seconds and six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths behind .

 Oxford coach Topolski said of his successful crew : " they got three [ lengths ] up , then they really sat on it and cruised . The enjoyed the row . It 's a natural thing when the other crew is so far behind . " He was critical of the Cambridge crew : " They didn 't really have a lot of talent . " 
 The official winning distance caused controversy . A discrepancy between the official margin ( six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths ) and those reported in various British newspapers , including The Sunday Times , The Daily Telegraph and The Times resulted in a delay in bookmakers paying out on winning bets .

 = Port of Skagen = 
 The Port of Skagen , also Skagen Harbour , ( Danish : Skagen Havn ) is located in Skagen , northern Denmark . The country 's leading fishing port consists of an industrial harbour that supports the area 's fishing industry as well as facilities for cruise ships . It also has a shipyard and fish @-@ processing facilities . The harbour 's marina is open to visitors during the summer months . 
 The fishing harbour was built between 1904 and 1907 , with inner and outer sections established under the supervision of hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun . The official inauguration was on 20 November 1907 . The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll , and opened in May 1908 . In 1932 , on the occasion of the harbour 's 25th anniversary , Anne Marie Carl @-@ Nielsen 's statue of the fisherman and lifeboatman was unveiled . The harbour was expanded to the east between 1935 and 1938 , and in the 1950s an 11 million krone ( kr ) expansion took place to the west , increasing the off @-@ shore area by 70 @,@ 000 square metres ( 750 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and the on @-@ shore area by 90 @,@ 000 square metres ( 970 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . Between 1964 and 1979 the harbour was further expanded towards the east in a 35 million kr project to facilitate growth at the port , doubling the size of the harbour and providing new facilities for auctioning the catches from the 400 fishing boats registered in Skagen . 
 The Skagen Port Authority is responsible for the harbour 's administration . FF Skagen , one of three companies supporting the Danish fish meal industry , has its processing plant on Skagen wharf . The harbour is being adapted to accommodate large international cruise ships . A new 450 m ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) berth to be completed by 2015 will also provide facilities for oil bunkering and enhanced facilities for the fishing industry . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Port of Skagen is situated in Ålbæk Bugt ( Ålbæk Bay ) . The harbour covers a total area of 1 @,@ 015 @,@ 000 m2 ( 10 @,@ 930 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , consisting of 645 @,@ 000 m2 ( 6 @,@ 940 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of land and 370 @,@ 000 m2 ( 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of water . The quays and moorings have a total length of 5 @.@ 5 km ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) , of which 970 m ( 3 @,@ 180 ft ) have a depth of 9 m ( 30 ft ) . The harbour consists of three main basins ( docks with water levels controlled by flood gates ) : <unk> <unk> , <unk> and Østhavn . The <unk> consists of Indre <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Vestre Bassin , while the Østhavn consists of Østbassin I and Østbassin II . Skagen <unk> ( Skagen 's pleasure boat harbour ) administers the area between Gamle Pier and Pier 2 in the <unk> . 
 The harbour can accommodate ships up to 130 metres ( 430 ft ) long and 20 metres ( 66 ft ) wide with a draft of 7 metres ( 23 ft ) . Ships less than 90 metres ( 300 ft ) long can moor at Quay 4 with a draft of 9 metres ( 30 ft ) . The largest vessel to have visited Skagen Harbour is the cruise ship Silver Cloud with a length of 156 metres ( 512 ft ) , which moored on Quay 4 in 2010 and 2011 . The <unk> ( marina ) between Piers 1 and 2 is open to visiting pleasure boats from 1 April to 30 September . While the Port of Skagen supervises the marina during the summer months , the facilities are used for berthing fishing boats in the off @-@ season . Frederikshavn Municipality is the official administrator . Facilities on Pier 1 include a diesel fuelling station at the end the pier and a barbecue . There is also a service building with toilets , showers , washing machines and dryers . <unk> internet access is available throughout the marina .

 = = = Early history and background = = = 
 After years of discussion between Skagen 's fishermen and the authorities , a commission was finally established in the 1880s , leading to an early proposal for a harbour by Customs Inspector Holm that was not accepted . Under pressure from the fishermen , the Minister of the Interior called on an engineer by the name of Berg to prepare a new proposal in 1888 . This finally led to parliamentary approval on 23 April 1903 , followed by a call for tenders on 26 January 1904 . On the basis of a bid from <unk> & <unk> og <unk> , work was initiated in February 1904 on Skagen 's <unk> ( south shore ) just outside the town . The work was supervised by the hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun who had reported on harbours in the Faroe Islands . 
 The design consisted of two breakwaters some 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) apart that stretched out to sea . With their outer extensions providing an entrance some 60 m ( 200 ft ) wide , the harbour covered an area of almost 160 @,@ 000 m2 ( 1 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . The basin was divided by two cross piers , creating an outer harbour and an inner harbour with an entrance 40 m ( 130 ft ) wide . A harbour @-@ master 's house , fish warehouse and a customs office were built in parallel . On 19 November 1907 , King Frederik VIII ceremonially opened the port in the presence of the Skagen Painters , who had decorated the facilities with flags . Carl Locher had designed an impressive gateway of honour . 
 In May 1908 , four fish warehouses on the quayside designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll were opened . In 1932 , on the occasion of the harbour 's 25th anniversary , Anne Marie Carl @-@ Nielsen 's statue of the fisherman and lifeboatman was unveiled . In 1935 , Johannes <unk> @-@ <unk> , Minister for Transport , announced that the government were funding a 900 @,@ 000 kr project to expand the harbour towards the east , involving a 100 metres ( 330 ft ) by 200 metres ( 660 ft ) basin with a depth of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) , designed to facilitate fisherman during the process of unloading . As a result , between 1935 and 1938 the harbour was expanded towards the east , and a new auction room was added in 1938 , 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in length and 12 metres ( 39 ft ) wide , with skylights and seven phone booths .

 In 1943 , the <unk> approved 7 million kr proposals to further expand the harbour towards the west . However , due to the German occupation during the war the project was postponed and it wasn 't until 1952 that construction began , rising to a budget of 11 million kr . The off @-@ shore area of the port was expanded by 70 @,@ 000 square metres ( 750 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and the on @-@ shore area was enlarged by 90 @,@ 000 square metres ( 970 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , with some 12 metres ( 39 ft ) of quay . Between 1964 and 1979 the harbour was further expanded towards the east in a 35 million kr project to facilitate growth at the port , doubling the size of the harbour and providing new facilities for auctioning the catches from the 400 fishing boats registered in Skagen . The off @-@ shore area was enlarged by 14 hectares and the on @-@ shore area with 120 hectares . A new auction room was erected between the fisheries inspection building and the auction office . In 1985 , the <unk> ( the Auction Basin ) of the port was deepened by some 7 metres ( 23 ft ) , as was the <unk> ( West Harbour ) in the early 1990s . 
 In 2001 , the Port of Skagen acquired autonomously governed harbour status , after the government sold off several of the national harbours . Under ownership of the municipality , a 12 @.@ 5 million kr investment was put into deepening the Østbassin 2 ( East Basin 2 ) and building a new 300 metres ( 980 ft ) quay to a depth of 9 metres ( 30 ft ) in its outer part . In 2007 , a new dry dock measuring 135 m ( 443 ft ) by 25 m ( 82 ft ) was built for <unk> 's wharf . Additional facilities for fish processing , including a refrigeration plant , were completed in 2008 . 
 = = Fishing = = 
 The Port of Skagen is Denmark 's largest fishing port and the first in Europe for landings of pelagic fish , primarily herring . Founded in 1960 , FF Skagen is one of three companies supporting the Danish fish @-@ meal industry ; its processing plant is located on Skagen wharf . As of 2011 , statistics from the Danish Fisheries Directorate list Skagen Harbour as the leading fishing port in Denmark in terms of both the quantity of catches and their value . Statistics for 2013 from <unk> showed a year @-@ on @-@ year increase in fishing takings of 10 percent for a total value of DKK 3 @.@ 4 billion ( c . US $ 621 million ) .

On the shipbuilding front , <unk> Skibsværft continues to prosper with orders for trawlers from Norway . There are also plans for establishing oil @-@ bunkering facilities for large vessels on the outer section of the new port . 
 In July 2014 , Berlingske reported that from 2015 the enlarged harbour was expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to only a dozen smaller ships at present . The larger vessels will carry up to 3 @,@ 500 passengers . Port of Skagen was covering the cost of the work which amounted to DKK 226 million ( US $ 41 million ) . The new harbour would provide new jobs increasing the workforce from some 2 @,@ 000 today to 2 @,@ 600 on completion .

 = Hôtel Ritz Paris = 
 The Hôtel Ritz is a grand palatial hotel in the heart of Paris , in the 1st arrondissement . It overlooks the octagonal border of the Place Vendôme at number 15 . The hotel is ranked highly among the most prestigious and luxurious hotels in the world and is a member of " The Leading Hotels of the World " . The Ritz reopened on 6 June 2016 after a major four @-@ year , multimillion @-@ dollar renovation . 
 The hotel , which today has 159 rooms , was founded by the Swiss hotelier , César Ritz , in collaboration with the chef Auguste Escoffier in 1898 . The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of an 18th @-@ century town house , overlooking one of Paris 's central squares . It was reportedly the first hotel in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite , a telephone and electricity for each room . It quickly established a reputation for luxury , with clients including royalty , politicians , writers , film stars and singers . Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel , including Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway who lived at the hotel for years . One of the bars of the hotel , Bar Hemingway , is devoted to Hemingway and the L 'Espadon is a world @-@ renowned restaurant , attracting aspiring chefs from all over the world who come to learn at the adjacent Ritz @-@ Escoffier School . The grandest suite of the hotel , called the Imperial , has been listed by the French government as a national monument in its own right . 
 During the Second World War , the hotel was taken over by the occupying Germans as the local headquarters of the Luftwaffe . After the death of Ritz 's son Charles , in 1976 , the last members of the Ritz family to own the hotel sold it in 1979 to the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al @-@ Fayed . In August 1997 , Diana , Princess of Wales and Al @-@ Fayed 's son , Dodi , dined in the hotel 's Imperial Suite before their fatal car crash . 
 The hotel is being entirely renovated in order to receive the ' Palace distinction ' which is a title bestowed by the French ministry of economy , industry and employment . It has been closed since 1 August 2012 and is now after four years finally accepting reservations beginning June 2016 . Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury , the hotel has featured in many notable works of fiction including novels ( F. Scott Fitzgerald 's Tender Is The Night and Hemingway 's The Sun Also Rises ) , a play ( Noël Coward 's play Semi @-@ Monde ) , and films ( Billy Wilder 's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon and William Wyler 's 1966 comedy How to Steal a Million ) .

 The site was purchased in 1705 by Antoine @-@ François <unk> de <unk> , and a private residence was constructed , which was occupied by several noble families and later became the Hôtel de Gramont . The façade was designed by the royal architect Jules <unk> Mansart . In 1854 it was acquired by the <unk> brothers , who made it the head office of their Crédit Mobilier financial institution . In 1888 , the Swiss hotelier César Ritz and the French chef Auguste Escoffier opened a restaurant in Baden @-@ Baden , and the two were then invited to London by Richard D 'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel , positions they held from 1889 until 1897 . The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success , attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele , headed by the Prince of Wales . In 1897 , Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy , when Ritz was implicated in the disappearance of over £ 3400 worth of wine and spirits . Before their dismissal , customers at the Savoy had reportedly urged them to open a hotel in Paris . Aided by Alexandre <unk> @-@ <unk> , Ritz purchased the palace and transformed the former Hôtel de <unk> building into a 210 @-@ room hotel . He stated that his purpose for the hotel was to provide his rich clientele with " all the refinement that a prince could desire in his own home . " He engaged the architect Charles Mewès to update the original 1705 structure . Ritz 's innovative standards of hygiene demanded a bathroom for every suite , the maximum possible amount of sunlight , and the minimum of curtains and other hangings . At the same time he furnished the hotel with all the old @-@ fashioned appeal of an English or French gentleman 's house , in order to make clients feel at home . 
 The hotel opened its doors on 1 June 1898 to a " glittering reception " . Together with the culinary talents of his junior partner Escoffier , Ritz made the hotel synonymous with opulence , service , and fine dining , as embodied in the term " ritzy . " It immediately became fashionable with Parisian socialites , hosting many prestigious personalities over the years , such as Marcel Proust , F. Scott Fitzgerald , Ernest Hemingway , King Edward VII , and the <unk> Coco Chanel , who made the Ritz her home for more than thirty years . Many of the suites in the hotel are named after their famous patrons . Hemingway once said , " When in Paris the only reason not to stay at the Ritz is if you can 't afford it " . Hemingway , who stayed at the hotel many times after World War II , was there when he learned his wife wanted a divorce . He reacted to the news by throwing her photo into a Ritz toilet and then shooting the photo and the toilet with his pistol . 
 In 1904 and 1908 , the Ritz garden café was painted by the Swiss artist , Pierre @-@ Georges <unk> . Proust wrote parts of Remembrance of Things Past here from around 1909 . The building was extended in 1910 , and César Ritz died in 1918 , succeeded by his son , Charles Ritz . Queen Marie of Romania stayed at the Ritz Hotel with her two eldest daughters , Elisabeth ( of Greece ) and Maria ( of Yugoslavia ) in 1919 while campaigning for Greater Romania at the Paris Peace Conference . Many other prominent royal figures and heads of state slept and dined at the hotel over the years . Edward VII reportedly once got stuck in a too @-@ narrow bathtub with his lover at the hotel . August Escoffier died in 1935 . In summer 1940 , the Luftwaffe , the air forces of Nazi Germany during the Second World War , set up their headquarters at the Ritz , with their chief Hermann Göring . 
 After the death of Charles Ritz in 1976 , the hotel went into a period of slow decline . As it lost its luster , its clientele diminished , and for the first time in its existence it began to lose money . It was rescued , however , in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman , Mohamed Al @-@ Fayed , who purchased the hotel for $ 20 million and installed a new managing director , Frank Klein . Klein in turn put Guy Legay , the former chef of the three @-@ star <unk> , in charge of the kitchen . Al @-@ Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation ; this was achieved by annexing two town houses , joined by an arcade with many of Paris 's leading boutiques . The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard <unk> from 1980 to 1987 . The entire ten @-@ year renovation cost a total of $ 250 million . The restaurants were given a new look , and a swimming pool , health club , and spas were created in the basement . The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar . In 1988 the Ritz @-@ Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier . 
 On 31 August 1997 , Diana , Princess of Wales and Al @-@ Fayed 's son Dodi Al @-@ Fayed , and their chauffeur Henri Paul , dined in the Imperial Suite of the hotel before leaving the hotel with bodyguard Trevor Rees @-@ Jones , only to have a fatal car accident in the Pont de l <unk> underpass . 
 In the 21st century , the Ritz remains possibly the most prestigious and luxurious hotel in the world and the finest and most expensive in Paris . It is referred to by some as the best hotel in Europe and one of the world 's most famous hotels . It is one of " The Leading Hotels of the World " . 
 On August 1 , 2012 , the Ritz closed its doors for the first time in its history for an extensive restoration . It was scheduled to reopen in late 2015 , but this date was later changed to March 2016 . At 07 : 00 local time on 19 January 2016 , a major fire broke out in the roof of the building . Fifteen fire engines and 60 firefighters attended . The Ritz reopened on 6 June 2016 after a major four @-@ year , multimillion @-@ dollar renovation .

 The palace and the square are masterpieces of classical architecture from the end of the reign of Louis XIV . The façade was designed by the royal architect Mansart in the late 17th century before the plot was bought and construction began in 1705 . The Hôtel Ritz comprises the Vendôme and the Cambon buildings with rooms overlooking the Place Vendôme , and , on the opposite side , the hotel 's garden . 
 The Ritz was reportedly the first hotel in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite , a telephone and electricity for each room . The Hôtel Ritz Paris is 4 floors high , including the mansard roof , and as of 2011 offers 159 rooms , a two @-@ Michelin @-@ starred restaurant , two bars and a casual dining restaurant .

 In the 1970s a travel publication Holiday wrote , " practically every royal head of state has <unk> under down quilts on the finest linen sheets , beneath fifteen @-@ foot @-@ high ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) ceilings in rooms looking out , through huge double windows , on the elegant Place Vendôme . " Frommer 's , which calls the Ritz " Europe 's greatest hotel " , describes the furnishings as follows , " the public salons are furnished with museum @-@ calibre antiques . Each guest room is uniquely decorated , most with Louis XIV or Louis XV reproductions ; all have fine rugs , marble fireplaces , tapestries , brass beds , and more . Ever since Edward VII got stuck in a too @-@ narrow bathtub with his lover , the tubs at the Ritz have been deep and big . " The bathrooms contain unique golden swan taps , and peach @-@ coloured towels and robes , believed to be more flattering than white to a woman 's complexion . 
 The Ritz is reputedly the most expensive hotel in Paris , employing a staff of over 600 , the rooms as of May 2011 started at € 850 a night . Suites start at € 3 @,@ 600 and up to € 13 @,@ 900 a night for the most lavish ones ( Suite Impériale being the most expensive ) . These finest suites are known as the " Prestige suites " , ten in total , which according to the Ritz are " a world for aesthetes where 18th century panelling echoes allegorical ceilings , old masters and priceless antique furniture . Each suite is unique and each seems to still breathe the spirit of the illustrious guests who once stayed there . " The Vendôme Suite is one of the most spacious of the hotel , containing Louis XIV furnishings , with a red and ivory theme and grand windows overlooking the square . The César Ritz Suite overlooks the square and contains Louis XV furniture and a portrait of Ritz himself . The room is decorated in shades of green and light yellow with a canopied bed in one room and silk floral pattern in the second . The doors of the sitting room of the suite are edged in gold leaf . The Elton John Suite , decorated in strawberry pink and cream , contains two bedrooms , a thick pink carpet and attic windows . John reportedly hired the entire floor for his 42nd birthday .

 Although there was necessarily a hotel restaurant from the inception of the Ritz , the current hotel restaurant , L 'Espadon ( The Swordfish ) was established in 1956 by Charles Ritz . He was a keen fishing enthusiast so named the restaurant after a fish . The restaurant is inspired by the legendary first chef of the hotel , Auguste Escoffier , serving " traditional French culinary style with contemporary overtones " . The cuisine is by the award @-@ winning chef Michel Roth , the ninth head chef of the hotel ; the restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide . The head chef was formerly Guy Legay , cited as one of Paris 's greatest chefs , who had served from at least 1986 to beyond 1999 . In 1999 , Esquire magazine wrote , " the dining room , L 'Espadon , down the long corridor of mirrors and display cases , has a glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl around you , and it 's easy enough to imagine Hemingway sitting down with Dietrich to a dish of chef Guy Legay 's buttery scrambled eggs ... " The restaurant decor is described as " opulent with trompe l ’ <unk> ceilings , <unk> drapes , and views into the garden . " The courtyard garden is rich in greenery and contains several statues and a fountain . The hotel hires five or so florists to provide fresh flowers . 
 = = = = Bars = = = = 
 The hotel has several bars , namely the Ritz Bar , Bar Vendôme , Bar Hemingway and the Pool Bar . The Ritz Bar , just inside the Rue Cambon entrance on the left , gained a reputation over the years for its glamorous cocktail parties and the extravagant concoctions of Frank Meier , head barman from 1921 until his death in 1947 . One of his best @-@ known cocktails was the potent " Rainbow " , consisting of <unk> , mint , yellow chartreuse , cherry brandy , <unk> , green chartreuse and cognac . The Ritz Bar is designed in the Victorian style with red @-@ velvet armchairs and bar furnishings , a marble fireplace and historic portraits . The Ritz Bar may have been the world 's first hotel bar . 
 Bar Hemingway was the favourite bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said by some to be the birthplace of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him . However , the fact that it is the actual birthplace is contested , given that Fernand <unk> claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry 's New York Bar , a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates , rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself . The bar has been restored to its original appearance , with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him . 
 Bar Vendôme is very popular with high class Parisians for afternoon tea and contains rich wood furnishings and a grand piano . During the summer months the doors are opened out onto the garden and terrace .

In The Da Vinci Code , the protagonist , Robert Langdon , stays at the hotel while in Paris , as do Andrea Sachs and Miranda Priestly in Lauren Weisberger 's The Devil Wears Prada . The final chapter of Ian Fleming 's James Bond novel From Russia , with Love is set at the hotel . The villain , Rosa Klebb , stays in room 602 and engages in a battle with Bond which results in her death .

In Billy Wilder 's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon , Hepburn initiates her romance with Gary Cooper in his suite in the hotel and much of the film is set there . The hotel is again seen in the 1966 movie How to Steal a Million , with a romantic scene between Hepburn and Peter O 'Toole in the hotel 's bar in which Hepburn wears an iconic Givenchy black lace <unk> and matching cocktail dress .

 = I syng of a mayden = 
 " I syng of a mayden " ( sometimes titled " As <unk> in <unk> " ) is a Middle English lyric poem or carol of the 15th century celebrating the Annunciation and the Virgin Birth of Jesus . It has been described as one of the most admired short vernacular English poems of the late Middle Ages . 
 Written by an anonymous hand , the text is now only to be found in the Sloane Manuscript 2593 , a collection of medieval lyrics now held in the British Library , although contemporary sources suggest it was well known in its day . Originally intended to be sung , no evidence of the work 's musical setting survives , and since its rediscovery and popularisation it has formed the basis for a number of modern choral and vocal works . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The work has been described by Laura <unk> Miles , a Yale University researcher of medieval manuscripts , as " one of the most admired fifteenth @-@ century Middle English lyrics [ which ] offers , within a deceptively simple form , an extremely delicate and haunting presentation of Mary ( the ' mayden / <unk> is <unk> ' ) and her conception of Christ ( ' here sone ' ) " . Primarily , the text celebrates the Annunciation of Mary as described in Luke 1 : 26 , but also widely references concepts from the Old Testament . Michael <unk> of University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point notes that " ' I syng of a mayden ' is a very quiet and very beautiful meditation on the inward aspects of the Annunciation , on the immediate consequences of Mary 's acceptance of Gabriel 's message . " The concept of the choice of Mary is an important subtlety in the text . Derek Pearsall writes : 
 A brain and a subtle ear has gone into the making of this poem ... celebrating the mystery of Christ 's conception . Dew falling on grass , flower and spray ( traditional imagery , deriving from OT texts such as Psalms 72 : 6 ) suggests ease , grace and delicacy generally ( not progressive stages of insemination ) . The emphasis on Mary 's freedom of choice , at the moment of the annunciation , is theologically strictly proper . 
 According to Miles , despite a celebratory opening , " Mary 's physical stillness as proof of her virginity remains the poet 's priority . " As a result , the poet repeats the phrase " He cam also <unk> " in three of the five verses . " <unk> " had several implications – the stillness of the conception of Mary and of the birth of Jesus Christ . 
 The poem is written from a first person point of view , and contains five quatrains . Below is the text in both its original Middle English , with spelling intact , and a modern translation . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The manuscript in which the poem is found , ( Sloane 2593 , <unk> @-@ 11 ) is held by the British Library , who date the work to <unk> and speculate that the lyrics may have belonged to a wandering minstrel ; other poems included in the manuscript include " I have a <unk> <unk> " , " Adam lay i @-@ <unk> " and two riddle songs – " A minstrel 's begging song " and " I have a yong <unk> " . The Chaucer scholar Joseph Glaser notes that 2593 contains the only surviving copies of several " indispensable " poems . These include the aforementioned poem " Adam lay i @-@ <unk> " , " A Babe is born al of a may " , " <unk> Domino " and " <unk> , <unk> <unk> " . 
 In 1836 , Thomas Wright suggested that , although his fellow antiquarian Joseph Ritson had dated the manuscript from the reign of Henry V of England ( 1387 – 1422 ) , he personally felt that although " its greatest antiquity must be included within the fifteenth century " , some lyrics contained within may be of an earlier origin . Wright speculated , on the basis of the dialect of Middle English , that the lyrics probably originated in Warwickshire , and suggested that a number of the songs were intended for use in mystery plays . More recent analysis of the manuscript places the dialect as being of East Anglian original and more specifically Norfolk ; two further carol MS from the county contain duplicates from Sloane 2593 . However , " I syng of a mayden " is a unique instance of this lyric . 
 Although the Sloane Manuscript is the only surviving textual source , the bibliographer and Shakespearean scholar W. W. Greg proposed that the poem 's similarity to a much earlier 13th @-@ century poem held at Trinity College , Cambridge ( MS. B. 13 . 49 ) was unlikely to be accidental . Alan J. Fletcher , a specialist in Latin liturgical drama and the late Middle Ages , noted in 1978 that a set of contemporary sermons compiled by a writer called <unk> ( Bodleian MS Barlow 24 ) quote the final phrases of the poem in such a way to suggest the poem was more widely disseminated and known in its time : 
 <unk> , <unk> and Moder <unk> <unk> but ye 
 <unk> may <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> be . 
 = = Musical setting = = 
 As most explicitly noted by the first quatrain , the poem was originally intended to be sung . Indeed , as noted by Stephen Medcalf , Emeritus professor at Sussex University , the text itself seems to imply melody and verse . However , due to the oral tradition of the time , the original melody of the song was not notated and over the course of time was forgotten . 
 Since the rediscovery of the text , many composers have set the text to music , amongst them diverse choral or vocal interpretations by Martin Shaw , Patrick Hadley , Roger Quilter , John <unk> , Gustav Holst , Arnold Bax Peter Warlock , R.R. Terry , Lennox Berkeley , Benjamin Britten ( " As <unk> in <unk> " in his Ceremony of Carols ) , Ronald Corp ( 1975 ) , Philip Lawson a setting published by Walton Music , John Adams ( as the chorus " I Sing of a Maiden " in his opera @-@ oratorio El Niño ) , and Bob Chilcott ( in his " Salisbury Vespers " ) . The work is also regularly performed by the Mediaeval <unk> .

 In 2005 , Jackson started working on her ninth studio album , 20 Y.O. , with her then partner , record producer Jermaine Dupri , who was commissioned as the executive producer . The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was feeling at the time her third studio album Control ( 1986 ) was recorded . " I started asking questions like , ' What was the feeling of life when you were 20 ? ' I was so intrigued with what was going on in her life then that I just thought her album should be called that " , Dupri commented . Jackson wanted to maintain a R & B sound from her most recent albums , but with an emphasis on dance music . 
 " So Excited " was written by Jackson , Jermaine Dupri , James Phillips , Johntá Austin , James Harris III , Terry Lewis and Khia Chambers , and was produced by Dupri , LRoc , Jam , Lewis and Jackson . The song is a hip hop and dance track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock 's 1983 song " Rockit " , with Hancock , Michael Beinhorn and Bill Laswell also receiving writing credits .

Sasha Frere @-@ Jones , writer from The New Yorker was enthusiastic with the song , calling it a " loud dance tune that is reminiscent of the songs on Control " , although she criticized some lyrics . For Don Baiocchi from Blogcritics , the song was not " the flawless dance floor anthem " her fans were hoping for . Chuck Taylor from Billboard called it disappointing , and felt it was bland and lacked innovation . Similarly , Evan Serpick , writing for Rolling Stone , stated , " Almost all of the tunes here ( particularly ' So Excited ' ) try to replicate Jackson 's early work , with diminishing returns " .

 After Khia was given a diminished role in the music video , she went to her MySpace account to say she was not pleased with her scenes being displayed in a TV during the music video , and criticized Jackson . Despite that , Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down , and wrote a song with Jackson in mind . However , she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer , stating , " I don 't say anything that I don 't mean . I meant every word that I said . People mix the truth with hate , but no I didn 't appreciate her putting me on the television .

 = Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) = 
 Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) is the second solo album by English musician Brian Eno . Produced by Eno , it was originally released by Island Records in November 1974 . Unlike his previous album Here Come the Warm Jets , Eno used a core band of five instrumentalists ( keyboards , guitars , bass , drums and percussion ) and used fewer guest musicians . Also participating was guitarist and co @-@ writer Phil Manzanera , who had played with Eno in Roxy Music . To help guide production of the album , Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to use through the creative process of the album . 
 Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) is a loose concept album with topics ranging from espionage to the Chinese Communist revolution . The album 's music has an upbeat and bouncy sound but with dark lyrical themes . The album did not chart in the United Kingdom or United States , but received greater attention from the rock press . It was re @-@ issued in a remastered version in 2004 by Virgin Records . The album has received critical attention , with varying opinions on its style and quality compared to Here Come the Warm Jets . 
 = = Production = = 
 The album was inspired by a series of postcards of a Chinese revolutionary opera , titled Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy . Eno described his understanding of the title as referring to " the dichotomy between the archaic and the progressive . Half Taking Tiger Mountain – that Middle Ages physical feel of storming a military position – and half ( By Strategy ) – that very , very 20th @-@ century mental concept of a tactical interaction of systems . " 
 To further explore the possibilities of the studio setting , Eno and his friend Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards , called Oblique Strategies . During recording of the album , he would allow the cards to dictate the next unconsidered action in the recording process . Describing the words on the album as an expression of " idiot glee " , Eno and Schmidt eventually expanded the Oblique Strategies set to over 100 " worthwhile dilemmas " , which would be used in nearly all his future recordings and productions . Schmidt also designed the album cover , which consists of four prints from an edition of fifteen hundred of his unique lithographs , as well as Polaroids of Eno , credited on the album sleeve to Lorenz <unk> . 
 Phil Manzanera , Eno 's former bandmate in Roxy Music , spoke positively about the recording experience . Manzanera described the recording of the album as : 
 ... just doing anything we felt like doing at the time . The engineer we used , Rhett Davies , also did Diamond Head and 801 Live and Quiet Sun , so it was like family . There was a lot of experimenting and a lot of hours spent with Brian Eno , me , and Rhett in the control room doing all the things that eventually evolved into those cards , the Oblique Strategies , and it was just a lot of fun . 
 Unlike his previous album Here Come the Warm Jets , Eno worked with a core group of musicians on Taking Tiger Mountain . The group consisted of Manzanera of Roxy Music , Brian <unk> and Freddie Smith of The Winkies and former Soft Machine vocalist Robert Wyatt . During the same period , Eno was producing Robert Calvert 's album Lucky Leif and the Longships , and the majority of the players on Taking Tiger Mountain were also involved in that project . Several guest musicians also played on select songs on the album , including Andy Mackay of Roxy Music and the Portsmouth Sinfonia , an orchestra in which Eno had once played clarinet . The orchestra 's philosophy allowed anybody to join as long as that person had no experience with the instrument to be played in the orchestra . For guest drummer Phil Collins , Eno called in a favour from Collins ' group Genesis . After Eno had helped with the production of Genesis ' album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway , Genesis front man Peter Gabriel asked how they could reciprocate . Eno looked at Collins , stating that he needed a drummer , and Collins played drums on " Mother Whale Eyeless " . 
 = = Style = = 
 The sound of Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) has been described as more upbeat and bouncy than Eno 's previous solo album while the lyrics have darker themes and subject matter . The lyrics of the album have been described as " remarkably literate and often humorous " with " quick @-@ fire rhymes , oddball couplets , abrupt demands and ruthless statements " . To create the lyrics , Eno later played these backing tracks , singing nonsense syllables to himself , then forming them into actual words , phrases and meanings . This lyric @-@ writing method was used for all his more vocal @-@ based recordings of the 1970s . 
 References to China appear in the album 's songs , including in " Burning Airlines Give You So Much More " , " China My China " and " Taking Tiger Mountain " . Steve Huey of AllMusic described these combined themes as a loose concept album that is " often inscrutable , but still playful – about espionage , the Chinese Communist revolution , and dream associations . " On the political theme within the lyrics and album title , Eno explained that he is " not Maoist or anything like that ; if anything I 'm anti @-@ Maoist " . The album addresses several different esoteric topics . " Burning Airlines Give You So Much More " is inspired by a 1974 crash near Paris of a Turkish Airlines DC @-@ 10 , one of the worst air crashes in history . " The Fat Lady of Limbourg " , described by Eno as a " Burroughs @-@ type song " about an asylum in Limbourg , Belgium where the residents of it outnumber the population of the town . " The Great Pretender " describes the rape of a suburban housewife by a crazed machine . " Third Uncle " has been referred to as an early predecessor of punk music .

 Like Eno 's previous album Here Come the Warm Jets , Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) received a mostly very positive reception from critics . Writing for the Village Voice , Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of A – , writing " Every cut on this clear , consistent , elusive album affords distinct present pleasure . Admittedly , when they 're over they 're over — you don 't flash on them the way you do on " Cindy Tells Me " and " Baby 's on Fire " . But that 's just his way of being modest . " Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno for the way he " grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow " . Robbins explained , " It sounds like it might be pretentious ; it 's not , because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions " ; he concluded that " a man who can write songs like ' Burning Airlines Give You So Much More ' has seen the future , and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno , who makes music you can live with " . Circus magazine described the album as " Sick ! Sick ! Sick ! But , oh @-@ h @-@ h , it feels so good ! [ ... ] guaranteed to be put on the ' Most Wanted ' list by psychopaths everywhere [ ... ] [ Eno ] takes you on a dada @-@ <unk> tour @-@ de @-@ force , lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable " . Critic Ed Naha , writing in Crawdaddy ! , gave the album a negative review , writing " Much of the <unk> magic found on Eno 's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain , being replaced by a dull , repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell . " In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) was voted one of the best albums of the year in the Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975 . 
 Recent assessments of the album have been mostly positive , with AllMusic and Blender giving the album five stars , their highest ratings . AllMusic 's Steve Huey compared the album to Here Come the Warm Jets , writing " not quite as enthusiastic as Here Come the Warm Jets , Taking Tiger Mountain is made accessible through Eno 's mastery of pop song structure " . Douglas Wolk of Blender had rated it more highly than Here Come the Warm Jets , calling it " more immediately likeable " . Select gave the album a four out of five rating , calling it " excellent " and described the songs " Mother Whale Eyeless " , " Put A Straw Under Baby " and " Third Uncle " as highlights .

 Lexus ( <unk> , <unk> ) is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese automaker Toyota . The Lexus marque is marketed in over 70 countries and territories worldwide , has become Japan 's largest @-@ selling make of premium cars , and has ranked among the ten largest Japanese global brands in market value . Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya , Japan . Operational centers are located in Brussels , Belgium , and the U.S. in Torrance , California . 
 Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan , code @-@ named F1 , which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989 . Subsequently , the division added sedan , coupé , convertible , and SUV models . Until 2005 Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 @-@ 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name . In 2005 , a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted , and additional hybrid models later joined the division 's lineup . In 2007 , Lexus launched its own F marque performance division with the debut of the IS F sport sedan , followed by the LFA supercar in 2009 . 
 From the start of production , Lexus vehicles have been produced in Japan , with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions , and in particular at Toyota 's Tahara , Aichi , Chūbu and Miyata , Fukuoka , Kyūshū plants . Assembly of the first Lexus built outside the country , the Ontario , Canada – produced RX 330 , began in 2003 . Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005 , Lexus operates its own design , engineering , and manufacturing centers . 
 Since the 2000s ( decade ) , Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market , the United States . The division inaugurated dealerships in Japan 's domestic market in 2005 , becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin . The brand was introduced in Southeast Asia , Latin America , Europe , and other regions . The division 's lineup also reflects regional differences for model and powertrain configurations .

 = = = 1980s : The F1 project = = = 
 In 1983 , Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda issued a challenge to build the world 's best car . The project , code @-@ named F1 ( “ Flagship One ” ) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota ’ s product line in the premium segment . The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models . Both the Supra and Mark II were rear @-@ wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M @-@ GE or 7M @-@ GTE inline @-@ six engine . The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited @-@ production , 1960s @-@ vintage Toyota Century , a domestic , hand @-@ built limousine , and V8 @-@ powered model , followed by the inline @-@ six @-@ engined Toyota Crown premium sedan . The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market , and along with the Crown not slated for export , after a complete restyle in 1982 . The F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine . 
 Japanese manufacturers exported more expensive models in the 1980s due to voluntary export restraints , negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives , that restricting mainstream car sales . In 1986 , Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S. , influencing Toyota 's plans for a luxury division ; the initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend , itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown , Nissan Cedric / Gloria , and Mazda Luce . In 1987 , Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand , Infiniti , and revised its Nissan President sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti Q45 , which it launched in 1990 . In 1988 , Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America , and later began plans to develop an upscale marque , to be called Amati , but its plans did not come to fruition . 
 Toyota researchers visited the U.S. in May 1985 to conduct focus groups and market research on luxury consumers . During that time , several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach , California to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers . Meanwhile , F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads . Toyota ’ s market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new sedan , and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market . 
 = = = = Brand development = = = = 
 In 1986 , Toyota ’ s longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized unit , Team One , to handle marketing for the new brand . Image consulting firm Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Alexis were chosen as top candidates . While Alexis quickly became the front runner , concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars ( being associated with the Alexis Carrington character on the popular 1980s primetime drama Dynasty ) , and as a result the first letter was removed and the " i " replaced with a " u " to morph the name to Lexus . 
 The etymology of the Lexus name has been attributed to the combination of the words " luxury " and " elegance , " and another theory claims it is an acronym for " luxury exports to the U.S. " According to Team One interviews , the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image . Just prior to the release of the first vehicles , database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used as they stated it might cause confusion . The injunction threatened to delay the division 's launch and marketing efforts . The U.S. appeals court lifted the injunction , deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products . 
 The original Lexus slogan , developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail , became " The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection . " The Lexus logo was developed by Molly Designs and Hunter Communications . The final design for the Lexus logo featured a stylized “ L ” within an oval , and according to Toyota , was rendered using a mathematical formula . The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo , designed by Team One , appeared at the Chicago , Los Angeles , and New York auto shows in 1988 .

 The F1 project was completed in 1989 , involving 60 designers , 24 engineering teams , 1 @,@ 400 engineers , 2 @,@ 300 technicians , 220 support workers , approximately 450 prototypes , and over US $ 1 billion in costs . The resulting car , the Lexus LS 400 , had a design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles , with a new 4 @.@ 0 L V8 gasoline engine and rear @-@ wheel drive . The car debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit , and went on sale the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S. The LS 400 was sold along with the smaller ES 250 , a rebadged Toyota Camry . The launch of Lexus was accompanied by a multimillion @-@ dollar advertising campaign . 
 The LS 400 was praised for its quietness , well @-@ appointed and ergonomic interior , engine performance , build quality , aerodynamics , fuel economy , and value , although it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort . In some markets , it was priced against mid @-@ size six @-@ cylinder Mercedes @-@ Benz and BMW models , and was rated by Car and Driver magazine as better than the higher priced Mercedes @-@ Benz 420 <unk> and BMW <unk> in terms of ride , handling , and performance . The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine . Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded as a shock to existing luxury marques . BMW 's and Mercedes @-@ Benz 's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 % and 19 % , respectively , with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market , while 35 % of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac . 
 In December 1989 , Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8 @,@ 000 LS 400s that were sold based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light . A 20 @-@ day operation to replace the parts on affected vehicles included technicians to pick up , repair , and return cars to customers free of charge , and also flying in personnel and renting garage space for owners in remote locations . This response was covered in media publications and helped establish the marque 's early reputation for customer service . 
 By the end of 1989 , a total of 16 @,@ 392 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans were sold in the four months following the U.S. launch . Although sales had begun at a slower pace than expected , the final tally matched the division 's target of 16 @,@ 000 units for that year . Following initial models , plans called for the addition of a sports coupe along with a redesigned ES sedan . 
 = = = 1990s : Growth and expansion = = = 
 In 1990 , during its first full year of sales , Lexus sold 63 @,@ 594 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans in the U.S. , the vast majority being the LS model . That year , Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom , Switzerland , Canada , and Australia . In 1991 , Lexus launched its first sports coupe , the SC 400 , which shared the LS 400 ’ s V8 engine and rear @-@ wheel drive design . This was followed by the second generation ES 300 sedan , which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus ' top seller . At the conclusion of 1991 , Lexus had become the top @-@ selling premium car import in the U.S. , with sales reaching a total of 71 @,@ 206 vehicles . That year , Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates ' studies on initial vehicle quality , customer satisfaction , and sales satisfaction for the first time . The marque also began increasing U.S. model prices past those of comparable American premium makes , but still below high @-@ end European models ; by 1992 , the LS 400 's base price had risen 18 % . 
 In 1993 , Lexus launched the mid @-@ size GS 300 sports sedan , based on the Toyota Aristo using the Toyota " S " platform from the Toyota Crown , which had sold for two years prior in Japan . The GS 300 was priced below the LS 400 in the marque 's lineup . That same year , Lexus also became one of the first marques to debut a certified pre @-@ owned program , with the aim of improving trade @-@ in model values . In 1994 , the marque introduced the second generation LS 400 . In May 1995 , sales were threatened by the U.S. government 's proposal of 100 % tariffs on upscale Japanese cars in response to the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit . SUVs were exempt from the proposed sanctions . Normal sales operations resumed by late 1995 when the Japanese auto manufacturers collectively agreed to greater American investments , and the tariffs were not enacted . 
 In 1996 , Lexus debuted its first sport utility vehicle , the LX 450 , followed by the third generation ES 300 sedan . The marque 's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995 . In 1998 , Lexus added the first luxury @-@ branded crossover SUV , the RX 300 , and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans . The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX 's off @-@ road capability ; it was particularly successful , becoming the marque 's top @-@ selling model ahead of the ES 300 . The same year , Lexus made its debut in South America 's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil . In 1999 , Lexus recorded its one @-@ millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market , and was ranked as the top @-@ selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall . 
 = = = 2000s : Global reorganization = = = 
 In 2000 , Lexus introduced the IS line , a series of entry @-@ level sport sedans . In 2001 , the first convertible was introduced , as well as the SC 430 , a redesigned ES 300 , and the third generation LS 430 . The GX 470 mid @-@ size SUV debuted in 2002 , followed by the second generation RX 330 in 2003 . The following year , Lexus recorded its two @-@ millionth U.S. vehicle sale , and the first luxury @-@ branded production hybrid SUV , the RX 400h . This vehicle used Toyota 's Hybrid Synergy Drive system that combined gasoline and electric motors . 
 In 2005 , Lexus completed an organizational separation from parent company Toyota , with dedicated design , engineering , training , and manufacturing centers working exclusively for the division . This effort coincided with Lexus ' launch in its home market of Japan and an expanded global launch of the brand in markets such as China . Executives aimed to increase Lexus sales outside of its largest market in the U.S. To accompany this expansion , next generation Lexus vehicles were redesigned as " global models " for international release . In the European market , where Lexus had long faced struggling sales owing to low brand recognition , few dedicated dealerships , and 1990s import quotas , the marque announced plans to introduce hybrid and diesel powertrains , increase the number of Lexus dealerships , and expand operations in emerging markets such as Russia . 
 Lexus ' arrival in the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first introduction of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market . New generation LS , IS , ES , GS , and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430 , ending domestic sales of Toyota @-@ branded models under the Celsior , <unk> , Windom , Aristo , Harrier , and <unk> nameplates , respectively . The <unk> and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store , the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store , the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store , and the <unk> was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations . Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts . Sales for the first half @-@ year were slower than expected , affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases , but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup . 
 Through the mid @-@ 2000s , Lexus experienced sales successes in South Korea and Taiwan , becoming the top @-@ selling import make in both markets in 2005 ; the marque also sold well in the Middle East , where it ranked first or second among rivals in multiple countries , and in Australia , where Lexus reached third in luxury car sales in 2006 . Division executives in 2006 announced an expansion goal from 68 countries to 76 worldwide by 2010 . By the end of the decade , this expansion resulted in official launches in Malaysia and South Africa in 2006 , Indonesia in 2007 , Chile in 2008 , and the Philippines in 2009 .

 In 2006 , Lexus began sales of the GS 450h , a V6 hybrid performance sedan , and launched the fourth generation LS line , comprising both standard- and long @-@ wheelbase V8 ( LS 460 and LS 460 L ) and hybrid ( LS 600h and LS 600h L ) versions . The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year . The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan . By the end of 2006 , Lexus ' annual sales had reached 475 @,@ 000 vehicles worldwide . In January 2007 , Lexus announced a new F marque performance division , which would produce racing @-@ inspired versions of its performance models . The IS F , made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show , accompanied by a concept car , the LF @-@ A. 
 In October 2007 , Lexus entered the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in the U.S. for the first time with the IS F , and announced its F @-@ Sport performance trim level and factory @-@ sanctioned accessory line . Increased emphasis on sporty models was an effort to target rivals from Mercedes @-@ Benz 's AMG and BMW 's M divisions . Models such as the SC 400 and GS 400 had received favorable reactions from sport luxury buyers , most Lexus models had been characterized as favoring comfort over sporty road feel and handling , compared with European rivals . By the end of 2007 , Lexus annual worldwide sales had surpassed 500 @,@ 000 vehicles , and the marque ranked as the top @-@ selling premium import in China for the first time . The largest sales markets in order of size for 2007 were the U.S. , Japan , the UK , China , Canada , and Russia . 
 In 2008 , amidst the late @-@ 2000s recession and a weakened world car market , global sales fell 16 % to 435 @,@ 000 , with declines in markets such as the U.S. and Europe where deliveries fell by 21 % and 27 @.@ 5 % , respectively . In 2009 , the marque launched the HS <unk> , a dedicated hybrid sedan for North America and Japan , the RX 450h , the second generation hybrid SUV replacing the earlier RX 400h , and later that year debuted the US $ 375 @,@ 000 production LFA exotic coupe . In late 2009 , citing higher sales of hybrid models over their petrol counterparts , Lexus announced plans to become a hybrid @-@ only marque in Europe . By the end of the decade , Lexus ranked as the fourth @-@ largest premium car make in the world by volume , and was the number @-@ one @-@ selling premium car marque in the U.S. for ten consecutive years . 
 = = = 2010s : Recent developments = = = 
 In 2010 , Lexus underwent a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives . Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009 – 2010 Toyota vehicle recalls , several of which included Lexus models . The ES 350 and certain IS models were affected by a recall for potentially jamming floor mats , while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per @-@ vehicle . The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update , one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV , citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high @-@ speed emergency turn . Although the publication knew of no reported incidents , the GX 460 received updated stability control software . 
 In late 2010 and early 2011 , Lexus began sales of the CT 200h , a compact four @-@ door hybrid hatchback designed for Europe , in multiple markets . Sales of lower @-@ displacement regional models were also expanded , beginning with the ES 240 in China followed by the RX 270 ; Japan , Russia , and Taiwan were among markets which received model variants intended for reduced emissions or import taxes . In March 2011 , the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami caused severe disruption to Lexus ' Japan @-@ based production lines , hindering the marque 's near @-@ term sales prospects . Lexus ' U.S. executives stated that due to vehicle shortages amidst close competition from BMW , Mercedes @-@ Benz , and Audi , the marque would not remain the country 's top @-@ selling premium car brand . 
 Cumulative sales results for 2011 indicated a 14 % sales drop in the U.S. market , along with sales increases of 40 % and 27 % in Europe and Japan respectively , for a global sales total of 410 @,@ 000 units . Lexus ' streak of eleven consecutive years as the best @-@ selling luxury marque in the U.S. ended that year , with the title going to BMW followed by Mercedes @-@ Benz . For 2011 while 45 percent of Lexus sales in the United States relied upon the RX luxury crossover SUV , rival Mercedes @-@ Benz 's best @-@ selling offering was the E @-@ Class mid @-@ luxury sedan which commands considerably higher prices . Subsequently , Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda vowed to restore passion to the marque and further increase its organizational independence , admitting that " ... back then we did not regard Lexus as a brand , but as a distribution channel " . As a result of Toyoda 's organizational changes , Lexus senior managers report directly to the chairman for the first time in the marque 's history . 
 In January 2012 , the marque began sales of the fourth generation GS line , including GS 350 and GS 450h variants , as well as a lower @-@ displacement GS 250 model for select markets . In April 2012 , the sixth generation ES line , include ES 350 and ES <unk> variants , debuted at the New York International Auto Show . 
 In April 2014 , Lexus unveiled the five @-@ seater NX crossover . The vehicle features a very first for a Lexus vehicle : a turbocharger . Its nomenclature is denoted as the <unk> . In August 2014 , Toyota announced it would be cutting its Lexus spare parts prices in China by up to 35 % . The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China 's National Development and Reform Commission of Lexus spare parts policies , as part of an industry @-@ wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after @-@ sales servicing . 
 In March 2016 , Lexus announced that it will be producing a new flagship vehicle : the two @-@ door LC 500 . The vehicle will be produced for late 2017 in a V8 version putting out 467 horsepower . The LC <unk> , a V6 hybrid variant , could potentially become available in late 2017 or early 2018 .

 Lexus International , headed by managing officer Tokuo <unk> , coordinates the worldwide operations of Toyota 's luxury division . Other executives at Lexus ' global headquarters , located in Nagoya , Aichi , include Mark Templin , executive vice president of Lexus International , and managers of the marque 's Japan Sales & Marketing and global Product & Marketing Planning divisions . While organizationally separate from its parent company , Lexus International reports directly to Toyota chief executive officer Akio Toyoda . 
 In the U.S. , Lexus operations are headed by Jeffrey Bracken , group vice president and general manager of the U.S. Lexus division , located in Southern California .

Companion design facilities are located in Southern California and central Japan , with the head design studio devoted entirely to Lexus models in Toyota City , Aichi . 
 = = = Regional operations = = = 
 Lexus sales operations vary in structure by region . In many markets , such as the U.S. , the dealership network is a distinct organization from corporate headquarters , with separately owned and operated Lexus showrooms . By contrast , in Japan all 143 dealerships in the country are owned and operated by Lexus . Several markets have a designated , third party regional distributor ; for example , in the United Arab Emirates , sales operations are managed by Al @-@ <unk> Motors LLC , and in Costa Rica , Lexus vehicles are sold via regional distributor Purdy Motors S.A. Other officially sanctioned regional distributors have sold Lexus models prior to the launch of , or in absence of , a dedicated dealership network . 
 = = = Sales = = = 
 Global sales of Lexus vehicles reached an all @-@ time high in 2007 , with a total of 518 @,@ 000 . Sales decreased in subsequent years due to the effects of the 2008 recession and the Japanese tsunami of 2011 . Following this , sales recovered and reached a new high of 523 @,@ 000 in 2013 . 
 In 2014 , the Lexus brand set a new global sales record after selling 582 @,@ 000 vehicles . This made Lexus the fourth best selling luxury brand in the world , trailing only BMW , Audi and Mercedes @-@ Benz . 
 Global sales of Lexus vehicles increased by 12 % in 2015 to reach another annual sales record with 652 @,@ 00 units sold world @-@ wide . 
 Global cumulative sales of Lexus brand hybrid electric cars reached the 500 thousand mark in November 2012 . The 1 million sales milestone was achieved in March 2016 . The Lexus RX 400h / RX 450h ranks as the top selling Lexus hybrid with 335 @,@ 000 units delivered worldwide as of March 2016 , followed by the Lexus CT 200h with 267 @,@ 000 units .

 Financial data of Lexus operations are not disclosed publicly . However , automotive analysts estimate that the Lexus division contributes a disproportionate share of Toyota 's profits , relative to its limited production and sales volume . Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume , vehicle product development cycles , and exchange rates , Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota 's annual U.S. profit in certain years . Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume , with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands . In 2006 , Lexus entered <unk> 's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time , with an estimated brand value of approximately US $ 3 billion annually . In 2009 , <unk> ranked Lexus as Japan 's seventh largest brand , between Panasonic and Nissan , based on revenue , earnings , and market value .

 Lexus produces its highest @-@ performance models under its F marque division . The name refers to Flagship and Fuji Speedway in Japan , whose first corner , 27R , inspired the shape of the " F " emblem . F marque models are developed by the Lexus Vehicle Performance Development Division . The first F marque model , the IS F , went on sale in 2007 , followed by the LFA in 2009 . A related F @-@ Sport performance trim level and factory @-@ sanctioned accessory line is available for standard Lexus models such as the IS 250 and IS 350 . F @-@ Sport succeeded an earlier in @-@ house tuning effort , the TRD @-@ based L @-@ Tuned , which had offered performance packages on the IS and GS sedans in the early 2000s ( decade ) . 
 The latest editions to the performance F marque include the Lexus RC F and Lexus GS F. 
 = = = Model nomenclature = = = 
 Lexus production models are named <unk> using two @-@ letter designations followed by three digits . The first letter indicates relative status in the Lexus model range ( ranking ) , and the second letter refers to car body style or type ( e.g. LS for ' luxury sedan ' ) . The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied by a factor of one hundred ( e.g. 350 for a 3 @.@ 5 L engine ) . A space is used between the letters and numbers . The same letter may be used differently depending on the model ; ' S ' can refer to ' sedan ' or ' sport ' ( e.g. in LS and SC ) , while ' X ' refers to ' luxury utility vehicle ' or SUV . On hybrids , the three digits refer to the combined gasoline @-@ electric output . For certain models , a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ( ' h ' for hybrid , ' d ' for diesel , ' t ' for turbocharged ) , while capital letter ( s ) placed at the end indicates a class subtype ( e.g. ' L ' for long @-@ wheelbase , ' C ' for coupe , ' AWD ' for all @-@ wheel drive ) . On F marque models , the two @-@ letter designation and the letter ' F ' are used with no numbers or hyphens ( e.g. IS F ) . 
 = = Design and technology = = 
 Lexus design has traditionally placed an emphasis on targeting specific vehicle development standards . Since the marque 's inception , design targets have ranged from aerodynamics and ride quality to interior ergonomics . The backronym " <unk> " ( " Impressive , Dynamic , Elegant , Advanced , and Lasting " ) is used in the development process . Each vehicle is designed according to approximately 500 specific product standards , known as " Lexus <unk> , " on criteria such as leather seat stitching . Design elements from the marque 's concept vehicle line , the LF series ( including the 2003 LF @-@ S and 2004 LF @-@ C ) , have been incorporated in production models . 
 Vehicle cabins have incorporated electroluminescent <unk> gauges , <unk> , a smart key entry and startup system , and multimedia features . Beginning with the 2010 RX and HS models , the Remote Touch system , featuring a computer mouse @-@ like controller with haptic feedback , was introduced ; other models have featured touchscreen controls ( through the 2009 model year ) as a navigation screen interface . 2014 saw the introduction of the next version of Lexus ’ remote @-@ touch innovations — the Remote Touch Interface <unk> in the new RC Coupe . 
 In 1989 , Lexus became among the first premium car marques to equip models with premium audio systems , in partnership with stereo firm <unk> . Since 2001 , optional surround sound systems are offered via high @-@ end audio purveyor Mark Levinson . For reduced cabin noise , the first LS 400 introduced sandwich steel plating , and later models added acoustic glass . In 2006 , the LS 460 debuted the first ceiling air diffusers and infrared body temperature sensors in a car . <unk> services include G @-@ Book with G @-@ Link in Asia and Lexus <unk> in North America . 
 In 2006 , Lexus incorporated the first production eight @-@ speed automatic transmission in an automobile with the LS 460 , and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models . Continuously variable transmissions , regenerative brakes , and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models . In 2007 , Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains , catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance . Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology ; in 2008 , the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED headlamps . 
 Safety features on Lexus models range from stability and handling programs ( Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management ) to backup cameras , swivel headlights , and sonar warning systems . The Lexus Pre @-@ Collision System ( PCS ) integrates multiple safety systems . In 2007 , Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities , lane keep assist , a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness , and rear pre @-@ collision whiplash protection , as part of the LS 460 PCS . As a safety precaution , Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed ; to prevent distraction , navigation inputs are limited , while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible . This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion . Pre @-@ 2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option , and updated European models allow operation in motion . 
 Production models in development have included convertibles , crossovers , and dedicated hybrids . Under the F marque , Lexus plans to produce high @-@ performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA . Lexus officials have also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms . The LS uses a dedicated platform , while the entry @-@ level Lexus ES had been criticized for being too similar to the Toyota Camry , with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation , in both styling and powertrain design . The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing . 
 = = = L @-@ finesse = = = 
 Lexus introduced a new design language known as " L @-@ finesse " in the mid @-@ 2000s with its LF series concepts and the 2006 Lexus GS . L @-@ finesse is represented by three Japanese kanji characters which translate as " Intriguing Elegance , <unk> Simplicity , and Seamless Anticipation " . Design characteristics , including a <unk> profile , lower @-@ set grille , and the use of both convex and concave surfaces , are derived from Japanese cultural motifs ( e.g. the phrase <unk> in arrowhead shapes ) . While earlier Lexus models were criticized for reserved and derivative styling , and often mistaken for understated domestic market cars , automotive design analyses described L @-@ finesse as adding a distinctive nature and embrace of Japanese design identity . Opinions varied for L @-@ finesse 's debut on the GS ; Sports Car International 's analysis praised the vehicle 's in @-@ person appearance ; Automobile Magazine criticized the daring of its forward styling , and compared subsequent rival models for design similarities . In 2012 , the arrival of the redesigned fourth generation Lexus GS featured the introduction of a spindle @-@ shaped grille design , intended to be used on all forthcoming Lexus models . L @-@ finesse exhibitions were presented at Milan 's Salone del Mobile from 2005 through 2009 . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Assembly plants = = = 
 The first Lexus vehicles were manufactured in Toyota 's Tahara plant , a highly sophisticated , computerized manufacturing plant in Japan . Lexus production techniques include methods and standards of quality control that differ from Toyota models . At the Tahara plant , separate assembly lines were developed for Lexus vehicles , along with new molds and specialized manufacturing equipment . Welding processes , body panel fit tolerances , and paint quality requirements are more stringent . Lexus plant workers , typically veteran technicians , are identified via repeated performance evaluations and ranked according to skill grade , with limited applicants accepted . The highest level <unk> ( Japanese for " artisan " ) engineers are responsible for maintaining production standards at key points in the assembly process , such as testing engine performance . Production vehicles are given visual inspections for flaws , individually test @-@ driven at high speeds , and subjected to vibration tests . 
 Through the 2000s ( decade ) , most Lexus sedan and SUV production has occurred in Japan at the Tahara plant in Aichi and Miyata plant in Fukuoka . In addition to the Tahara factory , Lexus vehicles have been produced at the Miyata plant ( Toyota Motor Kyushu , Inc . ) in <unk> , Fukuoka , Higashi Fuji plant ( Kanto Auto Works , Ltd . ) in <unk> , Shizuoka , and <unk> plant ( Toyota <unk> Corp. ; <unk> ) in Toyota City , Aichi . Front @-@ wheel drive cars , such as the ES and HS , are produced in the Fukuoka Prefecture . The Kokura plant in Kitakyushu , Fukuoka , which opened in 2008 , is a dedicated hybrid production site for Lexus models such as the gasoline @-@ electric RX . The North American – market RX 350 ( since the 2004 model year ) is produced at the Cambridge plant ( Toyota Canada , Inc . ) in the city of Cambridge , in Ontario , Canada , which is the first Lexus production site located outside Japan . In late 2015 , Lexus started to assemble North American @-@ spec ES 350 sedans at the Georgetown plant ( <unk> , Inc . ) .

 Lexus has become known for efforts to project an upscale image , particularly with service provided after the sale . The waiting areas in service departments are replete with amenities , ranging from refreshment bars to indoor putting greens . <unk> typically offer complimentary loaner cars or " courtesy cars " and free car washes , and some have added on @-@ site cafes and designer boutiques . Service bays are lined with large picture windows for owners to watch the servicing of their vehicle . In 2005 , Lexus also began reserving parking lots at major sporting arenas , entertainment events , and shopping malls , with the only requirement for free entry being the ownership of a Lexus vehicle . An online owner publication , Lexus Magazine , features automotive and lifestyle articles and is published online monthly and on a mobile site . 
 Since 2002 , Lexus has scored consecutive top ratings in the Auto Express and 76 @,@ 000 @-@ respondent Top Gear customer satisfaction surveys in the UK . Lexus has also repeatedly topped the 79 @,@ 000 @-@ respondent J.D.

 Lexus first entered the motorsport arena in 1999 when its racing unit , Team Lexus , fielded two GS 400 race vehicles in the Motorola Cup North American Street Stock Championship touring car series . In its 1999 inaugural season , Team Lexus achieved its first victory with its sixth race at Road Atlanta . Led by Sports Car Club of America and International Motor Sports Association driver Chuck Goldsborough , based in Baltimore , Maryland , Team Lexus capitalized on the debut of the first generation Lexus IS by entering three IS 300s in the third race of the 2001 Grand @-@ Am Cup season at Phoenix , Arizona . Team Lexus won its first IS 300 victory that year at the Virginia International Raceway . In 2002 , Team Lexus ' competitive efforts in the Grand @-@ Am Cup <unk> ( Street Tuner ) class achieved victories in the Drivers ' and Team Championships , as well as a sweep of the top three finishes at Circuit Mont @-@ <unk> in Quebec , Canada . 
 After the release of the Lexus brand in the Japanese domestic market in 2005 , Lexus sanctioned the entry of four SC 430 <unk> in the Super GT series of the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship in the GT500 class . In the first race of the 2006 series , an SC 430 took the chequered flag , and drivers André <unk> and <unk> <unk> raced the SC 430 to capture the GT500 championship for that year . In 2007 , another SC 430 won the GT500 opening round race . In 2006 , Lexus raced a hybrid vehicle for the first time , entering a GS 450h performance hybrid sedan in partnership with Sigma Advanced Racing Development at the 24 Hours of Tokachi race in Hokkaido , Japan . Lexus Canada also entered the GS 450h in 2007 's Targa Newfoundland event . In 2009 , Lexus Super GT Team SC 430 and IS 350 racers won the GT500 and <unk> championships , respectively . 
 Lexus ' participation in endurance racing further includes the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona , sanctioned by the Grand American Road Racing Association . After entering the Rolex Sports Car Series in 2004 , Lexus has won over 15 Rolex Series event races . In 2005 , Lexus was runner @-@ up , and in 2006 , it won the championship . Although Toyota has won this race in the past , it was the first time that its luxury arm emerged as the winner . In 2007 , six Lexus @-@ powered Daytona prototypes were entered in the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona event at the Daytona International Speedway . Lexus was a repeat winner of the event , with a Lexus @-@ Riley prototype driven by Scott Pruett , Juan Pablo Montoya , and Salvador Durán of Chip Ganassi Racing finishing first ; Lexus @-@ Riley prototypes also took three of the top ten spots . In 2008 , Lexus won its third consecutive win at Daytona . For the 2010 season , Lexus departed from the Rolex Sports Car Series , and Ganassi Racing switched to BMW / Dinan engines . The LF @-@ A prototype also competed on the Nürburgring since 2008 in <unk> endurance races and in the 24 Hours Nürburgring , also with the IS F.

 = = Marketing = = 
 From its inception , Lexus has been advertised to luxury consumers using specific marketing strategies , with a consistent motif used for the marque 's advertisements . Beginning in 1989 , television ads were narrated by actor James Sloyan ( the voice of " Mr. Lexus " until 2009 ) , and accompanied by vehicles that performed unusual stunts onscreen . The first decade of Lexus commercials ( 1989 – 99 ) consisted primarily of disjunctive verbal descriptions , such as " relentless , " " pursuit , " and " perfection , " while vehicles were used to claim superiority in precision , idling , and interior quiet and comfort on camera . Examples included the champagne glass " Balance " ( 1989 ) and rolling " Ball Bearing " ( 1992 ) . In the 2000s ( decade ) , commercials included descriptions of features , or a narration of the events onscreen , and were often targeted at the marque 's German competitors . An annual " December to Remember " campaign featured scenes of family members surprising loved ones with the gift of a new Lexus . The marque returned to the champagne glass theme in a 2006 LS 460 spot showing the sedan maneuvering between two stacks of glasses using its self @-@ parking system , and in a 2010 LFA spot showing its engine sound shattering a glass via resonance frequency . 
 Industry observers have attributed Lexus ' early marketing successes to higher levels of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors , which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass @-@ market cars . A reputation for dependability , bolstered by reliability surveys , also became a primary factor in attracting new customers from rival premium makes . Lexus has since grown to command higher price premiums than rival Japanese makes , with new models further increasing in price and reaching the over @-@ US $ 100 @,@ 000 ultra @-@ luxury category long dominated by rival European marques . 
 Automotive analysts have also noted Lexus ' relative newcomer status as a marketing challenge for the brand , although some have debated the requirement of a long history . European rivals have marketed their decades of heritage and pedigree , whereas Lexus ' reputation rests primarily upon its perceived quality and shared history with parent company Toyota . Several analysts have stated that Lexus will have to develop its own heritage over time by highlighting technological innovations and producing substantial products . 
 Lexus ' marketing efforts have extended to sporting and charity event sponsorships , including the U.S. Open tennis Grand Slam event from 2005 to 2009 , and the United States Golf Association 's U.S. Open , U.S. Women 's Open , U.S. Senior Open , and U.S. Amateur tournaments since 2007 . Lexus has organized an annual Champions for Charity golf series in the U.S. since 1989 . <unk> contracts have also been signed with professional athletes Andy Roddick , Annika Sörenstam , and Peter Jacobsen . 
 = Whale Whores = 
 " Whale Whores " is the eleventh episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park . The 192nd overall episode of the series , it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 28 , 2009 . In the episode , Stan joins an anti @-@ whaling crew in order to save dolphins and whales from Japanese whalers . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA LV in the United States . " Whale Whores " addressed the topic of Japanese whaling , condemning both the whalers themselves and the activists who fight against them . The episode is particularly critical of the reality television series Whale Wars and its star Paul Watson , an environmental activist who is prominently featured in " Whale Whores " . 
 In a response to the episode , Paul Watson said he was not offended by the portrayal , and was glad the show brought the issue of illegal whaling to a large audience . The episode also featured references to the show Deadliest Catch and a rendition of the Lady Gaga song " Poker Face " sung by Eric Cartman on the game Rock Band . A downloadable version of the song was released for the game in March . " Whale Whores " was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16 , 2010 . The episode was nominated for a Genesis Award , but lost to the Family Guy episode " Dog Gone " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Marsh family is spending Stan 's ninth birthday at a public aquarium in Denver . As the Marshes enjoy interacting with the trained bottlenose dolphins , Japanese armed with spears suddenly storm the dolphinarium and kill all the dolphins . The Japanese perform similar attacks at several other aquariums , and at an NFL game , where they kill members of the Miami Dolphins football team . Stan asks his friends Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny to help him take on the cause of saving the dolphins and whales from the Japanese . Kyle declines , feeling they can 't change Japan 's views on the issue . Cartman and Kenny are much more interested in playing the video game Rock Band , professing they " don 't give two shits about stupid @-@ ass whales " . Eventually , Butters informs Stan about the television show Whale Wars , stating that they can take volunteers to help them . Seeing this as his chance , Stan takes Butters ' advice and joins host Paul Watson and his crew aboard the Sea Shepherd , but is underwhelmed by their method of throwing " stinky butter " at Japanese whalers in an effort to deter them . After the Japanese whalers kill Watson with a harpoon , Stan destroys their ship by igniting their fuel barrels with a flare gun . Stan becomes the new captain and leads a more successful campaign in impeding the Japanese whaling effort by employing more aggressive methods . The crew ends up getting interviewed by Larry King , who describes Paul Watson as an " incompetent media whore " and questions Stan on his intentions of increasing ratings with violence . Stan dismisses the charge and contends he is only interested in saving the whales , not ratings . 
 Wanting to be on television , Cartman and Kenny join the ship 's crew under false pretenses of wanting to save the whales . After a brief run @-@ in with Captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the show Deadliest Catch , Japanese pilots launch kamikaze attacks on the Sea Shepherd . The suicidal planes kill the Whale Wars crew except for Stan , Cartman and Kenny . The trio are captured and brought to Japan , where Emperor Akihito tells them retaliation for the bombing of Hiroshima is the primary motive for Japan 's whaling efforts . He shows them a doctored photograph — given to Japan by the United States after the bombing — of the Enola Gay piloted by a dolphin and a killer whale . According to him , Japan was so grateful the Americans gave the Japanese these photos they declared peace . Knowing the picture is a fake , Stan decides to reveal the truth about the bombing , but Cartman reminds him that the Japanese seek to drive the entire species of the perpetrators to extinction . Claiming the U.S. government has authorized him to show the " original " photo , Stan presents Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and other Japanese officials with a new doctored photo showing a cow and chicken in the Enola Gay ( created by Kyle , who Stan managed to phone beforehand ) . The Japanese become infuriated , now believing cows and chickens had modified the original photo to frame the innocent whales and dolphins . The Japanese agree to cease their whaling efforts and start slaughtering cows and chickens , storming farms full of the animals . The episode ends as Randy congratulates Stan for making the Japanese " normal , like us . " 
 = = Theme = = 
 " Whale Whores " addresses the controversies surrounding Japanese whaling , which had been a subject of considerable media attention around the time the South Park episode first aired . The episode is equally condemning of all sides involved in the matter , including the Japanese whalers themselves and the activists who fight against them . By having the Japanese attack the dolphins at the Denver Aquarium in the middle of a dolphin riding demonstration , it has been suggested the episode highlights the link between visiting dolphins at marine parks and the reality of how aquatic wildlife are captured and slaughtered . " Whale Whores " is critical of the practice of whaling , as it displays primitive characteristics of the whalers . In the final scene , the show also draws parallel between Japanese whaling industry and generally accepted meat and poultry industries . 
 However , the episode prominently features and mocks the animal rights and environmental activist Paul Watson and his Animal Planet reality series , Whale Wars . Watson has received wide criticism for his method of disrupting whale hunts by at times attacking and sinking Japanese and Norwegian whaling ships . " Whale Whores " presents Watson and his show in a way that mocks his attempts to garner media attention by simply lying rather than doing anything productive . The episode mocks Whale Wars and its attempts to present mundane ship @-@ board activities as dramatic television . This is particularly illustrated in newspaper headlines after Stan takes over Watson 's ship : " New Captain Turns Vegan <unk> Into Real Pirates " and " Whale Wars Gets Better : Things Actually Happen ! " Watson himself is also portrayed in a physically unflattering way , with his stomach too fat to be entirely covered by his shirt . " Whale Whores " also refers to the criticisms that Watson bends the truth in order to further his popularity . This is particularly reflected through the fictional interview with Larry King , who calls Watson " an unorganized , incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause . " The fact that Whale Wars gets better ratings after Stan takes over and employs more violent tactics is a satire of the tendency in Whale Wars , and television in general , to exploit violence for money and viewership . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are identified as the cause of Japanese whaling . The two Japanese cities were destroyed by atomic weapons during the final stages of World War II under orders by U.S. President Harry Truman , which killed about 220 @,@ 000 people . In " Whale Whores " , the Japanese are presented with a doctored picture of the Enola Gay , the B @-@ 29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima . The picture shows a dolphin and a whale piloting the plane to bomb the city . The Miami Dolphins , a National Football League professional football team , are killed along with real dolphins by the whalers in " Whale Whores " . Near the end of the episode , Stan and the crew of the MY Steve Irwin encounter fishing ship captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the Discovery Channel reality series , Deadliest Catch . The scene with Paul Watson 's crew throwing " stinky butter " at the whalers refers to Watson and his crew 's practice of throwing stink bombs containing butyric acid , an acid found in rancid butter and cheese , at Japanese whaling vessels , including the factory vessel , the Nisshin Maru . 
 An Entertainment Weekly magazine cover is shown with the headline , " We ’ re STILL Remembering Michael Jackson " , a reference to the extremely large amount of media coverage surrounding the then @-@ recent death of pop singer Michael Jackson . During one scene , Stan frightens off a group of Japanese whalers by uncovering a large statue of Godzilla , the famous Japanese movie monster . During the episode Kyle , Kenny and Cartman are shown performing Lady Gaga 's song " Poker Face " on the video game Rock Band . On March 16 , 2010 , Rock Band developer Harmonix released this version of the song ( along with the original version ) as downloadable content for the game .

 " Whale Whores " received generally mixed reviews . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the criticism of the save @-@ the @-@ whales conservationists as a " delightfully savage ridicule " . Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show 's focus on whale conservation , writing , " Leave it to the hard @-@ hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together . " Josh Modell of The A.V. Club 's said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was " culturally insignificant " and not particularly well @-@ known . Modell wrote , " The show 's star , Paul Watson , seems to have really pissed off South Park 's creators Parker and Stone [ ... ] Fine , but could you make me laugh a few times while you beat me over the head with information about a guy that I couldn 't care less about ? " 
 Ramsey Isler of IGN called " Whale Whores " an entertaining episode , but said the episode could have provided more meaningful satire and did not explain the whaling issue very well , especially considering the show 's target audience was probably unfamiliar with it . Isler praised some of the individual jokes revolving around the Japanese attacks , and called Cartman 's " Poker Face " rendition a classic South Park moment , but dismissed the Enola Gay twist as " stupid " . Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said " South Park swung and missed " with " Whale Whores " . Delgado said many of the jokes were random and " weird " , particularly the Enola Gay twist and the Japanese kamikaze attacks . 
 Paul Watson said he was not offended by his portrayal in the episode , and was glad " Whale Whores " brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience , as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths . Watson said , " It 's a tough situation we are in . We can 't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations . If that makes us <unk> , so be it . It 's better than being portrayed as killers . " Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling , but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been . 
 In February 2010 , " Whale Whores " was nominated for a Genesis Award in the television comedy category . The Genesis Awards pay tribute to news and entertainment media for outstanding work that raise public understanding of animal issues .

Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to change the name of The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan , without consulting either of them . Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show , in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak . After the promotion , Liz tries to re @-@ assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show is because of Jack . Liz finds out that Jenna 's microphone was still on , and everyone in the studio heard her say terrible things about Jack and Tracy . 
 Liz attempts to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal , during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna and the other members of her staff . Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio 's monitors , which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments . Liz 's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her . Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over , and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht .

 Rachel Dratch , longtime comedy partner and fellow Saturday Night Live alumna of Fey , was originally cast to portray Jenna . Dratch played the role in the show 's original pilot , but in August 2006 , Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch 's replacement . Executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that while Dratch would not be playing a series regular , she would appear in various episodes in a different role .

 According to the Nielsen ratings system , " The Aftermath " was viewed by 5 @.@ 71 million viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States . It also achieved a 2 @.@ 3 / 7 in the key 18 – 49 demographic , meaning that it was watched by 2 @.@ 4 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds in the U.S. , and 5 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This was 2 @.@ 42 million viewers less than the pilot .

This was 200 @,@ 000 viewers down from the pilot , which attracted 700 @,@ 000 viewers and a 6 % share of the viewing audience at the time of the broadcast . 
 Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode was more cohesive than the pilot , but still suffered from " two generic main characters and predictable storytelling " . He praised characters Liz and Jack , saying they " continued to provide laughs " , but said Jenna and Tracy " only continued to frustrate " . Canning called Baldwin the best part of 30 Rock , and found that the series had " laid essential groundwork for a successful situation comedy " . Robert Abele of LA Weekly felt that the characters of Morgan and Krakowski were undeveloped , describing them as " self @-@ obsessed , newly thrown @-@ together co @-@ leads " . 
 Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that " The Aftermath " was only " minorly more funny " than the pilot . He praised Baldwin and Morgan , but said that the rest of the episode was " weak " . Goodman felt that Fey could " fix " 30 Rock by showing more of Baldwin , and less of Krakowski . Phil Horst of The Pitt News praised the individual scenes between Fey and either Baldwin or Morgan , but criticized Fey for not writing an effective scene in which she did not appear . Horst saw Jenna 's screentime as a waste of time , and thought that Krakowski did not " have the comedic skills to keep up with the rest of the cast " . He went on to say that Dratch would have taken the character in " a completely different direction " , giving 30 Rock the variety it lacked . 
 = Operation Retribution ( 1941 ) = 
 Operation Retribution ( German : Unternehmen <unk> ) also known as Operation Punishment , was the codename used for the April 1941 German bombing of Belgrade , the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , in the first days of the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . The operation commenced on 6 April and concluded on 7 or 8 April , resulting in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control , widespread destruction largely in the centre of the city , and significant civilian casualties . The bombing of Belgrade was preceded by the commencement of the ground invasion a few hours earlier , and also coincided with air attacks on a large number of Royal Yugoslav Air Force airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia . The invasion resulted in the surrender of Yugoslav forces on 17 April . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the 1938 Anschluss ( union ) of Germany with Austria , Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pressure as her neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers . In April 1939 , Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania . Between September and November 1940 , Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact , Italy invaded Greece , and Romania also joined the Pact . From that time , Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states , and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure . On 14 February 1941 , Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar @-@ Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact . Two weeks later , Bulgaria joined the Pact . The next day , German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania , closing the ring around Yugoslavia . 
 Further pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941 , when the Yugoslav Regent , Prince Paul , visited Berchtesgaden , but Prince Paul delayed a decision . On 6 March , the Royal Yugoslav Air Force ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VVKJ ) was secretly mobilised , and on the following day , British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the defences of their Balkan ally against the Italians . The VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields on 12 March , and this dispersal was completed by 20 March . Hitler , wanting to secure the southern flank of his impending invasion of the Soviet Union , demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact , and the Yugoslav government eventually complied on 25 March 1941 . Two days later a military coup d 'état was carried out by a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav Royal Guard officers , led by VVKJ commander Brigadier General Borivoje Mirković . Prince Paul was deposed and replaced by the 17 @-@ year @-@ old King Peter II who was declared to be of age . 
 On the same day as the Yugoslav coup d 'état , Hitler issued Directive 25 , which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the Balkans . He ordered that " even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty , she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible . " After the coup , German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace , and VVKJ fighter aircraft were on constant alert . The German incursions showed that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate . 
 = = Bombing = = 
 Hitler decided that Belgrade would be bombed in " retribution " for the coup against the government that had signed the Pact . In order to carry out Hitler 's orders , on 27 and 28 March 1941 Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany . The commander of Luftflotte IV , Generaloberst ( General ) Alexander Löhr , allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night . Löhr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March , but the decision to bomb Belgrade was not confirmed by Hitler until 5 April . Although Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade , Löhr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives at the last minute . On 3 April , Major Vladimir Kren of the VVKJ defected to the Germans , flying a Potez 25 aircraft to Graz in the Third Reich , and handing over the locations of many of the dispersal airfields as well as codes used by the VVKJ , which had to be quickly changed . On the afternoon of 5 May , a British colonel visited Mirković at the VVKJ base at Zemun and confirmed that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06 : 30 the following morning . 
 = = = 6 April = = = 
 The German ground forces crossed the border at 05 : 15 on 6 April , and the Reich Minister of Propaganda Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels announced the declaration of war at 06 : 00 . Yugoslav anti @-@ aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03 : 00 , but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian @-@ based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off . The VVKJ 's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn , and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields , the first patrol was sent into the air . At first , no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade . 
 The first wave closed on Belgrade at 06 : 45 , and consisted of 74 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka divebombers and 160 Heinkel He 111 medium bombers and Dornier Do 17 light bombers between 8 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 – 3 @,@ 000 m ) . They were escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters at 11 @,@ 000 – 12 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 400 – 3 @,@ 700 m ) and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at 15 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) . The whole of the Yugoslav 6th Fighter Brigade , consisting of the 51st Fighter Group at Zemun and the 32nd Fighter Group at Prnjavor , totalling 29 Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and 5 Rogožarski IK @-@ 3s , were scrambled to intercept the Germans . The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 ) . Just as the first wave was departing , Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Group of the 2nd Fighter Brigade based at <unk> arrived over Belgrade and engaged some divebombers , claiming one Stuka shot down . During the first attack , the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down , lost five of their own , with more than six badly damaged . The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground . On his return to base , the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action . 
 The second wave arrived over Belgrade about 10 : 00 , consisting of 57 Junkers Ju 87 divebombers and 30 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters . They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade . This time the Yugoslavs claimed two divebombers forced down , and one Bf 109E shot down . A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at Kragujevac , acting without orders of their group commander , followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two divebombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft . 
 Two further attacks were made on Belgrade by the Germans on the first day of the invasion . The third wave struck at 14 : 00 , consisting of 94 twin @-@ engined bombers flying from airfields near Vienna , escorted by 60 fighters . This attack was confronted by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment , who claimed four German aircraft shot down . The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16 : 00 , comprising 97 divebombers and 60 fighters . 
 The German groups attacking Belgrade claimed a total of nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April . Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged . The Yugoslavs claimed they had shot down twenty @-@ two German aircraft and forced two more to land . The Germans lost significantly less aircraft than claimed by the Yugoslavs , a total of twelve aircraft ; two Do 17Z light bombers , five Bf 110 heavy fighters , four Ju 87 divebombers , and one Bf 109E fighter . One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was Oberleutnant Gerhard <unk> of JG 54 , who went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1944 . 
 = = = 7 April = = = 
 In total , bombers and dive @-@ bombers dropped 215 – 360 long tons ( 241 – 403 short tons ) of bombs and incendiaries on the capital . 
 The weak Royal Yugoslav Air Force and inadequate anti @-@ aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault , but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack . Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders . A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft , and shot down 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed 44 on the ground , whereas other sources state that the Yugoslavs shot down 40 German aircraft over the two @-@ day air battle . Dive @-@ bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude . 
 According to historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch , the bombing of Belgrade lasted for three days . Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted just two days owing to poor flying weather on 8 April . The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the National Library of Serbia , which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire . Hundreds of thousands of volumes , rare books , maps , and medieval manuscripts were destroyed . Also hit was the Belgrade Zoo , which housed a number of animals . " Out of the nightmare of smoke and fire , " wrote Winston Churchill , " came the maddened animals released from their shattered cages . " 
 = = British retaliation = = 
 No. 37 Squadron of the Royal Air Force conducted two bombing raids on Sofia , the capital of Bulgaria , in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade . Operating Vickers Wellington bombers flying from an airfield in Greece , the squadron conducted raids on 6 – 7 April and 12 – 13 April , dropping a total of 30 long tons ( 34 short tons ) of high @-@ explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas . These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The bombing of Belgrade paralysed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters , and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance . 
 Civilian casualties were significant , but sources vary widely from 1 @,@ 500 to 17 @,@ 000 killed . According to the journalist William Stevenson , around 24 @,@ 000 corpses were recovered from the ruins , and many were never found . The official casualty figure released soon after the bombing was 2 @,@ 271 killed . Other sources mention 5 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 fatalities , with later Yugoslav estimates ranging even higher . In contrast , Professor Jozo Tomasevich writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following " careful postwar investigations " , and indicates that a figure between 3 @,@ 000 and 4 @,@ 000 is more realistic . 
 Following the Yugoslav capitulation , Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade . The report stated that 218 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 215 @.@ 0 long tons ; 240 @.@ 9 short tons ) of bombs were dropped , with 10 – 14 percent being incendiaries . It listed all the targets of the bombing , which included : the royal palace , the war ministry , military headquarters , the central post office , the telegraph office , passenger and goods railway stations , power stations and barracks . It also mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped , and that areas in the centre and northwest of the city had been destroyed , comprising 20 – 25 percent of its total area . Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained , particularly the use of the aerial mines . In contrast , Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed . After the invasion , the Germans forced 3 @,@ 500 – 4 @,@ 000 Jews to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing . 
 Löhr was captured by the Yugoslav Partisans on 9 May 1945 , escaped , and was recaptured on 13 May . He was intensively interrogated , after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on a number of war crimes charges , one of which related to his command of Luftflotte IV during Operation Retribution . He was convicted , sentenced to death and executed .

 = 2011 Alabama Crimson Tide football team = 
 The 2011 Alabama Crimson Tide football team ( variously " Alabama " , " UA " , " Bama " or " The Tide " ) represented the University of Alabama in the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season .

As a result of the storm , long snapper Carson Tinker suffered a broken wrist with his girlfriend being one of the 43 fatalities attributed to the storm in Tuscaloosa . On May 12 , 2011 , offensive lineman Aaron Douglas was found dead in Fernandina Beach , Florida . The cause of death was subsequently ruled accidental as a result of multiple drug toxicity . After transferring to Alabama from Arizona Western College , Douglas struggled with off @-@ field issues including a DUI charge following a December 2010 arrest . He started his career as a freshman All @-@ America at Tennessee , before the Volunteers ' new head coach Derek Dooley granted him a release from the program in Spring 2010 .
