 = 2005 FA Cup Final = 
 The 2005 FA Cup Final was a football match played between Arsenal and Manchester United on 21 May 2005 at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff . It was the final match of the 2004 – 05 FA Cup , the 124th season of English football ’ s primary cup competition , the FA Cup . Arsenal became the first team to win the FA Cup via a penalty shoot @-@ out , despite being outplayed throughout the game , after neither side managed to score in the initial 90 minutes or in 30 minutes of extra time . The shoot @-@ out finished 5 – 4 to Arsenal , with Patrick Vieira scoring the winning penalty after Paul Scholes ' shot was saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann . 
 As both teams were in the highest tier of English football , the Premier League , Arsenal and Manchester United entered the competition in the third round . Matches up to the semi @-@ final were contested on a one @-@ off basis , with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw . Both clubs only needed one replay along the way to the final ; Arsenal 's tie against Sheffield United in the fifth round was decided by a penalty shootout , whereas Manchester United overcame non @-@ league Exeter City in the third round , after the original tie ended goalless . 
 Protests over the impending takeover of Manchester United by American businessman Malcolm Glazer had threatened to overshadow the final , though demonstrations in Cardiff required little intervention from the police . Both managers for the final made surprising changes to their team ; Arsène Wenger unconventionally deployed a defensive formation , while Sir Alex Ferguson left midfielder Ryan Giggs on the bench . Manchester United dominated the match , creating four times as many shots as their opponents , but struggled to find the breakthrough . In extra time , Arsenal 's José Antonio Reyes was sent off for a second bookable offence , becoming only the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup final . 
 The British press unanimously agreed that Arsenal were fortunate to win ; Wenger himself admitted so in his press conference afterwards . A television audience of over 480 million worldwide watched the final ; in the United Kingdom , coverage of the match peaked at 12 @.@ 8 million , making it the highest @-@ rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final . The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before the year end , coupled with the changing objectives of both clubs , meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger .

 The FA Cup is English football 's primary cup competition . Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly with the remaining clubs . If a match is drawn , the tie is replayed at the ground of the away team from the original match . As with league fixtures , FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions . In September 2004 , it was announced that the Millennium Stadium was chosen as the venue for the semi @-@ finals , in addition to the final .

 Arsenal 's cup run started with a home tie against Stoke City . The visitors took the lead just before the break , but goals from José Antonio Reyes and Robin van Persie in the second half meant Arsenal won 2 – 1 . They then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the next round ; a goal apiece from Patrick Vieira and Fredrik Ljungberg secured a comfortable 2 – 0 victory . 
 Arsenal 's opponent in the fifth round was Sheffield United . After 35 minutes Dennis Bergkamp was sent off for his apparent push on Danny Cullip . With eleven minutes of normal time remaining , Robert Pirès scored for Arsenal , but the team conceded a late penalty which Andy Gray converted . The equaliser for Sheffield United meant the match was replayed at Bramall Lane on 1 March 2005 . Both teams played out a goalless draw after full @-@ time and throughout extra @-@ time , so the tie was decided by a penalty shootout . Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia saved two penalties , which ensured progress into the quarter @-@ finals . 
 Bolton Wanderers hosted Arsenal at the Reebok Stadium in the sixth round of the competition . Ljungberg scored the only goal of the tie after just three minutes ; he had an opportunity to extend Arsenal 's lead in stoppage time , but hit the ball over from six yards . It was described by BBC Sport as the " most glaring miss of the match , if not the entire season . " 
 Arsenal faced Blackburn Rovers in the semi @-@ final which was played on 16 April 2005 . Two goals from Van Persie and one from Pirès gave Arsenal a 3 – 0 win , in a match marred by Blackburn 's aggressive tactics . 
 = = = Manchester United = = = 
 Manchester United , the holders of the FA Cup , began their defence of the trophy with a home tie against non @-@ league Exeter City . United had made several first team changes and struggled to find a breakthrough in the tie . Even with the second half introductions of Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo , the visitors held on for a goalless draw . The match was replayed at Exeter 's home ground , St James Park on 19 January 2005 . Ronaldo scored the opening goal of the match in the ninth minute and Wayne Rooney added a second , three minutes from normal time . 
 Manchester United 's opponents in the fourth round was Middlesbrough . Rooney scored twice in the team 's 3 – 0 victory – he lobbed the ball over goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer for his first goal and volleyed it for his second . Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren credited Rooney 's performance afterwards and said he made the difference in the tie . Everton hosted Manchester United in the next round at Goodison Park . A goal apiece from Quinton Fortune and Ronaldo in either half ensured a 2 – 0 win . 
 Southampton was Manchester United 's opponent in the sixth round . After two minutes at St Mary 's United took the lead ; a shot by Roy Keane near the penalty area hit Southampton 's Peter Crouch and deflected into the goal . Ronaldo scored United 's second and additional goals from Scholes meant they progressed into the last four of the competition ; the final score was 4 – 0 . 
 In the semi @-@ final Manchester United faced Newcastle United at the Millennium Stadium . They took the lead in the 19th minute when Ruud van Nistelrooy scored , and Scholes extended the team 's advantage just before half time . Van Nistelrooy made it 3 – 0 in the 58th minute , before Shola Ameobi scored what proved a mere consolation a minute later , as Ronaldo added United 's fourth late on . 
 = = Pre @-@ match = = 
 The final marked the fifth meeting between the two clubs in the 2004 – 05 season . Despite finishing six points ahead of Manchester United in the league , Arsenal had lost both league fixtures between the clubs , as well as a League Cup fifth @-@ round tie , which was played out by the clubs ' fringe and reserve team players . Arsenal had won the season 's first encounter in the FA Community Shield , also at the Millennium Stadium , by a 3 – 1 scoreline . 
 The clubs had met in an FA Cup final before – in 1979 , when Arsenal won 3 – 2 . Manchester United were appearing in their 17th FA Cup Final , their second in as many years , and had won the FA Cup on 11 of their previous 16 appearances ( including beating <unk> in the 2004 final ) . Two of these victories had yielded a domestic double ( in 1994 and 1996 ) and in 1999 they had won the FA Cup as part of a unique Treble , consisting of the cup , the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League . Arsenal were also appearing in their 17th Cup final – their fourth in five years . They had won the cup nine times previously , most recently in 2003 , when they beat Southampton in the final . 
 Meetings between Arsenal and Manchester United were keenly contested during the 2000s and highly publicised by the media ; the cup final this season had added significance as neither club won the league after a decade of dominance , and it was their only chance of silverware . The emergence of Chelsea , who were crowned league champions in April , had presented a long @-@ term threat to Arsenal and Manchester United 's duopoly on English football , as they were financed by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich . Chelsea were accused of " tapping @-@ up " Arsenal defender Ashley Cole in January , and were linked to Manchester United 's Rio Ferdinand . 
 Wenger welcomed Chelsea 's emergence , describing them as the " third force " in English football , but he raised concerns over their conduct and what he perceived as artificial growth . Asked whether Chelsea could dominate for the foreseeable , Wenger said : " I feel yes , because they are a financially doped club . They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited . For me , it 's a kind of doping because it 's not in any way linked to their resources . " Despite the absence of Thierry Henry , ruled out through injury , and Arsenal 's poor recent record against Manchester United , Wenger believed his team were more than capable of winning the match : " What is good in football is that it is not predictable . [ … ] You act now like it is a decade that we haven ’ t beaten Manchester United – it 's not true . It 's two games . " It was reported on the eve of the final that Philippe Senderos would start ahead of first @-@ teamer Sol Campbell . 
 Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson dismissed suggestions that his team had been over physical in previous meetings against Arsenal . Referring back to the league fixture in October 2004 , he told reporters : " We committed three fouls on Reyes , for instance , but that hardly constitutes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre , does it ? There were six by them on Cristiano Ronaldo . " He questioned the character of Arsenal 's players after they lost their unbeaten record , and likened their protest to propaganda , as a way to disguise their crisis – " ... it was convenient for them to say they were kicked off the park . " United had struggled to score goals in the lead up to the final , and Ferguson stressed the importance of his team taking their chances . " Big games are usually decided that way . They are so close so that whoever gets in front has an advantage , " he said . 
 = = = Planned protests = = = 
 The build @-@ up to the final had focused upon many Manchester United fans ' discontent at their takeover by American businessman and sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer , and large demonstrations were planned inside and outside the Millennium Stadium . Despite this , the final was played in the rain and only a small group of around 100 supporters held protests and sang anti @-@ Glazer songs . The police were out in force but did not have any trouble to deal with . 
 = = Match = = 
 = = = Team selection = = = 
 Wenger opted for a 4 – 5 – 1 formation , with Bergkamp playing as a lone striker . The absence of Henry also opened a place in midfield for Gilberto Silva , while José Antonio Reyes and Pirès were selected on the wings ahead of Ljungberg and Robin van Persie , who were both named as substitutes . As anticipated , Senderos 's form saw him selected at centre @-@ back ahead of Campbell , despite the England international 's return from injury . 
 Ferguson had a defensive selection dilemma ahead of the final , with both of his starting full @-@ backs , Gabriel Heinze ( ankle ) and Gary Neville ( groin ) , having suffered injuries . Neville eventually recovered enough to make the substitutes ' bench , despite only playing in one of the team 's last five games , but Heinze missed the game entirely , Mikaël Silvestre taking his place at left @-@ back . Neville 's absence meant that John O 'Shea started at right @-@ back . Neville was joined on the bench by winger Ryan Giggs and goalkeeper Tim Howard ; Giggs ' omission was a surprise , and it meant that Darren Fletcher started on the right wing , while Ronaldo played on the left . Howard , on the other hand , had been competing for the number 1 jersey with Roy Carroll all season , and it was ultimately the Northern Irishman who was picked . 
 Roy Keane was appearing in his seventh FA Cup Final having previously played in the 1991 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1999 and 2004 finals . This was the most number of finals for a player in the post @-@ war period ; by 2010 however , Ashley Cole had reached his eighth final . 
 = = = Summary = = = 
 = = = = First half = = = = 
 Manchester United kicked the game off , and also fashioned the first chance of the game ; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross , only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker . Two minutes later , a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard , forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back . 
 Manchester United had the ball in the back of the net on 27 minutes , when Ferdinand turned in the rebound after Jens Lehmann saved from Rooney , but the assistant referee ruled that Ferdinand was offside . After a brief Arsenal attack , Silvestre played a long , diagonal ball to Van Nistelrooy on the right wing . The Dutch forward controlled the ball and then outpaced Cole to the goal line ; he then cut the ball back to Rooney , whose first @-@ time shot was turned over the bar by Lehmann . The consequent corner broke to Rooney on the edge of the penalty area , but his shot was deflected behind for another corner , which Scholes took . The England midfielder floated the ball over to the edge of the penalty area , where Rooney was waiting , only to volley it just over the bar . 
 In the closing stages of the first half , Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal , turning Senderos only to send the ball trickling along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably . The first half finished with a foul on Rooney , who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole , Vieira and Senderos , who eventually brought Rooney down . The English forward took the free kick himself , but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans and the sound of the referee 's half @-@ time whistle . 
 = = = = Second half = = = = 
 Manchester United fashioned the first chance of the second half after just three minutes , when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area , but his left @-@ footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick . Soon after , Van Nistelrooy received the ball on the edge of the penalty area and held it up before playing a through @-@ ball to Keane , but the Irishman 's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney . United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards , from the left corner of the penalty area . 
 Throughout the match , Lauren committed several fouls on Ronaldo , and confronted the Portuguese winger early in the second half , before finally being booked for persistent fouling in the 62nd minute . Ronaldo took the free kick himself but put it just over the bar from 30 yards . In the 64th minute , Arsenal were awarded a free kick for an O 'Shea foul on Reyes ; Bergkamp took the kick , which was headed away by Ferdinand , but only as far as Pirès , whose side @-@ footed volley went over the bar . The free kick was to be Bergkamp 's last contribution to the final , as he was then substituted by Ljungberg in the 65th minute . 
 United then went back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren , who dared not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card . Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full @-@ back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area , but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target . A minute later , Silvestre found Rooney with another diagonal pass ; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross , but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off the foot of the post . Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick . With their very next attack , United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again ; he sent over another cross , but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy . 
 Reyes received his first yellow card in the 76th minute , when he was late in tackling Silvestre after the French defender had played a backpass to Carroll . The break in play allowed Manchester United to make their first substitution , bringing on Fortune for O 'Shea , who appeared to be struggling with a calf injury . With six minutes left in normal time , United won a corner on the left hand side , which Ronaldo played short to Scholes . Scholes returned the ball to Ronaldo , who crossed it into the penalty area , where Keane was unmarked at the back post . The ball eventually broke to the United captain , who shot , only to see four Arsenal players between him and the goal , ready to block his effort behind for another corner . Lehmann came to meet the second corner kick , but missed the ball , allowing it to go all the way through to Van Nistelrooy ; the Dutchman headed the ball goalwards , but Ljungberg was on the line and headed it up onto the crossbar and away . 
 Arsenal then made their second substitution , bringing on Van Persie in place of Cesc Fàbregas . As the match entered injury time at the end of the second half , Ronaldo made yet another run down the left wing , outpacing Lauren to Rooney 's through @-@ ball . The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal , but his shot went over the bar . The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made its way across the penalty area to Ronaldo , but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann . 
 = = = = Extra time = = = = 
 Manchester United brought Giggs on at the start of extra time , the Welshman taking Fletcher 's place in the midfield . They immediately tried to play him in down the left wing , but the pass was over @-@ hit and went beyond Giggs . Arsenal finally got their first shot on target in the seventh minute of extra time , when a Van Persie free kick – awarded for a foul by Silvestre – forced a diving save from Carroll . Four minutes later , Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole , but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full @-@ back in the midriff . United sustained their attack , and the ball came to Scholes in the penalty area , but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann . The resultant corner was taken short by Scholes , before it was played back to him ; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area , but the Dutchman headed over the bar from the edge of the goal area . United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from Scholes into Touré 's body and up onto the Ivorian 's hand , but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down . Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pirès for the remaining 15 minutes . 
 The second half of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United , this time constructed from a Giggs break down the left wing , but Van Nistelrooy failed in his attempt to back @-@ heel Giggs ' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted . Five minutes into the second half , Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre , for which he received a final warning from referee Styles . Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes , who was shown a yellow card . The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after , when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu , provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players . A shoulder @-@ charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing ; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg , but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide . With a couple of minutes left in the extra period , Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking , but Giggs ' cross from the free kick was headed away . Meanwhile , Manchester United 's substitute goalkeeper , Howard , was seen warming up behind the goal , suggesting that he was preparing to come on for Carroll in the event of a penalty shootout ; however , no substitution was made . 
 The referee added two minutes of injury time at the end of extra time , during which time Manchester United won another free kick , but Scholes ' shot was straight at the Arsenal defensive wall . Then , with just seconds left in regulation time , Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half , only to be cynically body @-@ checked by Reyes . Referee Styles made no hesitation and showed Reyes a second yellow card , making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final , after Manchester United 's Kevin Moran in 1985 . The full @-@ time whistle went immediately after Reyes ' dismissal , and the match finished at 0 – 0 , making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout . 
 = = = = Penalty shootout = = = = 
 Van Nistelrooy took the first penalty for Manchester United , in front of the United fans , and sent Lehmann the wrong way to give United the early advantage . Lauren then converted the next penalty for Arsenal , before Scholes stepped up to take United 's second , only to see it saved by Lehmann , diving low to his right . The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg , Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal , Ronaldo , Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team . Although Carroll guessed the correct way to dive , Vieira 's kick was just out of his reach , giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup .

 As the Arsenal players ran towards Vieira and Lehmann to celebrate , Ferguson and Keane were seen consoling various players and staff members . Mark Lawrenson , the BBC 's co @-@ commentator for the final , summarised to his counterpart John <unk> : " Well , we must congratulate Arsenal on the way they took the penalties – they were excellent [ ... ] But I have to say over the course of the 120 minutes , Manchester United have been mugged . " 
 Wenger conceded his opponents were the better side , but praised his team 's resolve , telling reporters : " It was important to score the first goal and with neither team scoring it remained tight for a long , long period . There were some times in the second half when we were a bit lucky but we defended very well and to keep a clean sheet is good . " He admitted his players had practiced taking penalties , but was quick to point out " you don 't score because of the practising – keeping your nerve is more important . " Lehmann , who had been side @-@ lined by Wenger during the course of the season , credited his teammates for scoring all five penalties , and described it as a " big mental achievement . " Cole called Arsenal 's win a " … great team performance , we didn 't have too many chances but we defended really well and battled really hard . " Henry , who sat out the final due to injury expressed sympathy for Manchester United , and recollected a similar experience from his early Arsenal career : " I know how they feel because we lost against Liverpool and did not deserve to lose . If your name is on the cup you win it . " 
 Ferguson was proud of his team 's performance , but admitted their failure throughout the season to convert chances into goals , had cost them once more . Of the game , he continued : " In cup football , you need a break and we didn 't get one . We 've had luck in the past , so you understand it can happen . It 's not a nice experience but it 's one you have to accept . " Ferguson criticised the referee for failing to send Vieira off during extra @-@ time as he fouled Rooney , and labelled Arsenal as " boring " for deploying negative tactics . Keane , like his manager , rued the missed opportunities and said it was a small consolation : " We dominated but I 'm sure the Arsenal players won 't be too bothered about that – they 've got the winners ' medals and the cup and we haven 't . " 
 Writing for The Daily Telegraph , pundit Alan Hansen felt the ease in which Manchester United dominated the final and Arsenal 's inability to vary tactics highlighted why Wenger needed to make changes in the close season . Hansen agreed with Ferguson that United 's lack of goal threat cost them on the day , but felt their future was rosier than Arsenal 's . Nonetheless , he was of the opinion that Chelsea manager José Mourinho had little to be concerned about , concluding his piece with the sentence : " A London club did come away from Cardiff as big winners but it was not Arsenal , it was Chelsea . " In the same newspaper , Paul Hayward praised the performances of Rooney and Ronaldo – " surely the best one @-@ club pairing of under @-@ 21s in world football , " while ex @-@ Arsenal player Alan Smith noted his former club 's win demonstrated how Wenger " for the first time , practically , in his nine @-@ year Highbury tenure , had set up his side with the opposition in mind . " Capturing United 's sombre mood , The Times football correspondent Matt Dickinson wrote : " The black shirts turned out not to be in protest at Glazer but a reflection of their mood after the first FA Cup Final to be decided by a penalty shoot @-@ out . " 
 The match was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both the BBC and Sky Sports , with BBC One providing the free @-@ to @-@ air coverage and Sky Sports 1 being the pay @-@ TV alternative . BBC One held the majority of the viewership , with a peak audience of 12 @.@ 8 million ( 67 @.@ 1 % viewing share ) , which made it the most @-@ watched final in nine years . The match itself was watched by 10 million viewers ( 61 % ) , and coverage of the final averaged at 7 @.@ 3 million ( 50 @.@ 5 % ) . Viewing figures compiled by The Guardian showed the BBC 's coverage was second only to ITV 's broadcast of the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final between Liverpool and A.C. Milan , which amassed 13 @.@ 9 million viewers . Global audience figures for the 2005 FA Cup Final totalled 484 million .

 The 2005 final was Vieira 's last match as an Arsenal player ; he joined Juventus in the close season for a combined total fee of € 20 million . Wenger 's decision to sell his captain was made so the team could benefit from Fàbregas , who broke into the first eleven during the season . In later years , Wenger deviated from his usual counter @-@ attacking style , and imposed a fluent system , with less emphasis on physicality . The immediate seasons after Arsenal relocated to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 saw Wenger sell several experienced players , and integrate more young talent , as a means of fostering an identity with the club . Financing for the stadium however meant Arsenal prioritised its expenditure instead of the squad and trophies . Though Wenger managed to solidify the club ’ s position in the Premier League 's top four and secure the necessary funds to pay back its debtors , the 2005 Cup win represented Arsenal 's last silverware for nine years . In 2014 , he led Arsenal to a record @-@ equalling 11th FA Cup , and became the successful manager in the competition 's history a year later , as his side beat Aston Villa . 
 Like Arsenal , Manchester United endured a period of transition after the final . The Glazer 's takeover of the club resulted in disaffected fans setting up F.C. United of Manchester , which , as of 2016 , has become the largest supporter @-@ owned football club in the United Kingdom . On the pitch , Manchester United began the 2005 – 06 season poorly ; they were eliminated in the group stages of the Champions League and the manager was booed at home after United lost to Blackburn Rovers . Journalist Henry Winter in December 2005 opined that Ferguson needed to resign , writing in his column : " Under Ferguson , United became football 's answer to the Magic Circle . But the magic now drains away and so , next summer , must Ferguson . " He stayed , however , and having already called time on Keane 's career at United , he began reinvigorating his squad , by signing defenders Nemanja Vidić and Patrice Evra . United returned to the Millennium Stadium eight months after the FA Cup loss , and beat Wigan Athletic to win the 2006 Football League Cup Final . Ferguson guided his team to their first League title in four years the following season , after stern competition from Chelsea , and won a further nine competitive honours until his retirement in 2013 . 
 Kevin McCarra regards the final as a turning point in the rivalry between the two clubs : " ... Arsenal and United , who could barely be prised apart in 2005 , have since gone their separate ways . The signs of divergence were already apparent that afternoon . " The match is considered an example of Wenger setting his team up pragmatically and going against his ideals . Having later asserted he would never use the 4 – 5 – 1 system again , Wenger adopted the formation for Champions League matches and his approach resulted in Arsenal reaching the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final .

 Suriname sent a delegation of four people to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China : two athletes ( Jurgen Themen and Kirsten Nieuwendam and two swimmers ( Gordon Touw Ngie Tjouw and Chinyere Pigot ) who participated in four distinct events .

 = Boulogne agreement = 
 The Boulogne agreement was a document signed by a group of English magnates in 1308 , concerning the government of Edward II . After the death of Edward I in 1307 , discontent soon developed against the new king . This was partly due to lingering problems from the previous reign , but also related to issues with Edward II himself . Particularly his abandonment of the Scottish Wars and his patronage of the unpopular Piers Gaveston caused discontent . Drawn up in Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer during the king 's nuptials , the document vaguely asserted the signatories ' duty to guard the rights of the Crown . Three months later , the agreement was the basis for another document , justifying opposition to the king . This latter document , the so @-@ called Declaration of 1308 , is notable for its use of the " doctrine of capacities " : the distinction between the person of the King and the institution of the Crown . 
 The document today exists only in a 17th @-@ century transcript by the antiquarian William Dugdale . The Boulogne agreement was largely unknown to modern historians up until the 1960s , but it is now considered significant because it is the first documented expression of the conflict between king and nobility , which was to dominate so much of the reign of Edward II . Though historians agree on the document 's importance , there is still disagreement over its interpretation , particularly whether the signatories should be seen as oppositional or loyal to the king . 
 = = Background = = 
 Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307 , on the death of his father Edward I. The expectations of the new king were high , and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm . There were , however , some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father . Edward I 's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country , and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords . This had culminated in the drafting of the so @-@ called Remonstrances in 1297 , a set of complaints about royal government . By Edward I 's death in 1307 , most of these issued had been resolved . It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had , and ignored the opinions of his councillors . 
 There were also certain personal issues regarding the new king that caused concern . Shortly before his death , Edward I had exiled Prince Edward 's favourite and possible lover Piers Gaveston , whom the king believed had too much influence over the prince . At his deathbed he had supposedly exhorted some of his closest followers – Henry de Lacy , Earl of Lincoln , Guy de Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick , Aymer de Valence , Earl of Pembroke and Robert Clifford – to keep watch over his son , and particularly to make sure that Gaveston did not return . One of Edward II 's first actions as king was nevertheless to recall Gaveston from exile . He also gave him the title of Earl of Cornwall – a title normally reserved for members of the royal family – thereby furthering the aggravation against the favourite . Another source of discontent was Edward II abandoning the Scottish Wars pursued by his father . This left the way open for Robert the Bruce to regain land the English had conquered , to the detriment of many English magnates . 
 On 22 January 1308 , Edward II left England for France , leaving Gaveston behind as Regent . By the Treaty of Montreuil in 1299 , it had been agreed that Edward should marry Isabella , the daughter of Philippe IV of France . Accompanying the king were several great nobles , including Lincoln , Pembroke , Clifford , John de Warenne , Earl of Surrey and Humphrey de Bohun , Earl of Hereford . On 25 January Edward and Isabella were married at Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer , and on 31 January Edward performed homage for the Duchy of Aquitaine , which the English king held of the French king . On that same day , the nobles mentioned above , with others , gathered to sign the document that has become known to history as the Boulogne agreement . 
 = = Document and interpretation = = 
 The document was signed and dated at Boulogne on the 31 January 1308 . At the top of the list of signatories was Antony Bek , Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem . He was followed by the four earls Lincoln , Pembroke , Surrey and Hereford , and five men of baronial families : Clifford , Payn <unk> , Henry de Gray , John de Botetourt and John de Berwick . The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford , as a transcript made by the 17th @-@ century antiquarian William Dugdale . Dugdale 's transcript is believed to be based on an older document , which was probably lost in the Cotton library fire of 1731 . 
 The text of the document is rather vague and noncommittal . The signatories were concerned with guarding the king 's honour and the rights of the Crown ( <unk> son <unk> et les <unk> de sa <unk> ) . There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights , as well as the past and present oppression of the people ( les choses que sont <unk> avant ces <unk> <unk> <unk> honour et le droit de sa <unk> , et les <unk> que <unk> <unk> <unk> et <unk> se fount de jour en jour a <unk> people ) . Nothing is said about what specifically these things were , but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston . Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement . 
 Because of the vague language of the document , there has been much scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted . John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father , or face the consequences . J. R. S. Phillips , on the other hand , took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II . There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston , primarily the Earl of Warwick . The purpose of the document , in Phillips view , was to present the king with a warning , and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility . 
 = = Aftermath and transmission = = 
 The Boulogne agreement had little immediate impact , and is notable mostly for its influence on a later document presented in parliament in April that year . In the meanwhile , on 25 February , the king had been crowned . Before the coronation , the king had been forced to include an additional clause in his coronation oath . The king obliged himself to abide by the law , but this exact meaning of this promise was ambiguous . The clause referred to laws the people " shall have chosen " ( aura eslu ) , which left it unclear whether it also included future enactments . At the coronation ceremony that followed , Gaveston acted with such presumption and arrogance as to further alienate the leading magnates . 
 The document from the April parliament , today referred to as the Declaration of 1308 , contained three articles and was presented by the Earl of Lincoln . The first article invoked the so @-@ called " doctrine of capacities " : that the subjects of the realm owed allegiance to the institution of the Crown , not to the person of the King . If the King abused his position , it was his subject 's duty to correct this , thereby upholding the pledge of the Boulogne agreement to protect the rights of the Crown . The second article was an attack on Gaveston – though he was not mentioned by name – implicitly demanding his renewed exile . The third article referred to the additional clause from the coronation oath . It was here taken to mean that the king had obliged himself to abide by any decisions made by his subjects ; past , present or future . The king initially held out against the opposition , but the earls also received support from Philippe IV , who was offended by Edward 's apparent preference of Gaveston over Isabella . On 18 May Edward agreed to once again send Gaveston into exile . 
 Dugdale both transcribed the Boulogne agreement and made a reference to it , in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England . After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries . Dugdale 's footnote was mentioned by certain historians , but it was not until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source , when Noël Denholm @-@ Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry : 1254 – 1310 . In 1972 , J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence , Earl of Pembroke 1307 – 1324 . 
 = H @-@ 58 ( Michigan county highway ) = 
 H @-@ 58 is a county @-@ designated highway in the US state of Michigan that runs east – west for approximately 69 miles ( 111 km ) between the communities of Munising and Deer Park in the Upper Peninsula . The western section is routed through Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore , a national park on the southern shore of Lake Superior , and the adjacent Lake Superior State Forest in Alger County while connecting Munising to the communities of Van Meer and Melstrand . At Grand Marais , H @-@ 58 exits the national park and runs through town . The segment running east of Grand Marais to Deer Park in Luce County is a gravel road that connects to H @-@ 37 in Muskallonge Lake State Park . 
 A roadway was present along parts of today 's H @-@ 58 by the late 1920s ; initially , this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and connected with other roads to Grand Marais . In the 1930s , another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and to fill in the gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais . The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M @-@ 94 from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s . 
 The H @-@ 58 designation was created after the county @-@ designated highway system itself was formed in 1970 . Initially , only the section from Grand Marais to Deer Park was given the number ; the remainder was added in 1972 . The last sections to be paved in the 20th century were completed in 1974 . The National Park Service was required to build their own access road for the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the initial legislation that created the park . This requirement was rescinded by the United States Congress in 1998 , and the park service was authorized to fund improvements to H @-@ 58 instead . Paving projects were completed between 2006 and 2010 so that the entire length of H @-@ 58 in Alger County is now paved ; the section in Luce County is still a gravel road . 
 = = Route description = = 
 H @-@ 58 starts in Munising at an intersection with M @-@ 28 . The highway follows the eastern end of Munising Street through the eastern side of the city by the <unk> Paper Mill , then turns northeasterly . The roadway runs outside of , and parallel to , the southern boundary of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore . The park visitors center , which is open year round , is located off H @-@ 58 on Sand Point Road at the west end of the park . The highway turns due east and runs through an intersection with H @-@ 13 ( Connors Road ) . Leaving town , H @-@ 58 becomes Munising – Van Meer – Shingleton Road and enters the national park . East of the intersection with Carmody Road , the county road passes to the south of the Pictured Rocks Golf and Country Club before meeting the intersection with H @-@ 11 ( Miners Castle Road ) . This latter road provides access to Miner 's Castle , a natural rock formation located on the shores of Lake Superior , and the Miners Falls . Further east , H @-@ 58 meets H @-@ 15 in Van Meer , site of the Bear Trap Inn and Bar . Munising – Van Meer – Shingleton Road turns south along H @-@ 15 , and H @-@ 58 turns northeast along Melstrand Road to the community of Melstrand . 
 Melstrand is located outside of the national park boundaries in the Lake Superior State Forest . H @-@ 58 continues through " burned and cut areas , meadows , maturing second growth , and the haunting sounds of silence " in the state forest . H @-@ 58 reenters the national park and approaches more Pictured Rocks facilities like the Hurricane River Campground . The road then travels northward towards Buck Hill , which is near the intersection with the Adams Truck Trail ; at that intersection , there is a parking lot for snowmobiles . Past this point , the road is closed to vehicles during the winter months each year ; snow plows do not clear the snow from the roadway , allowing it to be used as a snowmobile trail . The area on each end of the park averages around 140 – 144 inches ( 360 – 370 cm ) of snowfall annually , while the National Park service says that this central section is higher . 
 The road meanders through forest lands and fields as it continues northwesterly toward the Log Slide . This location gives motorists a chance to hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees to the east and the Grand Sable Dunes to the west . The American Motorcyclist Association said of this segment of the roadway that it is " so close to the beach and lake that [ one ] can smell it when [ he ] rides . " The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground . The roadway crosses the Hurricane River and turns southerly away from Lake Superior . H @-@ 58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake , running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior . At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads , H @-@ 58 makes a 90 ° curve and travels northward for about three @-@ quarters of a mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) . The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot . This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H @-@ 58 that road crews do not plow . The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of Grand Marais . On the edge of town is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach to the base of the Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore . These dunes reach heights of up to 275 feet ( 84 m ) at a 35 ° incline . Hikers are advised to use the access points along H @-@ 58 to get to the dunes instead of attempting the climb up the face . 
 H @-@ 58 meets M @-@ 77 in Grand Marais . This town is the location of a small harbor that was once the home of a lumber shipping port . H @-@ 58 turns south to run concurrently along M @-@ 77 for about two blocks before turning back eastward . The county road runs along the southern edge of the harbor past the township 's school and out of town . The pavement ends when the road leaves Alger County for Luce County . 
 H @-@ 58 follows a gravel roadway through the forested northwestern corner of Luce County . The roadway turns northeasterly and runs closer to Lake Superior as it approaches Deer Park . The road also carries the County Road 407 ( CR 407 ) designation and the name Grand Marais Truck Trail . Near the Blind Sucker Flooding , a man @-@ made reservoir , the truck trail turns south to intersect Deer Park Road . H @-@ 58 turns east on Deer Park Road and runs between Rainy and Reedy lakes to the south and Lake Superior to the north . The east end of H @-@ 58 is at an intersection with H @-@ 37 near Muskallonge Lake State Park in Deer Park , north of Newberry . Deer Park is the location of a trio of resorts and remnants of a community that once included a sawmill , hotel and store . The state park is located on the shore of Muskallonge Lake and is visited by about 71 @,@ 000 people each year .

 = = = Road origins = = = 
 A county road along part of the route of H @-@ 58 was present at by at least 1927 ; the road ran east and northeasterly from Munising to Kingston Corners where it followed what is now Adams Trail east to M @-@ 77 . A second county road ran westward from Grand Marais . By 1929 , M @-@ 94 was rerouted through Alger County to follow Munising – Van Meer – Shingleton Road east from Munising to Van Meer and then south to Shingleton ; that routing followed what is now H @-@ 58 and H @-@ 15 . The section of county road between Van Meer and Melstrand was surfaced in gravel by 1936 with the remainder only an earthen road . By the end of the year , an earthen road was constructed east of Grand Marais to Deer Park . After the end of World War II , the gravel segment was extended north of Melstrand to the Buck Hill area , and the earthen road was extended between the Adams Trail and Grand Marais by way of Au Sable Point . East of Grand Marais , the roadway was improved with gravel to the county line . In late 1946 or early 1947 , the first two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Grand Marais were paved ; additional sections in Luce County were improved to gravel . All of the earthen road segments of what is now H @-@ 58 were improved to gravel road by the middle of 1958 ; the section between Van Meer and Melstrand as well as a section east of Grand Marais were paved . 
 In the early 1960s , M @-@ 94 was moved to follow M @-@ 28 between Munising and Shingleton . The section of Munising – Van Meer – Shingleton Road east of the junction with Connors Road was returned to county control by the middle of 1960 , and the remainder westward into Munising was turned over on November 7 , 1963 . In late 1961 , about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) was paved to the west of Grand Marais . The county @-@ designated highway system was created around October 5 , 1970 , and the section of H @-@ 58 was shown on state maps for the first time in 1971 . Initially , only the section between Grand Marais and Deer Park was marked as part of H @-@ 58 . Within two years , the remainder was marked as H @-@ 58 from Munising northeasterly to Grand Marais ; between Connors and Miners Castle roads was also a section of H @-@ 13 as the two designations were run concurrently together . In 1974 , the road was paved from Melstrand north to the Buck Hill area . The H @-@ 13 concurrency was removed in 2004 when the northern segment of H @-@ 13 along Miners Castle Road was redesignated H @-@ 11 . 
 = = = Park service gets involved = = = 
 The Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore was authorized on October 15 , 1966 , when President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the enabling legislation . The park was inaugurated on October 6 , 1972 , in ceremonies in Munising . In the original legislation that created the park was a mandate to build an access road along Lake Superior . When the National Park Service conducted environmental studies on such a road in the mid @-@ 1990s , they decided on a 13 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 21 km ) road called the Beaver Basin Rim Road between Twelvemile Beach and Legion Lake . Area residents opposed the plan , preferring that the federal government instead improve the existing H @-@ 58 . Representative Bart Stupak lobbied his colleagues in Congress in 1996 saying that building the new road would cost twice as much as improving the existing H @-@ 58 ; Stupak also introduced legislation to remove the construction mandate from the park . 
 Because H @-@ 58 was under the jurisdiction of the county , and not the park , it was ineligible for park service funding . Appropriations legislation passed by Congress in 1998 allowed the park service to fund road improvements in the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore for county @-@ maintained roads . Additional legislation reintroduced and sponsored by Stupak was also passed that removed the original road construction mandate from the park . On November 12 , 1998 , President Bill Clinton signed the legislation which cleared the last hurdles ; the service was prohibited from building that road and instead authorized to help the Alger County Road Commission ( ACRC ) improve H @-@ 58 . In 2005 , the Safe , <unk> , Flexible , Efficient Transportation Equity Act : A Legacy for Users budgeted $ 13 @.@ 3 million ( equivalent to $ 16 @.@ 8 million in 2015 ) for the paving and reconstruction project . 
 The ACRC implemented a five @-@ stage plan to pave the remaining sections of the road between the Melstrand area and Grand Marais utilizing National Park Service funding . Plans were put into place by July 2006 to straighten some tight curves and realign the roadway in places . The commission designed the updated road for travel speeds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) " to maintain the nature of the road and the park setting . " One phase was divided into subsections to accommodate the bridge across the Hurricane River . 
 Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the boundary of the national park was held up pending passage of a technical corrections bill by the US Senate . The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved ; instead they were being paved for the first time or realigned . A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved . The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway . Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008 . While the county completed a segment on their own in 2006 , the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national park boundaries from Buck Hill northwards . Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries , including a new bridge over the Hurricane River . 
 The final section was dedicated at a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony on October 15 , 2010 , which marked the official opening to traffic . Final work was continued through the end of that month to complete the Hurricane River Bridge . Since the road was completed , traffic has increased . After paving , the new road has reduced travel times between Munising and Grand Marais from 90 to 45 minutes . Not all residents have been happy with the updated H @-@ 58 ; thousands of nails have been scattered along the road , and have led to flat tires on many vehicles . Police said at the time they believed it was intentional , but had no motive for the vandalism . Since the thoroughfare has re @-@ opened , motorcyclists now frequent the highway , and a local group has named H @-@ 58 " one of the top five motorcycling roads in Upper Michigan " , and it has been promoted by the American Motorcyclist Association in their guidebooks .

 Race Against Time : Searching for Hope in AIDS @-@ Ravaged Africa is a non @-@ fiction book written by Stephen Lewis for the Massey Lectures . Lewis wrote it in early to mid @-@ 2005 and House of Anansi Press released it as the lecture series began in October 2005 . Each of the book 's chapters was delivered as one lecture in a different Canadian city , beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28 . The speeches were aired on CBC Radio One between November 7 and 11 . The author and orator , Stephen Lewis , was at that time the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa and former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations . Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as a concerned Canadian citizen , his criticism of the United Nations ( UN ) , international organizations , and other diplomats , including naming specific people , was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position . 
 In the book and the lectures , Lewis argues that significant changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline . Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s , citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to , rather than reduced , poverty . He connects the structural adjustment loans , with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure , to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working @-@ age population . Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children . To help alleviate problems , he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise . 
 Book reviewers found the criticisms constructive and the writing sincere . His style focuses less on numbers and statistics , and more on connecting decisions by UN officials and western diplomats to consequences on the ground in Africa . His eyewitness accounts are said to be candid and emotional . The book spent seven weeks at # 1 on The Globe and Mail 's Nonfiction Bestseller List . A second edition was released in June 2006 . The Canadian Booksellers Association awarded its Libris Award for non @-@ fiction book of the year to Race Against Time and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006 . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the time of publication , the author , Stephen Lewis , aged 67 and living in Toronto , worked as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa , a position he held since 2001 . Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children 's Fund ( 1994 – 99 ) , as the Canadian ambassador to the UN ( 1984 – 88 ) , and as leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party ( 1970 – 79 ) . After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed . Already a skilled orator , he became more vocal on the topic . He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation , hosted Oprah Winfrey as she toured Africa , and was the subject of two award @-@ winning documentaries by The Nature of Things , entitled Race Against Time and The Value of Life . Meanwhile he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada , awarded the Pearson Medal of Peace , and named Canadian of the Year ( 2003 ) by MacLean 's magazine . In 2005 , he was invited to deliver the annual series of Massey Lectures from which the book , Race Against Time , was adapted . He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released . Lewis wrote the book , not as an employee of the UN , but as a citizen concerned with the world 's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa . 
 = = Content = = 
 The book consists of five chapters , from which the five lectures were derived : Context , Pandemic , Education , Women , and Solutions . Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments , and afterwards a Glossary section . The book 's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006 . In the Preface , written by Lewis in August 2005 , he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and that the nature of the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect . He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984 . In the first chapter , Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN @-@ related events like , in 1986 , brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly 's 13th Special Session . He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation , but focuses on the effects of international finance institutions ' conditional loans since the late 1980s . 
 In the second chapter Lewis discusses his history in Africa , beginning in the 1960s as an English teacher in Ghana . He contrasts Africa of the 1960s shedding colonial rule , optimistic in future prospects , with Africa of the 2000s struggling with AIDS and increasingly widespread hunger . He acknowledges the brain drain trend , noting " there are more Malawian doctors in Manchester [ England ] than in Malawi " . In the third chapter Lewis examines how the UN , World Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) failed to fulfill promises of free access to primary education . In the instances where school entry fees were eliminated , additional fees ( e.g. fees for uniforms , books , exams , and registration ) had the same effect of limiting access . The fourth chapter elaborates on how women 's issues are ignored or dismissed at international conferences and by African governments . Lewis identifies the gender discrimination that occurs even within the UN organization , whose management staff was dominated by males . He links the World Bank and IMF conditions of low social spending on education and healthcare by governments of recipient countries to the rampant spread of AIDS in those same countries . The disease decimated Africa 's working age and farming population , leading to famine . He calls on the international financial institutions to pay " reparations " in the form of debt relief . 
 Lewis concludes that dramatic changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 . In the final chapter , he considers some potential measures that could help in Africa . He laments the shortfalls in funding by G8 countries , despite the continued renewed promises for full funding of Millennium Development Goal implementation . His proposed measures include : 
 the expansion of the Jubilee Coalition to include cancellation of agricultural subsidies ; 
 the amalgamation of UN Development Fund for Women , the UN Division for the Advancement of Women , and relevant portions of United Nations Population Fund into one UN agency funded to a similar level as UNICEF ; 
 maintenance of the momentum on the World Health Organization 's ' three by five ' ( 3 million people treated by 2005 ) program ; 
 addressing revenue shortfall in The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria through donations from private @-@ sector organizations that profit from Africa ( e.g. pharmaceutical companies ) ; 
 creating an agency that can provide emergency food aid in a much shorter timeframe than current programs ; 
 supporting Jeffrey Sachs ' Millennium Village Project ; 
 investing in vaccine and <unk> research ; 
 eliminating school fees for primary education ; 
 using microcredit money pots for women to care for orphans ; 
 planning for capacity replacement on a country @-@ by @-@ country , sector @-@ by @-@ sector basis .

 The writing style reflects the author 's intent to use the text for a lecture series . The narration addresses the audience while guiding it through explanations of the issues and anecdotal illustrations . Lewis ' charismatic , eloquent , and energetic oration style is reflected in the writing . The tone has been described as loud and persuasive . One reviewer called it " vintage Lewis – incisive criticism leavened with high @-@ blown rhetoric " . The book focuses more upon real @-@ world human experiences , rather than numbers and statistics , in discussing the effect of AIDS in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and the world 's response . Lewis ' eyewitness accounts are candid and vivid . For example , he recounts tours of hospitals and schools as he explains the dire straits of national health and education sectors , and he describes meetings with diplomats and staff from the UN , World Bank , and IMF as he explains their effect on foreign aid policies . The book is written from an idealistic perspective and , despite the anger and underlying sense of guilt , Lewis remains optimistic . While he was a professional diplomat , his memoir @-@ style reflections on specific people , such as Michel <unk> , Carol Bellamy , and Thabo Mbeki were called undiplomatic . Despite the book 's undiplomatic style , Lewis retained his post as a UN Special Envoy until the term completed in December 2006 .

 The book was released on October 18 as Lewis began the Massey lecture series in Vancouver . The second lecture took place in Winnipeg on the 20th , followed by Montreal on the 22nd , Halifax on the 26th , and the final one in Toronto two days later . The series was recorded then aired on CBC Radio One 's Ideas between November 7 and 11 . At each event Lewis fielded questions from the audience and participated in book signings . The publisher , House of Anansi Press , was on the last year of its contract with CBC to publish the Massey Lecture series ; facing a competitive bid from Penguin Books , Anansi aggressively promoted Race Against Time , with Lewis giving interviews to local media and attending receptions . CBC promoted the events nationally . Following an initial printing of 25 @,@ 000 copies of the book by Anansi , along with the audio CDs produced by CBC Audio , there was a second printing in June 2006 with a new Afterword section .

 In the Canadian market , Race Against Time debuted at # 5 on The Globe and Mail 's Nonfiction Bestseller List on October 29 . It spent seven weeks at # 1 , and forty weeks in the top ten . Excerpts from the book were published in The Globe and Mail , The Montreal Gazette , and Alternatives Journal . At the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Awards in June 2006 , the book won non @-@ fiction book of the year and Lewis won the Author of the Year Award . The book was short @-@ listed for the Pearson Writers ' Trust Prize and the Trillium Book Award . 
 The book was positively received by reviewers . The prose has been called magnificent , lucid , eloquent , and passionate . Lewis ' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid , sincere , powerful , and moving . Connecting the diplomatic and policy @-@ level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects on the ground in Africa , and describing the problem of orphans , were among the strengths of the book . Lewis ' criticisms are constructive and , since they come from such an ardent <unk> employed by the United Nations , authoritative . One reviewer questioned several of Lewis ' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws . The same reviewer identified as the book 's weakness its political slant , which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities of asking corporations and western governments to take steps against their self @-@ interest , like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating profits in the case of businesses . Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an effective tool to educate about the HIV / AIDS crisis and the plight of the people of sub @-@ Saharan Africa . 
 An article in The New York Times , in October 2005 , reported on the book 's criticism of South Africa 's government , singling out President Thabo Mbeki and Health Minister Manto <unk> @-@ <unk> . Lewis claimed that the South African programs were half @-@ hearted and confusing ; a spokesperson for the Health Ministry characterized Lewis as a biased and uninformed judge of South Africa 's situation , and countered that they are rapidly expanding treatment programs . In August 2006 , as a keynote speaker at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto , Lewis sustained his criticism , calling South Africa 's government " still obtuse , dilatory and negligent about rolling out treatment " . 
 = 2016 Milan – San Remo = 
 The 107th edition of the Milan – San Remo cycling classic took place on Saturday , 19 March 2016 . It was the fourth of 28 races of the 2016 UCI World Tour ; the first one @-@ day race . It was also the first cycling monument of the season . 
 It was won by Arnaud Démare in a sprint finish , ahead of Ben Swift ( Team Sky ) and Jürgen Roelandts ( Lotto – Soudal ) . The finish was disrupted by a crash involving Fernando Gaviria ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , causing several riders to take avoiding action , ruling them out of contention . A landslide on the road caused the race to be diverted for a length of 9 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) . 
 = = Route = = 
 As one of the sports monuments , Milan – San Remo is among the highest @-@ rated races in professional cycling . The 2016 route was set to be 291 km ( 181 mi ) long . Generally considered a sprinters ' classic , the race ran from the Via della Chiesa Rossa in Milan to the traditional finish on San Remo 's Via Roma . The final part of the race included the climbs of the Cipressa and the Poggio , which usually proved decisive for the race outcome . Across the road , the riders also had to tackle the 35 km ( 22 mi ) climb of the Passo dello Turchino , although it was not considered to be a key point in the race . After the Turchino , the route followed the Aurelia road along the coast from Genoa all the way to the finish in San Remo . With a little over 50 km ( 31 mi ) left to go , the first of the coastal climbs started with the Capo Mele , the Capo <unk> and the Capo Berta , before meeting the final two climbs leading to the finish . 
 A landslide on the morning of the race at a point 130 km ( 81 mi ) into the race caused the route to be slightly changed , with the riders taking a 9 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) detour along the A10 highway , entering in Genova <unk> and exiting in Arenzano , rejoining the original course at that point . As a consequence , the race ran over a distance of 295 km ( 183 mi ) . 
 = = Participating teams = = 
 25 teams were announced to take part in the race : all 18 World Tour teams were automatically invited ; seven continental teams were given wildcards – totalling 200 riders . As Moreno Hofland ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) was unable to start due to illness , 199 riders took part in the race . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The outgoing champion , John Degenkolb , missed Milan – San Remo after injuries sustained in an early @-@ season training camp in Spain . In his absence , 2014 winner Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) was tipped as the main favourite for the victory . Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) was also rated highly in what would be his final appearance in the race , as he was a former winner and had shown strong form , winning Strade Bianche earlier in the season . World Champion Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) was also named as a race favourite , as he had shown good form , albeit still lacking a win in 2016 . He rode with bib number one in the absence of Degenkolb . 
 Two riders came into Milan – San Remo with particular successes in hand , namely Michael Matthews ( Orica – BikeExchange ) , who had won two stages at Paris – Nice just a week earlier , while Greg van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) had won the overall classification at Tirreno – Adriatico . Other favourites included Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) , Niccolo Bonifazio ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Ben Swift , Geraint Thomas and Michał Kwiatkowski ( all Team Sky ) , Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) , Zdeněk Štybar ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , Sacha Modolo ( Lampre – Merida ) , Tony Gallopin ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) , Edvald Boasson Hagen ( Team Dimension Data ) and Simon Clarke ( Cannondale – Drapac ) . 2009 winner Mark Cavendish ( Team Dimension Data ) was also named as a favourite . Meanwhile , Astana named Vincenzo Nibali as their captain for the race , riding the race for the tenth time in his career . Another rider deemed a possible contender , Tom Dumoulin ( Giant – Alpecin ) , was ruled out of the race due to a flu . German sprinter André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) missed the race as well after breaking three ribs at the Volta ao Algarve .

 After the race started in Milan , a breakaway got clear after 14 km ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) of racing , including Gediminas <unk> ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , <unk> <unk> ( Androni Giocattoli – <unk> ) , Mirco Maestri ( Bardiani – CSF ) , Jan Barta ( Bora – Argon 18 ) , Adrian <unk> ( CCC – Sprandi – Polkowice ) , Roger Kluge ( IAM Cycling ) , Matteo Bono ( Lampre – Merida ) , <unk> Conti ( Wilier Triestina – Southeast ) , Maarten Tjallingii ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Andrea Peron ( Team Novo Nordisk ) and Marco <unk> ( Trek – Segafredo ) . The group had a maximum lead over the peloton of 10 : 35 minutes at the 50 km ( 31 mi ) mark . After that , Tinkoff and Orica – BikeExchange began to set a higher tempo in the pack and the lead was reduced to five minutes at the peak of the Turchino . 
 As the leading group arrived at the first seaside climb of the Capo Mele , the gap had come down to 2 : 18 minutes . Meanwhile , the first crashes occurred in the field , with Julien <unk> ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Federico <unk> ( Lampre – Merida ) being the first victims . At the Capo Berta , the lead of the front group was around a minute , while Marco Haller ( Team Katusha ) crashed on the following descent , dropping out of the main field . Another accident occurred a little later . Michael Matthews and Peter Kennaugh ( Team Sky ) were the most prominent riders to go down , but both managed to get back into the field even with a growing pace set at the front . 
 The breakaway group was caught with 25 km ( 16 mi ) to go . At the climb of the Cipressa , Giovanni Visconti ( Movistar Team ) and Ian Stannard ( Team Sky ) attacked and were joined by Daniel Oss ( BMC Racing Team ) , Matteo Montaguti ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , and Fabio Sabatini ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) on the descent . Arnaud Démare crashed on the climb , but was able to reach the field again as it got back to the attacking group at the bottom of the Poggio . Team Katusha set the pace up the final climb , but Michał Kwiatkowski broke clear 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from the finish . Vincenzo Nibali chased after him on the descent and the group of favourites came back together at the run @-@ in to the finish , after Fabian Cancellara had put in an attack , marked by Matteo Trentin ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . At the 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) mark , Edvald Boasson Hagen started one last attack , but to no avail as the group approached the finish together . Shortly before the line , a touch of wheels led to a crash by Fernando Gaviria ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , which caused several riders to lose momentum , including Peter Sagan . In the following mass sprint , Arnaud Démare came out on top and won his first ever cycling monument , ahead of Ben Swift and Jürgen Roelandts ( Lotto – Soudal ) . Démare was the first Frenchman to win Milan – San Remo since Laurent Jalabert in 1995 , and the first Frenchman to win a monument race since Jalabert 's victory in the 1997 Giro di Lombardia . 
 = = Post @-@ race = = 
 Following the race , Démare expressed delight at his victory , saying : " There are days like this one in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup , like crashing at the bottom of the Cipressa . I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic . [ ... ] This is a big one and has been running for over a century . It 's extraordinary . I 'm extremely happy . " Second placed Swift on the other hand , was disappointed by missing out on a possible win : " Obviously , it 's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument . " Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall , which he felt cost him a possible victory : " I am very sad about what happened . It was my fault , I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds , because I began thinking on how to sprint . I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me . That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team . " Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish . Some hundred metres before the finish line , he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off , taking away his chances . After crossing the line , he threw away his bike in anger . 
 Two riders very disappointed with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara . Matthews crashed at high speed shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow . He said : " Obviously I 'm devastated . [ ... ] This was everything , this was my world championships for the start of the season . [ ... ] I was really looking forward to making a good finale , it 's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that . " Cancellara , who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season , was held up in Gaviria 's crash after having stayed in the leading group . He described his final kilometres as difficult , as he had been isolated from his teammates , saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him . Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan , who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular . He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria 's crash : " Then I got away with Boasson Hagen , Gaviria and someone else . Then with about 500 metres to go , Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up . He went down and I only just managed to avoid him . I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres . " 
 One day after the race , both Matteo Tosatto ( Tinkoff ) and Eros Capecchi ( Astana ) accused Démare of having used the tow of his <unk> to rejoin the pack after his crash before the Cipressa climb . Démare rebuffed these allegations , saying that the race commissioners were right behind him and would have disqualified him , had he done something illegal . On 8 May 2016 , it became public that the Italian Cycling Federation was making inquiries into the accusations about Démare , with Tosatto saying that he had given written testimony to officials about the incident .

 = Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927 = 
 The Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927 arose from a disagreement among members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club over the selection of a new captain to succeed the retired Major Arthur Lupton . The main issue was whether a professional cricketer should be appointed to the post . It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains should always be amateurs . At Yorkshire , a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s , on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities , although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers . None lasted long ; after Lupton 's departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long @-@ term basis . 
 The Yorkshire committee , prompted by the influential county president , Lord Hawke , approached Herbert Sutcliffe , one of the side 's leading professionals . After Sutcliffe 's provisional acceptance of the captaincy , controversy arose . Some members objected to the appointment on the traditional grounds that Sutcliffe was not an amateur ; others felt that if a professional was to be appointed , the post should be offered to the county 's senior professional , Wilfred Rhodes , who had been playing much longer than Sutcliffe . Rhodes himself was offended that he had not been approached . When Sutcliffe became aware of the controversy , he withdrew his acceptance . No offer was made to Rhodes , and the county subsequently appointed amateur William Worsley as captain . He was respected by the team but had little personal success , lasted for just two seasons , and was followed by two further short @-@ term leaders . In 1933 Brian Sellers , a more competent amateur , was appointed and became the long @-@ serving captain that Yorkshire had sought . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1920s , every English county cricket team had an amateur captain . Yorkshire had been led by amateurs since Lord Hawke took over the position in 1883 . Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds , while professionals were mainly from the working classes . Class distinctions pervaded the game , which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs . They wished to preserve leadership roles for members of the Establishment , in defiance of broader social changes that had reduced their influence in other sports . Administrators argued that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over employment . The Wisden editor believed that " the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline . He would naturally hesitate to suggest to his committee that this player or that should be dropped , and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood . Further , feeling that an error of judgment would prejudice his standing with the committee , he might well hesitate to take risks . " In 1925 , Lord Hawke , then the Yorkshire president , expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side , had made the impromptu comment , " Pray God , no professional shall ever captain England . " His remarks were widely reported in the press and heavily criticised . This was to leave Hawke in an awkward situation in 1927 . 
 By the end of the 1927 English cricket season , Yorkshire had had a succession of short @-@ term captains . Generally , these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team , but Yorkshire 's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership . Tactically , Yorkshire 's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson . The captain 's primary role was the enforcement of discipline : maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected . In the early 1920s , Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field ; cricket correspondent Jim Kilburn wrote that they were in danger of becoming " social outcasts " , and E. W. Swanton commented that Yorkshire 's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely to jeopardise their relations with other teams . Matters came to a head in a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield . The crowd became very antagonistic and a Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest . Further incidents against Surrey that season led the captain Geoffrey Wilson to resign , though he led the team to the County Championship in each of his three years in charge . His resignation was possibly prompted by the Yorkshire president , Lord Hawke , but Wilson did not like the belligerent nature of the team and found it difficult to handle Rhodes . 
 Yorkshire appointed Major Arthur Lupton as captain , hoping that his experience in the army would allow him to exercise greater control than his predecessors had managed . Aged 46 , he was old for a cricketer . He had played once for Yorkshire in 1908 , but was no longer an effective batsman . He was very popular with the players , and managed to improve discipline but had little influence on team tactics . He left such matters to Rhodes and Robinson , to the point where several apocryphal stories emerged about his lack of control . In one story , Yorkshire had scored around 400 . Lupton , hoping to score some easy runs , came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said , " It 's all right , sir . Mr Rhodes has declared [ the innings over ] . " After three years in charge , Lupton resigned the captaincy at the end of 1927 . In their search for a successor , Yorkshire hoped to appoint a player with a better cricketing reputation who would serve for a longer term . 
 = = Appointment of Sutcliffe = = 
 = = = Initial approach = = = 
 At the beginning of the 1927 season , Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional . Rhodes declined , prompted by his wife 's suspicion of a plot against him . This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain . Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe , a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919 . In addition to Rhodes , other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe . However , Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals : he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War , his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society . Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers , and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one . While not particularly popular with his team @-@ mates , he was respected . 
 Hawke asked Sir Home Gordon , a cricket writer who had assisted Hawke with his autobiography , to sound out other counties to see if they would find Sutcliffe an acceptable captain if he played as an amateur — some players switched from amateur to professional , or vice versa , around this time . Sutcliffe was en route to South Africa with the MCC touring team , but was aware that Yorkshire were considering him as a replacement for Lupton . 
 Sutcliffe 's election was confirmed at a meeting of the club 's governing committee on 2 November 1927 , which voted on two proposals sponsored by Hawke . The first , to give Sutcliffe amateur status , was defeated by 19 votes to 5 ; the second , to appoint him captain , was carried 13 – 11 . On 4 November , a Press Association correspondent informed Sutcliffe on board his ship that he had been appointed . Sutcliffe replied , " It is the biggest honour of my career ... I shall do my utmost to uphold the best traditions of Yorkshire and England cricket . " However , six days later , having arrived in Cape Town , he sent a telegram stating , " I have not yet received by mail an official offer from the Yorkshire authorities of the captaincy of the Yorkshire team next season . " 
 = = = Reaction = = = 
 Reports at the time said that Lord Hawke and Toone had denied all knowledge of the approach to Sutcliffe ; Hawke said he supported the committee but Home Gordon later recalled that Hawke seemed indecisive about the best course of action . In the opinion of cricket writer Alan Gibson , his predicament came from his earlier criticism of professional captaincy . Wisden said that " Yorkshire cricket circles were greatly perturbed by the announcement " . Most opposition to the appointment was based on objections to the idea of a professional captain . In the Yorkshire Post , several members of the county club wrote to express their opinions . Some claimed it was too great a burden for a professional to captain the team while also earning a living through the game and therefore being concerned with his personal performances . Others said that Yorkshire 's amateur leaders were not given enough opportunities to prove themselves before they were replaced . It was also argued that if a suitable amateur candidate was unavailable and a professional appointment unavoidable , Wilfred Rhodes was the senior professional and longest serving player . Rhodes , drawn into the argument , said that the team would have preferred an amateur captain ; he also stated that he had not been approached , which made him feel unappreciated . Other members wrote to support Sutcliffe 's selection , glad a professional was openly appointed ; they thought the team would be strengthened by the decision . At the beginning of December , one Yorkshire member , S. E. Grimshaw , conducted a poll : 2 @,@ 264 Yorkshire members were in favour of an amateur captain , while 444 wanted a professional . If an amateur could not be found , 2 @,@ 007 preferred Rhodes be captain , compared to 876 who supported Sutcliffe . 
 = = = Withdrawal of offer = = = 
 Following the members ' poll , Yorkshire sent a telegram to Sutcliffe in South Africa , asking him to withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy . Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it . When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December , they appointed William Worsley , who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments . In the words of Wisden , " Happily the trouble was eventually settled to the satisfaction of all concerned . Sutcliffe declined the honour and , an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley , that gentleman stepped into the breach . " Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for " your loyalty to the club " . The Yorkshire Post also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself , noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable , it was " carried to unreasonable lengths " . Commenting on the affair , The Times expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership ; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game , but that there was nothing in principle to prevent a professional from performing the role . Of Sutcliffe , it said , " One would have liked to see him lead the side , and his general popularity , combined with his skill as a batsman , makes it probable that he would have been a success . However , half the value of a captain is gone if , before he takes up his duties , people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position , and Sutcliffe has been well @-@ advised to recognise this fact . " The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose a skipper from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role ; it added that Rhodes might have found it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Worsley captained for just two seasons . He struggled with the demands of fielding , while his batting was disappointing . However , he was widely respected by the team . He was slightly more effective in his second season as leader , after which he retired . The next skipper , Alan Barber , although regarded as successful , captained for just one season . He was a more accomplished batsman and a great disciplinarian . However , he chose a career in teaching , limiting his availability , and resigned . The captain after that , Frank Greenwood , also did not hold the post long , resigning due to business commitments . Lord Hawke , writing in 1932 , noted there had been eight captains since he retired in 1910 . While six of them won the County Championship in their first season in charge , he stated that " it is not good for a side to be always changing its captain " . Only when Brian Sellers was appointed in 1933 did Yorkshire gain the leader they wanted . After skippering most games in 1932 during Greenwood 's frequent absences , he remained in the role until 1947 and was considered the best county captain of his time . 
 When Leicestershire appointed Ewart <unk> as their captain for the 1935 season , he became the first professional to lead any county on a regular basis since the 19th century . Yorkshire did not have a professional skipper in the 20th century until Vic Wilson in 1960 . Alan Gibson believed that Yorkshire erred in rejecting Sutcliffe . He further argued that , if appointed , Sutcliffe would have been made England Test captain in 1931 instead of Douglas Jardine and that he would have done a good job for several years . Sutcliffe later regretted withdrawing his acceptance . In later years , he told Bill Bowes that Jack Hobbs , Sutcliffe 's opening partner on the national side , should have been made England captain . According to Bowes , he said , " ' Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there ' ... raising his hand from knee to shoulder level . ' Professional cricketers lifted it to there , ' he continued , raising his hand above his head , ' — and even Lord Hawke wanted it back again . Jack Hobbs , for the sake of the professional cricketer , should have accepted . ' " Sutcliffe 's son Billy subsequently captained Yorkshire from 1956 to 1958 . 
 = Uherský Brod shooting = 
 On 24 February 2015 , a mass shooting occurred at the Družba restaurant in the town of Uherský Brod , Czech Republic . Nine people were killed , including the gunman , 63 @-@ year @-@ old Zdeněk Kovář , who committed suicide after a standoff with police that lasted nearly two hours . In addition , one other person was injured . Uherský Brod is 260 kilometers ( 160 miles ) east @-@ southeast of the Czech capital Prague . 
 The shooting was one of the two deadliest mass murders in the country 's peacetime history , alongside a 1973 vehicular rampage committed by Olga <unk> . The circumstances of the shooting led to an examination on the gun politics in the Czech Republic and police rules of engagement against active shooters . Czech media speculated that the rampage may have been triggered by an apparent attempt of the authorities to review Kovář 's mental state . 
 = = Background = = 
 Due to similarities between the perpetrators , the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in <unk> pod <unk> , another Moravian town lying 90 km northwards . In the attack , a 57 @-@ year @-@ old man , Antonín Blažek , attempted to blow up a block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors . He first blocked both exits from the building , and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building 's corridor . Interrupted , Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building . The explosion and subsequent fire , however , were large enough to demolish part of the building , killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others , one of whom died on 17 February 2015 . 
 Before the murders , Kovář 's family became worried about his mental state to the point that they contacted authorities in connection with his possession of gun license . Just four days before the murders , Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license . Before entering the Družba restaurant , Kovář visited at least two other venues . Those , however , had fewer customers , and Kovář left them immediately after entering . 
 = = Murders = = 
 Kovář entered the Družba building at about 12 : 30 pm , the restaurant 's busiest daylight time . Around 20 people were in the small restaurant at the time . Before he entered the restaurant itself , which was situated on the first floor , Petr Gabriel , who was rushing to the bathroom , got ahead of Kovář on stairs leading to an upper floor . 
 Armed with a CZ <unk> semi @-@ automatic pistol , which is manufactured in the town , and an Alfa 820 revolver , Kovář opened fire without any warning immediately after entering the restaurant , shooting his victims directly in the head . Eight died immediately or soon afterwards . One female victim , who was shot twice in the chest , managed to leave the restaurant , while Gabriel remained hidden in the restaurant 's bathroom . Eight other people escaped the building through the back door . Another customer , Jiří <unk> , who took cover under a table , used a moment in which Kovář was reloading , and threw a chair at him , hitting him on the neck . This gave him an opportunity to run out through the front door with two other people . 
 Authorities received the first distress call from a person who escaped from the restaurant at 12 : 38 pm , and the first police car reached the building at 12 : 47 pm . The policemen were armed with the standard equipment for Czech police officers : holstered pistols ( mostly with variants of <unk> that was also used by Kovář ) , body armor , and a select @-@ fire rifle stored in car . The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn . Kovář , taking cover behind a bar opposite to the door , opened fire on the officers as soon as they entered . The police noted people lying on the ground and sitting on chairs between them and the shooter . Not knowing the status of the civilians , the police decided not to return fire , covered the exits , and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit . By this time , other police units as well as the first ambulance car had arrived , taking away the wounded female victim who had escaped . 
 At 12 : 56 pm , Kovář called a Prima TV station crime news reporter , claiming that he was being harassed by multiple people and that he had hostages whom he threatened to kill . The journalist who spoke to the gunman called the police , who were already sending all available units to the location . 
 A police negotiator contacted Kovář by phone at 13 : 07 . During negotiations , Kovář claimed to have hostages , although all of the people remaining inside were most likely already dead ( apart from Gabriel , who was hiding at the bathroom unbeknownst to Kovář ) . The hostage claim delayed police entry into the building . Kovář stopped communicating at about 14 : 00 p.m. After attempts to contact him failed , the tactical team breached the building at 14 : 23 p.m. Upon the team 's entry , Kovář immediately shot himself dead . 
 Apart from stun grenades , the policemen did not fire a single shot . After securing the restaurant , the police let in a large number of medical personnel . The only person alive who remained inside the building was Gabriel , who had been hiding in the bathroom for the entire duration of the incident .

 Zdeněk Kovář ( c . 1951 – 24 February 2015 ) was 63 years old at the time of his death and lived with his wife in a house not far from the scene of the murders . Neighbours described the couple as deranged , both possibly mentally ill , and known for loudness and verbal abuse of their neighbours . Kovář was the son of a worker in the local Česká <unk> Uherský Brod ( <unk> ) firearms factory , the largest small arms manufacturer in the country . Formerly an electrician , he had been unemployed for at least ten years . 
 Kovář had held a gun license since 2000 and legally owned both of the guns he used . 
 = = = Victims = = = 
 A total of eight people , excluding the gunman , died in the rampage . This included seven men , aged 27 to 66 , and one woman , aged 47 . Another woman , aged 37 , survived despite being shot twice in the chest . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As more information about Kovář 's notoriety among neighbors surfaced , focus of investigation shifted towards the circumstances under which he gained and retained gun license and firearms . In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic , a person must pass a qualification exam , receive a health clearance by a general practitioner , who may require a further examination by a specialist , such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation , and must pass a background check . According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act , an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years . Similarly , the law further makes gun license <unk> to people with mental illnesses . The license must be renewed every five years ( every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014 ) . The renewal requires the presentation of a new health clearance , while the police conduct a new background check . Kovář 's license was renewed in January 2015 . 
 = = = Misdemeanors registry = = = 
 Kovář applied for a gun license renewal in accordance with the law . According to Kovář 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , neighbors , and a local policeman who had repeated contacts with him , Kovář and his wife had committed misdemeanors against public order . The municipality of Uherský Brod , which deals with such misdemeanors , did not register them and thus Kovář had an apparently clean history . In turn , this satisfied the requirements and he had his license renewed . 
 The renewal of his license was due to the fact that while there is a central registry of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors , no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in the Czech Republic . In the case where a non @-@ traffic misdemeanor is solved on the spot ( e.g. fining by a policeman ) , no record of it is made . Only when the investigated person or the police refuse to deal with the misdemeanor on the spot , is an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and if convicted , then a record of it is made by the municipality . 
 The Czech government had made a decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014 , planning to have the system working within two years . As police are obliged to revoke a gun license when the licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in a period of three years , the central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke the license long before the murders .

 At any time , the police may order a new health clearance inspection if they have a reasonable concern that the person is not healthy enough to continue holding their license . 
 According to the Uherský Brod mayor Patrik <unk> , Kovář 's family members tried to prevent Kovář from having the license renewed by pleading with his general practitioner not to grant him the necessary health clearance , since they felt threatened and considered him mentally unstable . Nevertheless , Kovář received clearance from his general practitioner and presented it as a part of his license renewal application on 19 January 2015 . 
 After renewing the license in January , the police were contacted by an unspecified person who reported to them on Kovář 's mental state . The police subsequently contacted Kovář 's general practitioner , and psychiatrist , and on 17 February 2015 ordered a health reevaluation . He received the letter on 19 February 2015 , four days before the murders . Under the law , Kovář was obliged to present a new health clearance within a month or lose the license . Czech media has speculated that the apparent attempt of the authorities to review Kovář 's mental state may have triggered the rampage . 
 A few days after the murders , the Ministry of Interior announced its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms . This was , however , rejected by psychiatric associations . They argued that psychiatrists ' main goal is to cure patients , and that potential patients may be more likely to avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license . 
 = = = Police response = = = 
 One of the main topics of debate after Kovář 's rampage became the way police dealt with him , especially whether the first two responding officers were , under the circumstances , supposed to immediately engage and neutralize the perpetrator , and whether the decision to wait for the arrival of the tactical unit was sound . The debate became more vocal after a cook , who managed to escape the rampage , claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated . Another witness , who escaped unharmed , refuted this version of events , saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes leading up to the point of police entry , with no shots heard thereafter . 
 Police said the first responders decided not to engage because they saw civilians lying and sitting in the line of fire between them and the perpetrator ; they didn 't know their status , and the perpetrator had taken cover behind a bar with only his head and hand holding the pistol visible . According to the Chief of the Zlín Regional Police Department , Jaromír <unk> , the Uherský Brod district units present had enough manpower and equipment , including select @-@ fire rifles , to engage Kovář . However , they decided to withdraw due to the perpetrator 's claim of having hostages and stated intent to negotiate their release . 
 Apart from local units , a special ordnance unit was called in from its regional headquarters in Zlín . It arrived about 30 minutes later . Because there are eight tactical teams covering fourteen Czech regions and none in Zlín , a tactical team from Brno was called in . The team 's fifteen members reached the restaurant by cars in 66 minutes , opting not to use their helicopter that has a capacity of six . Furthermore , a paramilitary anti @-@ terrorist police <unk> unit was called from Prague . However , its helicopters didn 't arrive before the end of the standoff . According to <unk> , even if <unk> had its headquarters directly in Uherský Brod , it would not have changed anything about the timing nor the manner in which the police engaged Kovář . 
 Zlín region politicians announced they would call for the establishment of a local tactical team . Meanwhile , the Minister of Interior commented that the police were already in the process of hiring 4 @,@ 000 new officers ( about 10 % of its total manpower ) , thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments . Experts further pointed out the necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas . This type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at police officers in large towns . 
 On 10 March 2015 , weekly newspaper <unk> published more details of the police engagement . By chance , an emergency motorized police unit , which usually serve as immediate reinforcement to police officers in the field , was conducting exercises not far from Uherský Brod . The unit arrived within twenty minutes of the first emergency call . Heavily armed and well trained , their officer in charge gave order to immediately engage the perpetrator . Within a minute , the local police station chief arrived and ordered them to stand down , began securing the perimeter , gathering information , and preparing an engagement plan . Meanwhile , Kovář called the emergency line 158 and mentioned he had five unharmed hostages and was demanding the presence of TV Prima . The officer in charge ordered the policemen to stand down just as they were about to enter the building in order to start negotiating . At that time , he could not have been aware of the status of victims inside . Fifteen minutes later , the Zlín region police chief arrived . In total , the command over the operation was passed between five people within the initial 40 minutes . The fact that the police rules allow passing of command during engagement had been condemned a week earlier by Member of Parliament Stanislav <unk> , who pointed out to the Czech firemen 's rules , according to which the first person in charge at the place of engagement remains in charge even if a general happens to come to join an operation afterwards . He noted that the passing of command requires briefing which not only leads to loss of time , but often also to subsequent mistakes . 
 As of May 2015 , the only direct outcome of the inquiry into the police response to the shooting was lowering of wage of a dispatch officer , who advised the policemen on spot over the radio not to engage " so that nothing worse happens " . 
 In June 2015 , two members of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to multiple witnesses . The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police . Among other issues , the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker , initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them , didn 't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator to get out of the object and jeopardize other people . The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker . According to MPs , the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly , they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator 's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead . The policemen didn 't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1 pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters . Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn 't get all the relevant information . 
 = = = Gun politics = = = 
 In one of the first reactions on the day of the murders , before knowing whether Kovář possessed the guns he used legally , Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec stated that it was up to debate whether " [ the society ] wants to have so many gun license holders " . 
 Support for Chovanec 's comments was largely among members of parliament elected for the Communist Party . Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit . Some members of parliament , such as Miroslav <unk> , Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee , commented that the licensing process is thorough enough , and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons , especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks . Roman <unk> , Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec 's own Social Democratic party , refused Chovanec 's argument , while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction , claiming that there are too few armed people among the Czech population , since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář 's assault . The sentiment was shared also by , for example , Martin Koller , a former ambassador to <unk> and Iraq , who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force , and who pointed out to a past well @-@ known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting , stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed . 
 MF <unk> pointed out that despite the steady rise of firearm ownership in the country since abolition of restrictive Communist legislation after the Velvet Revolution , the number of intentional homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994 . 
 During a press conference on 26 February 2015 , Chovanec introduced five areas that were to be scrutinized in connection with the Uherský Brod attack : the communication of national police with municipal authorities , possible changes in crisis plans , operational range of tactical teams , and enhanced training of policemen . Chovanec didn 't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders , and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 Czech Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec said on Twitter that the shooting was not a terrorist incident but actions of a " crazed individual " . 
 Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka , who was on a trip to South Korea at the time , said in a statement , " I am shocked by the tragic attack that happened today in Uherský Brod . I would like to express my deepest sorrow and condolences to the families and relatives of the victims . " Uherský Brod mayor Patrik <unk> also said , " I 'm shaken to the core by this incident . I could not have dreamed something like this could happen here , in a restaurant that I 'm so familiar with . " 
 The day after the murders , hundreds of people gathered in front of the Družba restaurant and lit candles to honor the victims .

 Amar la Trama ( Loving the Plot ) is the ninth studio album by Uruguayan recording artist Jorge Drexler . It was released by Warner Music on March 16 , 2010 , after a four @-@ year gap since the release of his last album of original music . Drexler worked as co @-@ producer , along with Matías Cella and Carles Campi <unk> . The themes of the songs are his personal feelings inspired by journeys to Uruguay and Spain , his global wanderings , and the universal wonder of everyday moments . 
 The album received mostly positive reviews ; critics commended Drexler 's lyrics and his ability to perform live in front of a small audience during the recording sessions . The album entered the top five in Spain . The first single , " Una Canción Me Trajo Hasta Aquí " , also received praise . La Trama Circular , a DVD documentary about the recording sessions , is included on the standard edition of the album . On September 8 , 2010 , Amar la Trama received four nominations for the 11th Latin Grammy Awards . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2005 , Jorge Drexler became the first Uruguayan to win an Academy Award for Best Original Song , for his composition " Al Otro lado del Río " from the film The Motorcycle Diaries . The following year , Drexler recorded and released 12 <unk> de <unk> ( Twelve Seconds of Darkness ) , an album that received a Grammy Award nomination . In 2008 , Cara B , a live album that includes his greatest hits along with cover versions of songs written by Leonard Cohen , Caetano Veloso , and Kiko Veneno , was released . Cara B also received a Grammy nomination . The same year , Drexler wrote the score for the film The City of Your Final Destination . During 2009 , Drexler worked with Colombian performer Shakira on the Spanish @-@ language versions of her singles " She Wolf " and " Did it Again " , and recorded Amar la Trama in Madrid , Spain . Drexler described the album as playful , without " the melancholy and anguish " of 12 <unk> . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Amar la Trama was recorded from November 1 – 4 , 2009 , at Cata Studios in Madrid , in a television studio in front of a small audience who were selected in an online contest . He chose this format to avoid the " coldness " of the recording studio . Drexler was the lead vocalist and played guitar , and was joined by a band composed of additional guitarists , a rhythm section , a horn section , backup vocalists , and auxiliary musicians . All the tracks recorded were written by the singer , with the exception of " I Don 't Worry About a Thing " , a song by Mose Allison , which featured American pianist Ben Sidran . Leonor Watling performed vocals on the track " <unk> de Queda " ; Josemi Carmona is featured playing Spanish guitar on the song " Los <unk> " . Drexler said , " In recent years I 've realized that I sing better if I have an audience in front of me ; I have learned to communicate better that way . " The audience consisted of about 20 fans per session . This kept the musicians tense and alert ; " the concentration was so great that it was perceived in the air , a silence so intense that you can hear it on the album . " All the songs were available on the singer 's official website prior to the album 's release . The recording sessions were presented in the documentary La Trama Circular , directed by Ariel Hassan and Juan Aragonés . Drexler recorded the album with the working title of Mundo <unk> ( Nether World ) , which refers to the deep sea and the inner world of people . He eventually settled on Amar la Trama ( Loving the Plot ) because he has a passion for the plot , " the space between the beginning and end , to be completed , in which things happen . " The album cover is an original work by Manuel Rodríguez <unk> . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 On the album , Drexler was lyrically inspired by Madrid , where most of the songs were written . Drexler feels is a very optimistic album , since the title begins with the letter " a " , the same as in " affection " . The songs feature a completely different sound treatment , a departure from the " light electronica " of previous albums . Amar la Trama is the result of an artistic evolution originated with the recording of Cara B ; " with nine musicians playing and recording live on the album , I became interested in making music as in the past . " This new concept was explored with a trio of wind instruments and three percussionists , which brings great vitality and achieves bright and expansive sounds . The lyrics are very personal , and choose meaning over sonority . The first track , " Tres Mil <unk> de <unk> " , is a song about existence that plays with the theme of identity , which is often present in Drexler 's lyrics . " Noctiluca " is a gift to his son , since " having a child is the best experience to lose the fear of feelings . " The inspiration for this song was a phosphorescent sea , lit by Noctiluca <unk> , that he observed at Cabo Polonio , Uruguay . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The album received mostly positive reviews . Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic said it was " nothing short of tremendous " and " excellent " . He praised Drexler 's writing abilities and his courage in recording an album in front of a live audience ; Birchmeier said that " Una Canción Me Trajo Hasta Aquí " , " Mundo <unk> " , and " La Trama y el <unk> " were standouts worthy of special mention . Darío Vico of Rolling Stone gave the album a perfect score of five stars , naming the album a resounding success and a " big- bang curious emotional process . " Argentinian magazine , The Magazine , recognized Drexler as a " master " at designing memorable melodies , and maintaining a high literary level while writing lyrics . In her review for Billboard magazine , Judy Cantor @-@ Navas noted that the lyrics were " poetic " , and addressed familiar themes for the singer : fated encounters , global wanderings , the South American experience , and the universal wonder of everyday moments . She praised " <unk> de Queda " , since " Drexler returns to his Southern roots musically and thematically . " Cantor commented that the first track , " Tres Mil <unk> de <unk> " , seems " fuzzy " since the arrangement diverts attention from Drexler 's voice . Drexler received four nominations at the 11th Latin Grammy Awards , including Best Singer @-@ Songwriter Album for Amar la Trama , Best Long Form Video for La Trama Circular ( shared with Ariel Hassan ) , and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the single " Una Canción Me Trajo Hasta Aquí " . The included DVD , La Trama Circular , was nominated for a Premio de la Música by the Sociedad General de <unk> y Editores in Spain , for Best Musical Audiovisual Production .

 = Russian monitor Perun = 
 Perun ( Russian : <unk> ) was an Uragan @-@ class monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . The design was based on the American Passaic @-@ class monitor , but was modified to suit Russian engines , guns and construction techniques . Spending her entire career with the Baltic Fleet , the ship was only active when the Gulf of Finland was not frozen , but very little is known about her service . Perun was struck from the Navy List in 1900 and became a pilot ship . Renamed Lotsiia ( Pilot ) in 1915 , the ship was damaged during the Kronstadt rebellion of 1921 and laid up afterwards . She was run aground by a flood three years later and then her wreck was scrapped . 
 = = Description = = 
 Perun was 201 feet ( 61 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , with a beam of 46 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 10 @.@ 16 – 10 @.@ 84 feet ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 524 – 1 @,@ 626 t ) , and her crew numbered 8 officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865 . They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen 12 years later . 
 The ship was fitted with a two @-@ cylinder , horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine built by Carr and MacPherson of Saint Petersburg . It drove a single propeller using steam that was provided by two rectangular boilers . Specific information on the output of the ship 's engine has not survived , but it ranged between 340 – 500 indicated horsepower ( 254 – 373 kW ) for all the ships of this class . During Perun 's sea trials on 16 August 1865 , she reached a maximum speed of 6 @.@ 75 knots ( 12 @.@ 50 km / h ; 7 @.@ 77 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 190 long tons ( 193 t ) of coal , which gave her a theoretical endurance of 1 @,@ 440 nmi ( 2 @,@ 670 km ; 1 @,@ 660 mi ) at 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 Perun was designed to be armed with a pair of nine @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading guns purchased from Krupp of Germany and rifled in Russia , but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine @-@ inch smoothbores . These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license @-@ built fifteen @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading Rodman guns in 1867 – 68 . The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine @-@ inch rifled guns . 
 All of the wrought @-@ iron armor that was used in the Uragan @-@ class monitors was in 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates , just as in the Passaic @-@ class ships . The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates , of which the three innermost plates extended 42 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) below the waterline . This armor was backed by a wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of 36 inches ( 914 mm ) . The gun turret was protected by eleven layers of armor and the pilothouse above it had eight layers of armor . Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the funnel up to a height of 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) above the deck . Unlike their predecessors , the Uragans were built without deck armor to save weight . 
 = = Career = = 
 Construction of the ship began on 7 September 1863 at the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Perun was laid down on 15 December 1863 and she was launched on 30 June 1864 . She entered service on 1 September 1865 and cost a total of 1 @,@ 142 @,@ 700 rubles , almost double her contract cost of 600 @,@ 000 rubles . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she , and all of her sister ships except Latnik , made a port visit to Stockholm , Sweden in July – August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich . She was present when the American warships Miantonomoh and Augusta visited Kronstadt in July – August 1866 . 
 Sometime after Perun was completed , an armored ring , 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and 15 inches ( 381 mm ) tall , was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it . Later , an armored , outward @-@ curving bulwark was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there . Three sponsons were later added , probably during the 1870s , to the upper portion of the turret . Each sponson , one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret , mounted a light gun , probably a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) Engstrem gun , for defense against torpedo boats . A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret , also probably during the 1870s . 
 Little is known about the ship 's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze . On 18 July 1875 , she was accidentally rammed by the ironclad Admiral Chichagov , but only suffered minor damage . Perun was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900 , although she was not stricken until 17 August . After she was stricken she was used as a pilot ship before being renamed Lotsiia ( Pilot ) in 1915 . During the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion , the ship was struck by artillery fire . She was laid up after the resulting fire badly damaged her . During a flood on 23 September 1924 , Lotsiia ran aground and was subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = HMS Kempenfelt ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Kempenfelt was a C @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . A flotilla leader , she saw service in the Home Fleet before World War II and the ship made several deployments to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Kempenfelt was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) in 1939 and renamed HMCS Assiniboine . During World War II , she served as a convoy escort in the battle of the Atlantic , sinking one German submarine by ramming , on anti @-@ submarine patrols during the invasion of Normandy , and was employed as a troop transport after VE Day for returning Canadian servicemen , before being decommissioned in mid @-@ 1945 . Assiniboine was sold for scrap in 1945 , but she ran aground while being towed to the breakers and was not broken up until 1952 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Kempenfelt displaced 1 @,@ 390 long tons ( 1 @,@ 410 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 901 long tons ( 1 @,@ 932 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers . Kempenfelt carried a maximum of 473 long tons ( 481 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 175 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mark IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Kempenfelt had a single QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt AA gun between her funnels , and two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the aft end of her forecastle deck . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2 @-@ pounders were relocated to between the funnels . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . Three depth @-@ charge chutes were fitted , each with a capacity of two depth charges . After World War II began this was increased to 33 depth charges , delivered by one or two rails and two throwers . 
 The changes made to Assiniboine 's armament during the war ( dates can only be roughly assigned ) were first the replacement of the ship 's rear torpedo tube mount by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun and the 2 @-@ pounders were exchanged for quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers Mk III machine gun . Later , ' Y ' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges . ' X ' gun was later removed and the 12 @-@ pounder was resited in its place to further increased her depth charge capacity . Later changes included fitting a split Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar on each side of ' A ' gun , exchanging her two quadruple .50 @-@ calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns , and the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform . The ship 's director @-@ control tower and rangefinder above the bridge were removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar . A Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was also added as was an HF / DF radio direction finder on a short mainmast . 
 The ship was ordered on 15 July 1930 from J. Samuel White at Cowes under the 1929 Programme . Kempenfelt was laid down on 18 October 1930 , launched on 30 September 1931 , as the 2nd ship to carry the name , and completed on 30 May 1932 . Built as a flotilla leader , she displaced 15 long tons more than the rest of her class and carried an extra 30 personnel . These personnel formed the staff of the Captain ( D ) of the flotilla . 
 = = Service = = 
 Kempenfelt was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla , of the Home Fleet , after her commissioning . The ship briefly mounted an experimental 5 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) gun on ' B ' mount for evaluation purposes during this time ; it was replaced by the standard 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch gun . She was based at Rosyth for most of the rest of 1932 , but visited the Mediterranean between January and March 1933 before returning home . The ship was given a refit at Devonport that ended in January 1934 . Shortly afterwards , Kempenfelt participated in the Home Fleet 's tour of the West Indies that ended in March . The ship visited various Scandinavian ports during the remainder of the year . She participated in King George V 's Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead on 16 July 1935 . Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia , Kempenfelt was sent in August to the Red Sea with the other ships of the 2nd Flotilla to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936 . She was given a brief refit at Devonport that lasted until June upon her return to the UK . During the first stages of the Spanish Civil War in late 1936 , the ship evacuated British nationals from several different Spanish ports . 
 In December , Kempenfelt began a more thorough refit at Devonport that lasted until 10 April 1937 and returned to Spanish waters afterwards to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British @-@ flagged ships . On 6 March , the ship and the destroyer Boreas , rescued survivors from the Nationalist heavy cruiser Baleares after she had been sunk by Republican destroyers during the Battle of Cape Palos . She was refitted at Chatham in May – June 1938 and made a number of port visits in Scandinavia the following month . Kempenfelt was transferred to the Portsmouth Local Flotilla and remained there until the war began in September 1939 . 
 = = = Wartime service and transfer = = = 
 The ship was transferred to the 18th Destroyer Flotilla , based at the Isle of Portland , where she escorted shipping and conducted anti @-@ submarine patrols . Kempenfelt had been purchased before the war began by the Canadian government , but it agreed to allow the British to retain her until the Royal Navy could compensate for her loss by requisitioning enough auxiliary anti @-@ submarine vessels . By the time that the British were ready to turn her over to the RCN , the ship was under repair after a collision and the hand over was delayed until 19 October . She was renamed Assiniboine and arrived at Halifax , Nova Scotia on 17 November . The ship had not yet been fitting with the steam heating necessary to operate in a Canadian winter and she was transferred to the Caribbean in exchange for the destroyer HMCS Saguenay . Assiniboine arrived at Kingston , Jamaica on 8 December . 
 Assigned to the North America and West Indies Station , the highlight of the ship 's service in the Caribbean was the capture of the German blockade runner MV Hannover in the Mona Passage between the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on the night of 8 / 9 March 1940 . Initially intercepted by the light cruiser Dunedin , the crew of Hannover disabled their steering gear and set the ship on fire . Assiniboine took the burning ship under tow to prevent her from entering the waters of the neutral Dominican Republic while the cruiser sprayed water on the fire . The two ships swapped roles in the morning and the destroyer put some of her crew aboard Hannover to help Dunedin 's boarding party fight the fire while the cruiser towed the freighter to Kingston . Assiniboine arrived in Halifax on 31 March for a refit . 
 After the completion of her refit , the ship escorted local convoys in and around Halifax until 15 January 1941 when she was transferred to Greenock and assigned to the 10th Escort Group of the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force that was based there . Assiniboine rescued survivors from SS Anchises on 28 February and was damaged in a collision with MV <unk> on 5 April . Her repairs were not completed until 22 May and she was transferred to St. John 's , Newfoundland in June to reinforce escort forces in the Western Atlantic . In early August , Assiniboine , her sister Restigouche and the ex @-@ American destroyer HMS Ripley , escorted the battleship Prince of Wales to Placentia Bay where Prime Minister Winston Churchill met President Franklin Roosevelt for the first time . 
 Whilst escorting Convoy SC 94 in early August 1942 as part of Escort Group C1 , Assiniboine 's Type 286 radar spotted U @-@ 210 in a heavy fog on 6 August . The destroyer closed on the contact and briefly spotted the submarine twice before losing her in the fog . The submarine reappeared crossing the destroyer 's bow at a range of 50 yards ( 46 m ) , and both ships opened fire . The range was too close for Assiniboine 's 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns to engage , but her .50 @-@ calibre machine guns shot up the submarine 's deck and conning tower . This kept the Germans from manning their 88 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) deck gun , but the 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) flak gun was already manned and firing . The gun punched holes through the destroyer 's plating that set some petrol tanks on the deck afire and disabled ' A ' gun . It also claimed the only Canadian casualty during the engagement : Ordinary Seaman Kenneth " Wiley " Watson from <unk> , BC . The destroyer was unable to ram U @-@ 210 until the rear 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch gun hit the conning tower , killing the entire bridge crew and the .50 @-@ caliber machine guns were able to silence the flak gun . This caused Lieutenant <unk> , the senior surviving officer , to order the submarine to dive , but this meant that she had to hold a straight course while doing so . Assiniboine was able to take advantage of this and rammed U @-@ 210 abaft the conning tower whilst she was diving . This caused the electric motors to fail , damaged her propellers and led to water entering the submarine , as a result of which <unk> ordered the ballast tanks to be blown and the submarine abandoned . The destroyer rammed her again when U @-@ 210 resurfaced , dropped a pattern of depth charges set to detonate at shallow depth and hit her one more time with a 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch shell before the submarine finally sank . A number of survivors were rescued by Assiniboine and the British corvette Dianthus , before the former ship had to head home for repairs as she was taking on water below the waterline . She required nearly two months of repairs at Halifax and was assigned to Escort Group C3 when they were completed on 20 December . 
 Whilst en route to Londonderry , Assiniboine dropped a shallow pattern of depth charges on a submarine contact and badly damaged her stern on 2 March 1943 . The ship was repaired at Liverpool between 7 March and 13 July and then assigned to Escort Group C1 . She continued her escort work until April 1944 when she began a refit at Shelburne , Nova Scotia . Upon its completion in July , Assiniboine was assigned to the Western Approaches Command . The following month , the 12th Support Group , including Assiniboine , engaged three German minesweepers on 12 August , without sinking any . She remained in British waters for the rest of the war ; the ship was damaged in a collision with SS Empire Bond on 14 February 1945 and was under repair until early March . 
 Assiniboine returned to Canada in June and was briefly used as a troop transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career . She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list . Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore , she ran aground near East Point , Prince Edward Island . Attempts to get her off failed , and she was left to rust until eventually being broken up in place in 1952 .

 = Yellow Star ( novel ) = 
 Yellow Star is a 2006 biographical children 's novel by Jennifer Roy . Written in free verse , it depicts life through the eyes of a young Jewish girl whose family was forced into the Łódź Ghetto in 1939 during World War II . Roy tells the story of her aunt Syvia , who shared her childhood memories with Roy more than 50 years after the ghetto 's liberation . Roy added fictionalized dialogue , but did not otherwise alter the story . The book covers Syvia 's life as she grows from four and a half to ten years old in the ghetto . Syvia , her older sister Dora , and her younger cousin Isaac were three of only twelve children who survived . After the war , Syvia moved to the United States , married , and only much later told her story to Roy . Since its publication in 2006 , the book has received multiple awards , starred reviews , and other accolades , and has been made into a likewise well @-@ received audiobook . 
 = = Background = = 
 Yellow Star is the outgrowth of Sylvia Perlmutter Rozines ' recollections of life in the Łódź ghetto . Perlmutter Rozines , then Syvia Perlmutter , was a four and a half year old child when she and her relatives were confined to the ghetto in late 1939 . The ghetto was liberated the day before she turned 10 : more than half her life had been lived in the ghetto . The book relates the events of those five and a half years , as an adult Sylvia recalled them years later . The title derives from the yellow badge that Syvia was forced to <unk> but nobody knows it . 
 More than 50 years after the events described in the book , Perlmutter Rozines began telling her story to family members , starting with her son , Roy 's cousin Greg , who told Roy 's sister Julia , who told Roy . Roy tape recorded the conversations between herself and Perlmutter Rozines , and used those conversations as the basis for the book . 
 Yellow Star is written in free verse , after Roy struggled with how to authentically express Perlmutter Rozines ' experiences to children in a way that did not seem stiff or detached . Roy cites Karen Hesse 's Newbery Medal <unk> Out of the Dust as an inspiration for the book 's voice . Roy edited Perlmutter Rozines ' various recollections together into chronological order , and penned narrative introductions to each chapter describing the war 's events outside the ghetto . While the book is substantially based on Perlmutter Rozines ' recollections , it is classified as historical fiction since Roy included fictionalized dialogue . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1939 , the Nazis invaded Poland and forced that nation 's second @-@ largest community of Jews , 270 @,@ 000 strong , into one section of the city of Łódź , which they later walled off to form a ghetto . Before the invasion , Syvia and her family lived in Łódź . When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion , the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw . The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw , so they returned to Lodz . When the Germans did invade , they forced Syvia 's family to relocate , along with other Łódź @-@ area Jews , into a segregated section of the city : a ghetto . The book relates Syvia 's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like : her friends , people around the ghetto , jobs , and her schedule . It relates how Syvia 's family is forced to sell her doll , leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings . 
 When the other Jewish children were sent to <unk> , Syvia 's family smuggled the children from cellar to cellar . The book also relates tragic events : one of Syvia 's friends disappears , and another is killed and burned in an extermination camp . The ghetto is liberated one day shy of Syvia 's tenth birthday , on January 19 , 1945 . Syvia , her older sister Dora , and a younger cousin , Isaac , were three of only twelve children who survived .

 An extensive " Author 's Note " details the fate of the people Syvia interacted with in the Ghetto , including how the survivors in her immediate family settled initially in Paris . Afterwards , she emigrated to the United States , Americanized her name , married David Rozines ( another Holocaust survivor ) , and settled in upstate New York as Sylvia Perlmutter Rozines . As of 2006 , Sylvia , now widowed , had moved to Maryland , and volunteers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. She gave a videotaped interview to the Shoah Foundation , which records the personal recollections of Holocaust survivors .

 Yellow Star received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly and Booklist . The Publishers Weekly review commended the book for " the lyricism of the narrative , and Syvia 's credible childlike voice , maturing with each chapter , as she gains further understanding of the events around her " . Another reviewer praised the format , saying the " free @-@ verse format suits the young narrator and subject matter well " and concluding that " Readers searching for an accessible Holocaust novel will be absorbed by this haunting story based on true events " . Library Media Connection 's review praises Roy for her age @-@ appropriate language : " When Syvia witnesses the shooting of people in the street , author Jennifer Roy captures the fear of the moment without graphic descriptions " . Yellow Star was selected as a " fiction and poetry honor book " in the 2006 Boston Globe @-@ Horn Book Awards , an American Library Association Notable Children 's Book for Older Readers in April 2007 , and won the 2009 William Allen White Children 's Book Award , selected by vote of sixth- through eighth @-@ graders in Kansas . 
 Yellow Star was made into an audiobook read by Christina Moore in 2007 . A Booklist review noted that " Moore 's ' vroom <unk> @-@ <unk> pop ' to mirror Nazi motorcycles , booming bomb sounds , and transition to a scratchy voice to reflect the youngster 's oncoming sickness more than make up for a few technical glitches , including evidence of page turning and distracting breathing sounds . " 
 Roy , whose other works include children 's educational materials , hosts a variety of Yellow Star " Guides for Teachers and Book Groups " on her website . 
 = Corona Australis = 
 Corona Australis or Corona <unk> is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere . Its Latin name means " southern crown " , and it is the southern counterpart of Corona Borealis , the northern crown . One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd @-@ century astronomer Ptolemy , it remains one of the 88 modern constellations . The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with Sagittarius or Centaurus . Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle , ostrich nest , a tent , or even a hut belonging to a rock hyrax . 
 Although fainter than its namesake , the <unk> or horseshoe @-@ shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive . Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis are the two brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4 @.@ 1 . Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky . Lying alongside the Milky Way , Corona Australis contains one of the closest star @-@ forming regions to the Solar System — a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud , lying about 430 light years away . Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan . The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula , which varies in brightness accordingly . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Corona Australis is a small constellation bordered by Sagittarius to the north , Scorpius to the west , Telescopium to the south , and Ara to the southwest . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is ' <unk> ' . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of four segments ( illustrated in infobox ) . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 17h <unk> and <unk> <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 36 @.@ 77 ° and − 45 @.@ 52 ° . Covering 128 square degrees , Corona Australis culminates at midnight around the 30th of June and ranks 80th in area . Only visible at latitudes south of 53 ° north , Corona Australis cannot be seen from the British Isles as it lies too far south , but it can be seen from southern Europe and readily from the southern United States . 
 = = Notable features = = 
 While not a bright constellation , Corona Australis is nonetheless distinctive due to its easily identifiable pattern of stars , which has been described as <unk> or oval @-@ shaped . Though it has no stars brighter than 4th magnitude , it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye ( brighter than magnitude 5 @.@ 5 ) . Nicolas Louis de Lacaille used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation , designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether . Mu Coronae Australis , a yellow star of spectral type <unk> and apparent magnitude 5 @.@ 21 , was labelled by Johann Elert Bode and retained by Benjamin Gould , who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming . 
 = = = Stars = = = 
 The only star in the constellation to have received a name is <unk> Meridiana or Alpha <unk> . The name combines the Arabic name of the constellation with the Latin for " southern " . In Arabic , <unk> means " break " , and refers to the shape of both Corona Australis and Corona Borealis . Also called simply " Meridiana " , it is a white main sequence star located 130 light years away from Earth , with an apparent magnitude of 4 @.@ 10 and spectral type <unk> . A rapidly rotating star , it spins at almost 200 km per second at its equator , making a complete revolution in around 14 hours . Like the star Vega , it has excess infrared radiation , which indicates it may be ringed by a disk of dust . It is currently a main @-@ sequence star , but will eventually evolve into a white dwarf ; currently , it has a luminosity 31 times greater , and a radius and mass of 2 @.@ 3 times that of the Sun . Beta Coronae Australis is an orange giant 510 light years from Earth . Its spectral type is <unk> , and it is of apparent magnitude 4 @.@ 11 . Since its formation , it has evolved from a B @-@ type star to a K @-@ type star . Its luminosity class places it as a bright giant ; its luminosity is 730 times that of the Sun , designating it one of the highest @-@ luminosity K0 @-@ type stars visible to the naked eye . 100 million years old , it has a radius of 43 solar radii ( R ☉ ) and a mass of between 4 @.@ 5 and 5 solar masses ( M ☉ ) . Alpha and Beta are so similar as to be indistinguishable in brightness to the naked eye . 
 Some of the more prominent double stars include Gamma Coronae Australis — a pair of yellowish white stars 58 light years away from Earth , which orbit each other every 122 years . Widening since 1990 , the two stars can be seen as separate with a 100 mm aperture telescope ; they are separated by 1 @.@ 3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees . They have a combined visual magnitude of 4 @.@ 2 ; each component is an F8V dwarf star with a magnitude of 5 @.@ 01 . Epsilon Coronae Australis is an eclipsing binary belonging to a class of stars known as W Ursae Majoris variables . These star systems are known as contact binaries as the component stars are so close together they touch . Varying by a quarter of a magnitude around an average apparent magnitude of 4 @.@ 83 every seven hours , the star system lies 98 light years away . Its spectral type is <unk> @-@ 0 @.@ 8 + . At the southern end of the crown asterism are the stars Eta ¹ and Eta ² Coronae Australis , which form an optical double . Of magnitude 5 @.@ 1 and 5 @.@ 5 , they are separable with the naked eye and are both white . Kappa Coronae Australis is an easily resolved optical double — the components are of apparent magnitudes 6 @.@ 3 and 5 @.@ 7 and are 1700 and 490 light years away respectively . They appear at an angle of 359 degrees , separated by 21 @.@ 6 arcseconds . Kappa ² is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white , with a spectral type of B9V , while Kappa ¹ is of spectral type <unk> . Lying 202 light years away , Lambda Coronae Australis is a double <unk> in small telescopes . The primary is a white star of spectral type <unk> and magnitude of 5 @.@ 1 , while the companion star has a magnitude of 9 @.@ 7 . The two components are separated by 29 @.@ 2 arcseconds at an angle of 214 degrees . 
 Zeta Coronae Australis is a rapidly rotating main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4 @.@ 8 , 221 @.@ 7 light years from Earth . The star has blurred lines in its hydrogen spectrum due to its rotation . Its spectral type is B9V . Theta Coronae Australis lies further to the west , a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and apparent magnitude 4 @.@ 62 . Corona Australis harbours RX <unk> @-@ <unk> , an isolated neutron star that is thought to lie 140 ( ± 40 ) parsecs , or 460 ( ± 130 ) light years , away , with a diameter of 14 km . It was once suspected to be a strange star , but this has been discounted .

 In the north of the constellation is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud , a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae , including NGC 6729 , NGC 6726 – 7 , and IC <unk> . A star @-@ forming region of around 7000 M ☉ , it contains Herbig – Haro objects ( protostars ) and some very young stars . About 430 light years ( 130 parsecs ) away , it is one of the closest star @-@ forming regions to the Solar System . The related NGC 6726 and <unk> , along with unrelated NGC 6729 , were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865 . The Coronet cluster , about 554 light years ( 170 parsecs ) away at the edge of the Gould Belt , is also used in studying star and protoplanetary disk formation . 
 R Coronae Australis is an irregular variable star ranging from magnitudes 9 @.@ 7 to 13 @.@ 9 . Blue @-@ white , it is of spectral type <unk> . A very young star , it is still accumulating interstellar material . It is obscured by , and illuminates , the surrounding nebula , NGC 6729 , which brightens and darkens with it . The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope , as its length is five times its width . S Coronae Australis is a G @-@ class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star . Nearby , another young variable star , TY Coronae Australis , illuminates another nebula : reflection nebula NGC 6726 – 7 . TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8 @.@ 7 and 12 @.@ 4 , and the brightness of the nebula varies with it . Blue @-@ white , it is of spectral type <unk> . The largest young stars in the region , R , S , T , TY and VV Coronae Australis , are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig – Haro objects , many of which have been identified nearby . Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC <unk> , which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away . 
 Near Epsilon and Gamma Coronae Australis is Bernes 157 , a dark nebula and star forming region . It is a large nebula , 55 by 18 arcminutes , that possesses several stars around magnitude 13 . These stars have been dimmed by up to 8 magnitudes by its dust clouds . 
 IC 1297 is a planetary nebula of apparent magnitude 10 @.@ 7 , which appears as a green @-@ hued roundish object in higher @-@ powered amateur instruments . The nebula surrounds the variable star RU Coronae Australis , which has an average apparent magnitude of 12 @.@ 9 and is a WC class Wolf – Rayet star . IC 1297 is small , at only 7 arcseconds in diameter ; it has been described as " a square with rounded edges " in the eyepiece , elongated in the north @-@ south direction . Descriptions of its color encompass blue , blue @-@ tinged green , and green @-@ tinged blue . 
 Corona Australis ' location near the Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen . NGC <unk> is a magnitude 11 @.@ 2 object 35 ′ south of IC 1297 . It is made up of two galaxies merging , one of which is an elongated elliptical galaxy of classification E4 and the other a lenticular galaxy of classification S0 . IC <unk> is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12 @.@ 9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3 @.@ 9 degrees west @-@ southwest of Beta Sagittarii . However , amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure . It is 1 @.@ 9 arcminutes by 0 @.@ 8 arcminutes . The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument , which shows it to be tilted northeast @-@ southwest . 
 Southeast of Theta and southwest of Eta lies the open cluster ESO 281 @-@ <unk> , which is composed of the yellow 9th magnitude star GSC 7914 178 1 and five 10th to 11th magnitude stars . Halfway between Theta Coronae Australis and Theta Scorpii is the dense globular cluster NGC 6541 . Described as between magnitude 6 @.@ 3 and magnitude 6 @.@ 6 , it is visible in binoculars and small telescopes . Around <unk> light years away , it is around 100 light years in diameter . It is estimated to be around 14 billion years old . NGC 6541 appears 13 @.@ 1 arcminutes in diameter and is somewhat resolvable in large amateur instruments ; a 12 @-@ inch telescope reveals approximately 100 stars but the core remains unresolved . 
 = = = Meteor showers = = = 
 The Corona Australids are a meteor shower that takes place between 14 and 18 March each year , peaking around 16 March . This meteor shower does not have a high peak hourly rate . In 1953 and 1956 , observers noted a maximum of 6 meteors per hour and 4 meteors per hour respectively ; in 1955 the shower was " barely resolved " . However , in 1992 , astronomers detected a peak rate of 45 meteors per hour . The Corona Australids ' rate varies from year to year . At only six days , the shower 's duration is particularly short , and its meteoroids are small ; the stream is devoid of large meteoroids . The Corona Australids were first seen with the unaided eye in 1935 and first observed with radar in 1955 . Corona <unk> meteors have an entry velocity of 45 kilometers per second . In 2006 , a shower originating near Beta Coronae Australis was designated as the Beta Coronae Australids . They appear in May , the same month as a nearby shower known as the May <unk> , but the two showers have different trajectories and are unlikely to be related . 
 = = History = = 
 Corona Australis may have been recorded by ancient Mesopotamians in the MUL.APIN , as a constellation called <unk> ( " The Bark " ) . However , this constellation , adjacent to <unk> ( " The Goat @-@ Fish " , modern Capricornus ) , may instead have been modern Epsilon Sagittarii . As a part of the southern sky , <unk> was one of the fifteen " stars of Ea " . 
 In the 3rd century BC , the Greek didactic poet Aratus wrote of , but did not name the constellation , instead calling the two crowns <unk> ( <unk> ) . The Greek astronomer Ptolemy described the constellation in the 2nd century AD , though with the inclusion of Alpha Telescopii , since transferred to Telescopium . <unk> 13 stars to the constellation , he named it <unk> <unk> ( Stephanos <unk> ) , " Southern Wreath " , while other authors associated it with either Sagittarius ( having fallen off his head ) or Centaurus ; with the former , it was called Corona Sagittarii . Similarly , the Romans called Corona Australis the " Golden Crown of Sagittarius " . It was known as <unk> Coelum ( " Canopy " , " Little Sky " ) in the 5th century . The 18th @-@ century French astronomer Jérôme Lalande gave it the names <unk> Australe ( " Southern Garland " ) and <unk> <unk> , while German poet and author Philippus Caesius called it Corolla ( " Little Crown " ) or Spira Australis ( " Southern Coil " ) , and linked it with the Crown of Eternal Life from the New Testament . Seventeenth @-@ century celestial cartographer Julius Schiller linked it to the Diadem of Solomon . Sometimes , Corona Australis was not the wreath of Sagittarius but arrows held in his hand . 
 Corona Australis has been associated with the myth of Bacchus and Stimula . Jupiter had impregnated Stimula , causing Juno to become jealous . Juno convinced Stimula to ask Jupiter to appear in his full splendor , which the mortal woman could not handle , causing her to burn . After Bacchus , Stimula 's unborn child , became an adult and the god of wine , he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky . 
 In Chinese astronomy , the stars of Corona Australis are located within the Black Tortoise of the North ( <unk> , Běi Fāng <unk> <unk> ) . The constellation itself was known as ti 'en <unk> ( " Heavenly Turtle " ) and during the Western Zhou period , marked the beginning of winter . However , precession over time has meant that the " Heavenly River " ( Milky Way ) became the more accurate marker to the ancient Chinese and hence supplanted the turtle in this role . Arabic names for Corona Australis include Al <unk> " the Tortoise " , Al <unk> " the Tent " or Al <unk> al Na <unk> " the Ostrich Nest " . It was later given the name Al <unk> al <unk> , which the European authors Chilmead , Riccioli and Caesius transliterated as <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> respectively . 
 The <unk> speaking San people of South Africa knew the constellation as ≠ <unk> ta ! nu " house of branches " — owned originally by the <unk> ( rock hyrax ) , and the star pattern depicting people sitting in a semicircle around a fire . 
 The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria saw it as Won , a boomerang thrown by <unk> ( Altair ) . The Aranda people of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a coolamon carrying a baby , which was accidentally dropped to earth by a group of sky @-@ women dancing in the Milky Way . The impact of the coolamon created <unk> Bluff crater , 175 km west of Alice Springs . The Torres Strait Islanders saw Corona Australis as part of a larger constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of Scorpius 's tail ; the Pleiades and Orion were also associated . This constellation was Tagai 's canoe , crewed by the Pleiades , called the <unk> , and Orion , called the <unk> . The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe , but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission . Enraged , Tagai bound the <unk> with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat , then threw them overboard . Scorpius 's tail represents a <unk> , while Eta Sagittarii and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe . On the island of Futuna , the figure of Corona Australis was called <unk> and in the Tuamotus , it was called Na Kaua @-@ ki @-@ Tonga .

 Lieutenant Commander Robert Peverell Hichens DSO * DSC * * RNVR ( 2 March 1909 – 13 April 1943 ) was the most highly decorated officer of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( RNVR ) , being awarded two Distinguished Service Orders , three Distinguished Service Crosses and three Mentions in Despatches . He was also recommended for a Victoria Cross after being killed in action in April 1943 . 
 Before the Second World War , Hichens was a keen sportsman who rowed for Magdalen College , Oxford , and competed in the Double sculls at the Henley Regatta . He also competed in International Fourteen sailing events and three times participated in the Fastnet race . On land he raced in hill climbing events in Somerset and also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans race three times . During the Second World War , he rose in rank to become a lieutenant commander and commanded the 6th Motor Gun Boat Flotilla and later the 8th Motor Gun Boat Flotilla . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Peverell Hichens was born 2 March 1909 , the son of Doctor Peverell Smythe Hichens and Constance Sawbridge Hichens . He spent his early life in Northampton , until the start of the Great War when his father — an officer in a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Army Medical Corps — was sent to France , and the rest of the family moved to St Mawes in Cornwall . It was when living in Cornwall that Hichens and his sister Loveday were taught how to sail , eventually sailing their dinghy Arethusa on Carrick Roads . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 In 1919 , following the Great War , the family returned to the Northampton area , and Hichens was sent to a prep school nearby until 1921 , when he was enrolled in Marlborough College . In 1922 , Hichens ' father , by now a consulting physician at Northampton General hospital , retired and the family moved to Guernsey in the Channel Islands , purchasing <unk> House just outside Saint Peter Port . Hichens entered Magdalen College , Oxford , to read law in 1927 . A keen sportsman , he started rowing and within six months was in the <unk> second eight ; by the following year he made the first eight as stroke oarsman . In the Eights Week races ( the annual summer Head of the River Race at Oxford ) , when Hichens was at Magdalen , they came third in 1928 , sixth in 1929 and eighth in 1930 , which was the college 's lowest position in the race since 1876 . While at university he also joined the Officers Training Corps , receiving a commission as second lieutenant in the infantry on 2 June 1929 . In 1929 , the Hichens family had purchased <unk> House at Flushing , Cornwall , which they moved into in 1930 , after the death of Hichens ' father .

 Robert Hichens met his future wife , Catherine Gilbert Enys of Flushing , Cornwall , in 1928 ; they were married at St <unk> church , Penryn , Cornwall , in April 1931 . The following year he joined a firm of solicitors , Reginald Rodgers and son of Falmouth , Cornwall , as an articled clerk to be instructed as a solicitor . Hichens also trained in London with Mackrell 's of Bedford Square ; it was when working in London that he competed at the Henley Regatta in the Double sculls . In June 1933 , after his mother 's death , Hichens inherited half of his father 's estate and <unk> House , and at the same time completed his articles . He became a junior partner with Reginald Rodgers on 1 January 1934 . Robert and Catherine had two sons : Robert , born in 1932 , and Anthony , born in 1936 .

 During this time Hichens had continued to sail ; he joined the Royal Cornish Yacht Club and started to race in International Fourteen events in his own dinghies called Venture and Venture II . He competed in the Fowey Regatta and the Prince of Wales Cup , coming fifth on the River Clyde in 1936 . He also entered the competition at Lowestoft in 1937 and at Falmouth in 1938 . Hichens had also taken up offshore yacht racing and was a member of the Royal Ocean Racing Club , competed three times in the Fastnet race , and crewed in the Channel race in June 1939 .

 Robert Hichens applied to transfer from the Territorial Army to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ( RNVR ) in the summer of 1930 , and eventually transferred to the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve in 1936 , which was formed from yachtsmen sufficiently knowledgeable about the sea to be considered suitable for a commission . After the declaration of war he was ordered to join the training depot HMS King Alfred on 27 October 1939 , and after passing an interview and medical was promoted to sub lieutenant RNVR , completing his training in six weeks instead of the normal three months .

 Having completed training in December 1939 , he was promoted to lieutenant and appointed to HMS <unk> , part of the 5th Minesweeping Flotilla and later the 4th Minesweeping Flotilla . He moved ship to HMS Niger in April 1940 , during the Phoney war period both flotillas were kept busy minesweeping in the North Sea and the only action seen was on 15 May 1940 , when HMS Hussar was holed by a German bomber . On 29 May 1940 , Hichens was informed that the British Expeditionary Force were being evacuated from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo and that Niger would be leaving to assist . Arriving off Dunkirk on 31 May , Hichens organised the small boats and yachts used to evacuate the army from the Dunkirk jetty . When Niger was ordered home with a full complement of soldiers , Hichens asked to be left behind to continue with the evacuation . He was given permission but also informed he would have to find his own way home . Arriving back in Dover on the yacht Chico he rejoined Niger on 1 June . HMS Niger returned to Dunkirk another three times , Hichens once more went ashore to arrange the evacuation before the end of the operation . For his work on the beaches in the withdrawal of the Allied armies from Dunkirk , Hichens was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross ( DSC ) .

 Having asked for a transfer to Coastal Forces Hichens was sent to HMS Osprey at Portland for training on Motor Anti @-@ Submarine Boats ( MASB ) . He was appointed to his first command , MASB 16 , on 4 November 1940 , which he held until 18 November 1940 , when he was appointed commander of MASB 18 . His final MASB command was MASB 14 , which he took up 23 December 1940 . These boats were lightly armed with two twin Vickers .50 machine guns and depth charges and had a top speed of 40 knots . 
 In January 1941 , Hichens was given a new command , Motor Gun Boat 64 , becoming the first RNVR officer to command a MGB , and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla . It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch . As each boat needed to select a radio call sign , Hichens could not think of anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch , which stuck and remained with him for the rest of his time with the coastal forces . 
 The 6th MGB Flotilla was based at HMS Beehive in Felixstowe from April 1941 , where they were tasked to engage German E boats raiding east coast convoys . At this stage in the war MGBs were armed with a mixture of weapons , which could be Lewis machine guns , Vickers machine guns , Oerlikon 20 mm cannon or four barrelled Boulton Paul gun turrets . The armament was soon standardized with two twin Vickers .50 machine guns each side of the bridge , an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mounted aft , and depth charges . The boats had a crew of 18 , consisting of two officers , two petty officers and 14 ratings . 
 = = = Flotilla commander = = = 
 When Robert Hichens was appointed senior officer in command of the 6th MGB Flotilla from September 1941 , he became the first RNVR officer to command a flotilla in the Second World War . Along with the new command came a promotion to lieutenant commander . 
 As flotilla commander his first successful action took place the night of 19 / 20 November 1941 , when his flotilla was ordered to patrol 10 miles ( 16 km ) off the Hook of Holland to engage E boats returning to base . The flotilla engaged five E boats , causing damage to all five boats , damaging two severely and forcing them to disperse . One E boat was later found abandoned by the crew and boarded . This was the first E boat captured and Hichens ' crew obtained valuable information and equipment before the boat sank . For this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSC , the citation noting his " ... [ c ] <unk> skill and readiness when in action against enemy E boats sinking one and damaging others " . Other members of the flotilla were awarded one Distinguished Service Medal ( DSM ) and five others were Mentioned in Dispatches ( MID ) for the action . 
 The flotilla 's second success was the night of 19 / 20 December 1941 , again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast , when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat . They passed twice at high speed before losing contact , but twice during the night they located them and eventually carried out depth charge attacks . Both Hichens and the commander of the other boat received a MID for this action . 
 The third major action Hichens was involved in during this period was the action during the night of 21 / 22 April 1942 , off Ostend , when they engaged six E boats , forcing the superior force to scatter and run for port after severely damaging one boat and causing slight damage to the others . After this action the E boats were moved to a safer harbour to operate from . Hichens was awarded a Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) following this engagement . 
 = = = 8th MGB Flotilla = = = 
 Hichens was next appointed commander of the 8th MGB Flotilla . These new boats were armed with a twin Oerlikon mount aft , a QF 2 @-@ pounder Mark XIV forward , twin Lewis or later twin Vickers machine guns either side of the bridge and depth charges . The flotilla was moved to Dartmouth , Devon in July 1942 . The first action they were involved in was during the night of 14 / 15 July . Ordered to engage E Boats using Cherbourg as a base they found a convoy of naval trawlers escorting a small tanker . The flotilla engaged the two rear escort trawlers and carried out a depth charge attack . The tanker was last seen to be on fire as the flotilla reformed off Alderney . After this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSO . Both the DSO and the Bar were presented during the same investiture at Buckingham Palace on 22 September 1942 , while other members of the flotilla were awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and four MIDs for the action . 
 The flotilla was next in action during the night 29 / 30 July again off Ostend , when the flotilla in company with two Motor Torpedo Boats ( MTB ) engaged a convoy of three Flak trawlers and two merchant ships . One of the merchant ships was hit by torpedoes from the MTBs while the MGBs engaged the other by dropping depth charges . With those ships destroyed they then engaged the Flak trawlers . 
 During the night 1 / 2 August , under orders to patrol north west of Guernsey , the flotilla again located enemy shipping . Following them towards the port of Cherbourg they silently passed a German torpedo boat lying at anchor , and located four E boats waiting to enter harbour . Having caught them by surprise they opened fire on the stationary boats and after a short engagement withdrew leaving two of the enemy boats on fire . For this action Hichens received a second MID , while other members of the flotilla were awarded a DSC , two <unk> and four MIDs . 
 The flotilla was ordered back to Felixstowe in Autumn 1942 . Their first contact with the enemy was on the night 14 / 15 September when they engaged a small convoy off the Hook of Holland . They followed a convoy that was escorted by four Flak trawlers almost into harbour before inflicting considerable damage to it . For this , Hichens was awarded a second Bar to his DSC . Other members of the flotilla were awarded a DSC , two <unk> and a MID . 
 Hichens , now the recipient of two DSOs , three <unk> and two MIDs , was offered promotion to commander in command of HMS Bee at Weymouth , Dorset and a training post ashore . Feeling unsuited for such a role , he declined and remained commander of the 8th MGB flotilla . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 Hichens lost the first boat under his command during the night action 2 / 3 October 1942 . Engaging four trawlers MGB 78 went in for a depth charge attack and was lost to enemy fire . Another boat , MGB 76 , was lost during the night of 5 / 6 October 1942 , when the flotilla was ambushed by two German torpedo boats and a number of E boats . 
 The winter months of 1942 – 43 were uneventful , and Hichens started to write his unfinished account of the war . We fought them in <unk> was published posthumously in 1944 . 
 The flotilla , accompanied by four MTBs and escorting mine laying Motor Launches ( ML ) , were next in action over the night of 27 / 28 February 1943 . The mixed flotilla engaged a convoy escorted by two trawlers and a minesweeper , and lost MGB 79 to enemy fire . Hichens closed with the stricken boat , which was on fire , to remove the crew . They managed to rescue seven of the crew before being forced to withdraw under fire . Hichens ' own boat , MGB 77 , was also set on fire during the rescue . 
 On the night of 12 / 13 April 1943 , the flotilla was ordered to escort mine laying MLs off the Dutch coast . Detecting two trawlers they engaged them leaving one on fire , but as they withdrew MGB 77 was hit , killing Hichens outright and wounding three others on the bridge . Hichens received a posthumous MID for these actions . 
 = = Victoria Cross recommendation = = 
 Hichens was recommended for the Victoria Cross for his actions during the night of 27 / 28 February . When informed by his commanding officer , Commander Kerr , of the intention to recommend him , Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends . Kerr , respecting his views , dropped the recommendation , only for it to be resubmitted six weeks later after his death . The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr , Admiral Lyon ( the Commander @-@ in @-@ chief at Nore ) and Rear Admiral Rogers ( the Flag officer in charge at Harwich ) . The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty , citing the same reasons Hichens had himself given . 
 = Delayed gratification = 
 Delayed gratification , or deferred gratification , is the ability to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward . Generally , delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later . A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes , including academic success , physical health , psychological health , and social competence . 
 A person 's ability to delay gratification relates to other similar skills such as patience , impulse control , self @-@ control and willpower , all of which are involved in self @-@ regulation . Broadly , self @-@ regulation encompasses a person 's capacity to adapt the self as necessary to meet demands of the environment . Delaying gratification is the reverse of delay discounting , which is " the preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards " and refers to the " fact that the subjective value of reward decreases with increasing delay to its receipt . " It is theorized that the ability to delay rewards is under the control of the cognitive @-@ affective personality system ( CAPS ) . 
 Several factors can affect a person 's ability to delay gratification . Cognitive strategies , such as the use of distracting or " cool " thoughts , can increase delay ability , as can neurological factors , such as strength of connections in the frontal @-@ striatal pathway . Behavioral researchers have focused on the contingencies that govern choices to delay reinforcement , and have studied how to manipulate those contingencies in order to lengthen delay . Age plays a role too ; children under 5 years old demonstrate a marked lack of delayed gratification ability and most commonly seek immediate gratification . A very small difference between males and females suggest that females may be better at delaying rewards . The ability to wait or seek immediate reinforcement is related to avoidance @-@ related behaviors such as procrastination , and to other clinical diagnoses such as anxiety , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression . 
 Sigmund Freud , the father of psychoanalytic theory , discussed the ego 's role in balancing the immediate pleasure @-@ driven desires of the id with the morality @-@ driven choices of the superego . Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic , and found that impulsivity , or a lack of ego @-@ control , has a stronger effect on one 's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable . Finally , environmental and social factors play a role ; for example , delay is affected by the self @-@ imposed or external nature of a reward contingency , by the degree of task engagement required during the delay , by early mother @-@ child relationship characteristics , by a person 's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards ( e.g. , in poverty ) , and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms . Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples , such as ecological factors affecting the skill . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = The cognitive @-@ affective processing system = = = 
 One well @-@ supported theory of self @-@ regulation , called the Cognitive @-@ affective personality system ( CAPS ) , suggests that delaying gratification results from an ability to use " cool " regulatory strategies ( i.e. , calm , controlled and cognitive strategies ) over " hot regulatory strategies ( i.e. , emotional , impulsive , automatic reactions ) , when faced with provocation . In " hot " processing , a person thinks intently about the object causing temptation , and especially about its most appealing elements , and is subsequently less able to resist the immediate reward . The use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior . Effective " cool " strategies involve distraction and restructuring the perception of the tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing . For example , in one study of pre @-@ adolescent boys with behavioral problems , the boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used " cool " strategies , such as looking away or distracting themselves . The most effective type of distraction seems to be imagining another desirable reward , which takes attention away from the immediate temptations . 
 = = = The Stanford marshmallow experiment = = = 
 The seminal research on delayed gratification – the now @-@ famous " marshmallow experiment " – was conducted by Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s at Stanford University . Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation . They presented four @-@ year @-@ olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options : ( 1 ) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow , or ( 2 ) wait until the experimenter returned ( about 15 minutes later ) , and earn two marshmallows . The message was : " small reward now , bigger reward later . " Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow , whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows . In follow @-@ up experiments , Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain " cool " distraction techniques ( covering their eyes , hiding under the desk , singing songs , or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them ) , or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow ( focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball , rather than on its gooey , delectable taste ) . 
 The children who waited longer , when re @-@ evaluated as teenagers and adults , demonstrated a striking array of advantages over their peers . As teenagers , they had higher SAT scores , social competence , self @-@ assuredness and self @-@ worth , and were rated by their parents as more mature , better able to cope with stress , more likely to plan ahead , and more likely to use reason . They were less likely to have conduct disorders or high levels of impulsivity , aggressiveness and hyperactivity . As adults , the high delayers were less likely to have drug problems or other addictive behaviors , get divorced , or be overweight . Each minute that a preschooler was able to delay gratification translated to a .2 % reduction in Body Mass Index 30 years later . 
 Each of these positive outcomes requires some ability to forgo short @-@ term reward in favor of a higher payoff in the future . The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity ( the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection ) . In a 20 @-@ year follow @-@ up of the marshmallow experiment , individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self @-@ esteem and self @-@ worth and more adaptive coping skills , in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four @-@ year @-@ olds . These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern : The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings . 
 Forty years after the first marshmallow test studies , neuroimaging data has shed light on the neural correlates of delayed gratification . A team led by B. J. Casey , of Cornell University , recruited 59 of the original participants – who are now in their mid @-@ 40s – and gave them a delayed gratification task . Instead of resisting marshmallows , these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces , but not to neutral or fearful faces . Those who had been high delayers as pre @-@ schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to the emotional faces ( i.e. , not pressing the button in response to happy faces ) , suggesting that the high delayers continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses . Casey and colleagues also scanned the brains of 26 participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) as they completed the task . The researchers hypothesized that high delayers would be more likely to use " cool " regulation strategies to control their responses , which would manifest as activation of the right prefrontal cortex , whereas low delayers would use " hot " strategies , which would activate the ventral striatum , an area also linked to addiction . Indeed , results showed this differential brain activity . This mirrors other fMRI research of delayed gratification conducted by Noah <unk> and Jeremy Gray , of Yale University , demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards ( in hypothetical situations ) showed greater brain activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex . 
 = = Factors affecting one 's ability = = 
 = = = Cognitive / neurological factors = = = 
 The way that a person frames a situation heavily influences a decision 's outcome . Research on " hot " and " cool " strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward by focusing on the reward 's arousing , " hot " qualities ( taste , smell , sound , feel , etc . ) their self @-@ control and delay of gratification decreases , while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract , " cool " qualities ( shape , color , number , etc . ) , can enhance self @-@ control and increase the delay . Optimal self @-@ control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item , especially the arousing , " hot " qualities of a competing item . For example , delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy . This illustrates an individual 's ability to manipulate his / her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal @-@ directed purposes . 
 Delaying gratification is the same as controlling the impulse for immediate gratification , which requires cognitive control . The ventral striatum , located in the midbrain , is the part of the limbic system that is the reward center as well as a pleasure center . The limbic system will always react to the potential for instant pleasure . To override this instinct , the prefrontal cortex , which is also associated with reasoning and rational thought , must be active . The prefrontal cortex is also the part of the brain that determines the focus of a person 's attention , which enables a better framing that facilitates delayed gratification . During adolescence and early adulthood , the prefrontal cortex develops and matures to become more complicated and connected with the rest of the brain . Older children and adults find the deferment @-@ of @-@ gratification tasks easier than do young children for this reason . However , the relative ability to defer gratification remains stable throughout development . Children who can better control impulses grow up to be adults who also have better control . Practicing deferred gratification is quite beneficial to cognitive abilities throughout life . 
 = = = Behavioral factors = = = 
 <unk> focus on the acquisition and teaching of delayed gratification , and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay . Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person 's current behavior , which promotes learning a delay of gratification . It is important to note that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed , the reward must have some value to the participant . Without a reward that is meaningful , providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose , as the reward is not a strong <unk> of the desired behavior . 
 Behavior theorists see delaying gratification as an adaptive skill . It has been shown that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior , such as sharing and positive peer interactions . For example , students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities . To put it simply , if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after , the task 's completion becomes more likely . 
 Behavioral researchers have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement . A past study by <unk> et al . , focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time : 15 , 30 , 60 , and 90 seconds . The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for a short amount of time and the other turning the noise off for an extended time . The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60 @-@ second delay was issued . Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time . 
 = = = = Individual thresholds for delay = = = = 
 In a 2011 study , researchers tested to see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of ( hypothetical ) money that they could receive presently , or telling them they could wait a month for more money . Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on the amount of money being offered , but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward . The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward . As prospect theory states , people are heavily loss @-@ averse . People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain . 
 = = = = Duration of time delay = = = = 
 The duration of time until an eventual reward also affects participants ' choice of immediate or delayed gratification . A 2001 study demonstrated that if a reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time , such as 180 – 300 months ( 15 – 25 years ) , the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential ; instead , the bulk of the participants choose the immediate reward , even if their delayed reward would be quite large . Delayed gratification has its limits , and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait .

 In a Year 3 elementary classroom in South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times . The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts , and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan was put into place . The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask , and if they did not exceed the limit , they were given tokens for rewards . The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification , by way of cool processing . Instead of having the girls focus on attention @-@ seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students , the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had , and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher . They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward , which increased their delays . By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior , the girls dropped their rate of question @-@ asking and attention @-@ seeking . 
 = = = = = Applications to ADHD = = = = = 
 Compared to neurotypical children , those with ADHD generally demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more than by the frequency of reward and effort to obtain it . However , researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through the implementation of a simple self @-@ control training procedure in which <unk> immediacy competes with the frequency , quantity or saliency of the reward , and the delay is gradually increased . One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD . In another study , 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation of the quality of the <unk> and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing @-@ criterion design . Post @-@ assessment of the children illustrated that self @-@ control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement ; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference . 
 = = = Across the lifespan = = = 
 At birth , infants are unable to wait for their wants and needs to be met and exhibit a defining lack of impulse control . With age , developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification . Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan , including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems . 
 = = = = Effects of age = = = = 
 Children under five years old display the least effective strategies for delaying gratification , such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features . By 5 years old , most children are able to demonstrate better self @-@ control by recognizing the counter @-@ productivity of focusing on the reward . Five @-@ year @-@ olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self @-@ instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value . Between 8 and 13 years old , children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay . Once delaying strategies are developed , the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood . <unk> ' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing , which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the <unk> @-@ striatal circuit ( neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions ) . Declines in self @-@ regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward @-@ delaying strategies , specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies . 
 = = = = Effects of gender = = = = 
 Throughout 33 studies on gender differences , a small significant effect ( r = <unk> ) has been found indicating that a base @-@ rate of 10 % more females are able to delay rewards than males , which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior . This effect may be related to the slight gender differences found in delay discounting ( i.e. , minimizing the value of a delayed reward ) and higher levels of impulsivity and inattention in boys . Further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age ( e.g. , puberty ) or if it has a stable magnitude throughout the lifespan . Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother 's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does . 
 = = = Clinical factors = = = 
 = = = = Contemporary clinical psychology perspectives = = = = 
 Self @-@ control has been called the " master virtue " by clinical and social psychologists , suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person 's overall psychological adjustment . People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing , self @-@ esteem and openness to experience , as well as more productive ways of responding to anger and other provocations . Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life , such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder . Meanwhile , many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification . The tendency to choose short @-@ term rewards at the expense of longer @-@ term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology . 
 <unk> disorders . <unk> disorders ( i.e. , acting @-@ out disorders ) show a clearer link to delayed gratification , since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control . For example , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents , as are substance abuse , gambling , and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults . In a 2010 study , teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol , or to smoke cigarettes or marijuana . Interestingly , a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ ( in other words , ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ ) . This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification , and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation . 
 <unk> disorders . Difficulty delaying gratification also plays a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression . A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety @-@ provoking situations . By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance , a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance . <unk> , which is often a reflection of anxiety , is a clear example : a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead . Obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ( OCD ) is a more jarring case of this anxiety @-@ related struggle to delay gratification ; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts , even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run . ( One experiment , however , did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification , while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with Obsessive @-@ compulsive personality disorder . ) Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification , though the direction of cause and effect is not clear . A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is ( deliberately or not ) prioritizing short @-@ term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification . There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self @-@ harm ( i.e. , cut themselves ) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain . Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly . 
 A growing body of research suggests that self @-@ control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice . In other words , self @-@ control abilities are malleable , a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill . In psychotherapy , treatment for impulse @-@ control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification . In anxiety disorders , this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first , but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person 's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared . Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on . To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long @-@ term gains , therapists might also help individuals construct a pro @-@ con list of a certain behavior , with sections for short @-@ term and long @-@ term outcomes . For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self @-@ injury , substance use or avoidance , there are generally no long @-@ term pros . Meanwhile , abstinence from acting on a harmful urge ( i.e. , delayed gratification ) generally results in long @-@ term benefits . This realization can be a powerful impetus for change . 
 = = = = Psychoanalytic drives and impulses = = = = 
 Sigmund Freud viewed the struggle to delay gratification as a person 's efforts to overcome the instinctive , libidinal drive of the id . According to classic psychoanalytic theory , a person 's psyche is composed of the id , ego and superego . The id is driven by the pleasure principle : it wants physical pleasure , and it wants it now . The ego , operating under the reality principle , serves to moderate the id 's desire for instant gratification against the superego , which is guided by a person 's internalized sense of morality . According to psychoanalytic theory , a person with difficulty delaying gratification is plagued by <unk> conflict – the ego cannot adequately regulate the battle between the id and the superego – and experiences psychological distress , often in the form of anxiety or " neurosis . " 
 Other psychoanalytic researchers describe a more nuanced , and less universally positive , view of delayed gratification . David C. Funder and Jack Block theorized that a person 's tendency to delay , or not delay , gratification is just one element of a broader construct called ego control , defined as a person 's ability to modulate or control impulses . Ego control " ranges from ego <unk> at one end to ego <unk> at the other , " according to Funder . These tendencies are thought to be relatively stable in each individual , such that someone who tends toward <unk> will " grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at the cost of long @-@ term gain " and someone who tends toward <unk> will " delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost . " By this view , delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings , but inappropriate or even costly in other settings . 
 Funder and Block draw a distinction between the ego @-@ control model , in which delayed gratification is seen as a general tendency to contain motivational impulses ( whether or not it is adaptive in a specific instance ) , and the ego @-@ resiliency model ( supported by Mischel 's research ) , in which delayed gratification is seen as a skill that arises only when it is adaptive . To tease apart these models , Funder and Block explored the association between ego control , ego resiliency , IQ and delayed gratification in adolescents . The adolescents had the choice between being paid $ 4 at each of six study sessions or delaying their payment until the last session , in which case they would also earn an addition $ 4 of " interest . " The results supported both models of delayed gratification . The teens ' tendency to delay gratification was indeed associated with IQ and with ego resiliency ( e.g. , higher delayers were rated as more responsible , consistent , likable , sympathetic , generous ; less hostile , moody , self @-@ indulgent , rebellious ) , but was also independently associated with ego control ( e.g. , higher delayers were rated as " tends toward over @-@ control of needs and impulses , " " favors conservative values in a number of areas . " . The researchers noted that individual differences in ego control ( i.e. , overall impulsivity ) may play a larger role in delayed gratification when the incentives are larger and more motivating . 
 Writing in 1998 , Funder described delayed gratification as a " mixed bag . " He concluded : " Participants who exhibited the most delay were not just ' better ' at self @-@ control , but in a sense they seemed unable to avoid it . … <unk> are in general smart and well @-@ adjusted , but they also tend to be somewhat <unk> and unnecessarily inhibited . "

 Factors affecting one 's ability to delay gratification depend on whether the delay contingency is self @-@ imposed ( delay can be terminated at the will of the person waiting ) or externally imposed by another person , institution or circumstance . When the contingency is self @-@ imposed , the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification . On the other hand , when the delay is externally imposed , children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present , suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances .

 Engaging in work or an assigned task can generate an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person to wait for a longer delay , as long as the reward is not being flaunted . Having the reward present during work ( and easily accessible ) creates a negative frustration — akin to teasing — rather than providing motivation . For example , a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his / her homework will be less motivated to wait for his / her turn for recess . Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it , then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it . 
 = = = = Mother @-@ child relationship = = = = 
 The more positive emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24 @-@ month @-@ old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent , the better s / he is 3 @.@ 5 years later at using cooling strategies in order to delay gratification . This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations are similar to those utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal @-@ directed delay of gratification . Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child 's ability to delay gratification . An interaction has been found between a mother 's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment . Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer . Similarly , children who stay close to a non @-@ controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays . This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli , although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown . A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self @-@ regulation when the child was a toddler , indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self @-@ regulation , self @-@ control and emotional competency . 
 = = = = Reliability of gratification = = = = 
 Researchers have investigated whether the reliability of the reward affects one 's ability to delay gratification . Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity . For example , researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited . After the children successfully waited for the reward , better supplies could not be " found " and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape . Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification . Children who had learned that the researcher 's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow , waiting only an average of 3 minutes . Conversely , children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes , with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows . 
 = = = = Social / cultural influences = = = = 
 It is difficult to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large , instant reward for their years of schooling . Societal impacts and current media trends have had the effect of teaching people to expect instant gratification . The idea of waiting for a good job , earned through working from the bottom up , frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today 's society . This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces , but also in interpersonal relationships . Current studies show that 45 % of marriages will end in divorce . Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on them . Our society today makes it increasingly easy to receive instant gratification . " We have devalued the time we spend alone just thinking , but it 's that time for reflection that leads to the big ideas ... Multitasking is espoused and almost glorified in the United States , but it is dehumanizing us and making us less creative . " 
 = = = Genetics and evolution = = = 
 Evolutionary theory can argue against the selection of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior . One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting . While waiting , individuals lose time that could be used to find other food . Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage . There are also two risks associated with being patient . First , there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first , also known as an interruption risk . Second , there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short , perhaps by a predator , also known as a termination risk . These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened . There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world . For example , animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away , or waiting , delaying gratification , until it becomes ripe . The interruption risk plays a part here , because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit , there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first . Also , in extractive foraging , such as with nuts and shellfish , the outer shell creates a delay . However , animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions , and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage . 
 It is likely that there is a strong genetic component to deferred gratification , though no direct link has been established . Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks , it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior . For this same reason , multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification . Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification . 
 = = Animal studies = = 
 Delayed gratification or deferred gratification is an animal behavior that can be linked to delay discounting , ecological factors , individual fitness , and neurobiological mechanisms . Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys , tamarins , marmosets , rats , and pigeons . 
 = = = Delay discounting = = = 
 When animals are faced with a choice to either wait for a reward , or receive a reward right away , the discounting of the reward is hyperbolic . As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases , the reward is discounted at a gradual rate . Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting , rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time , only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging . Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals . Rather than relating risk to delay , risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting . In a study conducted by Haden and Platt , macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive , versus a more risky choice . The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time , and a small reward the other fifty percent . The ultimate payoff was the same , but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice . They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky , but rather as a large , delayed reward . They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain : if they did not get the large reward the first time around , they would eventually get it , but at a longer delay . To test for this theory , they gave the same test while varying the time between the opportunities to choose a reward . They found that as the interval increased , the number of times that the monkeys chose the more risky reward decreased . While this occurred in macaque monkeys , the varying interval time did not affect pigeons ' choices in another study . This suggests that research looking into varying risk sensitivity of different species is needed . When provided a choice between a small , short delay reward , and a large , long delay reward , there is an impulsive preference for the former . Additionally , as the delay time for the small / short and large / long reward increases , there is a shift in preference toward the larger , delayed reward . This evidence only supports hyperbolic discounting , not exponential . 
 = = = Ecological factors = = = 
 Although predicting reward preference seems simple when using empirical models , there are a number of ecological factors that seem to affect the delayed gratification behavior of animals . In real world situations , " discounting makes sense because of the inherent uncertainty of future payoffs . " 
 One study looked at how reward discounting is context specific . By differing the time and space between small and large rewards , they were able to test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and marmosets . They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards , but will not wait as long as marmosets . Conversely , marmosets will wait longer , but will not travel as far . They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species . The tamarins feed over large distances , looking for insects . Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action . The marmosets , on the other hand , eat tree sap , which takes more time to secrete , but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances . 
 The physiological similarities between humans and other animals , especially primates , have led to more comparative research between the two groups . Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world . 
 = The Go @-@ Getter ( 2007 film ) = 
 The Go @-@ Getter is a 2007 American independent road film directed and written by Martin Hynes . The film stars Lou Taylor Pucci , Zooey Deschanel , and Jena Malone . In the film , 19 @-@ year @-@ old Mercer ( Pucci ) steals a stranger 's car to embark on a road trip to find his estranged brother and tell him that their mother has died . He communicates with the car 's owner , Kate ( Deschanel ) , via her cell phone while he travels . 
 The story was based partially on Hynes 's own experiences . After his mother died , and his marriage ended , he took a road trip of his own and wrote " different things , " some of which came together in the script for The Go @-@ Getter . Before production began , Hynes and three other crew members traveled to almost every location visited in the film to perform a test shoot , trying various filming styles and techniques . Filming took place between October and November 2005 in Oregon , Nevada , California , and Mexico . Singer and guitarist M. Ward provided most of the music for the film , complemented by songs from The Black Keys , Elliott Smith , The Replacements , and Animal Collective . 
 The Go @-@ Getter debuted on January 22 , 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and was given a limited theatrical release on June 6 , 2008 by Peace Arch Entertainment . Its run lasted just three days , and it grossed only US $ 11 @,@ 931 . Critics were divided in reaction to the film ; some praised the performances , the dialogue and the cinematography , while others thought it was unoriginal , forgettable , and poorly acted . 
 = = Plot = = 
 One ordinary day , 19 @-@ year @-@ old Mercer White ( Lou Taylor Pucci ) steals a Volvo station wagon from a car wash , and leaves Eugene , Oregon to find his estranged half @-@ brother Arlen , who is unaware that their mother has recently died . Soon after leaving , a cell phone in the car rings , and Mercer finds himself talking to the owner of the car , Kate ( Zooey Deschanel ) , who lends him her car on the condition that he calls regularly to describe his trip to her . 
 Mercer travels to a bohemian pottery @-@ making commune in Shelter Cove , California where Arlen once lived , but learns that he moved to Reno , Nevada . He passes through Fallon , Nevada to meet up with the seductive Joely ( Jena Malone ) , his middle school crush . In Reno , they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen . Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film , where the director ( Julio Oscar <unk> ) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento , California . Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy ( Colin <unk> ) and his friend Rid ( William Lee Scott ) to Mojave , California , where they are building their own car . While driving , Mercer finds Kate 's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and , now knowing what she looks like , describes a dream to her in which he , Joely , and Kate are dancing in a re @-@ enactment of Bande à part 's dance sequence . Not wanting to get sidetracked , he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room , but when Buddy threatens to steal the car , Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend , and Buddy , Rid , and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate 's car . He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working , and retrieves the car . 
 Mercer talks to Kate while driving , imagining her sitting in the back seat of the car , but she hangs up in jealousy when he mentions Joely for the first time . He arrives in Sacramento and finds the pet store where Arlen worked . The owner ( Maura Tierney ) asks Mercer to sing in her children 's band , for which she plays as part of her probation . When he returns to the car , he finds somebody trying to break into it , only to discover that it is Kate . They spend the night at a hotel , but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles , California . With the help of a translator , he phones Arlen 's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada , Mexico . Mercer finally meets Arlen ( <unk> Garcia ) at the hotel in Ensenada , but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money . Enraged , Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises . Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel . She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him , and they have sex . The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again , more amicably , and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother 's ashes .

 Writer @-@ director Martin Hynes referred to the film as " very uncomfortably autobiographical " . He had learned that his mother was diagnosed with cancer when making his 1999 film The Big Split . His marriage ended soon after his mother died , which Hynes saw as " a huge amount of loss " . After deciding that " I have to do less , " he took a road trip , spending much of his time writing as he traveled . He wrote " really different things " , some of which were pieced together and led to his script for The Go @-@ Getter , which he wrote in 2004 . Within six months of the script 's completion , producer Lucy Barzun Donnelly had raised the entire budget of the film without any actors attached at the time . 
 Barzun Donnelly recommended to Hynes that he consider Lou Taylor Pucci for the lead role of Mercer , believing that he was " perfect " . Hynes watched Pucci 's 2005 film <unk> and thought that " We 'd be so lucky to have him . " He contacted Pucci about the role but was leaving for Norway in less than a week to attend a friend 's wedding and wanted to meet with him before leaving . Pucci was in San Francisco on a press tour and Hynes flew from Los Angeles to have lunch with him . Hynes said of the meeting , " I think we really [ got ] each other , " and Pucci accepted the role a week later . Jena Malone signed on to portray Joely because she " loved the script " and was keen to play " a woman on the cusp of learning to toy with her [ ... ] sexual manipulation " ; she only later learned that Hynes had written the role with her in mind , having previously worked with her on the short film Al as in Al . Hynes said that Zooey Deschanel , Maura Tierney , and Bill Duke each joined the cast because they " read [ the script ] and really liked it " . He made a deliberate attempt to cast Deschanel and Malone against their previous types . He described Deschanel as a " glamour girl " and Malone as a sexually mature woman . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Four months before filming began , Hynes asked Barzun Donnelly to set US $ 20 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 aside from the film 's budget so that he could perform a test shoot . Hynes , cinematographer Byron Shah , a camera assistant , and a stand @-@ in for Mercer — as Pucci had not yet been cast — traveled to every location in the film except for Mexico . Over 2 @,@ 000 miles ( 3 @,@ 200 km ) , they shot 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) of film , testing different filters , lenses , film stocks , and shooting styles . Hynes wrote an 85 @-@ page shot list , " <unk> [ ing ] out " the entire film . He called the test shoot an " incredible boon " and remarked that " Not one frame of it ended up on the movie , but it paid for itself time and time again . " After returning to Los Angeles , he visited each of the locations ( including Mexico ) again with the principal and technical crews . 
 Principal photography began in mid @-@ October 2005 and continued through November over a total period of 25 days . The film was shot in sequence , with production starting in Eugene , Oregon and then moving to Reno , Nevada and subsequently Ensenada , Mexico . Hynes called the filming " a high @-@ wire act the whole way " , and said that one of the biggest challenges was transporting the crew of 40 from Oregon to Mexico , sometimes changing locations twice a day with few hours of daylight . A crew member lost the project 's Filming Permit on the last day of shooting in Mexico , and filming at rush hour was halted by the police . Hynes took a smaller camera to film several blocks away from the original set , but the second assistant director soon arrived warning that the police were coming and that they would be taken to prison because they did not have the paperwork for filming . Hynes and the crew " scatter [ ed ] " , leaving Pucci alone further down the street , which Hynes claims is his strangest experience in the film industry . The crew later returned to Los Angeles to shoot final scenes and to commence post @-@ production . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 When searching for the film 's music , one of the producers suggested to Hynes that he go to a Bright Eyes concert . Singer and guitarist M. Ward opened the show as a supporting act , and Hynes recalled thinking , " Holy shit ! That 's the guy . That 's it . He 's perfect ! " Hynes sent an unsolicited script of the film to Ward , who read it and signed on to the project when there was no financing behind the film nor any actors attached . He told Hynes that any of his songs could be used in the film ; Hynes said that , in post @-@ production , he tested every one of Ward 's songs , including instrumental versions , in the final cut . In the beginning of the film , Mercer comes across a band ; Hynes had always intended for whichever song they were playing to become the overture of the film . Ward 's song " Vincent O 'Brien " became that overture , and described the continuous presence of Ward 's music as " a reminder of home " . He decided that when Joely entered " it was right to step away from Mercer 's sound — M. Ward — and [ convey ] that this movie has been overtaken by forces outside his control , " using The Black Keys ' " 10 A.M. Automatic " and " Keep Me " in addition to The Replacements ' " Color Me Impressed " . Hynes was able to obtain , at a low cost , " Banshee Beat " by Animal Collective and the late Elliott Smith 's song " Coast to Coast " , after writing a " heartfelt letter " to Smith 's mother and sister , his main estate holders . 
 He also used " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God " by novelty singer Corn Mo at the insistence of Nick Offerman , who plays three minor roles in the film . The Portland Youth Jazz Orchestra All Stars plays Ward 's " One Life Away " as an " old @-@ timey instrumental " for one of Mercer 's dreams , an homage to a dancing sequence seen in Jean @-@ Luc Godard 's 1964 film Bande à part . For the closing credits , Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of " When I Get to the Border " from Richard and Linda Thompson 's 1974 album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight . The pair found themselves " mutually charmed " , according to The New York Times ' Melena Ryzik , and bonded over similar musical interests . After Ward listened to Deschanel 's demos , they paired up and formed the band She & Him . Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go @-@ Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records , including a 12 @-@ song tracklist , but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack .

 He enrolled in the I. M. Sechenov 1st Moscow Medical Institute , where he graduated with a doctoral degree . After , he enrolled in the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems , Ministry of Public Health , Moscow , where he specialized in astronautics medicine . Polyakov dedicated himself to the field of space medicine in 1964 after the flight of the first physician in space , Boris <unk> , aboard Voskhod 1 .

 Polyakov was selected as a cosmonaut in Medical Group 3 on March 22 , 1972 . His first flight into space occurred on Soyuz TM @-@ 6 in 1988 . After staying aboard the Mir space station and conducting research for 240 days , Polyakov returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 7 . 
 Polyakov 's second spaceflight , the longest human spaceflight in history , began on January 8 , 1994 with the launch of the Soyuz TM @-@ 18 mission . He spent approximately 437 days aboard Mir conducting experiments and performing scientific research . During this flight , he completed just over 7 @,@ 000 orbits of the Earth . On January 9 , 1995 , after 366 days in space , Polyakov formally broke the spaceflight duration record previously set by Vladimir Titov and Musa <unk> six years earlier . He returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 20 on March 22 , 1995 . Upon landing , Polyakov opted not to be carried the few feet between the Soyuz capsule and a nearby lawn chair , instead walking the short distance . In doing so , he wished to prove that humans could be physically capable of working on the surface of Mars after a long @-@ duration transit phase . 
 Polyakov volunteered for his 437 @-@ day flight to learn how the human body would respond to the micro @-@ gravity environment on long @-@ duration missions to Mars . Upon returning from his second spaceflight , Polyakov held the record for the most total time in space . This record , however , was later broken by Sergei Avdeyev and is currently held by Gennady Padalka . Data from Polyakov 's flight has been used by researchers to determine that humans are able to maintain a healthy mental state during long @-@ duration spaceflight just as they would on Earth . 
 Polyakov underwent medical assessments before , during , and after the flight . He also underwent two follow @-@ up examinations six months after returning to Earth . When researchers compared the results of these medical exams , it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions , Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth . However , Polyakov 's mood stabilized to pre @-@ flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission . It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth . In light of these findings , researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights , such as manned missions to Mars .

 " The Man from the Other Side " is the 19th episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The episode follows the attempts of Thomas Jerome Newton , with the help of shapeshifters , to create a pathway between the two parallel universes , while the Fringe team 's Olivia Dunham , Peter Bishop , and Walter Bishop try to stop him . 
 The episode was written by co @-@ executive producer Josh Singer and series story editor Ethan Gross , and directed by Jeffrey Hunt . It first aired on April 22 , 2010 in the United States to an estimated 5 @.@ 84 million viewers , helping Fox place second for the night . Television critics praised the episode for good pacing and a " heartbreaking " conclusion ; one writer noted it was " full of just about everything I look for from the show " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Walter ( John Noble ) has prepared himself to reveal to Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) the truth — that he is from the parallel universe — when they are called to a case . Two teenagers were found dead , evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe . Exploring the nearby area , they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study . At the same time of the teenagers ' death , they find a carrier signal in the local television . With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic 's help , they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync , and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon . Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton 's ( Sebastian Roché ) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime , the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt . 
 From the unformed shapeshifter , they learn of a name of its potential target , a doctor at a local hospital . They take the man into custody but find that he has yet to be harmed . Based on the need for three shapeshifters , Walter surmises that Newton is trying to use the same technology that he and William Bell had pioneered for crossing the universes , by placing three vibrational sources triangulated around the target . Walter begins to collect equipment to create interference with the vibrations to prevent the crossing . Another corpse is found , that of a bank manager that appears to have been killed by a shapeshifter . Realizing both men would have access to secured areas in their workplaces , they use these locations as two points on <unk> 's triangle . From this , they are able to identify two locations where the transfer will occur . Olivia ( Anna Torv ) , using the information Walter has told her in private about his own crossing , identifies a collapsed derelict bridge over the Charles River , where the water would absorb the energy of crossing over . 
 The Fringe team converges on the bridge , where Newton has already started the process as the time of synchronization nears . As Olivia and the other FBI agent engage the two other shapeshifters in combat , Walter and Peter set up the interference device . Peter warns everyone , including Walter , back as he completes the interference device and the bridge , which still exists in the parallel universe , starts to appear with a man crossing it . The shockwave of its appearance disintegrates an FBI agent on the bridge with Peter but sends Peter flying back and knocks him out . 
 Peter wakes in the hospital , learning from Olivia that they saw a man safely cross the bridge and taken by Newton . When Walter arrives to see Peter , Peter tells him he has realized the truth : because he , like the man on the bridge , was not affected by the same shockwave that killed the FBI agent , he must be from the parallel universe . Walter is unable to deny Peter 's accusations . The next day , Walter is devastated to learn that Peter has discharged himself and has disappeared .

 MTV 's Josh Wigler praised Jackson and Noble 's performances , and appreciated the show 's ability to " gross you out in progressively unique ways " . Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A- , explaining it was " full of just about everything I look for from the show , " as it had a sequence focused on weird science , a great performance by Noble , and a " heartbreaking " ending . Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 8 @.@ 6 / 10 , as he thought it " delivered action , suspense , mystery , and the final climax " to Peter discovering his origins , and it was " a great achievement that marks a big turning point for the series " . Like other critics , Isler also praised Jackson and Noble 's acting . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly lauded Noble and Jackson 's performances , calling Peter 's change back to " the secretive , bitter , scurrilous character he was before the series started " a " wrenching daring move on the part of the show " . Tim Grierson of the magazine New York was worried that the hype surrounding Peter 's secret would not pay off , but believed " Happily , last night 's episode perfectly handled that anticipated plot point ... [ it ] turned out to be much better than could have been hoped " . 
 Hitfix 's Ryan McGee found the possibility of Walternate being the aforementioned Secretary a " compelling idea , " and loved the shapeshifting embryos . McGee concluded his review with a focus on the main cast 's performances , " Joshua Jackson 's understated nature during his final scene with John Noble really paid off . Had he blown into straight histrionics , the scene wouldn 't have worked nearly as well . But playing it with controlled , eloquent , understated fury , he conveyed betrayal more than anger , which cut Walter even deeper than rage ever could . " UGO Networks critic Alex Zalben was unhappy the promotions for the episode revealed Peter discovering his secret , " By showing Peter 's revelation in the ' Next Week on Fringe ' and subsequent commercials advertising this week 's episode , [ the network ] totally , one hundred percent blew it . " Otherwise , Zalben believed it to be an " awesome episode " , and praised the shapeshifter visual effects . Jane Boursaw of AOL TV wrote , " This episode of Fringe had everything - a slimy embryo , a thrilling gunfight , nefarious shapeshifters , some alternate universe action , and yes , that heartbreaking drama we 've been waiting for all season . " Boursaw was slightly critical of Peter 's discovery , explaining the relationship was built up so much that she wished Peter 's subsequent estrangement had " turned [ ed ] out better " and had him stay with Walter . 
 = Fundamental Rights , Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India = 
 The Fundamental Rights , Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the State to its citizens and the duties of the citizens to the State . These sections comprise a constitutional bill of rights for government policy @-@ making and the behavior and conduct of citizens . These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution , which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the Constituent Assembly of India . 
 The Fundamental Rights is defined as the basic human rights of all citizens . These rights , defined in Part III of the Constitution , apply irrespective of race , place of birth , religion , caste , creed or gender . They are enforceable by the courts , subject to specific restrictions . The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government . These provisions , set out in Part IV of the Constitution , are not enforceable by the courts , but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing laws . 
 The Fundamental Duties are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India . These duties , set out in Part IV – A of the Constitution , concern individuals and the nation . Unlike the Directive Principles , they are enforceable by law . 
 = = History = = 
 The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the Indian independence movement , which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state . The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England 's Bill of Rights , the United States Bill of Rights and France 's Declaration of the Rights of Man . The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement , with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress ( INC ) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects . This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919 . The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law , free speech , trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members , political power , and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens . 
 The experiences of the First World War , the unsatisfactory Montague @-@ Chelmsford reforms of 1919 , and the rise to prominence of M. K. Gandhi in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights . The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians . The Commonwealth of India Bill , drafted by Annie <unk> in 1925 , specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights – individual liberty , freedom of conscience , free expression of opinion , freedom of assembly , non @-@ discrimination on the ground of sex , free elementary education and free use of public spaces . In 1927 , the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a " Swaraj Constitution " for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression . The 11 @-@ member committee , led by Motilal Nehru , was constituted in 1928 . Its report made a number of recommendations , including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians . These rights resembled those of the American Constitution and those adopted by post @-@ war European countries , and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill . Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution , including the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles . 
 In 1931 , the Indian National Congress , at its Karachi session , adopted a resolution committing itself to the defence of civil rights and economic freedom , with the stated objectives of putting an end to exploitation , providing social security and implementing land reforms . Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles , universal adult franchise , abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement . Drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru , the resolution , which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles , placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State , and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement . The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s , along with an increased focus on minority rights – which had become an issue of major political concern by then – which were published in the Sapru Report in 1945 . The report , apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities , also sought to prescribe a " standard of conduct for the legislatures , government and the courts " . 
 During the final stages of the British <unk> , the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India proposed a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as part of the process of transfer of power . The Constituent Assembly of India , composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states , commenced its proceedings in December 1946 , and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949 . According to the Cabinet Mission plan , the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of fundamental rights , protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas . Accordingly , the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members , and from among these a twelve @-@ member sub @-@ committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J.B. <unk> in February 1947 . The sub @-@ committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947 , and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly , which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year , adopting the drafts of most of them by December 1948 . The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission , as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution . The Directive Principles , which were also drafted by the sub @-@ committee on Fundamental Rights , expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement , and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution . The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976 . 
 = = Fundamental Rights = = 
 The Fundamental Rights , embodied in Part III of the Constitution , guarantee civil rights to all Indians , and prevent the State from encroaching on individual liberty while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens ' rights from encroachment by society . Seven fundamental rights were originally provided by the Constitution – right to equality , right to freedom , right against exploitation , right to freedom of religion , cultural and educational rights , right to property and right to constitutional remedies . However , the right to property was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978 . 
 The purpose of the Fundamental Rights is to preserve individual liberty and democratic principles based on equality of all members of society . Dr Ambedkar said that the responsibility of the legislature is not just to provide fundamental rights but also and rather more importantly , to safeguard them . 
 They act as limitations on the powers of the legislature and executive , under Article 13 , and in case of any violation of these rights the Supreme Court of India and the High Courts of the states have the power to declare such legislative or executive action as unconstitutional and void . These rights are largely enforceable against the State , which as per the wide definition provided in Article 12 , includes not only the legislative and executive wings of the federal and state governments , but also local administrative authorities and other agencies and institutions which discharge public functions or are of a governmental character . However , there are certain rights – such as those in Articles 15 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 24 – that are also available against private individuals . Further , certain Fundamental Rights – including those under Articles 14 , 20 , 21 , 25 – apply to persons of any nationality upon Indian soil , while others – such as those under Articles 15 , 16 , 19 , 30 – are applicable only to citizens of India . 
 The Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of public interest . In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973 , the Supreme Court , overruling a previous decision of 1967 , held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended , subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution . The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced , removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment , passed by a two @-@ thirds majority of each House of Parliament . The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the Fundamental Rights , excluding Articles 20 and 21 , by order of the President . The President may , by order , suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well , thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights , except Articles 20 and 21 , during the period of the emergency . Parliament may also restrict the application of the Fundamental Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police , in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline , by a law made under Article 33 . 
 = = = Right to Equality = = = 
 The Right to Equality is one of the chief guarantees of the Constitution . It is embodied in Articles 14 – 16 , which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non @-@ discrimination , and Articles 17 – 18 which collectively further the philosophy of social equality . Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India . This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law , as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances . The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes , provided there is a reasonable basis for the same , meaning that the classification is required to be non @-@ arbitrary , based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified , as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification . 
 Article 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds only of religion , race , caste , sex , place of birth , or any of them . This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals , with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds . However , the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens , including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes . This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived and in need of special protection . Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion , race , caste , sex , descent , place of birth , place of residence or any of them . It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service , as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion . 
 The practice of untouchability has been declared an offence punishable by law under Article 17 , and the Protection of Civil Rights Act , 1955 has been enacted by the Parliament to further this objective . Article 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions , and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state . Thus , Indian aristocratic titles and titles of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished . However , awards such as the Bharat Ratna have been held to be valid by the Supreme Court on the ground that they are merely decorations and cannot be used by the recipient as a title . 
 = = = Right to Freedom = = = 
 The Right to Freedom is covered in Articles 19 – 22 , with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the Constitution , and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions . Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights , which are available only to citizens of India . These include the freedom of speech and expression , freedom of assembly without arms , freedom of association , freedom of movement throughout the territory of India , freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practise any profession . All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State , listed under Article 19 itself . The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted , and include national security , public order , decency and morality , contempt of court , incitement to offences , and defamation . The State is also empowered , in the interests of the general public to nationalise any trade , industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens . 
 The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20 – 22 . The scope of these articles , particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process , was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly . It was argued , especially by Benegal Narsing Rau , that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order , and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether . The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase " due process " in favour of " procedure established by law " . As a result , Article 21 , which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law , was , until 1978 , construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action . However , in 1978 , the Supreme Court in the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action , holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just , fair and reasonable , and effectively reading due process into Article 21 . In the same case , the Supreme Court also ruled that " life " under Article 21 meant more than a mere " animal existence " ; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life " meaningful , complete and worth living " . Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood , good health , clean environment , water , speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned . The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Constitutional amendment of 2002 . 
 Article 20 provides protection from conviction for offences in certain respects , including the rights against ex post facto laws , double jeopardy and freedom from self @-@ incrimination . Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons , in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest , consult a lawyer of one 's own choice , be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest , and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate . The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention , subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22 . The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly , and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949 . Article 22 provides that when a person is detained under any law of preventive detention , the State can detain such person without trial for only three months , and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board . The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention , and be permitted to make a representation against it , at the earliest opportunity . 
 = = = Right against Exploitation = = = 
 The Right against Exploitation , contained in Articles 23 – 24 , lays down certain provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society by individuals or the State . Article 23 prohibits human trafficking , making it an offence punishable by law , and also prohibits forced labour or any act of compelling a person to work without wages where he was legally entitled not to work or to receive remuneration for it . However , it permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes , including conscription and community service . The Bonded Labour system ( Abolition ) Act , 1976 , has been enacted by Parliament to give effect to this Article . Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories , mines and other hazardous jobs . Parliament has enacted the Child Labour ( Prohibition and Regulation ) Act , 1986 , providing regulations for the abolition of , and penalties for employing , child labour , as well as provisions for rehabilitation of former child labourers . 
 = = = Right to Freedom of Religion = = = 
 The Right to Freedom of Religion , covered in Articles 25 – 28 , provides religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India . According to the Constitution , there is no official State religion , and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally . Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience and the right to preach , practice and propagate any religion of their choice . This right is , however , subject to public order , morality and health , and the power of the State to take measures for social welfare and reform . The right to propagate , however , does not include the right to convert another individual , since it would amount to an infringement of the other 's right to freedom of conscience . Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects , subject to public order , morality and health , to manage their own affairs in matters of religion , set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes , and own , acquire and manage property in accordance with law . These provisions do not derogate from the State 's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination . The State is also empowered to regulate any economic , political or other secular activity associated with religious practice . Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution . Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State @-@ funded educational institution , and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their ( or their guardian 's ) consent . 
 = = = Cultural and Educational Rights = = = 
 The Cultural and Educational rights , given in Articles 29 and 30 , are measures to protect the rights of cultural , linguistic and religious minorities , by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination . Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language , script culture of its own , the right to conserve and develop the same , and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them . It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State , on the grounds only of religion , race , caste , language or any of them . However , this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes , as well as reservation of up to 50 percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community . 
 Article 30 confers upon all religious and linguistic minorities the right to set up and administer educational institutions of their choice in order to preserve and develop their own culture , and prohibits the State , while granting aid , from discriminating against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a religious or cultural minority . The term " minority " , while not defined in the Constitution , has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean any community which numerically forms less than 50 % of the population of the state in which it seeks to avail the right under Article 30 . In order to claim the right , it is essential that the educational institution must have been established as well as administered by a religious or linguistic minority . Further , the right under Article 30 can be availed of even if the educational institution established does not confine itself to the teaching of the religion or language of the minority concerned , or a majority of students in that institution do not belong to such minority . This right is subject to the power of the State to impose reasonable regulations regarding educational standards , conditions of service of employees , fee structure , and the utilisation of any aid granted by it . 
 = = = Right to Constitutional Remedies = = = 
 The Right to Constitutional Remedies empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement , or protection against infringement , of their Fundamental Rights . Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy , in the form of a Fundamental Right itself , for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights , and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution . The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs , namely habeas corpus , mandamus , prohibition , certiorari and quo warranto , for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights , while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights . The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies , and in case of any violation , award compensation as well to the affected individual . Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation . This right cannot be suspended , except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared . 
 = = Directive Principles of State Policy = = 
 The Directive Principles of State Policy , embodied in Part IV of the Constitution , are directions given to the State to guide the establishment of an economic and social democracy , as proposed by the Preamble . They set forth the humanitarian and socialist instructions that were the aim of social revolution envisaged in India by the Constituent Assembly . The State is expected to keep these principles in mind while framing laws and policies , even though they are non @-@ justiciable in nature . The Directive Principles may be classified under the following categories : ideals that the State ought to strive towards achieving ; directions for the exercise of legislative and executive power ; and rights of the citizens which the State must aim towards securing . 
 Despite being non @-@ justiciable , the Directive Principles act as a check on the State ; theorised as a yardstick in the hands of the electorate and the opposition to measure the performance of a government at the time of an election . Article 37 , while stating that the Directive Principles are not enforceable in any court of law , declares them to be " fundamental to the governance of the country " and imposes an obligation on the State to apply them in matters of legislation . Thus , they serve to emphasis the welfare state model of the Constitution and emphasise the positive duty of the State to promote the welfare of the people by affirming social , economic and political justice , as well as to fight income inequality and ensure individual dignity , as mandated by Article 38 . 
 Article 39 lays down certain principles of policy to be followed by the State , including providing an adequate means of livelihood for all citizens , equal pay for equal work for men and women , proper working conditions , reduction of the concentration of wealth and means of production from the hands of a few , and distribution of community resources to " <unk> the common good " . These clauses highlight the Constitutional objectives of building an egalitarian social order and establishing a welfare state , by bringing about a social revolution assisted by the State , and have been used to support the nationalisation of mineral resources as well as public utilities . Further , several legislation pertaining to agrarian reform and land tenure have been enacted by the federal and state governments , in order to ensure equitable distribution of land resources . 
 Articles 41 – 43 mandate the State to endeavour to secure to all citizens the right to work , a living wage , social security , maternity relief , and a decent standard of living . These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble . Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries , and the federal government has , in furtherance of this , established several Boards for the promotion of khadi , handlooms etc . , in coordination with the state governments . Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities . Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries . The State , under Article 46 , is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation . Several enactments , including two Constitutional amendments , have been passed to give effect to this provision . 
 Article 44 encourages the State to secure a uniform civil code for all citizens , by eliminating discrepancies between various personal laws currently in force in the country . However , this has remained a " dead letter " despite numerous reminders from the Supreme Court to implement the provision . Article 45 originally mandated the State to provide free and compulsory education to children between the ages of six and fourteen years , but after the 86th Amendment in 2002 , this has been converted into a Fundamental Right and replaced by an obligation upon the State to secure childhood care to all children below the age of six . Article 47 commits the State to raise the standard of living and improve public health , and prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs injurious to health . As a consequence , partial or total prohibition has been introduced in several states , but financial constraints have prevented its full @-@ fledged application . The State is also mandated by Article 48 to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines by improving breeds and prohibiting slaughter of cattle . Article 48A mandates the State to protect the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country , while Article 49 places an obligation upon the State to ensure the preservation of monuments and objects of national importance . Article 50 requires the State to ensure the separation of judiciary from executive in public services , in order to ensure judicial independence , and federal legislation has been enacted to achieve this objective . The State , according to Article 51 , must also strive for the promotion of international peace and security , and Parliament has been empowered under Article 253 to make laws giving effect to international treaties . 
 = = Fundamental Duties = = 
 The Fundamental Duties of citizens were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976 , upon the recommendations of the <unk> Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year . Originally ten in number , the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002 , which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years . The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India , including the Constitution , to cherish its heritage , preserve its composite culture and assist in its defense . They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood , protect the environment and public property , develop scientific temper , abjure violence , and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life . Citizens are morally obligated by the Constitution to perform these duties . However , like the Directive Principles , these are non @-@ justifiable , without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non @-@ compliance . There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties . 
 The Fundamental Duties noted in the constitution are as follows : 
 — It shall be the duty of every citizen of India — 
 to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions , the National Flag and the National Anthem ; 
 to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom ; 
 to uphold and protect the sovereignty , unity and integrity of India ; 
 to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so ; 
 to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious , linguistic and regional or sectional diversities ; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women ; 
 to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture ; 
 to protect and improve the natural environment including forests , lakes , rivers and wild life , and to have compassion for living creatures ; 
 to develop the scientific temper , humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform ; 
 to safeguard public property and to abjure violence ; 
 to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement ; 
 who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward , as the case may be , between the age of six and fourteen years 
 = = Criticism and analysis = = 
 Fewer children are now employed in hazardous environments , but their employment in non @-@ hazardous jobs , prevalently as domestic help , violates the spirit of the constitution in the eyes of many critics and human rights advocates . More than 16 @.@ 5 million children are in employment . India was ranked 88 out of 159 countries in 2005 , according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians . The year 1990 – 1991 was declared as the " Year of Social Justice " in the memory of B.R. Ambedkar . The government provides free textbooks to students belonging to scheduled castes and tribes pursuing medicine and engineering courses . During 2002 – 2003 , a sum of Rs . 4 @.@ 77 crore ( 47 @.@ 7 million ) was released for this purpose . In order to protect scheduled castes and tribes from discrimination , the government enacted the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe ( Prevention of Atrocities ) Act , 1989 , prescribing severe punishments for such actions . 
 The Minimum Wages Act of 1948 empowers government to fix minimum wages for people working across the economic spectrum . The Consumer Protection Act of 1986 provides for the better protection of consumers . The Equal Remuneration Act of 1976 provides for equal pay for equal work for both men and women . The <unk> Grameen <unk> Yojana ( Universal Rural Employment Program ) was launched in 2001 to attain the objective of providing gainful employment for the rural poor . The program was implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions . 
 A system of elected village councils , known as Panchayati Raj covers almost all states and territories of India . One @-@ third of the total number of seats have been reserved for women in Panchayats at every level ; and in the case of Bihar , half the seats have been reserved for women . The judiciary has been separated from the executive " in all the states and territories except Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland . " India 's foreign policy has been influenced by the Directive Principles . India supported the United Nations in peace @-@ keeping activities , with the Indian Army having participated in 37 UN peace @-@ keeping operations . 
 The implementation of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties . The Shah Bano case ( 1985 – 86 ) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano , a Muslim woman who had been divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women . This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community , which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women ( Protection of Rights on Divorce ) Act , 1986 overturning the Supreme Court 's verdict . This act provoked further outrage , as jurists , critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities . The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate , with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor implementation of Fundamental Rights . 
 = = Relationship between the Fundamental Rights , Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties = = 
 The Directive Principles have been used to uphold the Constitutional validity of legislations in case of a conflict with the Fundamental Rights . Article 31C , added by the 25th Amendment in 1971 , provided that any law made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Article 39 ( b ) – ( c ) would not be invalid on the grounds that they <unk> from the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14 , 19 and 21 . The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1976 , but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution . The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare . The Supreme Court , after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case , has adopted the view of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles being complementary to each other , each supplementing the other 's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution . Similarly , the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties . These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens , subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law . The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard , with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties . 
 = Earwig = 
 Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found throughout the Americas , Africa , Eurasia , Australia and New Zealand . With about 2 @,@ 000 species in 12 families , they are one of the smaller insect orders . Earwigs have characteristic cerci , a pair of forceps @-@ like pincers on their abdomen , and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings , hence the scientific order name , " skin wings . " Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers . Earwigs rarely use their flying ability . 
 Earwigs are mostly nocturnal and often hide in small , moist crevices during the day , and are active at night , feeding on a wide variety of insects and plants . Damage to foliage , flowers , and various crops is commonly blamed on earwigs , especially the common earwig Forficula <unk> . 
 Earwigs have five molts in the year before they become adults . Many earwig species display maternal care , which is uncommon among insects . Female earwigs may care for their eggs , and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt . As the nymphs molt , sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show . 
 Some earwig specimen fossils are in the extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera , the former dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic . Many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to earwigs , though the <unk> of Grylloblattaria are most likely . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The scientific name for the order , " Dermaptera " , is Greek in origin , stemming from the words <unk> , meaning skin , and pteron ( plural ptera ) , wing . It was coined by Charles De Geer in 1773 . The common term , earwig , is derived from the Old English <unk> , which means " ear " , and <unk> , which means " insect " , or literally , " beetle " . Entomologists suggest that the origin of the name is a reference to the appearance of the hindwings , which are unique and distinctive among insects , and resemble a human ear when unfolded . The name is more popularly thought to be related to the old wives ' tale that earwigs burrowed into the brains of humans through the ear and laid their eggs there . Earwigs are not known to purposefully climb into external ear canals , but there have been anecdotal reports of earwigs being found in the ear . 
 " To earwig " is a slang verb meaning either " to attempt to influence by persistent confidential argument or talk " or " to eavesdrop " . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Earwigs are abundant and can be found throughout the Americas and Eurasia . The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe , but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States . The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine @-@ tailed earwig ( Doru <unk> ) , found as far north as Canada , where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands . However , other families can be found in North America , including Forficulidae ( Doru and Forficula being found there ) , <unk> , Anisolabididae , and Labiduridae . 
 Few earwigs survive winter outdoors in cold climates . They can be found in tight crevices in woodland , fields and gardens . Out of about 1 @,@ 800 species , about 25 occur in North America , 45 in Europe ( including 7 in Great Britain ) , and 60 in Australia . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 Most earwigs are flattened ( which allows them to fit inside tight crevices , such as under bark ) with an elongated body generally 7 – 50 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 28 – 1 @.@ 97 in ) long . The largest certainly extant species is the Australian giant earwig ( <unk> <unk> ) which is approximately 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long , while the possibly extinct Saint Helena earwig ( <unk> <unk> ) reached 78 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) . Earwigs are characterized by the cerci , or the pair of forceps @-@ like pincers on their abdomen ; male earwigs generally have more curved pincers than females . These pincers are used to capture prey , defend themselves and fold their wings under the short tegmina . The antennae are thread @-@ like with at least 10 segments or more . 
 The forewings are short oblong leathery plates used to cover the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle , rather than to fly . Most species have short and leather @-@ like forewings with very thin hindwings , though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina ( epizoic species , sometimes considered as ectoparasites ) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci ( today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera ) . The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan , radiating from one point folded under the forewing . Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight , they are rarely seen in flight . These wings are unique in venation and in the pattern of folding that requires the use of the cerci . 
 = = = Internal = = = 
 The neuroendocrine system is typical of insects . There is a brain , a subesophageal ganglion , three thoracic ganglia , and six abdominal ganglia . Strong neuron connections connect the <unk> corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion , where the closely related median corpus <unk> produces juvenile hormone III in close proximity to the <unk> dorsal <unk> . The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects , consisting of a fore- , mid- , and hindgut , but earwigs lack gastric <unk> which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect . Long , slender ( <unk> ) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut . 
 The reproductive system of females consist of paired ovaries , lateral oviducts , spermatheca , and a genital chamber . The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body , while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored . Unlike other insects , the gonopore , or genital opening is behind the seventh abdominal segment . The ovaries are primitive in that they are <unk> ( the nurse cells and oocytes alternate along the length of the <unk> ) . In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct , while in others , short ovarioles appear around the duct . 
 = = Life cycle and reproduction = = 
 Earwigs are hemimetabolous , meaning they undergo incomplete metamorphosis , developing through a series of 4 to 6 molts . The developmental stages between molts are called instars . Earwigs live for about a year from hatching . They start mating in the autumn , and can be found together in the autumn and winter . The male and female will live in a chamber in debris , crevices , or soil 2 @.@ 5 mm deep . After mating , the sperm may remain in the female for months before the eggs are fertilized . From midwinter to early spring , the male will leave , or be driven out by the female . Afterward the female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in 2 days . Some earwigs , those parasitic in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina , are viviparous ( give birth to live young ) ; they would be fed by a sort of placenta . When first laid , the eggs are white or cream @-@ colored and oval @-@ shaped , but right before hatching they become kidney @-@ shaped and brown . Each egg is approximately 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 in ) tall and 0 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 03 in ) wide . 
 Earwigs are among the few non @-@ social insect species that show maternal care . The mother will pay close attention to the needs of her eggs , such as warmth and protection , though studies have shown that the mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them . The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident , but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent . The mother will also vigorously defend the eggs from predators , not eating unless an egg goes bad . Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi . Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed ; when the eggs were replaced after hatching , the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months . 
 The eggs hatch in about 7 days . The mother may assist the nymphs in hatching . When the nymphs hatch , they eat the egg casing and continue to live with the mother . The nymphs look similar to their parents , only smaller , and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt . The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother , and on their own molts . If the mother dies before the nymphs are ready to leave , the nymphs may eat her . 
 After five to six instars , the nymphs will molt into adults . The male 's forceps will become curved , while the females ' forceps remain straight . They will also develop their natural color , which can be anything from a light brown ( as in the Tawny earwig ) to a dark black ( as in the <unk> earwig ) . In species of winged earwigs , the wings will start to develop at this time . The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices , living in small amounts of debris , in various forms such as bark and fallen logs . Species have been found to be blind and living in caves , or <unk> ; reported to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa . Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter . For protection from predators , the species Doru <unk> of earwigs can squirt foul @-@ smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment . It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen , a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Earwigs are mostly scavengers , but some are omnivorous or predatory . The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular . It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps . The forceps are used for a variety of purposes . In some species , the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey , and in copulation . The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females . 
 The common earwig is an omnivore , eating plants and ripe fruit as well as actively hunting arthropods . To a large extent , this species is also a scavenger , feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance . Observed prey include largely plant lice , but also large insects such as <unk> flies and woolly aphids . Plants that they feed on typically include clover , dahlias , <unk> , butterfly bush , <unk> , lettuce , cauliflower , strawberry , blackberry , sunflowers , celery , peaches , plums , grapes , potatoes , roses , seedling beans and beets , and tender grass shoots and roots ; they have also been known to eat corn silk , damaging the corn . 
 Species of the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina are generally considered epizoic , or living on the outside of other animals , mainly mammals . In the Arixeniina , family <unk> , species of the genus <unk> are normally found deep in the skin folds and gular pouch of Malaysian hairless bulldog bats ( <unk> torquatus ) , apparently feeding on bats ' body or glandular secretions . On the other hand , species in the genus <unk> ( still of the suborder Arixeniina ) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the <unk> arthropods in the bat 's nest , where it has been found . Hemimerina includes <unk> found in the nest of Long @-@ tailed pouch rats ( <unk> ) , and <unk> which are found on Giant <unk> rats . 
 Earwigs are generally nocturnal , and typically hide in small , dark , and often moist areas in the daytime . They can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings . Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free @-@ fall to the ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice . During the summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms . Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight . Some people erroneously believe that earwigs burrow into people 's ears ; that is mostly a myth , although earwigs may crawl into ears and some can bite , as other insects do . Picnic tables , compost and waste bins , patios , lawn furniture , window frames , or anything with minute spaces ( even artichoke blossoms ) can potentially harbour them . 
 = = = Predators and parasites = = = 
 Earwigs are regularly preyed upon by birds , and like many other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals , amphibians , lizards , centipedes , assassin bugs , and spiders . European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs . Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae , or tachinid flies , whose larvae are endoparasites . One species of tachinid fly , <unk> <unk> , has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century . Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs , <unk> pallipes , has shown promise as a biological control agent as well . The common predatory wasp , the yellow jacket ( Vespula <unk> ) , preys upon earwigs when abundant . A small species of roundworm , Mermis nigrescens , is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter . At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order <unk> have been found on earwigs . The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs . A species of <unk> mite , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , are observed on common earwigs , sometimes in great densities ; however , this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation . Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet <unk> mites on European earwigs . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The fossil record of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about 208 million years ago in England and Australia , and comprises about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera . Some of the traits believed by <unk> to belong to modern earwigs are not found in the earliest fossils , but adults had five @-@ segmented tarsi ( the final segment of the leg ) , well developed ovipositors , veined tegmina ( forewings ) and long segmented cerci ; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now . The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the <unk> . These insects , which resemble modern Blattodea , or cockroaches owing to shell @-@ like forewings and the large , unequal anal fan , are known from the Permian of North America , Europe and Australia . There are no fossils from the Triassic when the morphological changes from <unk> to Dermaptera took place . The most likely , and most closely resembling , related order of insects is Grylloblattaria , theorized by Giles in 1963 . However , other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmida , <unk> , Plecoptera , and Dictyoptera . 
 Archidermaptera is believed to be sister to the remaining earwig groups , the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera ( = former suborders Forficulina , Hemimerina , and Arixeniina ) . The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments ( unlike the three found in Neodermaptera ) as well as unsegmented cerci . No fossil Hemimeridae and <unk> are known . Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order , <unk> , <unk> , or Hemimerina . Like most other epizoic species , there is no fossil record , but they are probably no older than late Tertiary .
