 Warren Anderson ( Martin Sheen ) , the CEO of Union Carbide , visits the plant to inspect its functionality , where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant , ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks . Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon ( Mischa Barton ) , a reporter in the Paris Match , and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson . She impersonates the identity of an Associated Press reporter , but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview . Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals . 
 As the date of the disaster nears , Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister . Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards , and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs . Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant 's safety if he wishes to retain his job . Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said , and expresses his fear about the plant 's safety , saying he will return to the rickshaw @-@ pulling business as soon as his sister is married . 
 In order to overcome the increasing revenue loss , the officials shut down the plant , firing most of the workers , including Dilip . The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible . Meanwhile , Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister , and Roy has a final look of the control room . The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows . The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking , and an attempt to contain the leak fails . The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind . Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west , since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged . He meets Dilip , who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding . Meanwhile , the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing . Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant , realising that the plant had been compromised . He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives succumbing to the toxic gas . He carries away his son , paying farewell to his wife 's corpse and flees the slum . 
 As the gas shows its effects , a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning , and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients ' death . Dilip , in the last of his energy , throws away his Union Carbide identity badge , rests his son on the ground and succumbs to the toxic gas . The story jumps to the present day , where a blind boy is holding Dilip 's identity badge , and the film ends with Motwani narrating the words " Whatever may be the cause of the disaster , Carbide never left Bhopal " . A photo montage depicts the aftermath of the disaster , and pictures of the characters and their real @-@ life counterparts

 In 2004 , while reading <unk> <unk> 's book Bhopal : Lessons of a Tragedy , Ravi Kumar got the idea of making a film based on the disaster . The Bhopal disaster is considered the world 's deadliest industrial disaster . Seeing that very few people of the newer generation knew about the disaster , Kumar decided to make a film based on it . He chose several well known actors for the film because he felt that this provided more chances of showing the " story to the world . " He wanted to cast Sheen for the role of Anderson , because of his political views and acting skills . Tannishtha Chatterjee and Rajpal Yadav were also cast for the film . Sienna Miller was previously attached to the project , but later dropped out and her role was given to Mischa Barton . In December 2008 , it was confirmed that Barton , Martin Sheen and Kal Penn were filming in India for the project . A copy of the script was sent to Penn , who agreed to join the project . Penn played the role of an Indian journalist and learnt Hindi from an instructor . In January 2009 the film 's shooting was wrapped up . Initially , the film 's story was written like a thriller and then dramatic elements were added to the film . Kumar wanted to depict Anderson as a victim of organisational error of judgement but Sheen insisted that Anderson should be depicted as a guilty and so he rewrote some of the scenes . Made on a total budget of US $ 12 million , the film was shot in Hyderabad 's Charminar area and Golconda Fort , Mumbai and the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal during a course of 18 months . A few scenes were also shot in Los Angeles . Hyderabad was chosen since it bore great resemblance to Bhopal in terms of its Mughal influence and architecture . Only a few important scenes were shot in Bhopal while the majority were shot on different factory locations and sets in order to create the setup for the period . 
 The script was jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller . In order to present the correct technical and medical facts in the film , Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings , forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant . Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting for the rights of the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film 's screening , called it an insult to the victims , blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster , diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so . Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson . Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script . He added that making the film was a life @-@ changing experience for him . A Prayer for Rain was added to the film 's title because had it rained on the night of 2 — 3 December 1984 , fewer people would have died . 
 On 7 January 2009 , Barton was questioned by the Indian media on why she chose to sign on the project to which she responded " I 'm interested in all kinds of things , I did this film for moral reasons . Also , I felt the story needed to be told , I feel that this is going to be an important film . " Benjamin Wallfisch , an Emmy and Ivor Novello @-@ nominated composer , composed music for the movie Bhopal : A Prayer for Rain . The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release . On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster , Shivraj Singh Chauhan , the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film 's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film 's earning . Chauhan called the film " very sensitive " and praised the " heart @-@ rending " performance given by actors . To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film 's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal <unk> and the online shopping website Snapdeal . As part of the partnership <unk> and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims .

 The first look of the movie was unveiled on 18 September 2014 and the official trailer was released on the following day . Sheen felt that finding a theatrical release for the film would be difficult . He said that the film portrayed " America 's cultural arrogance . " Director Ravi Kumar opined that Anderson was guilty of the disaster . While promoting the film in New Delhi , he compared it to Titanic and said that the film " is realistic and poignant , but entertaining . " Rajpal Yadav termed it the biggest project of his life and dedicated his role to the victims of the disaster . 
 The film was screened in Cannes , France , Pan Asia Film Festival in London , Dingle Film Festival and the Tokyo International Film Festival . The distributors advised director Kumar to remove a scene which they considered to be too dramatic for the western audiences . A private screening for a youth assembly was held at the United Nations . Revolver Entertainment acquired the distributor rights of the film for North American region in September 2014 . The worldwide sales rights were acquired by GFM Films . The film 's United States release was scheduled for 7 November 2014 . A special screening of the film was held in New York on 18 September . Another special screening was conducted in Bhopal just prior to the release . It was attended by many well known actors of the Hindi film industry . The film opened in New York on 7 November , Los Angeles on 14 November and in India on 5 December 2014 . Reportedly , Kumar had insured the film against libel for an undisclosed amount . Bhopal @-@ based journalist Rajkumar Keswani wanted to sue the film producers for portraying him as a " salacious gossip columnist " before his lawyer advised him to watch the film first . He had seen the film 's original script in which Penn 's character was named Keswani . Inspired by the film , musician Sting collaborated with Anoushka Shankar to record a song . Kumar also confirmed their collaboration .

 Meena Iyer of The Times of India praised the actors and noted that despite being based on true incidents the film " [ managed ] to connect emotionally " . In her review for Hindustan Times , Sweta Kaushal wrote that director Ravi Kumar " should be congratulated for picking a rather grave subject " and praised the actors for doing justice to their respective characters . However , she felt that in portraying Dilip , Kumar took away the " severity of the issue " and that he did not put " the blame on anyone " . Further , she opined that the film had depicted Anderson " as a rather humanist [ person ] " . She concluded that better research should have been done and that the film " could have been a more involving story " . While Kaushal felt that Barton 's role was unnecessary , Anuj Kumar of The Hindu suggested that this role was planted in the story to provide Warren Anderson a chance to express his views . Kumar praised Yadav 's acting by calling him the " face of the tragedy . " He also praised Sheen but felt that Penn looked " out of place in the <unk> surroundings . " Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express noted that Chatterjee was effective in her role . India Today 's Rohit Khilnani praised the director for " [ capturing ] everything that [ the ] drama needed " . However , he felt that the overall quality of the film could have been better . 
 Bryan Durham of Daily News and Analysis praised the actors , particularly Martin Sheen , the costumes and sets used for the film . He considered Barton 's character and Hinglish unnecessary . He also questioned how Rajpal 's character was able to live for a longer period of time than others who were exposed to the gas , and how the doctor and nurses survived the whole disaster . He concluded that " the film takes [ the ] viewer for granted in places . " Durham noted that the film had " its heart in the right place . " Prasanna D. <unk> of Rediff.com called Bhopal : A Prayer for Rain an " honest yet haunting film " and appreciated Anil <unk> ’ s cinematography . Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN praised Yadav , Sheen and Chatterjee for their acting . He criticised the film for its dialogues and Mischa Barton 's role . He further noted that there was " a sense of drama in the final moments " but the film " has few moments that are extraordinary or even genuinely moving . " 
 Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the " cautionary tale could not be more relevant . " Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post wrote that despite the terrible finale , the " movie never feels as powerful as it should . " She felt that the dialogue , acting and music tended to be melodramatic but " the overt heartstring @-@ pulling doesn ’ t add much . " In his review for The Hollywood Reporter , Frank Scheck praised Sheen 's portrayal of Anderson and the visuals of the leakage but felt that the film is " slack in its tension " . Writing for The New York Times , Ben Kenigsberg noted that the film " mines every chemical drip and gurgle for suspense . " Rotten Tomatoes , a review aggregator , rated it 58 % fresh based on a total of 12 critic reviews while the public audience gave the film a rating of 80 % fresh .

 = Heritage preservation in South Korea = 
 The heritage preservation system of South Korea is a multi @-@ level program aiming to preserve and cultivate Korean cultural heritage . The program is administered by the Cultural Heritage Administration ( CHA ; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and the legal framework is provided by the Cultural Heritage Protection Act of 1962 , last updated in 2012 . The program started in 1962 and has gradually been extended and upgraded since then . 
 The CHA classifies cultural heritage into five major categories ( state @-@ designated heritage , city and province @-@ designated heritage , cultural heritage material , registered cultural heritage , undesignated cultural heritage ) and these are divided further into subcategories . Besides tangible cultural heritage , South Korea aims to preserve its intangible cultural heritage as well , including folk customs , music , dance and handicraft . The program also includes " living national treasures " – people who possess the knowledge and skills important to pass down intangible cultural heritage to new generations . South Korea has founded several educational centers throughout the country and established a university , specifically dedicated to heritage preservation . 
 Some of the heritage properties of South Korea has been inscribed into various UNESCO lists . As of 2014 , the country has nine cultural and one natural World Heritage Sites , with 15 added to the provisional list ; and there are 17 items registered as UNESCO intangible cultural heritage . 
 Although the program is considered successful by both the public and experts , there are unresolved issues regarding the system and particularly the selection method of " living national treasure " holders . 
 = = The Cultural Heritage Administration = = 
 The program is administered by the Cultural Heritage Administration ( CHA ; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , the predecessor of which was founded in 1945 by the American military government of Korea . It first belonged to the Ministry of Education , then to the Ministry of Culture . Between 1999 and 2004 it functioned as an independent agency . The CHA administers the National Palace Museum of Korea as well as various ' palace offices ' and ' shrine offices ' . It is also responsible for the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty , which are part of the UNESCO World Heritage . 
 The CHA established Korea National University of Cultural Heritage in 2000 , which specifically educates professionals for heritage preservation . Since 1999 the South Korean government founded 27 educational centers for cultivating intangible cultural heritage . The administrator of CHA is <unk> <unk> , professor of history at Korea University . The annual budget of the administration was 615 billion won in 2012 . 
 The legal framework for the heritage program is provided by the Cultural Heritage Protection Act of 1962 ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , last updated in 2012 . 
 = = History = = 
 The legal framework of cultural heritage preservation is based on the number 961 Law of 1962 ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , which in turn is based on the similar Japanese act of 1950 . The Korean act is broader in scope , also extending to folklore . The act was amended in 1970 not only to include people ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> , " human cultural heritage " ) but also to support them financially . 
 At the beginning of the program , after the Korean War , the CHA had little means to operate . Go <unk> ( <unk> ) , the administrator of CHA between 1961 and 1968 set out to search for intangible cultural properties on the basis of a series of articles written by Yae <unk> ( <unk> ) for <unk> Ilbo , as the reporter spent years in exploring the country and interviewing old masters of handicraft . The first items to be inscribed on the intangible heritage list were thus taken from Yae 's articles . Others were added based on the opinions of researchers and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions . The recommendation of local administrations was also sought . 
 Korea introduced a unique system in the 1970s to preserve folk traditions ( including handicraft , arts , folk songs , folk dances , theatre , traditional food preparation techniques , etc . ) . This was triggered by a movement called New Community , aiming to modernize life in the countryside . In an attempt to get rid of old superstitions , the movement advocated cutting down the old <unk> trees often found at village entrances , as they were believed to be ' protectors ' of the village according to tradition . In 1971 , the songs of the <unk> , or " sea women " of Jeju Island were declared provincial intangible cultural properties . 
 Major stakeholders of the intangible heritage program are " living national treasures " or officially called " holders " ( <unk> <unk> ) , people who possess knowledge or skills essential for preserving Korean culture . Some of these ' holders ' obtained significant national exposure or fame , for example Han <unk> ( <unk> ) , a holder for the Korean royal court cuisine who supervises the authentic presentation of Joseon Dynasty food in historical movies and television series . 
 The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage took place in 2003 and South Korea joined the program a year later . In 2005 China declared some 1200 properties as intangible cultural heritage , with 16 items belonging to the Korean minority of the country , including the traditional wedding ceremony , Arirang ( a folk song ) and <unk> ( a traditional seesaw game ) . The CHA decided that they also had to broaden the scope of intangible heritage to properties that do not have any designated ' holders ' , like kimchi , <unk> or Goryeo ginseng . 
 The CHA plans to open its World Intangible Heritage Complex in Jeonju , which will also function as a national centre . The complex will have an area of 59 @,@ 930 square metres ( 645 @,@ 100 sq ft ) and is being constructed from 66 million USD .

 The cultural heritage program of South Korea is generally considered a success both by academics and the public , however , a few issues remain to be addressed . One of them is the selection process of the " holders " , as the prestige and state support of the position creates high competition between folk artists to be selected . According to Choi Sung @-@ ja , a member of the Intangible Cultural Heritage Subcommittee , the intangible cultural heritage program should not be tied exclusively to the existence of " holders " , and a less subjective selection process should be introduced . Since 2009 the CHA changed its selection process by involving academic professionals to introduce a more objective evaluation system of " holders " . 
 Changes in society also brought challenges to the program . For example , in the 1990s Christian groups started to question the need to classify shamanistic rituals as cultural heritage . Patriarchal lifestyle , where the man is the main provider of the family and women stay at home , also influenced " holders " , as housewives started to pick up the preservation of folk traditions also in areas that were previously dominated by men . The government resisted appointing female holders for such predominantly male traditions but was gradually forced to acknowledge them when there were no male practitioners at all , or where the women were significantly more talented than the men . 
 According to Roald <unk> of The Australian National University , the program faces challenges from the Korean Wave , as well . As Korean culture is becoming more popular worldwide , due to the influence of television series and K @-@ pop , South Korea started to use its culture as a means of soft power , involving its cultural heritage , too . <unk> thinks that 
 " ... a society ’ s image abroad is not shaped entirely by cultural activities . It is , instead , shaped by the combined total of what people abroad see and hear , and what they know about aspects they consider important , whether those are positive or not . [ ... ] Even a society that cares greatly for its people and its heritage may not have a very positive image abroad , and vice versa . South Korea cannot control what people abroad will come to understand about its society and culture either .

 = = Production = = 
 " Debasement Tapes " was written by John Enbom and directed by supervising producer Dan Etheridge , marking Enbom 's seventeenth and final writing credit for the show and Etheridge 's first and only directing credit for the series . The episode guest stars actor Paul Rudd as former rock star Desmond Fellows . During casting of the character of Vinnie Van Lowe , Rudd was considered to play the part ; however , the role was given instead to Ken Marino , who appears in the episode . Marino and Rudd are friends in real life . Rudd was a friend of Enbom and Etheridge , and he had been signed on to appear in the episode by the airing of " Spit & Eggs " . They had lobbied Rudd to come on the show for several years . Thomas described the reason for Rudd not appearing earlier being that the crew were unable to find a good moment for the character 's entry that worked with Rudd 's schedule . 
 Series creator Rob Thomas thought that the character would be a perfect role for Rudd , stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom . However , Thomas did not release any details about Rudd 's plot line in the episode before its airing . Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O 'Toole . In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond , the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed , leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later . Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present . 
 The scene in which Desmond goes nude swimming was not included in the same form in Etheridge 's version of the episode ; however , Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more , so he put it in the final cut . Because the show could not show full nudity , they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh @-@ colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed . The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics , with Rudd 's performance and the various subplots being generally well @-@ received , although some disliked the main mystery . Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode a 7 @.@ 8 out of 10 , indicating that it was " good " . He generally praised Rudd 's performance and the case @-@ of @-@ the week , but he was critical of its ending , stating that " after last week , it was a bit too much of another ' and that 's one to grow on ' conclusion . " He was also mixed towards the episode 's subplots , enjoying Mac 's romantic storyline but disliking Logan 's continued interest in Veronica . He also referred to Vinnie running for Sheriff as " a bit ridiculous " . Reviewer Alan Sepinwall , on his blog What 's Alan Watching ? , lauded the episode , particularly Rudd 's performance . He stated that Rudd , despite playing a stock character , " made me feel like I hadn 't seen it a thousand times before . " He also enjoyed the pairing of Mac and Max , while he believed that the impact of Vinnie and Leo 's reappearances was blunted by the knowledge that the show would likely not return for a fourth season . Television Without Pity graded the episode a " B " . 
 The Los Angeles Times praised Rudd 's performance while criticizing his storyline and the mystery @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week . While stating that Kristen Bell is usually the scene stealer , the reviewer thought that Rudd took on that role in this episode . However , the reviewer called his mystery " an excuse just to get Rudd on the screen . " Missy Schwartz of Entertainment Weekly was also positive towards the episode particularly Rudd 's performance and the episode 's subplots . While criticizing the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week 's ending as anticlimactic , she thought that Rudd 's singing was better than expected . The reviewer also lauded the comedic portions of the subplots , particularly the scene in which Dick compares himself to a lion and Mac and Veronica compare their romantic interests to cafeteria food . Brill Bundy of Zap2it was mostly positive towards the episode , particularly praising Rudd 's comedic timing and the episode 's use of supporting series regulars such as Mac and Piz . He also commented positively on the development of the romantic storyline between Piz and Veronica , stating that it was realistic . However , the reviewer did not think that the mystery involving Rudd 's character was necessary and that it would have been better to not have a mystery at all . 
 Stereogum referred to the opening scene of the episode as " Rudd generally being awesome . " Cortney Martin , writing for the Houston Chronicle , was mixed overall . While being complimentary towards Rudd 's performance and Greenfield 's reappearance , the reviewer disliked the mystery of Desmond 's missing tapes , stating , " the mystery of the week turns out to be the lamest non @-@ mystery of the show 's entire run , I think . " The reviewer opined that the subplot involving the Fitzpatricks was boring but that Marino 's reappearance was a good surprise . Brian Raftery of Idolator believed that Rudd 's character could have been based on a number of different real @-@ life figures but guessed Courtney Love and Matthew Sweet as potential influences . 
 Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode as the best of the season so far . He lauded the development of the romantic storylines of both Veronica and Mac , while stating that Veronica 's was more realistic , describing the concert scene in which Veronica and Piz hold hands again was genuinely emotional . He also stated that Rudd " changes Fellows from a painful stereotype into a pantheon one @-@ off character . " The reviewer also opined that the episode 's combination of Rudd and the subplot involving Logan and Mac created a very entertaining episode that was exemplary of how well the new story structure could work . 
 = The Boat Race 1971 = 
 The 117th Boat Race took place on 27 March 1971 . Held annually , it is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . It was won by Cambridge who passed the finishing post ten lengths ahead of Oxford , securing Cambridge 's fourth consecutive victory . The winning time was , at that point , the second fastest in the history of the event . 
 In the reserve race , Goldie beat Isis , and in the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge were victorious . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities , followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Oxford by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in the previous year 's race , and held the overall lead , with 64 victories to Oxford 's 51 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 Cambridge coach Lou Barry was aiming to lead the Light Blues to victory for the fourth consecutive time under his guidance , while Oxford were coached by their former Blue , Ronnie Howard , who represented the university in the 1957 and 1959 races . The race was umpired by the former Oxford and Olympic rower Chris Davidge who had represented the Dark Blues in the 1949 , 1951 and 1952 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 13 st 8 lb ( 86 @.@ 0 kg ) , 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge saw the return of four former Blues in Chris Baillieu , James Hervey @-@ Bathurst , Christopher Rodrigues and N. G. Hughes , all of whom had made they Boat Race debut in the 1970 race . Oxford welcomed back A. J. Hall , J. Hawksley and F. J. L. Dale , the latter rowing in his third Boat Race for the Dark Blues . Cambridge 's American number seven , Somerset Waters III , was the only non @-@ British rower recorded in the race . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge were pre @-@ race favourites , according to Jim Railton writing in The Times , they were " the strongest favourites for many years " . They won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , consigning Oxford to Middlesex , from which the losers of the last ten consecutive races had commenced . After a good start , and despite a " desperate attack " from the Dark Blues , Cambridge were three seconds ahead at the Mile Post . The Light Blues were clear soon after and by the time the crews shot Hammersmith Bridge , they held a three length , ten @-@ second lead over Oxford . By Chiswick Steps , the lead had extended out to 18 seconds ; Oxford trailed by 26 seconds at Barnes Bridge and could make no ground on Cambridge as they passed the finishing post ten lengths clear . The winning time of 17 minutes 58 seconds was the second fastest in the history of the event , behind that of the Cambridge crew of the 1948 race who recorded a time eight seconds faster . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis by fifteen lengths , their fifth consecutive victory . In the 26th running of the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge triumphed , their ninth consecutive victory . 
 = Archaeomarasmius = 
 Archaeomarasmius is an extinct genus of gilled fungus in the Agaricales family Tricholomataceae , containing the single species Archaeomarasmius leggetti . It is known from two fruit bodies recovered from amber , one consisting of a complete cap with a broken stem , the other consisting of a fragment of a cap . The cap has a diameter ranging from 3 @.@ 2 to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 13 to 0 @.@ 24 in ) , while the stem is 0 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 in ) thick . Spores were also recovered from the amber , and are broadly ellipsoid to egg @-@ shaped , measuring roughly 7 @.@ 3 by 4 @.@ 7 μm . The species , which resembles the extant genera Marasmius and Marasmiellus , is inferred to have been saprobic on plant litter or other forest debris . 
 The genus is solely known from the New Jersey amber deposits along the Atlantic coastal plain in New Jersey , United States , which date from the Turonian stage ( about 90 – 94 Mya ) of the Upper Cretaceous . Archaeomarasmius is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in the fossil record , and the only one to be described from New Jersey amber . 
 = = History and classification = = 
 The genus is known only from the two holotype fossils , a fruit body ( or mushroom ) and a fragment of a mushroom , both currently residing in the American Museum of Natural History . The specimens , collected in November 1994 from the area of East Brunswick , New Jersey , by G.R. Case , P.D. Borodin , and J.J. Leggett , were found as a single clear yellow amber nodule 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter . The specimen was found above the South Amboy Fire Clay , part of the Raritan Formation , suggesting that it is Turonian in age ( Upper Cretaceous , about 90 to 94 million years ago ) . Due to weathering , the amber specimen AMNH NJ @-@ 90 fractured into a number of chips along fractures and flow lines . The chips with the holotype specimens , AMNH NJ @-@ 90Y and AMNH NJ @-@ 90Z , were first studied by a group of researchers consisting of David Hibbett and Michael Donoghue from Harvard University with David Grimaldi of the AMNH . Hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in the American Journal of Botany . The generic epithet Archaeomarasmius is a combination of the Greek <unk> meaning " ancient " and " Marasmius " , a modern genus which it resembles . The specific epithet " leggetti " was coined by the authors in honor of J.J. Leggett and company , who first discovered the amber nodule and donated it to the AMNH . 
 When first reported , Archaeomarasmius leggetti was the second extinct species of agaric fungus to be described , and it is the only species to be known from the New Jersey amber . Three species , <unk> <unk> , Coprinites dominicana and Protomycena electra , have been described from the Miocene Dominican amber found in the Dominican Republic . The extinct Agaricomycetes species <unk> <unk> , found in marine calcareous concretions on Vancouver Island , Canada , and dating to about 130 – 125 Mya , is probably in the <unk> or the <unk> . In 2007 , another agaric was reported , <unk> antiquus , found in Early Cretaceous Burmese amber ( about 100 Mya ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The holotypes of Archaeomarasmius consist of mushrooms and associated basidiospores . Specimen AMNH NJ @-@ 90Y is a nearly complete mushroom , broken off near the base of the stipe ( stem ) . The pileus ( cap ) is up to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) in diameter and has a convex shape sporting an umbo ( a broad raised central region ) . The mushroom is a medium @-@ dark brown color with thin , minutely textured flesh and an incurved margin . The lamellae or gills are distantly spaced , with 12 gills extending fully from the cap edge to the stipe , and lack lamellulae ( short gills which do not reach the stipe from the edge of the pileus ) . The pileus is centered on the stipe , which is 0 @.@ 5 by 2 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 020 by 0 @.@ 087 in ) long and is broken off above the base . The stipe lacks a veil and is smooth and cylindrical . The top of the pileus is exposed on a fracture plain , and to prevent oxidation , the area was coated in a fine layer of synthetic resin , which also resulted in slightly improved visibility of the mushroom . 
 Specimen AMNH NJ @-@ 90Z is a small wedge @-@ shaped fragment of pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study , splitting it in half . Though the researchers had not intended to perform destructive analysis on the sample , this fracturing warranted the sacrifice of some parts of the specimen for structural and molecular study . Small pieces of the specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) stubs and sputter coated with a gold / palladium alloy . The resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained , and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen . Another sample of the specimen was mounted in <unk> 's resin ( an embedding medium used in electron microscopy ) and sectioned with a diamond knife ; the resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The lack of discernible biological material from the mushroom seen in the SEM study was confirmed in the TEM analysis . A final section of the fossil was selected to attempt DNA sequencing . A small sample of the fossil was extracted at the AMNH and sent to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology for DNA amplification . None of the three selected extracts showed any results after the amplification was attempted . It is possible that the fractures and <unk> which split AMNH NJ @-@ 90Z during initial preparation had already penetrated into the fossil and destroyed the hermetic seal which would have been needed for preserving the organic matter of the mushroom . 
 The basidiospores recovered with the fruiting body were examined during the SEM study . The spores showed considerable damage from both the fossilization process and the subsequent weathering and specimen collection . They also displayed distinct halos in the amber , possibly from gas or liquid leaching out , or a reaction in the spores that prevented the resin from turning to amber . Even so , enough remained to make some observations about spore morphology . The basidiospores are broadly elliptic to oval , measuring approximately 7 @.@ 3 by 4 @.@ 7 μm , and each shows a distinct hilar appendage . 
 The combined characters of Archaeomarasmius indicate a relation to the modern family Tricholomataceae , with a close similarity to the genera Marasmius and Marasmiellus . Both genera are noted for <unk> , toughening and drying , rather than <unk> . This property would increase the chances of a mushroom becoming entombed in amber . However , a number of other species are also possible close relatives of Archaeomarasmius , mostly in Tricholomataceae , although some species in the family Strophariaceae are also <unk> . The authors suggest it may also be appropriate to classify Archaeomarasmius more conservatively as incertae sedis ( of uncertain placement ) within the <unk> , Agaricales , or <unk> . 
 = = Associated inclusions = = 
 The amber specimen " AMNH NJ @-@ 90 " , which preserved the two holotypes , also preserved a number of other inclusions that give indications as to what the ecology of Archaeomarasmius may have been . Of the approximately forty insect inclusions present , flies in the families Ceratopogonidae and Chironomidae , together with caddisflies of the order Trichoptera , suggest that the mushroom was growing near fresh water . Beetles from the family <unk> , a termite and a <unk> , in addition to the mushroom , are indicators of rotting wood , probably from a tree in the Cupressaceae family . Modern Marasmiaceae members are saprobic — obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter — and specimens included with Archaeomarasmius indicate a similar habit for the mushroom . 
 = Battle of the Narrow Seas = 
 The Battle of the Narrow Seas , also known as the Battle of the Goodwin Sands or Battle of the Dover Straits was a naval engagement that took place on the 3 – 4 October 1602 during the Anglo @-@ Spanish War of 1585 and part of the Dutch Revolt . An English fleet under Sir Robert Mansell intercepted and attacked six Spanish galleys under the command of Federico Spinola ; in the Dover Straits and was fought all the way off from the coast of England and finally off the Spanish Netherlands . The English were soon joined by a Dutch fleet under Jan <unk> Cant and they completed the destruction . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1602 Frederico Spinola , younger brother of Ambrogio Spinola had distinguished himself greatly as a soldier in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested ; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale . Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain , the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley @-@ borne invasion of England from Flanders . However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys , provided at Spinola 's expense . He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at <unk> Bay which cost him two galleys . 
 After this defeat Spinola took his remaining six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders . During the sailing to Flanders he took an English ship , which he left at A Coruña . At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1 @,@ 600 men . In England word had spread that Spinola was on his way in an attempt to run the English channel again . His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys , of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October . Queen Elizabeth decided to act , so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis , to see what they could do to impeach them . Meanwhile , the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice @-@ Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain , Spinola had already escaped to the north . Van Duyvenvoorde , coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself , sent four of his ships back north under Jan <unk> Cant , known by the English as Jan van Cant . 
 = = Engagement = = 
 Mansell , with three ships ( the 30 gun Hope along with the 42 gun Victory and the Answer ) departed and patrolled about Dungeness . Mansell 's flag captain came up with the strategy on how to tackle Spinola ; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast . Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using <unk> so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice @-@ Admiral Jan Cant . On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch <unk> , Samson , and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap . 
 = = = Action with the English = = = 
 In the moonlight of 3 October just before midnight Mansell was on the lookout for Spinola 's galleys and were soon sighted . Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness ; Moon , Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys . Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round to face the South East , the direction of the Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship San Felipe ( St. Philip ) ran straight into the Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further East . 
 What happened when the Spanish galleys came under fire of the English ships differs depending on sources : from one side it is asserted that the San Felipe was nearly battered into submission by Victory 's guns and she was only able to escape when the other galleys came up in support drawing Victory 's and Hopes fire . On the other hand , it is also claimed that Spinola 's galleys succeeded in passing almost unscathed between the English ships by rowing at full strength . Mansell decided on creating as much damage as possible ; instead of concentrating on one galley , fire was switched from one target to another and as a result be believed that damage was inflicted on most of the galleys they saw in the moonlight . By the time they reached Goodwin Sands the Spanish galleys started to retreat in desperation for the Flemish coast . A gale was now blowing strongly from the West which also hampered Spanish attempts and they were hotly pursued by the English ships and soon the gunfire warnings were signals for the Dutch to engage . 
 = = = Dutch join the attack = = = 
 The action continued across the Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk , Nieuwpoort , Gravelines and Sluis . The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon cut off the Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere . The States ' ship Mackerel ( <unk> ) , came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe , pouring in a broadside . Drawing off from this assailant , the galley found herself close to Vice @-@ Admiral Cant 's Half Moon ( Halve <unk> ) . The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results . The Halve <unk> bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop . Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist . Another State 's <unk> bore down to complete the work ; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves , sailors , and soldiers . 
 The Lucera , trying the same evasive tactic , was the next galley attacked ; a Dutch <unk> , which drove under full sail managed to ram her . The galley was struck between the mainmast and stern , with a blow which carried away the assailant 's own bowsprit , but in return completely demolished the stern of the galley . Vice @-@ Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half @-@ moon , and finished Lucera ( Morning Star ) off by ramming , tearing the galley apart . Meanwhile , Victory and two States ' <unk> were chasing two galleys ; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state . With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them , the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort . In the end , both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of <unk> . Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais . The galley San Luis , which bore Spinola himself and his thirty @-@ six pay chests , attempted to reach Dunkirk , but as the tide was low , she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank . Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis , but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk . With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola 's escape . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Casualties were exceptionally heavy for the Spanish ; as two galleys sank with all hands , with perhaps over 2 @,@ 000 were killed wounded or captured . At Calais the wrecked galley was chopped up and used as firewood by the French , the Spanish crew were interned and the galley slaves freed . Casualties for the Dutch and English were light with some ships suffering no casualties at all . Two Dutch ships were damaged in the ramming that took place and but the rest of the Dutch ships suffered only minor damage . The English ships suffered no damage at all except for a broken mast on Samson due to the gale . The battle clearly showed the difference between galleons and galleys , the transition in warfare , along with the introduction of much cheaper cast iron guns in the 1580s , proved the " death knell " for the war galley as a significant military vessel . 
 Mansell was rewarded for his part in the victory and was named Vice @-@ Admiral of the Narrow Seas in commemoration of the name of the battle . Van Duyvenvoorde and Cant both received honorary golden chains from the States of Holland . As for Spinola , he managed to save half of the galleys , as the two which had reached Nieuwpoort were soon able to join San Luis in Dunkirk . From there , the three ships sailed unmolested to Sluis , where Spinola with his five galleys still possessed a threat to the English and Dutch shipping . Both the English and the Dutch were gradually able to gain supremacy in the seas not just in and around the English Channel but in all the European waters . As a result , Spinola would be defeated again and mortally wounded at the Battle of Sluys by the blockading Dutch forces in an attempt to escape . Spinola 's death and the subsequent surrender of Sluis to the Dutch in 1604 ended his and Philip III 's dreams , and English fears , of a galley @-@ borne invasion of England from Flanders . 
 = The Crescent , Taunton = 
 The Crescent is a street in Taunton , a town in the English county of Somerset . Construction began in 1807 , during a period of extensive redevelopment in the town , driven by the Market House Society and the Member of Parliament Sir Benjamin Hammet . Lined on the eastern side by a Georgian terrace , the street follows a shallow crescent shape , broken in the middle by Crescent Way and a bit further south by St George 's Place . It links Upper High Street , at its southern end , with Park Street and Tower Street to the north . On the western side , Somerset County Council have their offices in the County Hall , erected in 1935 , and extended in the 1960s . The Georgian terrace , the Masonic Hall , and the County Hall are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as listed buildings . 
 = = History = = 
 During the 17th and 18th centuries Taunton suffered , first due to the Civil War ( 1642 – 1651 ) , during which two thirds of the town was burnt down , and then the decline of the cloth industry upon which the town 's economy relied . In the late 18th century , the Taunton Market House Society formed with the aim of improving Taunton town centre , most notably the Market House . Benjamin Hammet , a prominent member of the society , was elected as a Member of Parliament for Taunton in 1782 , and tried to start clearing the slums in the town centre . In 1770 , the old Market House was knocked down and replaced , and less than ten years later , Hammet Street was built , to connect the Market square with the Church of St Mary Magdalene . 
 The Crescent formed part of Hammet 's plan for Taunton . It was built to the north of Upper High Street , in what was known at the time as Paul 's Field . It follows a shallow crescent shape , which Nikolaus Pevsner notes is " hardly noticeable " . Although Hammet died in 1800 , the foundation stone was placed in 1807 by William Kinglake , as part of a ceremony that was attended by " an immense number of persons . " The Monthly Magazine noted that the street was intended to add to the " ornament , respectability , and advantage " of Taunton , while the Taunton Courier reported that the houses were intended for " genteel families " . 
 When the street was built , each end featured a cottage with high iron gates which limited traffic to residents and their visitors . The footpaths were less restricted , but featured " three or four posts between which a corpulent person had difficulty in squeezing . " These gates and posts have since been removed . The Crescent comprised a terrace of houses along the street 's eastern side ; the other side was not built on and was eventually converted into parkland . In 1822 , a Catholic chapel , known as St George 's Chapel was built at the southern @-@ end of the terrace , the first Catholic church built in Taunton since the Reformation . The Catholic congregation moved out to a larger church in 1878 and the chapel was bought by the Freemasons , who converted it into a Masonic Lodge . 
 In 1935 , County Hall was built on the open side of The Crescent , providing Somerset County Council with more space than their previous offices at Shire Hall . Early plans for further buildings at the site did not come to fruition , but County Hall was extended in the 1960s to cover most of the open land in front of The Crescent .. Despite the work done by Hammet , the area between The Crescent and the High Street was still considered a slum until it was redeveloped around the Second World War . During this period , the General Post Office ( GPO ) built " Telephone House " , a telephone exchange and office building , replacing the houses in the middle of the terrace . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 On the eastern side of The Crescent , a Georgian terrace was erected in 1807 . Built of " pinkish @-@ brown " brick , each house is of three @-@ storeys plus a basement , and is two windows across . The houses are split by plain pilasters and topped with hipped slate roofs . While the first and second storey windows are rectangular , those on the ground floor are round @-@ headed , as are the doorways . The first floor windows have small , circular segmental balconies . A variety of six- and eight @-@ panel doors are reached by climbing a small flight of steps , and the entire terrace is fronted with railings . This terrace forms two separate listed building designations from Historic England ; numbers 1 – 11 and 15 – 20 , both of which are Grade II * listed . 
 The terrace was later split , and is intersected by Crescent Way , which leads to the Crescent car park . On the southern side of Crescent Way , the northern end of the terrace formed by numbers 15 – 20 , is Exchange House , the former GPO Telephone House . According to Pevsner , this building breaks the modesty of the street , with " its thick @-@ set Tuscan porch " . At the southern end of the same terrace is the Masonic Hall , another Grade II * listed building , which forms the end of the terrace , and features a series of prominent Ionic pilasters along the front and southern end . 
 A further terrace to the south of the Masonic Hall is split from the hall by St George 's Place . It is formed of numbers 21 to 23 The Crescent , and number 42 Upper High Street .

 = Andover F.C. = 
 Andover F.C. was a football club based in Andover , Hampshire , established in 1883 . Since the 2007 – 08 season , Andover had been a member of the Southern League Division One South and West at Step 4 of the National League System ( i.e. four divisions below the English Football League ) . The club played at this level for 29 of its 128 years of existence , and played its thousandth game in this league in 2008 . Compared with earlier periods , the ten years from 1998 to 2008 were relatively successful for Andover , seeing them win a number of league and cup honours as well as registering their biggest ever win . 
 In the 2010 – 11 season , the club finished twenty @-@ first out of twenty @-@ one teams , and was dissolved in July 2011 due to continuing financial constraints . In a statement announcing the matter , club secretary Graham Cousins expressed a hope that the club could " be resurrected to play at a more appropriate level " in the future . A new club , Andover Lions F.C. was subsequently formed and play in the Hampshire Premier League .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Andover Football Club was formed in 1883 and played their first game on 27 October at Stride 's Field , <unk> Road , a friendly match against Basingstoke Mechanical Engineers . Three years later they moved to the Walled Meadow , where they played their home matches for the next 96 years . For most of the next thirty years , the club competed in three separate small leagues which were run side @-@ by @-@ side during the space of each season ; the Hampshire League , the Salisbury and District League , and the North Hants May League . During this time , Andover won the Salisbury League eight times , the North Hants May League five times and reached the Hampshire Junior Cup final twice . 
 Andover competed in the first Hampshire Senior Cup in 1888 , but became involved in controversy after they were knocked out of the competition by Woolston Works . During this match , a Glasgow – based player called J. Kesson played for Woolston in their victory . Andover protested that Kesson should be disqualified on the grounds of residency — although he had played for Woolston Works earlier that season , he had since moved back to Glasgow . Woolston 's appeal rested on the fact that Kesson had left some items of clothing at his lodgings in Woolston , and this should be interpreted as his intention to return . The Hampshire FA upheld the appeal , allowing Woolston to progress through to the next round and eventually win the inaugural competition . 
 Andover joined the newly formed Southern League Second Division South West section in 1898 . They won just two of their ten games at this higher level and finished bottom of their six @-@ team division , which also included Cowes , Ryde and Eastleigh . After just one season , they moved back down to county league football along with the majority of teams in that division . 
 = = = 1900 to the Second World War = = = 
 Until the First World War Andover played in the Hampshire League North Division ( the Hampshire League at this time was composed of a number of regional divisions instead of the present @-@ day hierarchical structure ) , and their first major honour came in 1913 – 14 when they won that division . Competition was suspended during the war , and upon the restart they rejoined the Hampshire League in the North Division before moving to an enlarged County Division in the 1920 – 21 season . It was while in this division that they won their most prestigious title to date , the league championship in 1924 – 25 . 
 Division One of the Hampshire League was formed at the start of the 1929 – 30 season , and Andover were almost permanent members of that division , winning their first title in 1934 – 35 . The only slip was in 1936 – 37 when they were relegated , but they returned the following year after winning promotion from Division Two . The club remained active during the Second World War , winning the Hampshire League title in 1944 – 45 . 
 Andover had a certain degree of success in county cup competitions during this period . They reached the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup twice , in 1931 and 1933 , losing to Winchester City and Newport ( IOW ) respectively . They also won the Russell Cotes Cup four times and reached the final a further three times . 
 = = = Post @-@ war years = = = 
 Andover continued playing in Division One of the Hampshire League after the war . They had success during the period between 1948 and 1951 , winning two more Hampshire League championships as well as winning the Hampshire Senior Cup for the first two times in the club 's history . In 1960 – 61 , Andover won the Russell Cotes Cup for the sixth time , while the reserves were champions of Division Two and won the County Intermediate Cup for the second successive season . The following year saw the first team win their eighth Hampshire League championship and retain the Russell Cotes Cup , while the Reserves were champions of Division Two again . Ian Henderson broke his own goalscoring record set the previous year , scoring 62 goals . 
 In 1962 , the club followed Salisbury and stepped up to the Western League . This proved to be quite a different challenge — whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition , they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon , Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers , Bristol City and Torquay United . They generally fared well , only failing to finish in the top half of the table twice during their time at this level . Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5 – 4 in a fourth qualifying round replay . On 3 November , Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1 – 0 in front of <unk> spectators , a figure which would remain as the club 's largest attendance for a home game . In the league Andover finished fourth , but that was their highest placing until 1969 – 70 when they finished as runners @-@ up . 
 This was repeated the following season , and so in 1971 Andover took another step up and joined the Southern League . Now competing against teams from an even wider area spanning almost the entire width of the country ( ranging from Bideford in the west to Bury Town in the east ) and in some cases with a larger budget and fanbase , competition was always tough with the club generally finishing in the bottom half of the table . The highest position the club reached at this level was the sixth place reached in 1987 – 88 and again in 1991 – 92 . 
 = = = Move to the Portway Stadium = = = 
 In 1989 the Walled Meadow was sold for redevelopment and the club moved to the brand new Portway Stadium , which is located on the West Portway Industrial Estate . A crowd of 1 @,@ 100 watched the official opening match against Leicester City , with the league team coming away with a 10 – 1 victory . After much deliberation over the cost and distance of travel involved in Southern League football , the club voluntarily stepped down the pyramid ladder to join the Wessex League in 1993 – 94 . 
 The first season saw them finish runners @-@ up , but the club 's management declined to apply for promotion back into the Southern League and so they remained in the Wessex League . In the following three seasons they were placed seventh , ninth and sixth , but 1997 – 98 saw the club finish runners @-@ up again , winning promotion back to the Southern League . Returning after a five @-@ year absence , it was not long before the difference in quality between the two leagues became evident , and the club soon realised that it was unable to compete financially with the bigger clubs in the division . At the beginning of the year the club announced its intention to return to the Wessex League for 1999 – 2000 , a decision taken because it was felt it would be better to play in a league in which it could compete financially and successfully . 
 = = = 2000 to 2011 = = = 
 The next few years saw Andover enjoying its most successful spell for many decades . The first season back in the Wessex League saw the club finish third . They also reached the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup for the first time in 35 years , losing 1 – 9 to Aldershot Town in what is the Shots ' record win in their current incarnation . The team scored a total of 233 goals in all competitions , including a club record 88 goals scored by Andy Forbes . 
 Andover won the Wessex League championship for the first time in the 2000 – 01 season , scoring a club record 153 league goals including a 14 – 1 win over Swanage Town & <unk> , the club 's record victory . In addition , they won the Hampshire Senior Cup for the fifth time in the club 's history , beating Havant & Waterlooville 2 – 0 at The Dell . They also retained the North Hants Senior Cup to complete a treble . 
 They retained the League title the following year , winning the championship by a single point from Fleet Town following a 1 – 1 draw at Fleet on the last day of the season — this match was played in front of 623 people , a record attendance for a Wessex League match up to that date . The Lions gained another treble by also winning the League Cup and Russell Cotes Cup . The club won the North Hants Senior Cup again in 2002 – 03 , and reached the semi @-@ finals of both the Hampshire Senior Cup and the Russell Cotes Cup . Another Wessex League attendance record was set towards the end of the season when 702 people saw Andover 's 6 – 1 win over Eastleigh . 
 Despite this period of success , the club failed to attract significant local support . The club was close to extinction during the summer of 2003 after the chairman resigned , and was only saved when twelve supporters secured its future by purchasing the lease for the Portway Stadium from the outgoing chairman . The 2003 – 04 season brought success in the FA Vase competition , when Andover reached the quarterfinals for the first time in their history , before losing to Hampshire rivals Winchester City . They finished sixth in the league and won the North Hants Senior Cup for the fifth time . The 2004 – 05 season saw an improvement in the league with a fifth @-@ place finish ; the reserves finished runners up in the Wessex Combination East division . The club also won the North Hants Senior Cup for the sixth time . 
 Under the 2006 pyramid reorganisations , a third @-@ place finish in the Wessex League was good enough for promotion back to the Southern League , along with local rivals Winchester City and Thatcham Town . In their first season back , they finished in ninth place , just five points from the divisional playoffs . They were unable to build on this and struggled to a nineteenth @-@ place finish in the following season , ultimately finishing 29 points above relegation after Slough Town were reprieved following Halifax Town 's expulsion from the Football Conference . Andover 's home match against Uxbridge , played towards the end of that season , was the club 's thousandth game in the Southern League . 
 The beginning of the 2008 – 09 season saw the Lions marking their 125th anniversary with a pre @-@ season friendly against local rivals Salisbury City . Prior to the game , it had been announced that the club would also be wearing a new kit design to mark this occasion for one season only — a plain red shirt ( a departure from the traditional red and black stripes ) was worn for the first time during this game , which Andover won 3 – 2 . The season itself saw Andover have their best run in the FA Trophy to date , eventually losing 0 – 3 at home to Newport County in the third qualifying round . 
 The start of the 2010 – 11 season was disrupted due to damage caused to the Portway Stadium pitch by rabbits , leading to a number of home league games being postponed . An FA Cup match against Chertsey Town was played at Whitchurch United 's Longmeadow Ground , and their FA Trophy match against Bideford was played at Winchester City 's <unk> City Ground . The Lions were unable to recover and struggled throughout the season , failing to win a single home game and finishing bottom of the division with eleven points after conceding more than 100 goals . However , the club avoided relegation due to the resignation of Almondsbury Town F.C. earlier in the season . 
 = = = Dissolution and reformation = = = 
 Following the 2010 – 11 season , a new chairman and manager were appointed by the club . However , the manager resigned shortly afterwards to take up a post at Rotherham United F.C. , and the chairman resigned citing continuing financial constraints . The remaining board members formally wound up the club and resigned from the Southern League in July 2011 . 
 A new club named Andover Lions F.C. was formed two weeks later . After gaining clearance from the Football Association and the Hampshire F.A. , the club were accepted into the Hampshire League 2004 ( where the original club 's reserve side had been playing ) in time for the start of the 2011 – 12 season , with home games played at the Charlton Sports Centre . 
 = = = Honours = = = 
 = = Ground = = 
 Previously , the club played at the Walled Meadow , near to the town centre . The ground had a main wooden stand along one side ( which incorporated the changing rooms ) , and a bank of covered terracing on the opposite side . The ground was mainly accessed via the car park off London Road , with turnstiles also situated on Eastfield Road behind the main stand . Since the club left the Walled Meadow in 1989 , the ground has been demolished and the site is now used for a housing development of the same name . 
 In 1989 the club moved to the Portway Stadium , situated in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town . Built at a cost of £ 850 @,@ 000 , the ground has a main stand of brick and concrete construction with bench seating for around 250 people . This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground , giving spectators on that side an elevated view of the pitch . The managers ' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level . The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same level as the pitch along the north side . There is hard standing around the entire perimeter of pitch , along with a turnstile block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access . 
 The stadium 's clubhouse ( named the Portway Suite ) is also situated on this elevated side , just inside the turnstiles . The clubhouse houses a function suite and bar at first @-@ floor level , and changing rooms , physio room , public announcement equipment , toilets and a tea bar at ground @-@ floor level . 
 In addition to hosting the club 's first , reserve and youth team fixtures , the Portway Stadium has also played host to a number of local and regional cup matches . They include Hampshire Senior Cup semi @-@ finals , Hampshire Floodlit Youth Cup finals , and the South West Counties Women 's Championship playoff final . 
 Following the demise of Andover F.C. in 2011 , the stadium was unused for 2 years until the newly formed Andover Town won the lease for its use and , after a major facelift , regular football returned to the venue with the newly established outfit gaining direct entry into the Wessex League First Division where they gained promotion after their first season . 
 = = Supporters = = 
 In the 2008 – 09 season , Andover 's average attendance was 149 , representing a small increase of three compared to the previous season . This figure was the 11th highest in the division , falling around twenty short of the division 's mean average . 
 Attendance levels at Andover 's matches reached a peak in the late 1960s . During the 1969 – 70 season , home attendances at league matches averaged over 550 , with the largest crowd being the 2 @,@ 144 people who watched their FA Cup match against local rivals Salisbury . In the years following their promotion to the Southern League , average attendances started to drop until they dipped below the 200 mark during the 1970s . Since then , the average attendance at Andover 's matches has remained at approximately 140 , although this figure dipped below 100 in the 1999 – 2000 season following their last relegation from the Southern League . Just three seasons later however , this figure had risen to just under 200 following the club 's second consecutive Wessex League championship and successes in cup competitions . 
 = = = Rivalries = = = 
 Traditionally , Andover 's supporters regarded Salisbury as their local rivals , with matches between the two teams often attracting larger attendances than average for Andover 's home games . This rivalry was encouraged by the fact that the two teams played in the same division for all but three years between Andover 's admission into the Western League in 1962 and their step down to the Wessex League in 1992 . With Salisbury City 's rise up the football pyramid separating the two teams , the nearest club in Andover 's division was Whitchurch United , until Winchester City were promoted from the Hampshire League in 2003 . Their rivalry quickly grew and was at its closest during that season 's FA Vase competition , in which the two clubs were drawn against each other at the quarter @-@ final stage . This rivalry continued following the two teams ' simultaneous promotion to the Southern Football League in 2006 . 
 Andover New Street , a Wessex League team who play just outside the town , were also considered rivals . The two teams competed in an annual pre @-@ season tournament known as the Dango Memorial Cup ( a charity tournament named in honour of a former player who appeared for both teams ) , together with two other invited clubs . 
 = = Colours and crest = = 
 Andover 's traditional strip of red and black stripes was worn for the vast majority of their history . This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes . When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972 , the team 's colours were changed , this time to red with a single white stripe . This kit was worn until 1988 , when the familiar red and black stripes were re @-@ introduced . For the 2008 – 09 season , a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club 's 125th anniversary — this was worn for the first time in the pre @-@ season friendly against Salisbury City . The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts . However , various combinations have been worn in recent years , such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts , and tangerine shirts with white shorts . 
 Andover 's badge depicted a lion standing under an oak tree , which mirrors the design used on the town coat of arms . This badge was first used during the 1950s .

 Andover were sponsored by a number of local companies including the Hospital Saving Association ( HSA ) , a locally based health insurance firm who have also sponsored Blackburn Rovers in the past . 
 In addition to gate receipts , the club derived income from club merchandise sold in the club shop , and the Portway Suite ( the clubhouse at the Portway Stadium ) . The suite was able to be rented out for private events such as wedding receptions and birthday parties as well as hosting club events such as quiz nights . A boardroom was also available for conferences and meetings . 
 = = Former players = = 
 Despite their relatively low stature , a few notable players have represented Andover FC in the past . The most famous of these in recent times is Nigel Spackman , a local player who began his career for his home town before moving to AFC Bournemouth in 1980 . From there , he enjoyed a successful career culminating in an English league championship win with Liverpool , and numerous Scottish league and cup winners medals with Rangers . Since retiring , he has ventured into club management as well as becoming a television football pundit . 
 Like Spackman , Bill Rawlings was another <unk> who began his career at the club . He joined Southampton in 1919 where he enjoyed a successful career scoring 175 goals in 327 league appearances , making him their third all @-@ time goalscorer behind Mick Channon and Matthew Le Tissier . He earned two England caps in 1922 against Wales and Scotland respectively . He also played for Manchester United and Port Vale . 
 Dick Rowley was signed in September 1922 by Andover whilst serving at nearby Tidworth army base . After a few years playing the wing for the club , he was signed by Swindon Town and went on to play for Southampton , Tottenham Hotspur and Preston North End . He won six caps for Ireland in the years between 1929 and 1931 , scoring two goals against Scotland and Wales . 
 Another league player who started his career for Andover is James Sharp who left Andover in 2000 to play for Hartlepool United . Since then , he has had spells at Falkirk , Torquay United , Rochdale and Airdrie United in the Scottish League . 
 However , it has often been the case that league players have joined Andover after retiring from professional football . One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley , who ended his career with the Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers . After leaving Andover in 2001 , Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player who had tried to break up a fight . Maurice Evans is another former professional who , after briefly taking over as Andover 's player @-@ manager in 1967 , went on to lead Reading to the Fourth Division championship , and Oxford United to Milk Cup victory . 
 Another such player is Nicky Banger who played for Andover in their Wessex League championship winning team of 2002 , the Lions being one of a string of local non @-@ league clubs that he played for after leaving professional football . Mel Blyth , who was on Southampton 's 1976 FA Cup winning team , ended his career with Andover in 1982 . His cup final team @-@ mate David Peach also played for Andover , this time in the 1983 – 84 season when he scored five goals for the club . Other ex @-@ league players who have represented Andover in the past include Colin Barrett ( who joined Andover in 1981 after playing league football for Manchester City , Nottingham Forest and Swindon Town ) , Stuart Barfoot , Peter Brown , and former player @-@ coach Phil Andrews . 
 = = Other teams and activities = = 
 Andover 's reserve team played for most of the club 's history in various competitions and won the Hampshire Combination in 1998 , although they did not play during the 2007 – 08 season . The reserve team competed in the Hampshire League 2004 from 2008 to 2011 . In addition to their first and reserve teams , Andover FC also ran a number of youth teams ; an under @-@ 18s team competing in the North East Hampshire Youth League , and teams for other age groups ranging from under @-@ 7s to under @-@ 15s . The under @-@ 18s also competed in the FA Youth Cup . 
 In July 2008 , the club started a community programme called " Lions in the Community " in conjunction with some of their principal sponsors ( such as HSA and Stannah Lifts ) and a government body to provide a range of football activities for children and schools in the immediate area . Events held included coaching sessions at schools and local sports centres , five @-@ a @-@ side football tournaments for girls ' teams from local secondary schools , fun days and after @-@ school clubs . As a result of this programme , the club was officially awarded FA Charter Community Club status in October 2009 .

 Taboo Tuesday ( 2005 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , which took place on November 1 , 2005 , at the iPayOne Center in San Diego . It was the second annual Taboo Tuesday event in which the fans were given the chance to vote on stipulations for the matches . The voting for the event started on October 24 , 2005 , and ended during the event . Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card . The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before , during , and after the event were planned by WWE 's script writers . The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand : a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner . 
 The main event was a Triple Threat match , a standard match involving three wrestlers , for the WWE Championship . In this match , John Cena defeated Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels to retain his title . Two bouts were featured on the undercard . In a retrospective singles matches for the WWE Intercontinental Championship , Ric Flair defeated Triple H in a Steel cage match , which is fought in a cage with four sheets of mesh metal around , in , or against the edges of the wrestling ring , in which Flair won by escaping the cage and having both feet touch the arena floor . The other featured an Interpromotional tag team match where Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy ( SmackDown ! ) defeated Chris Masters and Snitsky ( Raw ) . 
 Taboo Tuesday received 174 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys , which was the same amount as the previous year 's event . The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event 7 out of 10 stars , higher than the 2004 event rating of 5 out of 10 stars . 
 = = Background = = 
 Unlike other WWE pay @-@ per @-@ views , where stipulations were determined by WWE 's creative staff , this was the second event where stipulations for matches were determined by votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE 's official website . The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches . Although the stipulations resulted from votes by WWE fans , different wrestlers were involved in pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots and storylines , which led to scheduled matches in which WWE fans could vote upon stipulations . 
 The main event scripted into Taboo Tuesday was between John Cena and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship , in which Cena would also defend the title against the fans ' choice of three possible opponents : Kane , The Big Show , and Shawn Michaels . The buildup to the match began at Unforgiven , Raw 's previous pay @-@ per @-@ view event , in which Cena intentionally disqualified himself . In WWE , a championship cannot change hands via count @-@ out or disqualification , as a result , Cena retained the title . On the October 17 episode of Raw , one of WWE 's primary television programs , General Manager Eric Bischoff , a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer , announced that a standard match involving three wrestlers , termed as a Triple Threat match , for the WWE Championship , would take place between Cena , Angle and the fans ' choice at Taboo Tuesday . Bischoff was scripted to promote three series of qualifying matches , in which the winner would receive a spot on the ballot as a potential challenger to Cena and Angle . The winners were Kane , The Big Show , and Shawn Michaels . The following week , a Triple Threat match was scheduled between the three competitors . Michaels won the match after he hit both Big Show and Kane with a superkick and pinned the Big Show for the win . The following week , Bischoff announced a singles match between Cena and Michaels . Late in the match , Angle attacked both Cena and Michaels . Cena , however , retaliated and lifted Angle up on his shoulders , but Michaels managed to hit Cena with a superkick . 
 One of the featured preliminary matches was between Ric Flair versus Triple H for the WWE Intercontinental Championship . On the October 3 episode of Raw , WWE Homecoming , Triple H returned after a four @-@ month hiatus . He took part in a match , teaming up with Flair , who was a fan favorite during Triple H 's absence , to take on Chris Masters and Carlito . The duo defeated Masters and Carlito ; after the match , Triple H turned on Flair and hit him with a sledgehammer . The following week , Triple H explained his actions , saying he saw that Flair had become mediocre when he was spat at and when he won the Intercontinental title . Triple H continued to say that he needed to end Flair 's career so his memories of Flair would not be tarnished . On the October 24 episode of Raw , a singles match was scheduled between Flair and Triple H at Taboo Tuesday , in which the fans would be given the opportunity to choose the type of match they compete in . The choice of the matches were a regular match , submission match , or a Steel Cage , a match where the ring is surrounded by walls of steel , for the Intercontinental title . 
 Another preliminary match was between the Raw and SmackDown ! brands . The feud began on the October 3 episode of Raw , in which WWE Chairman Vince McMahon wanted a match between SmackDown ! wrestlers on the program . A match was scheduled , but before it could get underway , Eric Bischoff announced that McMahon had left the arena , thus leaving himself in charge . Seeing SmackDown ! as inferior , Bischoff stopped the match by turning off the lights and going to a commercial break . At the end of the broadcast , SmackDown ! General Manager Theodore Long , led SmackDown ! superstars to the ring , and they fought with Raw superstars . On the October 17 episode of Raw , John " Bradshaw " Layfield 's ( JBL ) ( SmackDown ! ) entrance music played during Edge 's ( Raw ) match , the distraction caused Edge to lose the match . As part of the storyline , Edge and Chris Masters showed up to the SmackDown ! program on the October 21 episode , in which they interfered in a match between JBL and Rey Mysterio , where they assaulted Mysterio . On the October 24 episode of Raw , a match was made between Edge and Masters , and two of five SmackDown ! superstars chosen by the fans , and Mysterio attacked Edge from behind . The following week , Bischoff invited Mysterio to the Raw program to take the Master Lock Challenge , a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Masters ' swinging full nelson submission hold , which he calls the Master Lock . Mysterio , however , attacked Masters instead , which caused Bischoff to call for other Raw superstars . Long called for SmackDown ! superstars , and they fought until the Raw roster retreated .

 = = = Preliminary matches = = = 
 The first televised match was a tag team match in which Edge and Chris Masters ( representing Raw ) faced off against Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy ( representing SmackDown ! ) . Before the match , it was revealed that Edge refused to wrestle , saying he did not care about representing Raw and chose Snitsky as his replacement . Masters and Snitsky quickly gained the early advantage in the match , as they took the upper hand over Mysterio . Mysterio fought back with a tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl , a counterattack hold . Afterwards , Hardy and Snitsky were tagged in , leading to Hardy getting the advantage as he grabbed Snitsky by the side and drove Snitsky 's head onto the wrestling mat . Back and forth action took place between both teams . The match ended when Mysterio performed the 619 on Masters , followed by Hardy performing the Twist of Fate on Snitsky . Mysterio pinned Masters and giving SmackDown ! the win over Raw . 
 The next match was another tag team match involving Rob Conway and Tyson Tomko versus Eugene and Jimmy Snuka , who won the fans ' vote with 42 % . The team of Conway and Tomko dominated Eugene in the early start of the match . Eugene , however , fought back by avoiding Tomko 's attacks . Eugene tagged Snuka in and performed a series of chops to Conway 's chest and headbutted him in the process . In retaliation , Tomko attacked Snuka from behind , but Eugene fought him off , as he extended his arm out and knocked him out of the ring and out of the match . Eugene performed a jawbreaker on Conway , which proceeded with Eugene to lift Conway by holding his back horizontally and slamming it down , termed as a side slam . Snuka covered Conway for the pinfall victory . After the match , Tomko attacked Snuka and Eugene until Jim Duggan and Kamala came down and fought off Tomko . 
 The third match was between Carlito and Mankind , which was the gimmick chosen for Foley by the fans ' vote with 52 % . The match began with Carlito performing a dropkick on Mankind . Mankind , however , got the advantage over Carlito . Mid @-@ way through the match , Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito , but Carlito avoided getting hit , as he executed a drop toe @-@ hold , sending Mankind to hit the steel steps . Mankind rose to his feet , which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick , resulting in Mankind to hit the back of his head into the steel steps . Back in the ring , Mankind received the upper hand after he bent Carlito forward and hooked each arm behind Carlito 's back , tucked his head under one of Mankind 's arms , and then fell back to pull Carlito down flat on his face which caused Carlito to roll over . He then forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match . 
 The voting results for John Cena and Kurt Angle 's opponent for the WWE Championship were then revealed , with Shawn Michaels winning . Big Show and Kane , who were also contenders for the WWE title match , faced the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship . The match began with Big Show and Kane dominating Cade and Murdoch early on . Cade and Murdoch fought back after Murdoch shoved Kane off the top turnbuckle . They performed a running chop block combination on Kane and taking the upper hand . The Big Show , who was tagged in , stood at 7 feet 0 inches ( 2 @.@ 13 m ) and weighed 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) , used his body size to his advantage as he squashed , or easily and quickly performed moves on , Cade and Murdoch . The match concluded after Big Show and Kane grabbed and lifted Cade by the throat and slammed him down into the mat , a move called the chokeslam . This allowed the Big Show to pin Cade and become the new World Tag Team champions with Kane . After the match , Big Show and Kane double teamed Murdoch , as they performed a chokeslam . 
 The next match was a Street Fight , a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere , between Jonathan Coachman and SmackDown ! World Heavyweight Champion Batista . Goldust and Vader , were scripted to take part in the match , on behalf of Coachman . In the beginning of the match , Batista fought both Goldust and Vader , where they proceeded to beat him down in the corner . Batista , however , fought back with a series of shoulder block takedowns . Coachman , who stood on the outside , entered the ring , but did not last long , as Batista performed a clothesline on him . Batista attempted to perform a suplex on Vader , a move that consists of one wrestler picking up his opponent off the ground and then using a large portion of his or her own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat , but Goldust managed to hit Batista with a kendo stick . This allowed Coachman to receive the advantage over Batista . The match concluded after Batista performed a sitout powerbomb on Coachman , a move Batista calls the Batista Bomb , to gain the win . 
 The sixth match was a Battle Royal , a multi @-@ competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared the winner , for the WWE Women 's Championship between Ashley , Candice Michelle , Mickie James , Victoria , Maria and Trish Stratus , all of whom wore lingerie , which was voted by the fans ' with 43 % . In the match , James , as part of a storyline angle involving her being a devoted fan of Stratus , saved Stratus from being eliminated from the match , after Victoria tried eliminating her . Maria was tossed over the top rope by Stratus and James , thus being the first to be eliminated . Afterward , Michelle applied a submission move on Ashley on the top rope . Michelle turned around and was knocked off the ring apron by Ashley , making the second elimination of the match . Following the elimination of Michelle , Ashley was then eliminated by Victoria . The match concluded after Victoria hesitantly tried to eliminate Stratus , but James stopped her from doing so . James eliminated herself along with Victoria to allow Stratus to win and retain her Women 's title .

 The main match was a singles match between Ric Flair and Triple H. The match was a Steel Cage match , which gained 83 % of the vote . During the match , Triple H sent Flair head @-@ first into the steel cage , causing Flair to bleed from the head . A spot in the match saw Triple H retrieve a steel chain in which he wrapped around his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle . Flair , however , countered as he raised his foot to hit Triple H in the face and performed a series of chops to Triple H 's chest . Triple H controlled most of the match , until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock , a signature move of Flair 's , which resulted in Flair sending him towards the steel cage . Flair followed this by biting the head of Triple H , resulting in him bleeding from his forehead , this often results when a wrestler is trapped , either in a corner of the ring or in a submission hold , as a desperation move . The match concluded after Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and three chair shots to the head . This allowed Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and thus retain his Intercontinental title . 
 The main event was the WWE Championship match , in which John Cena defended the title against Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels , who received the fans ' vote to be part of the Triple Threat match . During the beginning of the match , Cena performed a back body drop on Angle , sending him to outside . Michaels , who had been thrown out of the ring , received the upper hand over Cena until Angle returned to the match and performed a variety of suplexes on both Michaels and Cena . Mid @-@ way in the match , Angle and Michaels double teamed Cena , lifting him in the air crashing face @-@ first on the Spanish announce table . Back in the ring , Angle lifted Michaels on his shoulders and spun 90 ° to slam him down to the mat , a move Angle calls the Angle Slam , from the top of the turnbuckles . Angle then tried to apply the ankle lock hold on Michaels , but Cena came into the ring and clotheslined Angle out of the ring . Cena proceeded by executing a back body drop on Michaels and attempting to perform a fist drop with theatrics , but was pulled out of the ring by Angle , who tossed him over the security barricade . The match concluded when Angle caught Cena in the ankle lock . Michaels , who was on the outside , climbed the top rope and drove his cocked elbow onto Angle 's chest , who was lying on the mat holding onto Cena 's ankle . Michaels performed a superkick , which saw the sole of his foot strike Angle 's chin , a move in which Michaels calls Sweet Chin Music . Following this , Cena lifted Michaels over his shoulders and threw him down to execute the FU . Cena got the pinfall victory and thus retained his title .

 Following Taboo Tuesday , the storyline between John Cena and Kurt Angle continued . A match was scheduled in which Cena would defend WWE Championship against Angle at November 's pay @-@ per @-@ view event Survivor Series . In the scripted feud , Angle refused to compete in the November 7 episode of Raw due to the " you suck " chants from the audience . Angle finally agreed to compete that night when Eric Bischoff censored the crowd and let him have a special guest referee for his title rematch against Cena ; Angle chose Daivari to be the guest referee . Before their scheduled rematch , Daivari 's officiating was unfair and biased towards Angle 's opponents . At Survivor Series , Cena went on to defeat Angle to retain his title . 
 The storyline angle between Triple H and Ric Flair also continued at Survivor Series , where they were scheduled in a match the wrestler who was unable to respond to a ten count by the referee would lose . Triple H defeated Flair at Survivor Series after Flair was unable to respond to a ten count . The feud between the Raw and SmackDown ! brands continued with Eric Bischoff and Theodore Long deciding on a 5 @-@ on @-@ 5 elimination match and a singles match between the two at Survivor Series . The teams feuded on both programs . At Survivor Series , Team SmackDown ! ( Batista , Rey Mysterio , JBL , Bobby Lashley , and Randy Orton ) defeated Team Raw ( Shawn Michaels , Kane , The Big Show , Carlito , and Chris Masters ) and Long defeated Bischoff .

 = Greater crested tern = 
 The greater crested tern ( Thalasseus bergii ) , also called crested tern or swift tern , is a seabird in the tern family that nests in dense colonies on coastlines and islands in the tropical and subtropical Old World . Its five subspecies breed in the area from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific and Australia , all populations dispersing widely from the breeding range after nesting . This large tern is closely related to the royal and lesser crested terns , but can be distinguished by its size and bill colour . 
 The greater crested tern has grey upperparts , white underparts , a yellow bill , and a shaggy black crest that recedes in winter . Its young have a distinctive appearance , with strongly patterned grey , brown and white plumage , and rely on their parents for food for several months after they have fledged . Like all members of the genus Thalasseus , the greater crested tern feeds by plunge diving for fish , usually in marine environments ; the male offers fish to the female as part of the courtship ritual . 
 This is an adaptable species that has learned to follow fishing boats for jettisoned bycatch , and to use unusual nest sites such as the roofs of buildings and artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works . Its eggs and young are taken by gulls and ibises , and human activities such as fishing , shooting and egg harvesting have caused local population declines . There are no global conservation concerns for this bird , which has a stable total population of more than 500 @,@ 000 individuals . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The terns , family Sternidae , are small to medium @-@ sized seabirds closely related to the gulls , skimmers and skuas . They are gull @-@ like in appearance , but typically have a lighter build , long pointed wings ( which give them a fast , buoyant flight ) , a deeply forked tail and short legs . Most species are grey above and white below , and have a black cap that is reduced or flecked with white in the winter . 
 The greater crested tern was originally described as Sterna bergii by German naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823 , but was moved to its current genus , Thalasseus , after mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that the three main head patterns shown by terns ( no black cap , black cap , black cap with a white forehead ) corresponded to distinct clades . 
 The greater crested tern 's closest relatives within its genus appear to be the lesser crested tern ( T. bengalensis ) , and the royal tern ( T. maximus ) . The DNA study did not include the critically endangered Chinese crested tern ( T. <unk> ) but , as that bird was formerly considered to be conspecific with the greater crested tern as a synonym of the subspecies T. b. cristatus , it is presumably also very closely related . 
 The generic name of the greater crested tern is derived from Greek Thalassa , " sea " , and the species epithet bergii commemorates Carl Heinrich <unk> , a Prussian pharmacist and botanist who collected the first specimens of this tern near Cape Town . 
 The greater crested tern has about five geographical races , differing mainly in the colour of the upperparts and bill . These are listed below in taxonomic sequence . A similar number of other potential subspecies have been proposed , but are not considered valid . 
 = = Description = = 
 The greater crested tern is a large tern with a long ( 5 @.@ 4 – 6 @.@ 5 cm or 2 @.@ 1 – 2 @.@ 6 in ) yellow bill , black legs , and a glossy black crest that is noticeably shaggy at its rear . The breeding adult of the nominate subspecies T. b. bergii is 46 – 49 cm ( 18 – 19 @.@ 5 in ) long , with a 125 – 130 cm ( 49 – 51 in ) wing @-@ span ; this subspecies weighs 325 – 397 g ( 11 @.@ 4 – 14 @.@ 0 oz ) . The forehead and the underparts are white , the back and inner wings are dusky @-@ grey . In winter , the upperparts plumage wears to a paler grey , and the crown of the head becomes white , merging at the rear into a peppered black crest and mask . 
 The adults of both sexes are identical in appearance , but juvenile birds are distinctive , with a head pattern like the winter adult , and upperparts strongly patterned in grey , brown , and white ; the closed wings appear to have dark bars . After moulting , the young terns resemble the adult , but still have a variegated wing pattern with a dark bar on the inner flight feathers . 
 The northern subspecies T. b. velox and T. b. <unk> are in breeding plumage from May to September or October , whereas the relevant period for the two southern African races is from December to April . For T. b. cristata , the moult timing depends on location ; birds from Australia and Oceania are in breeding plumage from September to about April , but those in Thailand , China and Sulawesi have this appearance from February to June or July . 
 The royal tern is similar in size to this species , but has a heavier build , broader wings , a paler back and a blunter , more orange bill . The greater crested often associates with the lesser crested tern , but is 25 % larger than the latter , with a proportionately longer bill , longer and heavier head , and bulkier body . Lesser crested tern has an orange @-@ tinted bill , and in immature plumage it is much less variegated than greater crested . 
 The greater crested tern is highly vocal , especially at its breeding grounds . The territorial advertising call is a loud , raucous , crow @-@ like <unk> . Other calls include a <unk> given at the nest by anxious or excited birds , and a hard <unk> <unk> in flight . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The greater crested tern occurs in tropical and warm temperate coastal parts of the Old World from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and Australia . The subspecies T. b. bergii and T. b. enigma breed in Southern Africa from Namibia to Tanzania , and possibly on islands around Madagascar . There is then a break in the breeding distribution of this species until Somalia and the Red Sea , and another discontinuity further east in southern India . 
 The greater crested tern breeds on many islands in the Indian Ocean including Aldabra and Etoile in the Seychelles , the Chagos Archipelago , and Rodrigues . There are colonies on numerous Pacific islands , including Kiribati , Fiji , Tonga , the Society Islands and the Tuamotus . 
 The nests are located on low ‑ lying sandy , rocky , or coral islands , sometimes amongst stunted shrubs , often without any shelter at all . When not breeding , the greater crested tern will roost or rest on open shores , less often on boats , pilings , harbour buildings and raised salt mounds in lagoons . It is rarely seen on tidal creeks or inland waters . 
 All populations of greater crested tern disperse after breeding . When Southern African birds leave colonies in Namibia and Western Cape Province , most adults move east to the Indian Ocean coastline of South Africa . Many young birds also travel east , sometimes more than 2 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) , but others move northwards along the western coast . T. b. <unk> winters on the east African coast north to Kenya and Somalia and may move as far south as Durban . Populations of T. b. velox breeding from the Persian Gulf eastwards appear to be sedentary or dispersive rather than truly migratory , but those breeding in the Red Sea winter south along the east African coast to Kenya . T. b. cristata mostly stays within 400 km ( 250 mi ) of its colonies , but some birds wander up to around 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) . This species has occurred as a vagrant to Hawaii , New Zealand , North Korea , Jordan , and Israel . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The greater crested tern breeds in colonies , often in association with other seabirds . It is monogamous and the pair bond is maintained through the year and sometimes in consecutive breeding seasons . The colony size is related to the abundance of pelagic fish prey , and the largest documented colony , with 13 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 pairs , is in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia , a region which also supports major colonies of other seabirds . Since nesting in this area follows the summer monsoonal flooding , it is presumably a response to fish stocks rising , probably due to river run @-@ off providing extra nutrient to the Gulf . This tern does not show site fidelity , frequently changing its nest site from year to year , sometimes by more than 200 km ( 120 mi ) . 
 A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting , and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory . If the intruder is another male , it retaliates in kind , and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent . A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male 's aggression , enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display , including head raising and bowing ; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair . Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual . One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak , calling loudly ; its partner may also fly , but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged . 
 The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open , flat or occasionally sloping ground . It is often unlined , but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones . One , sometimes two , eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30 days prior to hatching . The eggs are cream with blackish streaks . Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colony and more tightly so within sub @-@ colonies . Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched chicks , but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two days @-@ old , shortly before they begin to wander from the nest . The precocial chicks , which are very pale with black speckling , are brooded and fed by both parents , but may gather in crèches when older . The young terns fledge after 38 to 40 days , but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until they are about four months old . 
 In South Africa , this species has adapted to breeding on the roofs of building , sometimes with Hartlaub 's gull , which also shares the more typical nesting sites of the nominate race . In 2000 , 7 @.@ 5 % of the population of this subspecies bred on roofs . Artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works have also recently been colonised by this adaptable seabird . 
 Adult terns have few predators , but in Namibia immature birds are often robbed of their food by kelp gulls , and that species , along with Hartlaub 's gull , silver gull and sacred ibis , has been observed feeding on eggs or nestlings , especially when colonies are disturbed . Smaller <unk> with a relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more predation . In Australia , predation by cats and dogs , and occasional deaths by shooting or collisions with cars , wires or light @-@ towers have been documented . 
 Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the greater crested tern . Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food , and huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large prawn trawl fishery . Conversely , purse @-@ seine fishing reduces the available food supply , and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of great crested terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish , which are intensively exploited by purse @-@ seine fishing . Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with trawl warps , trapped in trawls or discarded gear , or hooked by longline fishing , but , unlike albatrosses and petrels , there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected . 
 An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off Robben Island , South Africa by marine foam , generated by a combination of wave action , kelp mucilage and phytoplankton . After treatment , 90 % of the birds were fit to be released . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Fish are the main food of the greater crested tern , found to make up nearly 90 % of all prey items with the remainder including cephalopods , crustaceans and insects . Unusual vertebrate prey included agamid lizards and green turtle hatchlings . 
 The great crested tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up to 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) , or by dipping from the surface , and food is usually swallowed in mid @-@ air . Birds may forage up to 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) from land in the breeding season . Prey size ranges from 7 – 138 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 – 5 @.@ 43 in ) in length and up to 30 g ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) in weight . Shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovy and sardine are typical prey , but bottom @-@ living species are taken as discards from commercial fishing . This tern actively follows trawlers , including at night , and during the fishing season trawl discards can constitute 70 % of its diet . Prawn fishing is particularly productive in providing extra food , since prawns usually represent only 10 – 20 % of the catch , the remaining being bycatch , mainly fish such as cardinalfish and gobies . 
 A study of an area of the Great Barrier Reef where the number of breeding great crested terns has grown ten @-@ fold , probably due to extra food from trawl by @-@ catch , suggested that lesser crested and sooty terns have moved away and now breed on a part of the reef where fishing is banned . It is possible that the large increase in the number of greater crested terns may have affected other species through competition for food and nesting sites . 
 Terns have red oil droplets in the cone cells of the retinas of their eyes . This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision , especially in hazy conditions . Birds that have to see through an air / water interface , such as terns and gulls , have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in the cone oil drops than other avian species . The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish , although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed , or observing other terns diving for food . Tern 's eyes are not particularly ultraviolet sensitive , an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls . 
 = = Status = = 
 The greater crested tern has a widespread distribution range , estimated at 1 – 10 million square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 8 million square miles ) . The population has not been quantified , but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for either the size criterion ( fewer than 10 @,@ 000 mature individuals ) or the population decline criterion ( declining more than 30 % in ten years or three generations ) of the IUCN Red List . For these reasons , the species is evaluated as being of Least Concern at the global level . However , there are concerns for populations in some areas such as the Gulf of Thailand where the species no longer breeds , and in Indonesia where egg harvesting has caused declines . 
 All subspecies except T. b. cristata are covered under the Agreement on the Conservation of African @-@ Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) . Parties to the Agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan . The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation , management of human activities , research , education , and implementation . 
 = Valerie Solanas = 
 Valerie Jean Solanas ( April 9 , 1936 – April 25 , 1988 ) was an American radical feminist , best known for writing the SCUM Manifesto and attempting to murder artist Andy Warhol in the late 1960s . 
 She was born in New Jersey and as a teenager had a volatile relationship with her mother and stepfather after her parents ' divorce . As a consequence , she was sent to live with her grandparents . Her alcoholic grandfather physically abused her and Solanas ran away and became homeless . She came out as a lesbian in the 1950s . She graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland , College Park . Solanas relocated to Berkeley , California . There , she began writing her most notable work , the SCUM Manifesto , which urged women to " overthrow the government , eliminate the money system , institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex . " 
 Solanas moved to New York City in the mid @-@ 1960s , working as a writer . She met pop artist Andy Warhol and asked him to produce her play , Up Your Ass . She gave him her script , which she later accused him of losing and / or stealing , followed by Warhol expressing additional indifference to her play . After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script , Warhol hired her to perform in his film , I , a Man , paying her $ 25 . In 1967 , Solanas began self @-@ publishing the SCUM Manifesto . Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas 's future writings , and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing . Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work , Solanas purchased a gun in the spring of 1968 . 
 On June 3 , 1968 , she went to The Factory , where she found Warhol . She shot at Warhol three times , with the first two shots missing and the final wounding Warhol . She also shot art critic Mario Amaya , and attempted to shoot Warhol 's manager , Fred Hughes , point blank , but the gun jammed . Solanas then turned herself in to the police . She was charged with attempted murder , assault , and illegal possession of a gun . She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and pleaded guilty to " reckless assault with intent to harm " , serving a three @-@ year prison sentence , including treatment in a mental hospital . After her release , she continued to promote the SCUM Manifesto . She died in 1988 of pneumonia , in San Francisco . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Solanas was born in Ventnor City , New Jersey , to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo in 1936 . Her father was a bartender and her mother , a dental assistant . She had a younger sister , Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez . Her father 's parents were immigrants from Spain and her mother was Italian @-@ American . 
 Solanas said that she regularly suffered sexual abuse at the hands of her father . Her parents divorced when she was young , and her mother remarried shortly afterwards . Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother , becoming a truant . As a child , she wrote insults for children to use on one another , for the cost of a dime . She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl , and also hit a nun . Because of her rebellious behavior , her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949 . Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her . When she was 15 , she left her grandparents and became homeless . In 1953 , she gave birth to a son , fathered by a married sailor . The child , named David ( later David Blackwell by adoption ) , was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again . 
 Despite this , she graduated from high school on time and earned a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland , College Park , where she was in the Psi Chi Honor Society . While at the University of Maryland , she hosted a call @-@ in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men . She was also an open lesbian , despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s . 
 She attended the University of Minnesota 's Graduate School of Psychology , where she worked in the psychology department 's animal research laboratory , before dropping out and moving to attend Berkeley for a few courses , when she began writing the SCUM Manifesto . 
 = = New York City and the Factory = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s Solanas moved to New York City where she supported herself through begging and prostitution . In 1965 she wrote two works : an autobiographical short story called " A Young Girl 's Primer on How to <unk> the Leisure Class " and a play titled Up Your Ass , about a young prostitute . According to James Martin Harding , the play is " based on a plot about a woman who ' is a man @-@ hating hustler and <unk> ' and who ... ends up killing a man " and is more a " provocation than ... a work of dramatic literature " and " rather adolescent and contrived . " The short story was published in Cavalier magazine in July 1966 . Up Your Ass remains unpublished . Harding described her as " an avant @-@ <unk> " . 
 In 1967 , Solanas encountered Andy Warhol outside his studio , The Factory , and asked him to produce her play . He accepted the script for review and told Solanas that it was " well typed " and promised to read it . According to Factory lore , Warhol , whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity , thought the script was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap . Solanas contacted Warhol about the script , and was told that he had lost it . He also jokingly offered her a job at the Factory as a typist . Insulted , Solanas demanded money for the lost manuscript . Instead , Warhol paid her $ 25 to appear in his film , I , a Man . 
 In her role in I , a Man , she leaves the film 's title character ( played by Tom Baker ) to fend for himself , explaining " I gotta go beat my meat " as she exits the scene . Solanas was satisfied with her experience working with Warhol and her performance in the film , and brought Maurice Girodias to see the film . Girodias described her as being " very relaxed and friendly with Warhol . " Solanas also had a nonspeaking role in Warhol 's film <unk> , in 1967 . 
 = = = SCUM Manifesto = = = 
 In 1967 , Solanas self @-@ published her best @-@ known work , the SCUM Manifesto , a scathing critique of patriarchal culture . The manifesto 's opening words are : 
 " Life " in this " society " being , at best , an utter bore and no aspect of " society " being at all relevant to women , there remains to civic @-@ minded , responsible , thrill @-@ seeking females only to overthrow the government , eliminate the money system , institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex . 
 Some authors have argued that the Manifesto is a parody of patriarchy and a satirical work and , according to Harding , Solanas described herself as " a social propagandist " , but Solanas denied that the work was " a put on " and insisted that her intent was " dead serious . " The Manifesto has been translated into over a dozen languages and is excerpted in several feminist anthologies . 
 While living at the Chelsea Hotel , Solanas introduced herself to Maurice Girodias , the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel . In August 1967 , Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her " next writing , and other writings . " In exchange , Girodias paid her $ 500 . She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work . She told Paul Morrissey that " everything I write will be his . He 's done this to me ... He 's screwed me ! " Solanas intended to write a novel based around the SCUM Manifesto , and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol 's failure to return the Up Your Ass script . She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work . 
 = = = Shooting = = = 
 In early 1968 , Solanas went to writer Paul Krassner to ask him for $ 50 . In a 2009 written account , Krassner rejected part of Morrissey 's account and maintained that Solanas asked him for the money for food and he loaned it to her . Krassner later speculated that Solanas could have used the money to buy the gun as the shooting was a few days later . According to Freddie Baer , when Solanas asked Krassner for money in 1968 , she told him she wanted to shoot Maurice Girodias and she used the $ 50 Krassner gave her to buy a .32 automatic pistol . In any event , Krassner denied that he knew that Solanas intended to kill Warhol when she asked to borrow money from him . 
 According to an <unk> source in The Outlaw Bible of American Literature , on June 3 , 1968 , at 9 : 00 am , Solanas arrived at the Chelsea Hotel , where Girodias lived . She asked for him at the desk but was told he was gone for the weekend . She remained for three hours before heading to the Grove Press , where she asked for Barney Rosset , who was also not available . 
 In her 2014 biography , Valerie Solanas , Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias . Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto , which he had published . Fahs states that " the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor 's Studio at 432 West Forty @-@ Fourth Street early that morning . " Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor 's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg , asking to leave her play for him . Miles said that Solanas " had a different look , a bit tousled , like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind . " Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon . Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then " ... shut the door because I knew she was trouble . I didn 't know what sort of trouble , but I knew she was trouble . " 
 Fahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden 's ( then Margo Eden ) residence in Crown Heights , Brooklyn , as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce her play . As related to Fahs , Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours , trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men . Throughout this time , Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas 's play . According to Feiden , Solanas then pulled out her gun , and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play , Solanas responded , " Yes , you will produce the play because I 'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous , and then you 'll produce it . " As she was leaving Feiden 's residence , Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play and other personal papers . 
 Fahs describes how Feiden then " frantically called her local police precinct , Andy Warhol 's precinct , police headquarters in Lower Manhattan , and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol . " In some instances , the police responded that " You can 't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol , " and even asked Feiden " Listen lady , how would you know what a real gun looked like ? " In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times , Feiden said that she did know that Solanas intended to kill Warhol , but could not prevent it . ( A New York Times assistant Metro editor responded to an online comment regarding the story , saying that the Times " does not present the account as definitive . " ) 
 Fahs additionally cites Assistant District Attorney Roderick <unk> 's handwritten notes on the case , written on June 4 , 1968 , which begin with Margo Feiden 's stage name , " Margo Eden " , address , and telephone numbers at the top of the page . 
 Later that day , Solanas arrived at the Factory and waited outside . Morrissey arrived and asked her what she was doing there , and she replied " I 'm waiting for Andy to get money " . Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day , but she told him she would wait . At 2 : 00 pm she went up into the studio . Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave . She left but rode the elevator up and down until Warhol finally boarded it . 
 She entered The Factory with Warhol , who complimented her on her appearance as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup . Morrissey told her to leave , threatening to " beat the hell " out of her and throw her out otherwise . The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom . While Warhol was on the phone , Solanas fired at him three times . Her first two shots missed , but the third went through both lungs , his spleen , stomach , liver , and esophagus . She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip . She tried to shoot Fred Hughes , Warhol 's manager , in the head but her gun jammed . Hughes asked her to leave , which she did , leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table . Warhol was taken to Columbus – Mother Cabrini Hospital , where he underwent a five @-@ hour , successful operation . 
 Later that day , Solanas turned herself in , gave up her gun , and confessed to the shooting , telling a police officer that Warhol " had too much control in my life . " She was fingerprinted and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon . The next morning , the New York Daily News ran a front page headline stating : " Actress Shoots Andy Warhol . " Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement that she was an actress . The Daily News changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating " I 'm a writer , not an actress . " At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn 't produce her play but said " it was for the opposite reason " , that " he has a legal claim on my works . " Solanas told the judge that " it 's not often that I shoot somebody . I didn 't do it for nothing . Warhol had tied me up , lock , stock , and barrel . He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me . " She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she " was right in what I did ! I have nothing to regret ! " " The judge struck her comments from the court record " and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation . 
 = = = Trial = = = 
 After a cursory evaluation , Solanas was declared mentally unstable and transferred to the prison ward of Elmhurst Hospital . Solanas appeared at the New York Supreme Court on June 13 , 1968 . Florynce Kennedy represented her and asked for a writ of habeas corpus , arguing that Solanas was being held inappropriately at Elmhurst . The judge denied the motion and Solanas returned to Elmhurst . On June 28 , Solanas was indicted on charges of attempted murder , assault , and illegal possession of a gun . She was declared " incompetent " in August and sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane . That same month , Olympia Press published the SCUM Manifesto with essays by Girodias and Krassner . 
 In January , 1969 , Solanas underwent psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia . In June , she was finally deemed fit to stand trial . She represented herself without an attorney and pleaded guilty to " reckless assault with intent to harm " . She was sentenced to three years in prison , with one year of time served .

 The shooting of Warhol propelled Solanas into the public spotlight , prompting a flurry of commentary and opinions in the media . Robert <unk> , writing in The Village Voice , declared that Solanas " has dedicated the remainder of her life to the avowed purpose of eliminating every single male from the face of the earth . " Norman Mailer called her the " Robespierre of feminism . " 
 Ti @-@ Grace Atkinson , the New York chapter president of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) , described Solanas as " the first outstanding champion of women 's rights " and as " a ' heroine ' of the feminist movement " , and " smuggled [ her manifesto ] ... out of the mental hospital where Solanas was confined . " According to Betty Friedan , the NOW board repudiated Atkinson . Atkinson left NOW and started another feminist organization . According to Friedan , " the media continued to treat Ti @-@ Grace as a leader of the women 's movement , despite its repudiation of her . " 
 Another NOW member , Florynce Kennedy , called her " one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement . " 
 English professor Dana Heller argued that Solanas was " very much aware of feminist organizations and activism " , but that she " had no interest in participating in what she often described as ' a civil disobedience luncheon club . ' " Heller also stated that Solanas could " reject mainstream liberal feminism for its blind adherence to cultural codes of feminine politeness and decorum which the SCUM Manifesto identifies as the source of women 's debased social status . "

 After Solanas was released from the New York State Prison for Women in 1971 , she stalked Warhol and others over the telephone and was arrested again in November 1971 . She was subsequently institutionalized several times and then drifted into obscurity . 
 The attack had a profound impact on Warhol and his art , and security at the Factory scene became much stronger afterward . For the rest of his life , Warhol lived in fear that Solanas would attack him again . " It was the Cardboard Andy , not the Andy I could love and play with , " said close friend and collaborator Billy Name . " He was so sensitized you couldn 't put your hand on him without him jumping . I couldn 't even love him anymore , because it hurt him to touch him . " 
 = = Later life = = 
 Solanas may have intended to write an eponymous autobiography . In a 1977 Village Voice interview , she announced a book with her name as the title . The book , possibly intended as a parody , was supposed to deal with the conspiracy which led to her imprisonment . In a corrective 1977 Village Voice interview , Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion and that it would be about many things , include proof of statements in the manifesto , and " deal very intensively with the subject of bullshit " , but she said nothing about parody . 
 In the mid @-@ 1970s , in New York City , according to Heller , Solanas was " apparently homeless " , " continued to defend her political beliefs and the SCUM Manifesto " , and " actively promoted " her own new Manifesto revision . 
 Ultra Violet , according to her somewhat unreliable report , interviewed her . Solanas was then known as <unk> Loh . Solanas stated that the August 1968 version of the manifesto had many errors , unlike her own printed version of October 1967 , and that the book had not sold well . She also said that , until told by Violet , she was unaware of Andy Warhol 's death . 
 = = = Death and after = = = 
 On April 25 , 1988 , at the age of 52 , Solanas died of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco . A building superintendent at the hotel , not on duty that night , had a vague memory of Solanas : " Once , he had to enter her room , and he saw her typing at her desk . There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her . What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery . " Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously .

 Solanas 's life has been the focus of numerous performances , films , musical compositions , and publications . 
 In 1996 , actress Lili Taylor played Solanas in the film I Shot Andy Warhol , which focused on Solanas 's assassination attempt on Warhol . Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role . The film 's director , Mary Harron , requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground , but was denied by Lou Reed , who feared that Solanas would be glorified in the film . Six years before the film 's release , Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas , " I Believe , " on their concept album about Warhol , Songs for <unk> ( 1990 ) . In " I Believe " , Reed sings , " I believe life 's serious enough for retribution ... I believe being sick is no excuse . And I believe I would 've pulled the switch on her myself . " Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol 's death from a gallbladder infection 20 years after she shot him . 
 Three plays have been based around Solanas 's life . Valerie Shoots Andy , by Carson Kreitzer , from 2001 , which starred two actresses playing a younger ( Heather Grayson ) and an older ( Lynne McCollough ) Solanas . Tragedy in Nine Lives , by Karen <unk> , in 2003 , examined the encounter between Solanas and Warhol as a Greek tragedy and starred Juliana Francis as Solanas . Most recently , in 2011 , was Pop ! , a musical by Maggie @-@ Kate Coleman and Anna K. Jacobs . Pop ! focused mainly on Andy Warhol , with Rachel <unk> playing Solanas and singing the song " Big Gun " , which was described as the " evening 's strongest number " by The Washington Post . 
 In 1999 Up Your Ass was re @-@ discovered and produced in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco . Coates turned the piece into a musical , starring an all @-@ female cast . Coates learned about Up Your Ass while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum , which marked the 30th anniversary of the shooting . The copy that Warhol had lost was discovered buried in a trunk of lighting equipment that was owned by Billy Name . Coates would consult with Solanas 's sister , Judith , while writing the piece , and sought to create a " very funny satirist " out of Solanas , not just showing her as the attempted assassin of Warhol . 
 Swedish author Sara <unk> wrote a semi @-@ fictional novel about Valerie Solanas , called <unk> ( English : The Dream Faculty ) . In the book , the narrator visits Solanas towards the end of her life at the Bristol Hotel . <unk> was awarded the Nordic Council 's Literature Prize for the book . 
 Composer Pauline Oliveros released a piece titled " To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation " in 1970 . Through the work , Oliveros sought to explore how " Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality : Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress . Solanas wished to be supported for her own creative work . " There is a music group from Belgium called The Valerie Solanas . 
 = = = Influence and analysis = = = 
 Solanas 's role as a cult figure was solidified with the publication of the SCUM Manifesto and her shooting of Andy Warhol . Harding explained that , by declaring herself independent from Andy Warhol , after her arrest she " aligned herself with the historical avant @-@ garde 's rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater " , and Harding explained that her anti @-@ patriarchal " militant hostility ... pushed the avant @-@ garde in radically new directions . " Harding believed that Solanas 's assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance . At the shooting , she left on a table at the Factory a paper bag in which she carried a gun , her address book , and a sanitary napkin . Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance , and called " attention to basic feminine experiences that were <unk> [ sic ] taboo and tacitly elided within avant @-@ garde circles . " 
 Feminist philosopher <unk> <unk> compared Solanas to an array of people : Lorena Bobbitt , a " girl Nietzsche " , Medusa , the Unabomber , and Medea . <unk> believed that Solanas was threatened by the hyper @-@ feminine women of the Factory that Warhol liked and felt lonely because of the rejection she felt due to her own butch androgyny . She believed that Solanas was ahead of her time , living in a period before feminist and lesbian revolutionaries such as the Guerrilla Girls and the Lesbian Avengers . 
 Solanas has also been credited with instigating radical feminism . Catherine Lord wrote that " the feminist movement would not have happened without Valerie Solanas . " Lord believed that the reissuing of the SCUM Manifesto and the disowning of Solanas by " women 's liberation politicos " triggered a wave of radical feminist publications . According to Vivian <unk> , many of the women 's liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later , developing the first wave of radical feminism . At the same time , perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political , according to Harding and Victor <unk> . 
 However , writer Breanne Fahs describes Solanas as a contradiction which " alienates her from the feminist movement . " Fahs argues that Solanas never wanted to be " in movement " but she nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking <unk> members to disagree about her case . Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle ( a lesbian who sexually serviced men , claim of being asexual , confusion ) , a rejection of queer culture , and a non @-@ interest in working with others despite a co @-@ dependency on others . Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas 's life . Solanas 's life is described as one of a victim , a rebel , a desperate loner , yet Solanas 's cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s , not primarily as a prostitute , and friend Geoffrey <unk> said she had a " groovy childhood . " Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life , which makes one question and complicate the notion that Solanas hated her father and acted out this hatred in the shooting / manifesto . Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity .

 The Izumo @-@ class cruisers ( <unk> , Izumo @-@ gata <unk> <unk> ) were a pair of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself , the vessels were built in Britain . They were part of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 . The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 — the Battle of Port Arthur , the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima — but played a much more minor role in World War I. 
 Iwate was first used as a training ship in 1916 and remained in that role for most of the rest of her career . Her sister , Izumo , was mostly used for training during the 1920s , but became flagship of the IJN forces in China in 1932 . She was involved in the Shanghai Incident that year and in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War that began five years later . The ship was used in the early stages of the Philippines Campaign during the Pacific War until she struck a mine at the end of 1941 . Izumo joined her sister as a training ship in home waters in 1943 . Both ships were sunk in a series of American air attacks on the naval base at Kure in July 1945 . Their wrecks were refloated after the war and scrapped . 
 = = Background and design = = 
 Japan initiated the 1896 Naval Expansion Plan after the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 . The plan included four armored cruisers and four battleships , all of which had to be ordered from foreign shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself . Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy . Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships . The revised plan is commonly known as the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " . These ships were purchased using the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino @-@ Japanese War . Unlike most of their contemporaries , which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes , the Izumo class was intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline . 
 Construction of the Izumo @-@ class ships was awarded to the British shipbuilder Armstrong Whitworth of Elswick , the same shipyard that had built the earlier two Asama @-@ class armored cruisers of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " . They were also designed by Sir Philip Watts , who took advantage of rapidly advancing boiler technology to substitute lighter Belleville boilers in lieu of the cylindrical boilers of the earlier ships and used the weight saved to increase the thickness of the protective deck and improve the hull structure . The increased number of boilers required an extra funnel , which became the primary means of distinguishing between the two classes . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Izumo @-@ class ships were 132 @.@ 28 meters ( 434 ft 0 in ) long overall and 121 @.@ 92 meters ( 400 ft 0 in ) between perpendiculars . They had a beam of 20 @.@ 94 meters ( 68 ft 8 in ) and had an average draft of 7 @.@ 21 to 7 @.@ 26 meters ( 23 ft 8 in to 23 ft 10 in ) . The ships displaced 9 @,@ 423 to 9 @,@ 503 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 274 to 9 @,@ 353 long tons ) at normal load and 10 @,@ 235 to 10 @,@ 305 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 073 to 10 @,@ 142 long tons ) at deep load . They had metacentric heights of 0 @.@ 73 to 0 @.@ 88 meters ( 2 ft 5 in to 2 ft 11 in ) . Their crew consisted of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ships had two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) . The sisters had a designed speed of 20 @.@ 75 knots ( 38 @.@ 43 km / h ; 23 @.@ 88 mph ) and both exceeded it by at least a 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) during their sea trials from 15 @,@ 739 to 16 @,@ 078 ihp ( 11 @,@ 737 to 11 @,@ 989 kW ) . They carried up to 1 @,@ 527 long tons ( 1 @,@ 551 t ) of coal and could steam for 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ; 8 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament for all of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " armored cruisers was four Armstrong Whitworth @-@ built 45 @-@ caliber eight @-@ inch guns in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The electrically operated turrets were capable of 130 ° rotation left and right , and the guns could be elevated to + 30 ° and depressed to − 5 ° . Each turret accommodated 65 shells , but could only be reloaded through doors in the turret floor and the ship 's deck that allowed the electric winch in the turret to hoist shells up from the shell room deep in the hull . The guns were manually loaded and had a rate of fire about 1 @.@ 2 rounds per minute . The 203 @-@ millimeter gun fired 250 @-@ pound ( 113 @.@ 5 kg ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 feet per second ( 760 m / s ) to a range of 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 The secondary armament consisted of fourteen Elswick Ordnance Company " Pattern Z " quick @-@ firing ( QF ) , 40 @-@ caliber , six @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . All but four of these guns were mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks , and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields . Their 100 @-@ pound ( 45 @.@ 4 kg ) AP shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 feet per second ( 700 m / s ) . The ships were also equipped with a dozen 40 @-@ caliber QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 @-@ cwt guns and eight QF 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Yamauchi guns as close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . The former gun fired three @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 359 feet per second ( 719 m / s ) . 
 The Izumo @-@ class ships were equipped with four submerged 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . The Type 30 torpedo had a 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) warhead and three range / speed settings : 870 yards ( 800 m ) at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , 1 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) at 23 @.@ 6 knots ( 43 @.@ 7 km / h ; 27 @.@ 2 mph ) or 3 @,@ 300 yards ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) at 14 @.@ 2 knots ( 26 @.@ 3 km / h ; 16 @.@ 3 mph ) . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 All of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences , one of which was that the four later ships all used Krupp cemented armor . The waterline belt ran the full length of the ships and its thickness varied from 7 @.@ 0 inches ( 178 mm ) amidships to 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 89 mm ) at the bow and stern . The thickest part of the belt covered the middle of the ship for a length of 275 feet 2 inches ( 83 @.@ 87 m ) . It had a height of 7 feet 0 inches ( 2 @.@ 13 m ) , of which 4 feet 4 inches to 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 33 to 1 @.@ 39 m ) was normally underwater . The upper strake of belt armor was 5 @.@ 0 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck . It extended 167 feet 11 inches to 174 feet 11 inches ( 51 @.@ 18 to 53 @.@ 31 m ) from the forward to the rear barbette . The Izumo class had oblique 5 @-@ inch armored bulkhead that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel . 
 The barbettes , gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by 51 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of armor . The deck was 63 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was 356 millimeters ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness . The ships had 30 watertight compartments in their double bottom and an additional 136 or 137 between the bottom and the upper deck .

 = = = Russo @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 The sisters spent most of the Russo @-@ Japanese War as flagships together in the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet ; Iwate for the divisional commander , Rear Admiral Misu Sotarō , and Izumo for the fleet commander , Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō . They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . Iwate was moderately damaged by the Russians , but Izumo only slightly . 
 In April 1904 , the division was tasked to contain the Russian armored cruisers based at Vladivostok , but failed to do so until 13 August when the latter tried to rendezvous with the ships that attempted to breakout from Port Arthur . Unbeknownst to the Russians , Tōgō had defeated the ships from Port Arthur during the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August and the Russian squadron from Vladivostok was intercepted off Ulsan , Korea by the 2nd Division . The steering of the Russian cruiser Rurik was damaged early in the battle and the Russians made several attempts to prevent the Japanese from concentrating fire on her , but were ultimately forced to abandon her to her fate . Kamimura left Rurik to the tender ministrations of his reinforcements and pursued the two remaining Russian ships for a time before breaking off pursuit prematurely based on an incorrect report that Izumo had expended most of her ammunition . That ship was hit over 20 times , but suffered fewer than 20 men killed or wounded . Iwate , in contrast , was hit far fewer times , but one of them started a major ammunition fire that killed or wounded dozens of men . After the battle , the sisters were refitted and assigned to different units , escorting troop convoys to northern Korea , providing cover while a minefield was laid off Vladivostock , and blockading the Tsugaru Strait until the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan in mid @-@ 1905 . 
 = = = = Battle of Tsushima = = = = 
 The Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons were spotted on the morning on 27 May 1904 and Tōgō ordered his ships to put to sea . Izumo and Iwate had rejoined the 2nd Division in anticipation of this battle and Kamimura 's ships confirmed the initial spotting later that morning before joining Tōgō 's battleships . Together with most of the Japanese battleships , the division opened fire at 14 : 10 on the Russian battleship Oslyabya , which was forced to fall out of formation at 14 : 50 and sank 20 minutes later . After a failed torpedo attack was repulsed by Iwate and several other cruisers around the same time , the Russian battleship Knyaz Suvorov suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15 : 35 at short range . Kamimura 's ships engaged her for five minutes before she disappeared back into the mists . Later in the day , Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers around 17 : 30 . He abandoned his chase around 18 : 03 and encountered the Russian battleline about a half hour later . He stayed at long range and his ships fired when practicable before ceasing fire at 19 : 30 . 
 The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire and stayed beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply . Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range . Well after Nebogatov 's surrender , the coast defense ship Admiral Ushakov was spotted well south of Nebogatov 's ships and Iwate and the armored cruiser , Yakumo , were tasked to pursue her . The Japanese ships demanded that the Russians surrender when they came within range , but her captain refused . Admiral Ushakov attempted to close the range to bring the Japanese cruisers within range of her guns , but they were fast enough to keep the range open and the Russian ship could not hit either of them . After about half an hour , Admiral Ushakov had been heavily damaged to bear and her commander ordered his crew to abandon ship and the scuttling charges detonated . Both Iwate and Izumo were struck several times during the battle , but neither was significantly damaged and casualties were light . After the battle , the division covered amphibious landings in northeastern Korea in July and August before the war ended .

 Izumo was ordered to patrol the west coast of Mexico to safeguard Japanese interests and nationals during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when Japan declared war on the German Empire on 23 August 1914 . She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America . The ship assisted the armored cruiser Asama in early 1915 , when she struck a rock off Baja California . In 1917 , Izumo became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea . After the war , she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex @-@ German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan . 
 Iwate played a minor role in the war , participating in the Battle of Tsingtao before sailing to the South Sea Islands to search for German commerce raiders . The ship began the first of her many training cruises for naval cadets of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1916 , a task that would last until the end of 1939 . Izumo began making training voyages of her own during the 1920s . 
 In 1924 , four of the ships ' 12 @-@ pounder guns were removed , as were all of their QF 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder guns , and a single 40 @-@ caliber 8 cm / 40 3rd Year Type anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) gun was added . The gun had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and could fire a 3 @-@ inch , 12 @.@ 5 lb ( 5 @.@ 67 kg ) projectile with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ( 680 m / s ) to a maximum height of 23 @,@ 600 feet ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . Refitted again in 1930 – 31 , their torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6 @-@ inch guns and their casemates plated over ; they now carried only four 12 @-@ pounders . At that time , Iwate also had her boilers replaced by six water @-@ tube boilers , but Izumo was not reboilered until 1935 . The new boilers produced less steam which limited engine power to 7 @,@ 000 ihp ( 5 @,@ 200 kW ) and reduced their top speed to 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) .

 In 1932 , during the First Shanghai Incident , Izumo became the flagship of the newly re @-@ established 3rd Fleet that garrisoned Japanese @-@ occupied China . Two years later , she was equipped to operate a floatplane at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal . During the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , the ship participated in the Battle of Shanghai in mid @-@ 1937 during which she provided naval gunfire support to Japanese troops ashore . 
 Still in Shanghai at the beginning of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941 , Izumo captured the American river gunboat USS Wake and assisted in sinking the British river gunboat HMS Peterel . On 31 December , the cruiser struck a mine in the Lingayen Gulf while supporting Japanese forces during the Philippines Campaign . During this period , Iwate was still serving as a training ship in home waters . The sisters were briefly re @-@ classified as 1st @-@ class cruisers on 1 July 1942 before they became training ships in 1943 . Izumo returned to Japan late that year and joined her sister in training naval cadets . 
 In early 1945 , the sisters were rearmed when their 8 @-@ inch guns were replaced by four 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns in two twin mounts and four of their remaining 6 @-@ inch guns were removed . When firing at surface targets , the Type 89 gun had a range of 16 @,@ 100 yards ( 14 @,@ 700 m ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 30 @,@ 970 feet ( 9 @,@ 440 m ) at an elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around 8 rounds per minute . Their light anti @-@ aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of 9 ( Iwate ) and 14 ( Izumo ) license @-@ built Hotchkiss 25 @-@ millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in single , double and triple mounts and two 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in single mounts . The 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) weapon was the standard Japanese light anti @-@ aircraft gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . The twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast . The weapon had a maximum range of 24 @,@ 600 feet ( 7 @,@ 500 m ) , but effective range was only about 4 @,@ 900 – 9 @,@ 800 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 The sisters were attacked , but not hit , during the American aerial attack on Kure in July 1945 . However , the shockwaves from near misses caused extensive flooding in both ships . Iwate sank in shallow water on 25 July and Izumo capsized three days later . Both ships were removed from the navy list on 20 November and their wrecks were raised and scrapped in 1946 – 47 . 
 = Exmoor = 
 Exmoor is loosely defined as an area of hilly open moorland in west Somerset and north Devon in South West England . It is named after the River Exe , the source of which is situated in the centre of the area , two miles north @-@ west of Simonsbath . Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest , also called Exmoor , which was officially surveyed 1815 – 1818 as 18 @,@ 810 acres ( 7 @,@ 610 ha ) in extent . The moor has given its name to a National Park , which includes the Brendon Hills , the East Lyn Valley , the Vale of Porlock and 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) of the Bristol Channel coast . The total area of the Exmoor National Park is 692 @.@ 8 square kilometres ( 267 @.@ 5 sq mi ) , of which 71 % is in Somerset and 29 % in Devon . 
 The upland area is underlain by sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods with Triassic and Jurassic age rocks on lower slopes . Where these reach the coast cliffs are formed which are cut with ravines and waterfalls . It was recognised as a heritage coast in 1991 . The highest point on Exmoor is Dunkery Beacon ; at 519 metres ( 1 @,@ 703 ft ) it is also the highest point in Somerset . The terrain supports lowland heath communities , Ancient woodland and blanket mire which provide a habitat for some scarce flora and fauna . There have also been reports of The Beast of Exmoor , a <unk> cat roaming Exmoor . Several areas have been designated as Nature Conservation Review and Geological Conservation Review sites . 
 There is evidence of human occupation from the Mesolithic . This developed for agriculture and extraction of mineral ores into the bronze and Iron Ages . The remains of standing stones , cairns and bridges can still be identified . The royal forest was granted a charter in the 13th century , however foresters who managed the area were identified in the Domesday Book . In the Middle Ages sheep farming was common with a system of <unk> licensing the grazing of livestock as the Inclosure Acts divided up the land . The area is now used for a range of recreational purposes . 
 = = National Character Area = = 
 Exmoor has been designated as a national character area ( No. 145 ) by Natural England , the public body responsible for England 's natural environment . Neighbouring natural regions include The Culm to the southwest , the Devon Redlands to the south and the Vale of Taunton and Quantock Fringes to the east . 
 = = Exmoor National Park = = 
 Exmoor was designated a National Park in 1954 , under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act . The Exmoor National Park is primarily an upland area with a dispersed population living mainly in small villages and hamlets . The largest settlements are Porlock , Dulverton , Lynton , and Lynmouth , which together contain almost 40 % of the park 's population . Lynton and Lynmouth are combined into one parish and are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway . Exmoor was once a Royal forest and hunting ground , covering 18 @,@ 810 acres ( 7 @,@ 610 ha ) , which was sold off in 1818 . Several areas within the Exmoor National Park have been declared Sites of Special Scientific Interest due to their flora and fauna . This title earns the site some legal protection from development , damage and neglect . In 1993 an environmentally sensitive area was established within Exmoor . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Exmoor is an upland area formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods . The name of the geological period and system , ' Devonian ' , comes from Devon , as rocks of that age were first studied and described here . With the exception of a suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde ( within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself ) , all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group , which comprises a mix of <unk> , sandstones , slates , shales , limestone , siltstones and mudstones . Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil . The <unk> area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member ( formerly ' Formation ' ) of the Hangman Sandstone Formation ( formerly ' Group ' ) . The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset . These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions . As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation , the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform . The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet , acid soil . 
 = = = Coastline = = = 
 Exmoor has 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) of coastline . The highest sea cliff on mainland Britain ( if a cliff is defined as having a slope greater than 60 degrees ) is Great Hangman near Combe Martin at 318 metres ( 1 @,@ 043 ft ) high , with a cliff face of 250 metres ( 820 ft ) . Its sister cliff is the 250 metres ( 820 ft ) Little Hangman , which marks the edge of Exmoor . The coastal hills reach a maximum height of 314 metres ( 1 @,@ 030 ft ) at Culbone Hill . 
 Exmoor 's woodlands sometimes reach the shoreline , especially between Porlock and The Foreland , where they form the single longest stretch of coastal woodland in England and Wales . The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the diversity of plant species present . 
 The scenery of rocky headlands , ravines , waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast recognition as a heritage coast in 1991 . With its huge waterfalls and caves , this dramatic coastline has become an adventure playground for both climbers and explorers . The cliffs provide one of the longest and most isolated <unk> traverses in the UK . The South West Coast Path , at 1 @,@ 014 kilometres ( 630 mi ) the longest National Trail in England and Wales , starts at Minehead and runs along all of Exmoor 's coast . There are small harbours at Lynmouth , Porlock Weir and Combe Martin . Once crucial to coastal trade , the harbours are now primarily used for pleasure ; individually owned sailing boats and non @-@ commercial fishing boats are often found in the harbours . The Valley of the Rocks beyond Lynton is a deep dry valley that runs parallel to the nearby sea and is capped on the seaward side by large rocks , and Sexton 's Burrows forms a natural breakwater to the harbour of <unk> Bay on the coast . 
 = = = Rivers = = = 
 The high ground forms the catchment area for numerous rivers and streams . There are about 483 kilometres ( 300 mi ) of named rivers on Exmoor . The River Exe , for which Exmoor is named , rises at Exe Head near the village of Simonsbath , close to the Bristol Channel coast , but flows more or less directly due south , so that most of its length lies in Devon . It reaches the sea at a substantial ria ( estuary ) on the south ( English Channel ) coast of Devon . Historically , its lowest bridging point was at Exeter , though there is now a viaduct for the M5 motorway about 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) south of the city centre . It has several tributaries which arise on Exmoor . The River Barle runs from northern Exmoor to join the River Exe at <unk> , Devon . The river and the Barle Valley are both designated as biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Another tributary , the River <unk> , flows from the <unk> Lake . 
 Most other rivers arising on Exmoor flow north to the Bristol Channel . These include the River Heddon , which runs along the western edges of Exmoor , reaching the North Devon coast at Heddon 's Mouth , and the East and West Lyn rivers , which meet at Lynmouth . Hoar Oak Water is a moorland tributary of the East Lyn River , the confluence being at Watersmeet . The River Horner , which is also known as Horner Water , rises near Luccombe and flows into Porlock Bay near Hurlstone Point . The main exception to northward @-@ draining rivers is the River Mole , which arises on the south @-@ western flanks of Exmoor . It is the major tributary of the River Taw , which itself flows northward from Dartmoor . <unk> Water is one of the small rivers running north to the coast and is associated with the Lorna Doone legends . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Along with the rest of South West England , Exmoor has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England . The mean annual temperature at Simonsbath is 8 @.@ 3 ° C ( 46 @.@ 9 ° F ) with a seasonal and diurnal variation , but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK . January is the coldest month , with mean minimum temperatures between 1 and 2 ° C ( 34 and 36 ° F ) . July and August are the warmest months in the region , with mean daily maxima around 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . In general , December is the month with the least sunshine and June the month with the most sun . The south west of England has a favoured location with regard to the Azores high pressure when it extends its influence north @-@ eastwards towards the UK , particularly in summer . 
 Cloud often forms inland , especially near hills , and reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the park . The average annual sunshine is about 1 @,@ 600 hours . Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection . In summer , convection , caused by the sun heating the land surface more than the sea , sometimes forms rain clouds and at that time of year a large proportion of the rainfall comes from showers and thunderstorms . Annual precipitation varies from 800 mm ( 31 in ) in the east of the park to over 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 in ) at The Chains . However , in the 24 hours of 16 August 1952 , more than 225 mm ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) of rain fell at The Chains . This rainfall , which followed an exceptionally wet summer , led to disastrous flooding in Lynmouth with 34 dead and extensive damage to the small town . 
 Snowfall is very variable from year to year and ranges from 23 days on the high moors to about 6 on coastal areas . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , with June to August having the lightest winds . The wind comes mostly from the south west . 
 There are two Met Office Weather stations recording climate data within Exmoor : <unk> and Nettlecombe . 
 = = History = = 
 There is evidence of occupation of the area by people from Mesolithic times onward . In the Neolithic period , people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland , rather than act purely as hunters and as gatherers . It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools , weapons , containers and ornaments started in the late Neolithic , and continued into the bronze and Iron Ages . An earthen ring at Parracombe is believed to be a Neolithic henge dating from 5000 – 4000 BC , and Cow Castle , which is where White Water meets the River Barle , is an Iron Age fort at the top of a conical hill . 
 Tarr Steps are a prehistoric ( circa 1000 BC ) clapper bridge across the River Barle , about 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) south east of Withypool and 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) north west of Dulverton . The stone slabs weigh up to 5 tonnes apiece and the bridge has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building , to recognise its special architectural , historical or cultural significance . There is little evidence of Roman occupation apart from two fortlets on the coast . <unk> is the site of several standing stones and cairns which have been scheduled as ancient monuments . The stone settings are between 0 @.@ 3 metres ( 1 ft 0 in ) and 0 @.@ 65 metres ( 2 ft 2 in ) high . A series of Bronze Age stone cairns are closely associated with the standing stones . 
 Holwell Castle , at Parracombe , was a Norman motte @-@ and @-@ bailey castle castle built to guard the junction of the east – west and north – south trade routes , enabling movement of people and goods and the growth of the population . Alternative explanations for its construction suggest it may have been constructed to obtain taxes at the River Heddon bridging place , or to protect and supervise silver mining in the area around Combe Martin . It was 40 metres ( 131 ft ) in diameter and 6 @.@ 2 metres ( 20 ft ) high above the bottom of a rock cut ditch which is 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 9 ft ) deep . It was built , in the late 11th or early 12th century of earth with timber palisades for defence and a one or two storey wooden dwelling . It was probably built by either Martin de Tours , the first lord of the manor of Parracombe , William de Falaise ( who married Martin 's widow ) or Robert fitz Martin , although there are no written records to validate this . The earthworks of the castle are still clearly visible from a nearby footpath , but there is no public access to them . 
 = = = Establishment of royal forest = = = 
 According to the late 13th century Hundred Rolls , King Henry II of England ( d . 1189 ) gave William of Wrotham the office of steward of Exmoor . The terms steward , warden and forester appear to be synonymous for the king 's chief officer of the royal forest . 
 = = = Wardens = = = 
 The first recorded wardens were Dodo , Almer & Godric who were named in the Domesday Book ( 1087 ) as " foresters of <unk> " , Withypool having been the ancient capital of the forest . The family of Denys were associated with Ilchester and " Petherton " . William of Wrotham , who died in 1217 , was steward of the forests of Exmoor and North Petherton , Somerset . Walter and Robert were named as foresters of Exmoor when they witnessed an early 13th century grant to Forde Abbey . In 1276 the jurors of <unk> manor made a complaint about John de Camera in the Court of Exchequer in which he was described as forester of Exmoor . 
 William Lucar of " <unk> " , the brother of Elizabeth Lucar , was forester <unk> under Henry VI , between 1422 and 1461 . William de Botreaux , 3rd Baron Botreaux was appointed in 1435 warden of the forests of Exmoor and Neroche for life by Richard Duke of York . The Botreaux family had long held the manor of Molland at the southern edge of Exmoor , but were probably resident mainly at North Cadbury in Somerset . On 10 May 1461 William Bourchier , 9th Baron <unk> ( 1407 @-@ 1470 ) , feudal baron of Bampton was appointed by King Edward IV as Master Forester of the Forests of Exmoor and Neroche for life . Sir John Poyntz of Iron Acton , Gloucestershire , was warden or chief forester of Exmoor in 1568 when he brought an action in the Court of Exchequer against Henry Rolle ( of <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , the powerful lord of the manors of Exton , <unk> and Withypool . 
 In 1608 Sir Hugh Pollard was named as chief forester in a suit brought before the Court of Exchequer by his deputy William <unk> . James Butler , 1st Duke of Ormonde , was named as Keeper of Exmoor Forest in 1660 and 1661 . James Boevey was a forester in the 17th century . Sir Richard Acland ( or possibly Sir Thomas Dyke Acland ) was the last forester up to 1818 . One of the roles of the Warden was Master of Staghounds and this role continued to be exercised by the Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds , a position extant today . By 1820 the royal forest had been divided up . A quarter of the forest , 10 @,@ 262 acres ( 4 @,@ 153 ha ) , was sold to John Knight ( 1765 – 1850 ) in 1818 . This section comprises the present Exmoor Parish , whose parish church is situated in Simonsbath . 
 = = Wool trade = = 
 The parish of Exmoor Forest was part of the Hundred of Williton and <unk> . 
 During the Middle Ages , sheep farming for the wool trade came to dominate the economy . The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven , <unk> , dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster . The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed , leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields . During the 16th and 17th centuries the commons were overstocked with <unk> livestock , from farmers outside the immediate area who were charged for the privilege . This led to disputes about the number of animals allowed and the enclosure of land . In the mid @-@ 17th century James Boevey was the warden . The house that he built at Simonsbath was the only one in the forest for 150 years . When the royal forest was sold off in 1818 , John Knight bought the Simonsbath House and the accompanying farm for £ 50 @,@ 000 . He set about converting the royal forest into agricultural land . He and his family also built most of the large farms in the central section of the moor as well as 35 @.@ 4 km ( 22 @.@ 0 mi ) of metalled access roads to Simonsbath and a 46 @.@ 7 km ( 29 @.@ 0 mi ) wall around his estate , much of which still survives . 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century a mine was developed alongside the River Barle . The mine was originally called Wheal Maria , then changed to Wheal Eliza . It was a copper mine from 1845 – 54 and then an iron mine until 1857 , although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552 . At Simonsbath , a restored Victorian water @-@ powered sawmill , which was damaged in the floods of 1992 , has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order ; it is now used to make the footpath signs , gates , stiles and bridges for various sites in the park .

 In addition to the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) , two other areas are specifically designated . North Exmoor covers 12 @,@ 005 @.@ 3 hectares ( 29 @,@ 666 acres ) and includes the Dunkery Beacon and the Holnicote and Horner Water Nature Conservation Review sites , and the Chains Geological Conservation Review site . The Chains site is nationally important for its south @-@ western lowland heath communities and for transitions from Ancient woodland through upland heath to blanket mire . The site is also of importance for its breeding bird communities , its large population of the nationally rare heath fritillary butterfly ( <unk> <unk> ) , an exceptional woodland lichen flora and its palynological interest of deep peat on the Chains . 
 The South Exmoor SSSI is smaller , covering 3 @,@ 132 @.@ 7 hectares ( 7 @,@ 741 acres ) and including the River Barle and its tributaries with submerged plants such as alternate water @-@ <unk> ( Myriophyllum <unk> ) . There are small areas of semi @-@ natural woodland within the site , including some which are ancient . The most abundant tree species is sessile oak ( Quercus petraea ) , the shrub layer is very sparse and the ground flora includes bracken , bilberry and a variety of mosses . The heaths have strong breeding populations of birds , including whinchat ( Saxicola rubetra ) and European stonechat ( Saxicola rubicola ) . <unk> ( Oenanthe oenanthe ) are common near stone boundary walls and other stony places . Grass warbler ( Locustella naevia ) breed in scrub and tall heath . Trees on the moorland edges provide nesting sites for redpoll ( <unk> <unk> ) , common buzzard ( Buteo buteo ) and raven ( Corvus corax ) . 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 <unk> heath and moorland cover about a quarter of Exmoor landscape . Some moors are covered by a variety of grasses and sedges , while others are dominated by heather . There are also cultivated areas including the Brendon Hills , which lie in the east of the National Park . There are also 3 @,@ 000 hectares ( 7 @,@ 413 acres ) of forestry commission woodland , comprising a mixture of broad @-@ leaved ( oak , ash and hazel ) and conifer trees . Horner Woodlands and Tarr Steps woodlands are prime examples . The country 's highest beech tree , 350 metres ( 1 @,@ 148 ft ) above sea level , is at Birch Cleave at Simonsbath but beech in hedgebanks grow up to 490 metres ( 1 @,@ 608 ft ) . At least two species of whitebeam tree : Sorbus <unk> and Sorbus ' Taxon D ' are unique to Exmoor . These woodlands are home to lichens , mosses and ferns . Exmoor is the only national location for the lichens <unk> <unk> , <unk> fimbriata and <unk> <unk> , the latter having been found only on one individual tree . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 Sheep have grazed on the moors for more than 3 @,@ 000 years , shaping much of the Exmoor landscape by feeding on moorland grasses and heather . Traditional breeds include Exmoor Horn , Cheviot and Whiteface Dartmoor and <unk> Dartmoor sheep . North Devon cattle are also farmed in the area . Exmoor ponies can be seen roaming freely on the moors . They are a landrace rather than a breed of pony , and may be the closest breed to wild horses remaining in Europe ; they are also one of the oldest breeds of pony in the world . The ponies are rounded up once a year to be marked and checked over . In 1818 Sir Thomas Acland , the last warden of Exmoor , took thirty ponies and established the Acland Herd , now known as the Anchor Herd , whose direct descendants still roam the moor . In the Second World War the moor became a training ground , and the breed was nearly killed off , with only 50 ponies surviving the war . The ponies are classified as endangered by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , with only 390 breeding females left in the UK . In 2006 a Rural Enterprise Grant , administered locally by the South West Rural Development Service , was obtained to create a new Exmoor Pony Centre at <unk> , at a disused farm with 7 hectares ( 17 acres ) of land with a further 56 hectares ( 140 acres ) of moorland . 
 Red deer have a stronghold on the moor and can be seen on quiet hillsides in remote areas , particularly in the early morning . The Emperor of Exmoor , a red stag ( Cervus elaphus ) , was Britain 's largest known wild land animal , until it was killed in October 2010 . The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects . Birds seen on the moor include merlin , peregrine falcon , Eurasian curlew , European stonechat , dipper , Dartford warbler and ring ouzel . Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor , probably as a result of a reduction in habitat management , and for the former species , an increase in visitor pressure . 
 = = = Beast = = = 
 The Beast of Exmoor is a <unk> cat ( see phantom cat ) that is reported to roam Exmoor . There have been numerous reports of eyewitness sightings . The BBC calls it " the famous @-@ yet @-@ elusive beast of Exmoor " . Sightings were first reported in the 1970s although it became notorious in 1983 , when a South Molton farmer claimed to have lost over 100 sheep in the space of three months , all of them apparently killed by violent throat injuries . Descriptions of its colouration range from black to tan or dark grey . It is possibly a cougar or black leopard which was released after a law was passed in 1976 making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity outside zoos . In 2006 , the British Big Cats Society reported that a skull found by a Devon farmer was that of a puma ; however , the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) states , " Based on the evidence , Defra does not believe that there are big cats living in the wild in England .

 The National Park , 71 % of which is in Somerset and 29 % in Devon , has a resident population of 10 @,@ 600 . It was designated a National Park in 1954 , under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act . About three quarters of the park is privately owned , made up of numerous private estates . The largest landowners are the National Trust , which owns over 10 % of the land , and the National Park Authority , which owns about 7 % . Other areas are owned by the Forestry Commission , Crown Estate and Water Companies . The largest private landowner is the <unk> Land Company , which represents hunting interests . 
 From 1954 on , local government was the responsibility of the district and county councils , which remain responsible for the social and economic well @-@ being of the local community . Since 1997 the Exmoor National Park Authority , which is known as a ' single purpose ' authority , has taken over some functions to meet its aims to " conserve and enhance the natural beauty , wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks " and " promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the parks by the public " , including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment . 
 The Park Authority receives 80 % of its funding as a direct grant from the government . The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils , and six appointed by the Secretary of State . The work is carried out by 80 staff including rangers , volunteers and a team of estate workers who carry out a wide range of tasks including maintaining the many miles of rights of way , hedge laying , fencing , <unk> , walling , invasive weed control and habitat management on National Park Authority land . There are ongoing debates between the authority and farmers over the biological monitoring of SSSIs , showing the need for a controlled regime of grazing and burning ; farmers claim that these regimes are not practical or effective in the long term . 
 = = Sport and recreation = = 
 Sightseeing , walking , cycling and mountain biking taking in Exmoor 's dramatic heritage coastline and moorland countryside scenery are the main attractions . The South West Coast Path which starts at Minehead and follows all along the Exmoor coast before continuing to Poole . The Coleridge Way is a 82 km ( 51 mi ) footpath which follows the walks taken by poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Lynmouth , starting from Coleridge Cottage at Nether Stowey in the Quantocks where he once lived . The Two Moors Way runs from <unk> in South Devon to Lynmouth on the coast of North Devon , crossing parts of both Dartmoor and Exmoor . Both of these walks intersect with the South West Coast Path , Britain 's longest National Trail . Other Exmoor walking trails include the Tarka Trail , Samaritans Way South West , Macmillan Way West , Exe Valley Way and Celtic Way Exmoor Option . 
 For others , although the hunting of animal with hounds was made illegal by the Hunting Act 2004 , the Exmoor hunts still meet in full regalia and there is a campaign to resurrect this rural sport . Nine hunts cover the area – the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and the Quantock Staghounds , the Exmoor , Dulverton West , Dulverton Farmers and West Somerset Foxhounds , the Minehead Harriers , the West Somerset Beagles and the North Devon Beagles . During the spring , amateur steeplechase meetings ( point @-@ to @-@ points ) are run by hunts at temporary courses such as Bratton Down and Holnicote . These , along with thoroughbred racing and pony racing , are an opportunity for farmers , hunt staff and the public to witness a day of traditional country entertainment .

 The attractions of Exmoor include 208 Scheduled monuments , 16 conservation areas , and other open access land as designated by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 . Exmoor receives approximately 1 @.@ 4 million visitor days per year which include single day visits and those for longer periods . 
 Attractions on the coast include the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway , which connects Lynton to neighbouring picturesque Lynmouth at the confluence of the East Lyn & West Lyn rivers , nearby Valley of Rocks and Watersmeet . 
 Woody Bay , a few miles west of Lynton , is home to the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway , a narrow @-@ gauge railway which once connected the twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth to Barnstaple , about 31 km ( just over 19 miles ) away . 
 Further along the coast , Porlock is a quiet coastal town with an adjacent salt marsh nature reserve and a harbour at nearby Porlock Weir . Watchet is a historic harbour town with a marina and is home to a carnival , which is held annually in July . 
 Inland , many of the attractions are small towns and villages or linked to the river valleys , such as the ancient clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the Snowdrop Valley near <unk> Cross , which is carpeted in snowdrops in February and , later , displays bluebells . Withypool is also in the Barle Valley , the Two Moors Way passes through the village . As well as Dunster Castle , Dunster 's other attractions include a priory , dovecote , yarn market , inn , packhorse bridge , mill and a stop on the West Somerset Railway . Exford lies on the River Exe . 
 Exmoor has been the setting for several novels including the 19th century Lorna Doone : A Romance of Exmoor by R. D. Blackmore , and Margaret Drabble 's 1998 novel The Witch of Exmoor . The park was featured on the television programme Seven Natural Wonders twice , as one of the wonders of the West Country .

 " Unapologetic Bitch " is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna for her thirteenth studio album , Rebel Heart ( 2015 ) . It was written by Madonna , Thomas Wesley Pentz , <unk> Garcia , Bryan Orellana , Maureen McDonald and Toby Gad , with production being done by Madonna , Garcia & Teenwolf , BV , Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid . The song 's demo was leaked to the internet in December 2014 , with twelve other tracks from the album . Its final version was released on December 20 , 2014 , with five other tracks on the iTunes store , as " an early Christmas gift " to avoid more leakage . The song was conceived while Madonna was in the studio with Diplo , who worked with the singer on more than eight songs for the album .

 While recording for her thirteenth studio album , Madonna enlisted American DJ and producer Diplo to work with her on some songs . In May 2014 , she posted three photos on her Instagram account , which revealed she was working the producer . She called him " a slave driver " in the studio . Diplo commented that he met Madonna because of her kids and then she invited him to a party , and they ended up writing seven songs together . He continued : " I do not usually feel pressured to write hits , but when it ’ s an artist of this <unk> , it ’ s obvious that I want to push the <unk> a little bit further and surpass myself . " He claimed she was " up for anything " and that he " love [ s ] when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them , and Madonna was very open @-@ minded to my ideas ... she was down from day one . " He added : 
 " I 've done about three weeks with her , and we ’ re gonna do some more projects at the end of July . She ’ s just really cool . I think as far as artists reinventing themselves , she did it before anybody else . She kind of began that trend of actually coming back with a whole new look and style and sound and winning it and hitting the top of the charts . Those records are gonna be crazy @-@ sounding . We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing . " 
 In December 2014 , some reports suggested that the album was set to be named Unapologetic Bitch , since it was the title of one of the thirteen track demos that leaked to the Internet in December 2014 , as well as the hashtag that she used frequently on Instagram while working on the album . However , she later confirmed the album to be titled Rebel Heart , while releasing six completed tracks as pre @-@ order for the album on iTunes Store , on December 20 , 2014 , as an " early Christmas gift " to avoid more material being leaked . " Unapologetic Bitch " was among the six tracks and it was revealed that Diplo produced it . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Unapologetic Bitch " was written by Madonna , Diplo , <unk> Garcia , Bryan Orellana , Maureen McDonald and Toby Gad , with production being completed by Madonna , Garcia & Teenwolf , DV , Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid . Diplo , Garcia & Teenwolf were the song 's musicians , Demacio " Demo " Castellon and Nick Rowe were the song 's engineers , with Castellon also serving as the song 's mixer , Gad contributed to additional programming and Angie Teo to additional mixing . It is a reggae pop song , with a dancehall groove , having air horns and military drum beats , with the song " morphing slide guitar into lasers " and " squalling dub sirens " during its bridge . Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald added that Madonna 's voice is " tweaked at times to sound cartoonish amid Jamaican off @-@ beat guitars and <unk> synthesiser noise . " 
 Lyrically , " Unapologetic Bitch " talks about a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength , with Madonna " shooting a few poison arrows into the heart of some dude who 's done her wrong , " as noted by Rolling Stone 's Rob Sheffield . During the song , she repeatedly labels an ex 's bad behavior as " bullshit " and tells him , " fuck you " . In another part , she mocks , " When we did it , I 'll admit it , wasn 't satisfied . " In the chorus , she sings : " It might sound like I ’ m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is . " The song was allegedly written about Madonna 's ex @-@ boyfriend Brahim <unk> . She told Rolling Stone that the song " it 's like , fuck you , I 'm going to have fun . You think you 're going to ruin my life and you think that it 's over for me , but guess what ? It 's not . Life goes on . " While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word " bitch " numerous times in two songs from the album , Madonna explained : 
 I think that 's bullshit . The word police can fuck off . I don 't want to be policed ! I 'm not interested in political correctness . The word " bitch " means a lot of different things . Everything is about context . When I first moved to England and heard the word " cunt " , I was horrified . People were calling each other cunts ! And then I realized that , in that culture , it was different — they slapped each other on the back and said , " Who 's the cunt , right , you 're my best mate ! " The word " fuck " doesn 't just mean sexual intercourse . I mean , " You 're a stupid fuck , " " Are you going to fuck with me ? " " Fuck off ! " ... Sex has nothing to do with any of those expressions , and the same goes for " bitch " . If I say to you , " I 'm a badass bitch , " I 'm owning myself , I 'm saying , " I 'm strong , I 'm tough , and don 't mess with me . " If I say , " Why are you being such a bitch to me ? , " well , that means something else .

 The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics . While analyzing " Unapologetic Bitch " and " Bitch I 'm Madonna " , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that " their titles suggesting vulgarity , their execution flinty and knowing , " and also picked " Unapologetic Bitch " as one of the album 's highlights . Kitty Empire of The Guardian noted that the songs with the word " bitch " in the title " bode well " , expressing that " Unapologetic Bitch " is even better , where " Diplo lays Madonna down over some dancehall . Santigold was doing similar things in ’ 08 , but the method remains sound . " Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also noticed that it " resembles watered @-@ down Santigold . " Amy Pettifer of The Quietus applauded the line , " you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me " , calling it " the killer nugget of this track , " which she labelled " [ w ] <unk> good , " while Time 's Jamieson Cox thought that it was " fun to hear Madonna deliver a line like , ' It might sound like I ’ m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is ' because she has three ’ decades worth of unapologetic bitchiness in her back pocket . It ’ s an easy score , sure , but it ’ s effective . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it " brilliant " , while Lee DeVito of Metro Times called it " one of the more enjoyable tracks " on the album . 
 Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called the song " the standout " among the first six tracks on the album , calling it " a breakup rant over a Diplo @-@ produced dancehall groove , " noting that " Madonna writing herself a theme song called ' Unapologetic Bitch ' is like Springsteen doing one called ' Jersey Guy Who <unk> a Lot ' . " Caryn Ganz of the same publication named it a " refreshing , reggae @-@ tinged [ track ] . " Saeed Saeed of The National labelled it " a peppy reggae track , [ where ] Madonna gives h [ er e @-@ x ] a smackdown , " comparing it to Diplo 's former work with Sri Lankan artist and former Madonna collaborator M.I.A .. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it " defiant " , but informed that it " strikes more than a few poses copied from the Gwen Stefani playbook . " Gavin Haynes of NME opined that the song " could 've fallen off the back of a Major Lazer album . " While calling it " interesting " , Lydia Jenkin of The New Zealand Herald criticized Madonna 's voice , which according to her , " sounds out of place , and overly thin in the context of the track . " In other hand , Spin 's Andrew Unterberger provided a very positive note about the song , claiming : 
 " ' Unapologetic Bitch ' is about as successful and seamless a rebranding as Madge could ask for in the year 2015 . Co @-@ written and produced by Diplo , a man prone to the occasional bout of unapologetic bitchiness himself , the reggae @-@ tinged banger is as <unk> exhilarating as ' Human Nature ' was 20 years ago , but now Madonna is done with even feigning shock at being told what not to talk about , instead casually proffering , ' I gotta call it like it is . ' "

 Madonna performed " Unapologetic Bitch " on her Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 – 16 ) . The song was the penultimate track on the tour setlist , before the show 's encore , " Holiday " . For the performance , Madonna invited a member of the audience to join her during the song , and while dancing with them and playfully spanking the guest , she finished the performance giving a banana as a " gift " . The first guest during the opening night in Montreal , Canada was the song 's producer Diplo . The singer turned him around and simulated insertion of the fruit , while saying : " There ’ s so many things you can do with a banana . " Other artists included Amy Schumer , Nelly Furtado , Anderson Cooper , Graham Norton and Katy Perry , who was called the " Best Unapologetic Bitch Ever " by Madonna . 
 Jon Pareles of The New York Times called the performance " jibe , but a more celebratory one , " while Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture named it " a crowd @-@ pleaser " . Writing for The Daily Telegraph , Neil McCormick praised the fact that the singer " sound [ ed ] spontaneous and unscripted and her pleasure in performing is undeniable and infectious , " noticing that " [ s ] he delighted the London audience [ ... ] for an absurdly improvised funky dance that seems likely to become a YouTube meme . " Reviewing the show for The Guardian , Peter Robinson called her performance " relaxed and comfortable " .

 Blue Wing Blitz ( <unk> ) is a Japanese @-@ exclusive tactical role @-@ playing game developed and published by Square on July 5 , 2001 for the WonderSwan Color and compatible with the WonderSwan . 
 Unlike standard tactical video games , Blue Wing Blitz focuses on aerial battles , fought with aircraft , which can be customized . The events of the game begins in the Esk Republic , in an unnamed fictional world . Esk is threatened by the militaristic empire of Ordia , and the player 's party is given the mission to repel the invasion . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Blue Wing Blitz is a traditional turn @-@ based tactical role @-@ playing game , although it has the particularity of involving mostly aerial warfare units . These are moved on a grid map , and an encounter with an enemy unit opens a separate , close @-@ up combat screen in which up to two ally units and two enemy units engage in a short dogfight ; the player using menu commands to attack , change altitude or take evasive maneuvers . 
 Different parts of each unit can be damaged , and the success of each attack depends on the units ' stats as well as maneuvers . Several ground units are also present on the grid map , and can only be destroyed by bombers . The level of fuel and amount of ammunition of each unit are limited and must be replenished when necessary . 
 After each mission , aircraft can be upgraded , customized or remodeled with various weapons and equipment developed in factory . Which upgrades are available depends on the player 's degree of success in the precedent mission .

 The fictional world of Blue Wing Blitz is composed of floating islands , and usage of aircraft is widespread . Most of the islands are owned and ruled by the expansionist Ordia Empire , which possess superior aircraft . One of the independent states is the Esk Republic , a rich agrarian nation which supplies food to other countries , such as the United Federation of <unk> or the Kingdoms of <unk> and <unk> . At the beginning of the game , <unk> , the Prime Minister of Esk , assembles a rebel force to reclaim territories menaced by Ordia . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The players controls the members of Esk 's rebel force , who each have a distinct aircraft . The main character of the game is a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old pilot trainee named <unk> , from <unk> Village , while the second playable character is Payer , a female senior pilot of the same age . She volunteers to defend <unk> from enemy armies and meets <unk> , who becomes enlisted in the rebel force as an officer . The third playable character , <unk> , is a veteran piloting a flying gunboat . 
 Other playable characters include notably Blore , a strategist and devoted pilot of the royal air force of <unk> ; and <unk> , his younger sister and bomber pilot . Roster , an ally of Ordia who secretly leads the <unk> Spirit resistance also joins the player 's party ; as does <unk> , the fourth prince of <unk> and bomber pilot , and his female guard <unk> .

 Blue Wing Blitz was officially announced on March 8 , 2001 , and was Square 's second original title for Bandai 's Japan @-@ exclusive handheld console WonderSwan Color , after Wild Card . A trailer of the game was featured in the bonus DVD included in the Japanese release of Final Fantasy X. 
 The game was developed by the same team responsible for the Front Mission series , while the characters were designed by Nobuyuki Ikeda . The score for the game , which was never released in album form , was composed by Kumi Tanioka and was the first time that she composed a soundtrack entirely by herself . 
 A 95 @-@ page official strategy guide , titled Blue Wing Blitz Freedom Fighter 's Guide , was published by DigiCube on the same date as the game . The contents include information on the characters and the setting , battle system explanations , map screenshots , and reference and data tables .

 Blue Wing Blitz sold poorly , with around 20 @,@ 000 units sold one year after its release . In a preview of the title , the gaming website GIA praised the graphics of the game , stating that Nobuyuki Ikeda 's character designs " add style and charm " to the battles and cutscenes despite simple field graphics and the console 's technical limitations . RPGamer noted that the game 's focus on aircraft was an " interesting new take on a classic concept " . 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish used Blue Wing Blitz as an example of one of the WonderSwan 's major games . 
 = Dixie Mission = 
 The United States Army Observation Group , commonly known as the Dixie Mission , was the first U.S. effort to establish official relations with the Communist Party of China and the People 's Liberation Army , then headquartered in the mountainous city of Yan 'an . This mission was launched on 22 July 1944 during World War II , and lasted until 11 March 1947 . 
 In addition to establishing relations , the goal was to investigate the Communist Party politically and militarily , and determine if the U.S. would benefit from establishing liaison . John S. Service , of the United States Department of State , was responsible for political analysis , and Colonel David D. Barrett of the United States Army performed the military analysis . Initially , they reported that the Chinese Communists might be useful wartime and post @-@ war ally , and that the atmosphere in Yan 'an was more energetic and less corrupt than in Nationalist areas . After the war , the Dixie Mission 's reports , and Service and Barrett , were condemned by pro @-@ Chinese Nationalist factions in the American government and fell victim to McCarthyism . Service was fired from his position at the State Department , and Barrett was denied a promotion to brigadier general . 
 The Dixie Mission hosted the Patrick Hurley and George Marshall diplomatic missions to negotiate a unification of the Chinese Communists and Nationalists . Both diplomatic efforts failed . Later , the brief existence of the Dixie Mission served as a positive memory between the People 's Republic of China and the United States during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon when official relations between the two countries were re @-@ established . Veterans of the Dixie Mission , like John Service and Koji Ariyoshi , were among the first Americans invited to visit the People 's Republic of China . 
 = = Origin = = 
 Prior to the Dixie Mission , the U.S considered military interventions into CPC held China , such as an unimplemented idea by the Office of Strategic Services to send agents into north China . The Dixie Mission began , according to John Paton Davies , Jr . ' s memo , on January 15 , 1944 . Davies , a Foreign Service Officer serving in the China Burma India Theater ( CBI ) , called for the establishment of an observers ' mission in Chinese Communist territory . Davies argued that the communists offered attractive strategic benefits in the fight against Japan and that the more the U.S. ignored the communists , the closer Yan 'an - the ' capital ' of CPC held China - would move to Moscow . With the support of Davies ' superior , General Joseph Stilwell , this memorandum successfully convinced the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt to put the plan into motion . 
 The Roosevelt Administration asked Chinese Nationalist president Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's permission to send U.S. observers to visit the CPC . Initially , Chiang was hostile to the proposal and delayed action . The Generalissimo consented after foreign correspondents that he had permitted to visit Yan 'an reported on the CPC to U.S. readers . Chiang agreed after American Vice @-@ President Henry Wallace made a state visit to Chungking , the nationalists ' capital , in late June 1944 . John Carter Vincent , an experienced State Department China expert , assisted Wallace in persuading Chiang to allow the U.S. to visit the CPC in Yan 'an without Nationalist supervision . In exchange , the U.S. promised to replace the American commander of the Burma India Theater , General Stilwell . He was removed from command in October 1944 .

 The first members of the Dixie Mission arrived in Yan 'an on July 22 , 1944 , on an Army C @-@ 47 . This team consisted of : Colonel David D. Barrett , John S.

Whittlesey , and Staff Sergeant Anton H <unk> . . 
 The second half of the team arrived on August 7 , and consisted of : Raymond P. <unk> , Lieutenant Colonel Reginald E. Foss , Major Wilbur J. Peterkin , Major Charles E. Dole , Captain Brooke Dolan , Lieutenant Simon H. Hitch , 1st Lieutenant Louis M. Jones , Sergeant Walter Gress , and Technician 4th Class George I. Nakamura . Later , other members , including Koji Ariyoshi , joined the mission . 
 = = = At work in Yan 'an = = = 
 John Service , while under Stilwell 's command , served as a diplomatic observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking . Over the next three months , he sent a series of reports to Chungking , and sparked controversy immediately . Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists , rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society in stark contrast to the corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai @-@ shek . He was found bias . After visiting Yan 'an , Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists , such as the Communists , though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang . This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies , and this position ruined both careers . 
 Colonel David Barrett evaluated the communists ' military potential by observing war games between CPC troops and visiting war schools set up to train the Chinese officer corps . Barrett felt the CPC emphasized indoctrinating their soldiers over military training , but he believed that American advisors could train the CPC soldiers to become excellent fighters . 
 The Americans were impressed by the CPC 's attacks on the Japanese , often in guerilla raids . However , the last significant CPC military campaign against the Japanese had occurred four years earlier in the Hundred Regiments Campaign by the Chinese Communist 8th Route Army . After disastrous results , the CPC avoided large campaigns against the Japanese , but maintained an illusion as active fighters .

 = = = Hurley Mission = = = 
 On 7 November 1944 , General Patrick Hurley arrived in Yan 'an . Hurley had been in the CBI theater since August , as part of an agreement between Wallace and Chiang to provide a liaison for Chiang to communicate directly with Roosevelt and circumvent Stilwell . Successful in negotiating in the private sector , Hurley was sent to China to improve operations in the China theater , which he extended to uniting the Nationalists and CPC in a unified government . Hurley approached the CPC and the KMT without knowledge of either political group , and believed that their differences were no greater than those between the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States . He failed at reconciling the Nationalists and Chinese Communists and blamed Dixie Mission staff , John Service and John Paton Davies , and others . 
 = = = Marshall and Wedemeyer Missions = = = 
 Following the Japanese surrender , the KMT and the CPC resumed the Chinese Civil War which they had set aside in the United Front to fight the Japanese in 1937 . In December 1945 , President Harry S. Truman sent General George C. Marshall to China to negotiate a ceasefire and to form a unified government between the CPC and the KMT . While Marshall spent most of his time in Chungking , the Dixie Mission hosted Marshall in Yan 'an so he could speak with the CPC leadership . Like Hurley , Marshall failed to develop a lasting compromise , and the Civil War resumed . 
 Truman then sent another representative to China , General Albert Wedemeyer , who had commanded U.S. troops in China during the war , on a fact finding mission . Again , the Dixie Mission in Yan 'an hosted the presidential mission . Wedemeyer reported that U.S. interests were best served by continued support for the Nationalist government , but Truman suppressed the report because he was waiting to see who would win and refused to expand aid the Nationalists so as to avoid involvement in the Chinese Civil War . After Wedemeyer 's visit , the U.S. packed up operations in Yan 'an and liquidated everything that could not be transported aboard a C @-@ 47 . On 11 March 1947 , the last members of the Dixie Mission left Yan 'an . 
 = = Question of Communist subterfuge = = 
 Dixie Mission participants such as John Service were criticized for viewing the CPC leadership as socialist agrarian reformers , who claimed that China under their rule would not follow the violent path of Russia under the Bolsheviks . Instead , socialism would come to China only after economic reforms that preserved capitalism , so as to mature the society to a point where it would be prepared for a peaceful transition to a communist society . This belief was disseminated to the American people prior to and during the war by the popular authors Edgar Snow and Agnes Smedley . In his August 3 , 1944 , report , " The Communist Policy Towards the Kuomintang , " Service underlined his opinion of the Communists as such and stated : 
 " And the impressive personal qualities of the Communist leaders , their seeming sincerity , and the coherence and logical nature of their program leads me , at least , toward general acceptance of the first explanation -- that the Communists base their policy toward the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which there can be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social upheaval and revolution . " 
 After the Dixie Mission , Colonel Barrett reflected upon this position and wrote in his memoir : 
 " In addition , I had fallen to some extent , not as much perhaps as did some other foreigners , for the " agrarian reformer " guff . I should have known better than this , particularly since the Chinese Communists themselves never at any time made claim to being anything but revolutionaries - period . " 
 The history of China after the revolution is that the CPC did not pursue a slow gradual change in the economy as some believed in 1944 . Regardless , 25 years later Service believed that American cooperation with the CPC might have prevented the excesses that occurred under Mao Zedong 's leadership after the war . After the same number of years , John Davies , in his memoir , Dragon by the Tail , defended his belief that the CPC would have been a better Chinese ally for the U.S. than the Kuomintang . Davies believes that the U.S. interests would have been better served allying with the CPC based on Realpolitik practical considerations . Allying with the CPC would have prevented it from allying with the Soviet Union , and lessened the risk and anxiety that the U.S. and the world experienced in the Cold War . In the " Lost Chance " theory , the United States missed the opportunity to build a friendly relationship with the CPC and prevent their later alignment with the Soviet Union . Service and Davies reported in good faith what they saw at the time . 
 = = Lasting impact = = 
 The Dixie Mission had consequences for individuals , and for the nation . Many participants were accused of being communists , such as John Davies and John Service . Both were subjected to multiple Congressional investigations that consistently found that they were not Communist Party members , agents of foreign powers , or disloyal to the United States . This did not spare Service from termination at the State Department . He appealed this decision and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in his favor . Davies was exiled from China , his field of expertise , by Hurley . Then he was hounded from a position in Russia to an inconsequential post in South America . Davies resigned that position and began manufacturing furniture . Hurley accused Colonel David Barrett of sabotaging his diplomacy with the KMT and the CPC . He succeeded in preventing Barrett from promotion to brigadier general , even though Barrett 's promotion was endorsed by the theater commander , General Albert C. Wedemeyer . Barrett was retained in the China Theater , but placed in an inferior position . 
 <unk> of the Dixie Mission contributed to the nationwide Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s . <unk> relations between the People 's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened a new chapter for the mission . For the first time , the mission and its participants became the subject of serious scholarship , and many of the mission participants were among the first Americans invited to visit China in twenty years . In China , the Dixie Mission is remembered as a positive time between the two nations , and a symbol of Sino @-@ American cooperation . 
 In 2013 , the story of the Dixie Mission served as the historical basis for a new WWII novel called Two Sons of China , by Andrew Lam ( author ) . It was released by <unk> Books in December 2013 .

 While fondly referred to as " Dixie " or the Dixie Mission , the true name of the mission was the United States Army Observation Group to Yan 'an .

 = SMS Blücher = 
 SMS Blücher was the last armored cruiser built by the German Empire . She was designed to match what German intelligence incorrectly believed to be the specifications of the British Invincible @-@ class battlecruisers . Blücher was larger than preceding armored cruisers and carried more heavy guns , but was unable to match the size and armament of the battlecruisers which replaced armored cruisers in the British Royal Navy and German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . The ship was named after the Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher , the commander of Prussian forces at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . 
 Blücher was built at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel between 1907 and 1909 , and commissioned on 1 October 1909 . The ship served in the I Scouting Group for most of her career , including the early portion of World War I. She took part in the operation to bombard Yarmouth and the raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby in 1914 . 
 At the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915 , Blücher was slowed significantly after being hit by gunfire from the British battlecruiser squadron under the command of Vice Admiral David Beatty . Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper , the commander of the German squadron , decided to abandon Blücher to the pursuing enemy ships in order to save his more valuable battlecruisers . Under heavy fire from the British ships , she was sunk , and British destroyers began recovering the survivors . However , the destroyers withdrew when a German zeppelin began bombing them , mistaking the sinking Blücher for a British battlecruiser . The number of casualties is unknown , with figures ranging from 747 to around 1 @,@ 000 . Blücher was the only warship lost during the battle . 
 = = Design = = 
 German armored cruisers — referred to as Große Kreuzer ( large cruisers ) — were designed for several tasks . The ships were designed to engage the reconnaissance forces of rival navies , as well as fight in the line of battle . The earliest armored cruiser — Fürst Bismarck — was rushed through production specifically to be deployed to China to assist in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 . Subsequent armored cruisers — with the exception of the two Scharnhorst @-@ class ships — served with the fleet in the reconnaissance force . 
 On 26 May 1906 , the Reichstag authorized funds for Blücher , along with the first two Nassau @-@ class battleships . Though the ship would be much larger and more powerful than previous armored cruisers , Blücher retained that designation in an attempt to conceal its more powerful nature . The ship was ordered under the provisional name " E " . Her design was influenced by the need to match the armored cruisers which Britain was known to be building at the time . The Germans expected these new British ships to be armed with six or eight 9 @.@ 2 in ( 23 cm ) guns . In response , the German navy approved a design with twelve 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns in six twin turrets . This was significantly more firepower than that of the previous Scharnhorst @-@ class of German armored cruisers , which only carried eight 21 cm guns . 
 One week after the final decision was made to authorize construction of Blücher , the German naval attache obtained the actual details of the new British ships , called the Invincible class . In fact , HMS Invincible carried eight 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns of the same type mounted on battleships . It was soon recognized that these ships were a new type of warship , which eventually came to be classified as the battlecruiser . When the details of the Invincible class came to light , it was too late to redesign Blücher , and there were no funds for a redesign , so work proceeded as scheduled . Blücher was therefore arguably obsolete even before her construction started , and was rapidly surpassed by the German Navy 's battlecruisers , of which the first ( Von der Tann ) was ordered in 1907 . Despite this , Blücher was typically deployed with the German battlecruiser squadron . The ship ultimately cost the German government 28 @,@ 532 @,@ 000 Goldmarks . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Blücher was 161 @.@ 1 m ( 528 ft 7 in ) long at the waterline and 161 @.@ 8 m ( 530 ft 10 in ) long overall . The ship had a beam of 24 @.@ 5 m ( 80 ft 5 in ) , and with the anti @-@ torpedo nets mounted along the sides of the ship , the beam increased to 25 @.@ 62 m ( 84 ft 1 in ) . Blücher had a draft of 8 @.@ 84 m ( 29 @.@ 0 ft ) forward , but slightly less aft , at 8 @.@ 56 m ( 28 ft 1 in ) . The ship displaced 15 @,@ 842 t ( 15 @,@ 592 long tons ) at her designed weight , and up to 17 @,@ 500 t ( 17 @,@ 200 long tons ) at maximum displacement . Her hull was constructed with both transverse and longitudinal steel frames , and she had 13 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for approximately 65 % of the length of the hull . 
 Documents from the German naval archives generally indicate satisfaction with Blücher 's minor pitch and gentle motion at sea . However , she suffered from severe roll , and with the rudder hard over , she heeled over up to 10 ° from the vertical and lost up to 55 % of her speed . Blücher 's metacentric height was 1 @.@ 63 m ( 5 ft 4 in ) . The ship had a standard crew of 41 officers and 812 enlisted men , with an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors when she served as a squadron flagship . She carried a number of smaller vessels , including two picket boats , three barges , two launches , two yawls , and one dinghy .

 Blücher was equipped with three vertical 4 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Each engine drove a propeller , the center screw being 5 @.@ 3 m ( 17 ft 5 in ) in diameter , while the outer two screws were slightly larger , at 5 @.@ 6 m ( 18 ft 4 in ) in diameter . The ship had a single rudder with which to steer . The three engines were segregated in individual engine rooms . With six marine @-@ type double boilers per room , the ship contained a total of 18 coal @-@ fired boilers . The ship had a designed maximum speed of 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mph ) , but during her trials , she achieved 25 @.@ 4 knots ( 47 @.@ 0 km / h ; 29 @.@ 2 mph ) . At a cruising speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , Blücher could steam for 6 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 200 km ; 7 @,@ 600 mi ) . At a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) , her range was cut down to 3 @,@ 250 nmi ( 6 @,@ 020 km ; 3 @,@ 740 mi ) . The ship was designed to carry 900 t ( 890 long tons ) of coal , though voids in the hull could be used to expand the fuel supply to up to 2 @,@ 510 t ( 2 @,@ 470 long tons ) of coal . Electrical power for the ship was supplied by six turbo @-@ generators that provided up to 1 @,@ 000 kilowatts , rated at 225 volts . The highest power ever achieved by a reciprocating engine warship was the 37 @,@ 799 indicated horsepower ( 28 @,@ 187 kW ) produced by Blücher on her trials in 1909 . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Blücher was equipped with twelve 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 27 in ) SK L / 45 quick @-@ firing guns in six twin turrets , one pair fore and one pair aft , and two pairs in wing turrets on either side of the superstructure . The guns were supplied with a total of 1 @,@ 020 shells , or 85 rounds per gun . Each shell weighed 108 kg ( 238 lb ) , and was 61 cm ( 24 in ) in length . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 30 ° , providing a maximum range of 19 @,@ 100 m ( 20 @,@ 900 yd ) . Their rate of fire was 4 – 5 rounds per minute . 
 The ship had a secondary battery of eight 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 91 in ) quick @-@ firing guns mounted in MPL C / 06 casemates , four centered amidships on either side of the vessel . These guns could engage targets out to 13 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 800 yd ) . They were supplied with 1320 rounds , for 165 shells per gun , and had a sustained rate of fire of 5 – 7 rounds per minute . The shells were 45 @.@ 3 kg ( 99 @.@ 9 lb ) , and were loaded with a 13 @.@ 7 kg ( 30 @.@ 2 lb ) RPC / 12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge . The guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 835 m ( 2 @,@ 740 ft ) per second , and were expected to fire around 1 @,@ 400 shells before they needed to be replaced . 
 Blücher was also armed with sixteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 46 in ) SK L / 45 quick @-@ firing guns , placed in both casemates and pivot mounts . Four of these guns were mounted in casemates near the bridge , four in casemates in the bow , another four in casemates at the stern , and the remaining four were mounted in pivot mounts in the rear superstructure . They were supplied with a total of 3 @,@ 200 rounds , or 200 shells per gun , and could fire at a rate of 15 shells per minute . Their high explosive shells weighed 10 kg ( 22 lb ) , and were loaded with a 3 kg ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) RPC / 12 propellant charge . These guns had a life expectancy of around 7 @,@ 000 rounds . The guns had a maximum range of 10 @,@ 700 m ( 11 @,@ 700 yd ) . 
 Blücher was also equipped with four 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . One was placed in the bow , one in the stern , and the other two were placed on the broadside , all below the waterline . The ship carried a total of 11 torpedoes . The torpedoes carried a 110 kg ( 240 lb ) warhead and had two speed settings , which affected the range . At 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , the weapon had a range of 2 @,@ 000 m ( 2 @,@ 200 yd ) and at 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) , the range was reduced to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 As with other German capital ships of the period , Blücher was equipped with Krupp cemented armor . The armored deck was between 5 – 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) in thickness ; more important areas of the ship were protected with thicker armor , while less critical portions of the deck used the thinner armor . The armored belt was 18 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship where machinery , ammunition magazines , and other vitals were located , and tapered to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) in less important areas of the hull . The belt tapered down to zero at either end of the ship . Behind the entire length of the belt armor was an additional 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) of teak . The armored belt was supplemented by a 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) torpedo bulkhead , though this only ran between the forward and rear centerline gun turrets . 
 The forward conning tower was the most heavily armored part of the ship . Its sides were 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick and it had a roof that was 8 cm thick . The rear conning tower was significantly less well armored , with a roof that was 3 cm thick and sides that were only 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) thick . The central citadel of the ship was protected by 16 cm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) armor . The main battery turrets were 8 cm thick in their roofs , and had 18 cm sides . The 15 cm turret casemates were protected by 14 cm of armor . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Blücher was launched on 11 April 1908 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1909 . She served as a training ship for naval gunners starting in 1911 . In 1914 , she was transferred to the I Scouting Group along with the newer battlecruisers Von der Tann , Moltke , and the flagship Seydlitz . The first operation in which Blücher took part was an inconclusive sweep into the Baltic Sea against Russian forces . On 3 September 1914 , Blücher , along with seven pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the IV Squadron , five cruisers , and 24 destroyers sailed into the Baltic in an attempt to draw out a portion of the Russian fleet and destroy it . The light cruiser Augsburg encountered the armored cruisers Bayan and Pallada north of Dagö ( now Hiiumaa ) island . The German cruiser attempted to lure the Russian ships back towards Blücher so that she could destroy them , but the Russians refused to take the bait and instead withdrew to the Gulf of Finland . On 9 September , the operation was terminated without any major engagements between the two fleets . 
 On 2 November 1914 , Blücher — along with the battlecruisers Moltke , Von der Tann , and Seydlitz , and accompanied by four light cruisers , left the Jade Bight and steamed towards the English coast . The flotilla arrived off Great Yarmouth at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port , while the light cruiser Stralsund laid a minefield . The British submarine HMS D5 responded to the bombardment , but struck one of the mines laid by Stralsund and sank . Shortly thereafter , Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters . On the way , a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight , so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved and they could safely navigate the defensive minefields . The armored cruiser Yorck made a navigational error that led her into one of the German minefields . She struck two mines and quickly sank ; only 127 men out of the crew of 629 were rescued . 
 = = = Bombardment of Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby = = = 
 Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , commander of the German High Seas Fleet , decided that another raid on the English coast should be carried out in the hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed . At 03 : 20 , CET on 15 December 1914 , Blücher , Moltke , Von der Tann , the new battlecruiser Derfflinger , and Seydlitz , along with the light cruisers Kolberg , Strassburg , Stralsund , Graudenz , and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade estuary . The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland , until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse , at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough . Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade , the High Seas Fleet , consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and eight pre @-@ dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers , seven light cruisers , and 54 torpedo boats , departed to provide distant cover for the bombardment force . 
 On 26 August 1914 , the German light cruiser Magdeburg had run aground in the Gulf of Finland ; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy , which found code books used by the German navy , along with navigational charts for the North Sea . These documents were then passed on to the Royal Navy . Room 40 began decrypting German signals , and on 14 December , intercepted messages relating to the plan to bombard Scarborough . The exact details of the plan were unknown , and it was assumed that the High Seas Fleet would remain safely in port , as in the previous bombardment . Vice Admiral Beatty 's four battlecruisers , supported by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron , along with the 2nd Battle Squadron 's six dreadnoughts , were to ambush Hipper 's battlecruisers . 
 On the night of 15 / 16 December , the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers . Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack , Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat . Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl 's reversal , and so he continued with the bombardment . Upon reaching the British coast , Hipper 's battlecruisers split into two groups . Seydlitz , Moltke , and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool , while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby . Of the three towns , only Hartlepool was defended by coastal artillery batteries . During the bombardment of Hartlepool , Seydlitz was hit three times and Blücher was hit six times by the coastal battery . Blücher suffered minimal damage , but nine men were killed and another three were wounded . By 09 : 45 on the 16th , the two groups had reassembled , and they began to retreat eastward . 
 By this time , Beatty 's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper 's chosen egress route , while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement . At 12 : 25 , the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper . One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty . At 12 : 30 , Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships . Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper 's ships , but the battlecruisers were some 50 km ( 27 nmi ; 31 mi ) ahead . The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron , which had been screening for Beatty 's ships , detached to pursue the German cruisers , but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions . This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers . The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape . 
 Both the British and the Germans were disappointed that they failed to effectively engage their opponents . Admiral Ingenohl 's reputation suffered greatly as a result of his timidity . The captain of Moltke was furious ; he stated that Ingenohl had turned back " because he was afraid of eleven British destroyers which could have been eliminated ... Under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing . " The official German history criticized Ingenohl for failing to use his light forces to determine the size of the British fleet , stating : " He decided on a measure which not only seriously jeopardized his advance forces off the English coast but also deprived the German Fleet of a signal and certain victory . " 
 = = = Battle of Dogger Bank = = = 
 In early January 1915 the German naval command found out that British ships were conducting reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area . Admiral Ingenohl was initially reluctant to attempt to destroy these forces , because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while Von der Tann was in drydock for periodic maintenance . Konteradmiral ( counter admiral ) Richard Eckermann — the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet — insisted on the operation , and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank . 
 On 23 January , Hipper sortied , with Seydlitz in the lead , followed by Moltke , Derfflinger , and Blücher , along with the light cruisers Graudenz , Rostock , Stralsund , and Kolberg and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half @-@ Flotillas . Graudenz and Stralsund were assigned to the forward screen , while Kolberg and Rostock were assigned to the starboard and port , respectively . Each light cruiser had a half @-@ flotilla of torpedo boats attached . 
 Again , interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role . Although they were unaware of the exact plans , the cryptographers of Room 40 were able to deduce that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area . To counter it , Beatty 's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron , Rear Admiral Gordon Moore 's 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron and Commodore William Goodenough 's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were to rendezvous with Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt 's Harwich Force at 08 : 00 on 24 January , approximately 30 nmi ( 56 km ; 35 mi ) north of the Dogger Bank . 
 At 08 : 14 , Kolberg spotted the light cruiser Aurora and several destroyers from the Harwich Force . Aurora challenged Kolberg with a searchlight , at which point Kolberg attacked Aurora and scored two hits . Aurora returned fire and scored two hits on Kolberg in retaliation . Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire , when , almost simultaneously , Stralsund spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position . This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming toward Hipper 's ships . Hipper later remarked : 
 The presence of such a large force indicated the proximity of further sections of the British Fleet , especially as wireless intercepts revealed the approach of 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron ... They were also reported by Blücher at the rear of the German line , which had opened fire on a light cruiser and several destroyers coming up from astern ... The battlecruisers under my command found themselves , in view of the prevailing [ East @-@ North @-@ East ] wind , in the windward position and so in an unfavourable situation from the outset ... 
 Hipper turned south to flee , but was limited to 23 kn ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) , which was Blücher 's maximum speed at the time . The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at 27 kn ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , and quickly caught up to the German ships . At 09 : 52 , Lion opened fire on Blücher from a range of approximately 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) ; shortly after , Princess Royal and Tiger began firing as well . At 10 : 09 , the British guns made their first hit on Blücher . Two minutes later , the German ships began returning fire , primarily concentrating on Lion , from a range of 18 @,@ 000 yd ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . At 10 : 28 , Lion was struck on the waterline , which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker . At around this time , Blücher scored a hit with a 21 cm shell on Lion 's forward turret . The shell failed to penetrate the armor , but had concussion effect and temporarily disabled the left gun . At 10 : 30 , New Zealand — the fourth ship in Beatty 's line — came within range of Blücher and opened fire . By 10 : 35 , the range had closed to 17 @,@ 500 yd ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) , at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships . Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to engage their German counterparts . 
 By 11 : 00 , Blücher had been severely damaged after having been pounded by numerous heavy shells from the British battlecruisers . However , the three leading German battlecruisers , Seydlitz , Derfflinger , and Moltke , had concentrated their fire on Lion and scored several hits ; two of her three dynamos were disabled and the port side engine room had been flooded . At 11 : 48 , Indomitable arrived on the scene , and was directed by Beatty to destroy the battered Blücher , which was already on fire and listing heavily to port . One of the ship 's survivors recounted the destruction that was being wrought : 
 The shells ... bore their way even to the stokehold . The coal in the bunkers was set on fire . Since the bunkers were half empty , the fire burned merrily . In the engine room a shell licked up the oil and sprayed it around in flames of blue and green ... The terrific air pressure resulting from [ an ] explosion in a confined space ... roar [ ed ] through every opening and [ tore ] its way through every weak spot ... Men were picked up by that terrific air pressure and tossed to a horrible death among the machinery . 
 The British attack was interrupted due to reports of U @-@ boats ahead of the British ships . Beatty quickly ordered evasive maneuvers , which allowed the German ships to increase the distance from their pursuers . At this time , Lion 's last operational dynamo failed , which reduced her speed to 15 kn ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Beatty , in the stricken Lion , ordered the remaining battlecruisers to " Engage the enemy 's rear " , but signal confusion caused the ships to target Blücher alone . She continued to resist stubbornly ; Blücher repulsed attacks by the four cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron and four destroyers . However , the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron flagship , Aurora , hit Blücher twice with torpedoes . By this time , every main battery gun turret except the rear mount had been silenced . A volley of seven more torpedoes was launched at point @-@ blank range ; these hits caused the ship to capsize at 13 : 13 . In the course of the engagement , Blücher had been hit by 70 – 100 large @-@ caliber shells and several torpedoes . 
 As the ship was sinking , British destroyers steamed towards her in an attempt to rescue survivors from the water . However , the German zeppelin L5 mistook the sinking Blücher for a British battlecruiser , and tried to bomb the destroyers , which withdrew . Figures vary on the number of casualties ; Paul <unk> reported 6 officers of a total of 29 and 275 enlisted men of a complement of 999 were pulled from the water , for a total of 747 men killed . The official German sources examined by Erich Gröner stated that 792 men died when Blücher sank , while James Goldrick referred to British documents , which reported only 234 men survived from a crew of at least 1 @,@ 200 . Among those who had been rescued was Kapitan zur See ( captain at sea ) Erdmann , the commanding officer of Blücher . He later died of pneumonia while in British captivity . A further twenty men would also die as prisoners of war . 
 The concentration on Blücher allowed Moltke , Seydlitz , and Derfflinger to escape . Admiral Hipper had originally intended to use his three battlecruisers to turn about and flank the British ships , in order to relieve the battered Blücher , but when he learned of the severe damage to his flagship , he decided to abandon the armored cruiser . Hipper later recounted his decision : 
 In order to help the Blücher it was decided to try for a flanking move ... But as I was informed that in my flagship turrets C and D were out of action , we were full of water aft , and that she had only 200 rounds of heavy shell left , I dismissed any further thought of supporting the Blücher . Any such course , now that no intervention from our Main Fleet was to be counted on , was likely to lead to further heavy losses . The support of the Blücher by the flanking move would have brought my formation between the British battlecruisers and the battle squadrons which were probably behind . 
 By the time Beatty regained control over his ships , after having boarded HMS Princess Royal , the German ships had too great a lead for the British to catch them ; at 13 : 50 , he broke off the chase . Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the destruction of Blücher and the near sinking of Seydlitz , and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor . Rear Admiral Eckermann was removed from his post and Admiral Ingenohl was forced to resign . He was replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl . 
 = John Adams ( drummer ) = 
 John Adams ( born 1951 ) is a dedicated fan of the Cleveland Indians , a Major League Baseball team based in Cleveland , Ohio . Adams has played his bass drum in the bleacher seats during nearly every Indians home game since 1973 , which has brought him notoriety and recognition from the Indians and other organizations . The Indians now pay for two season tickets for Adams and his drum , he has been involved in two ceremonial first pitches , and he is the only fan for whom the Indians have dedicated a bobblehead day . 
 = = Drumming = = 
 Adams first drummed at an Indians game on August 24 , 1973 , at Cleveland Stadium , at a game in which the Indians beat the Texas Rangers , 11 – 5 . Adams , who was 21 years old at the time , has stated that he brought his bass drum to that first game because he wanted to add to the noise of " seat banging " , a tradition at Cleveland Stadium in which fans would bang the swivel seat of their chairs against the chair 's base during tense moments in the game . But Adams preferred to sit in the bleachers , where there were no seats to bang . 
 During the game , Bob <unk> , a reporter for the Cleveland Press , interviewed Adams and asked if he was going to drum again at the following game . Adams said no , but <unk> wrote in his article that he would . According to Adams , " not to make a liar out of Bob , I showed up with my drum , and then I came to the next game and the next game and the next game . " The Indians ' promotions director at the time , Jackie York , also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game . Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum . 
 Ever since , Adams has sat in the highest bleacher seat in left @-@ center field with his bass drum ; as of August 2013 he has missed only 38 home games in more than 40 seasons . Adams played at Cleveland Stadium until October 1993 , when the Indians played their last game there . Next spring he moved with the team to its new ballpark , Jacobs Field ( renamed Progressive Field in 2008 ) . Adams played the drum at his 3,000th game on April 27 , 2011 . During his tenure , he has witnessed Indians pitcher Len Barker pitch a perfect game on May 15 , 1981 , and witnessed the Indians play in the 1995 and 1997 World Series . 
 Adams still uses the same 26 @-@ inch @-@ wide bass drum he began with in 1973 . He has stated that he bought it as part of a set for $ 25 at a garage sale . It has the same head on the side of the drum that Adams does not beat , but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year . During games , Adams tends to drum at particular moments : when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game , if the Indians have runners in scoring position , if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game , or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning . Because of his drumming , Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom @-@ Boom , by Indians radio announcer Herb Score . It has also helped him meet politicians , including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official . 
 = = = Recognition = = = 
 Adams has been recognized by the Cleveland Indians and other organizations for his long commitment to the team . On October 4 , 2007 , he threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Indians ' first game in the 2007 American League Division Series , against the New York Yankees . After Adams drummed at his 3,000th game on April 27 , 2011 , the Indians celebrated it the following Saturday , on April 30 , 2011 , by incorporating Adams in the ceremonial first pitch and putting on a pregame parade featuring Adams ' fellow Indians fans carrying bongos , snares and plastic toy drums . For the ceremonial first pitch , Adams swung at the ball with his drum from home plate after it was thrown by former Indians player Joe <unk> . Soon after the move to Jacobs Field , Cleveland began a record @-@ breaking run of sellouts , which ended at 455 games in April 2001 . Soon after , the Indians retired the number 455 in honor of their fans and Adams helped unveil the commemorative sign . 
 Adams once paid for his tickets ( one for himself , and one for his drum ) , but the Indians now pay for two of his season tickets in honor of the contributions he has made to the ballpark atmosphere . Adams buys an additional two season tickets . In 2006 , the Indians gave out bobblehead dolls depicting Adams , making him the only fan for whom the team has dedicated a bobble head day . 
 In 2008 , he won the Hilda Award , which is awarded annually by The Baseball Reliquary " to recognize distinguished service to the game by a baseball fan " and is named in memory of Hilda Chester , a dedicated fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers . In April 2012 , Great Lakes Brewing Company , a Cleveland @-@ based brewery and brewpub , released a product called Rally Drum Red Ale in honor of Adams and Opening Day . In April 2015 , The Plain Dealer columnist Tim <unk> wrote a column suggesting that a statue of Adams be built in Cleveland in his honor . 
 Adams also has a plaque located by his seat just under the left field scoreboard commemorating his tenure as the Indians ' " # 1 Fan " .
