 Empires was received positively by critics , according to review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings . The game 's sales , when combined with those of Empire Earth , surpassed 2 @.@ 5 million units by May 2004 . Game Informer 's Adam Biessener called Empires " a good knockoff " of WarCraft III and Age of Mythology , worthwhile for fans of the RTS genre . He praised its Empire Builder and Action modes , and the uniqueness of its multiplayer mode ; but he found its single @-@ player campaigns to be lackluster . Jonah Jackson of X @-@ Play , Ron Dulin of Computer Gaming World and Stephen Poole of PC Gamer US were similarly unimpressed by the game 's single @-@ player mode : the last critic highlighted its " stupendously loquacious cut @-@ scenes and terrible voice @-@ acting " . However , Poole dubbed Empires a strong , streamlined and fully featured multiplayer game , which he recommended despite its flaws and lack of innovation . Jackson lauded the multiplayer component as well , and he believed that , while the game at first seems unoriginal , Empires is " the most mature and well @-@ balanced of Goodman 's titles " . 
 Regarding the single @-@ player campaigns , PC Zone 's writers noted strong level design and " voice acting of the highest calibre " ; and they praised the multiplayer mode 's " balance and diversity " . However , they criticized the pathfinding , interface , unoriginality and inconsistent graphical quality of Empires , and they named it the inferior of Medieval : Total War and Rise of Nations . Conversely , Dulin agreed with Jackson that Empires is a deceptively conventional RTS , which introduces " great , if initially <unk> , changes to the standard formula . " He summarized it as a well @-@ made competitor to historical RTS titles like Rise of Nations , Age of Empires and Empire Earth . Writing for GameSpot , Sam Parker argued that Empires separated itself from rivals Age of Empires II : The Age of Kings and Age of Mythology , and he commented , " While it may not have the breadth of Rise of Nations ' real @-@ time empire building , the tight scope deals out dividends when it comes to fast @-@ paced battles . " 
 Steve Butts of IGN , along with GameSpy 's Rausch , called Empires a major improvement on the foundation of Empire Earth , thanks to its smaller scope and deeper gameplay . Like the staff of PC Zone , both writers enjoyed the single @-@ player mode , although Rausch noted its middling writing and voice acting . Rausch considered the multiplayer mode to be Empires ' best feature : he felt that its Empire Builder and Action modes were both balanced , and that each civilization " offers players a completely different experience " . He noted the game 's audiovisual presentation as a low point . Butts found fault with the game 's camera system , but he summarized Empires as a unique RTS and " a good direction for the genre " .

 In a slight decrease from the previous week , the episode was viewed in 7 @.@ 97 million homes in its original airing , according to Nielsen ratings , in the United States . The episode also acquired a 2 @.@ 8 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , slightly edging out The Simpsons , in addition to significantly winning over series creator Seth MacFarlane 's second show on Fox , American Dad ! , in both rating and total viewership . It was the 35th most @-@ watched episode of the week . 
 Reviews of the episode were mostly mixed , stating that the episode had " its moments , [ ... ] but as a whole , it was somewhat lacking . " Ahsan Haque of IGN found it to be " one of the most bizarre and tasteless episodes of the season . " Furthermore , Haque noted , " as with almost every episode of Family Guy , the plot takes many strange twists and turns . That often this leads to a muddled story with no sense of direction . " Haque also stated , that he was " amused by Peter 's static shocking escapade " and " liked the restaurant themed story angle , " saying that it was well executed . Overall , Haque finally noted that the episode managed to recapture some of the show 's " so @-@ offensive @-@ you @-@ have @-@ to @-@ groan " feel that was prevalent during the first few seasons . The fight with the Cripple @-@ Tron ranked tenth position on IGN 's Top 10 Fights in the show . Brett Love of TV Squad found the cultural references to be a " mixed bag , " but noted his enjoyment of the restaurant scenes , as well as Quagmire 's brief appearance . In closing his review , Love stated , " Overall , this one just didn 't work for me . It 's worth a look for a couple of the bits , but not an episode I 'll watch when it gets repeated . [ ... ] They can 't all be gems . " 
 The Parents Television Council , which has frequently criticized the series , named the episode the " Worst TV Show of the Week " for the week ending April 6 , 2007 , for its insensitivity toward the disabled , as well as its gag depicting Adolf Hitler as a scarecrow , or " Scare @-@ Jew , " as it was referred to in the episode . 
 = Linx ( railway company ) = 
 Linx AB was a railway company which operated inter @-@ Scandinavian passenger trains between 2001 and 2004 . Established as a joint venture between the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) and the Swedish state @-@ owned SJ , Linx operated the routes from Oslo , Norway , to Stockholm , Sweden , and from Oslo via Gothenburg , Sweden , to Copenhagen , Denmark . Services were provided up to ten times per day . However , slow speeds caused by curvy infrastructure in Norway , combined with competition from low @-@ cost airlines , caused the company to lose money , and eventually grounded operations . The services were taken over by NSB and SJ . Linx . The main rolling stock were eleven X2 electric multiple units , although it used Rc @-@ hauled trains on the Gothenburg – Oslo service . The company was based in Gothenburg . 
 = = History = = 
 Linx was established following an informal agreement between the ministers of transport in Norway , Sweden and Denmark to establish high @-@ speed rail connection between the countries ' capitals . Linx was the train operating part of the agreement , while the governments would have to invest in better rail infrastructure to allow higher speeds . 
 The company was introduced by NSB and SJ on 12 May 2000 . The stated plans were to start with the service from Gothenburg to Copenhagen in January 2001 , from Oslo to Gothenburg in June , and from Oslo to Stockholm in January 2002 . The company would have its head office in Gothenburg and would lease rolling stock from SJ . NSB 's chief executive officer , Osmund Ueland , became the company 's first chair . The company had a share capital of 10 million Swedish krona ( SEK ) and was owned in equal shares by NSB and SJ . The company 's first train ran on 7 January , from Gothenburg to Copenhagen . Service from Oslo to Gothenburg started on 17 June . 
 Because Linx was only to operate profitable routes , it was decided that the company not take over the night train service from Oslo to Copenhagen . NSB stated that they wanted all inter @-@ Scandinavian passenger transport to be operated by the new company , and therefore decided to terminate the night train as of September 2 . Although the night trains were filled during the summer and parts of the winter , there was a low ridership during the rest of the year . However , it was a lack of engineers that forced NSB to terminate the night train service as of 20 June . There were protests against the ending of the service , particularly in Norway . Marketing Director Øyvind <unk> of Linx stated that " we are concentrating on the day trains . We want to develop a holistic concept , where new modern trains are a major part . Night trains do not fit into this concept " . 
 X2 trains were never introduced on the section from Gothenburg to Oslo . Linx stated that investments for NOK 2 billion were needed on the Østfold Line to reach a travel time from Oslo to Gothenburg of 3 hours and 30 minutes , rather than the more than 4 hours at the time . In contrast , the Norway / Vänern Line on the Swedish side of the border meets the necessary standards . 
 The first service from Oslo to Stockholm ran on 16 June 2002 . Initially there were only three daily services , but later that year , two more daily services were introduced . At the same time , travel time was reduced by 20 minutes , as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations . Linx operated with different prices on the same route , depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden . The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone , in part because Norwegians were willing to pay more , and in part because the sales system in Sweden was more automated . 
 In July 2003 , Linx reduced the number of daily services from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four . The company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership . Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines , who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport , Gardermoen and Stockholm @-@ Arlanda Airport . Ryanair also provided an airline service , but with fewer departures and with the same center @-@ to @-@ center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport , Torp and Stockholm @-@ <unk> Airport . From 1 September 2003 , Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda , and became a more direct competitor to Linx . From 27 October , Nordic Airlink ( later <unk> ) also started a flight between the same airports . With shorter travel time from center to center and comparable fares , Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx . 
 Starting on December 15 , NSB took over three of the daily services from Oslo to Gothenburg , by extending three of the InterCity services along the Østfold Line onwards from Halden Station to Gothenburg . On 24 January 2004 , a Linx train derailed at Vestby Station on the Østfold Line . None of the 50 passengers were hurt in the incident . 
 On 11 June 2004 , NSB and SJ stated that they would discontinue Linx , and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004 . The company had never made a profit , and the new low @-@ cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40 % . The only part of the service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad , which SJ intended to continue . NSB stated that if a new Oslo – Stockholm service was to be introduced , it would require state grants . In September , SJ 's CEO Jan Forsberg stated that the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway . While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen , the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable . Linx had by then transported 1 @.@ 3 million passengers , and Forsberg stated that had the company transported 1 @.@ 7 million people , it would have been profitable . 
 The closing was criticized by two engineers , who stated that the company actually made a profit , but ended up paying 24 % of their revenue in ticket commission to SJ and NSB . In 2003 , the company had a revenue of SEK 426 @.@ 8 million , of which SEK 411 million was from ticket sales . The company had a deficit of SEK 33 @.@ 8 million , of which NSB covered SEK 8 @.@ 1 million and SJ SEK 25 @.@ 6 million . However , NSB took a commission of SEK 10 @.@ 8 million and SJ SEK 58 @.@ 5 million . This gave a profit , before provisions , of SEK 35 @.@ 5 million . In comparison , Narvesen took a commission of 2 @.@ 7 % for tickets sold by NSB . 
 The closing of the Oslo – Stockholm service was the first time there was not a train service between the capitals since 1871 , when the line opened . In addition , the service cut occurred at the same time as the centennial of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden . On 4 November , SJ and NSB stated that they would continue the service , but only on weekends . They stated that an increased service would either require financial grants from the states , or introduction of duty @-@ free sales on board . 
 = = Service = = 
 Travel time from Oslo to Stockholm was 4 hours and 30 minutes , with stops at Oslo Central Station , Lillestrøm Station , Kongsvinger Station , Karlstad Central Station , and Stockholm Central Station . When the service was launched , a ticket from Oslo to Stockholm cost NOK 563 , or NOK 326 if bought at least seven days before departure . Two people under the age of 16 could travel for free when accompanying an adult . Later , minimum prices of NOK 280 were launched , while maximum price for business class was NOK 1300 . Tickets were slightly cheaper to purchase in Sweden than in Norway . About 185 @,@ 000 passengers took the train from Oslo to Stockholm each year . 
 Travel time from Gothenburg to Copenhagen was 3 hours and 30 minutes . The X2 trains had a speed of up to 200 kilometres per hour ( 120 mph ) on the West Coast Line from Gothenburg Central Station to Malmö Central Station , and then ran along the Oresund Line via Copenhagen Airport , <unk> Station to Copenhagen Central Station . A ticket from Gothenburg to Copenhagen cost NOK 1119 in business class , NOK 803 in second class , and with reduced prices down to NOK 342 if bought in advance or for weekend travel . 
 Travel time from Oslo to Gothenburg was slightly more than four hours . Prices varied from NOK 633 for a business class ticket , NOK 355 for a second class ticket to NOK 187 for pre @-@ booked tickets . X2 trains were never introduced on the section from Oslo to Gothenburg . Instead , conventional Swedish trains from the 1960s hauled by Rc locomotives were used . Passengers traveling from Oslo to Copenhagen had to change train in Gothenburg .

 On the sections Oslo – Stockholm and Gothenburg – Copenhagen , Linx operated X2 electric multiple units owned by SJ . Forty @-@ three units were delivered to SJ by Kalmar Verkstad between 1990 and 1997 . The trains are standard gauge , have a power output of 3 @,@ 260 kilowatts ( 4 @,@ 370 hp ) and a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour ( 120 mph ) . Each train consists of a locomotive , a number of middle cars and an end car . The trains use 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC power supply in Sweden and Norway , and 25 kV 50 Hz AC in Denmark . Linx had two classes : business and second . On business class , a warm meal and drink was included , while in second class , a restaurant car was provided . Seats had a power outlet for laptops , and free wireless Internet .

 Annika Sörenstam ( pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; listen ; born 9 October 1970 ) is a retired Swedish professional golfer , one of the most successful female golfers in history . Before stepping away from competitive golf at the end of the 2008 season , she had won 90 international tournaments as a professional , making her the female golfer with the most wins to her name . She has won 72 official LPGA tournaments including ten majors and 18 other tournaments internationally , and she tops the LPGA 's career money list with earnings of over $ 22 million — over $ 3 million ahead of her nearest rival . Since 2006 , Sörenstam has held dual American and Swedish citizenship . 
 The winner of a record eight Player of the Year awards , and six Vare Trophies given to the LPGA player with the lowest seasonal scoring average , she is the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition . She holds various all @-@ time scoring records including the lowest season scoring average : 68 @.@ <unk> in 2004 . 
 Representing Europe in the Solheim Cup on eight occasions between 1994 and 2007 , Sörenstam was the event 's all @-@ time leading points earner until her record was surpassed by England 's Laura Davies during the 2011 Solheim Cup . 
 In 2003 , Sörenstam made history at the Bank of America Colonial tournament as the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since 1945 .

 At the age of 12 , she switched to golf , sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister — Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even — and earned her first handicap of 54 . She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three @-@ putt at the end of a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech .

 Sörenstam turned professional in 1992 , but missed her LPGA Tour card at the final qualifying tournament by one shot , and began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour ( LET ) , formerly known as the <unk> . She was invited to play in three LPGA Tour events in 1993 , where she finished <unk> , 4th , and <unk> , earning more than $ 47 @,@ 000 . She finished second four times on the Ladies European Tour and was 1993 Ladies European Tour Rookie of the Year . By tying for 28th at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament she earned non @-@ exempt status for the 1994 season . Sörenstam 's first professional win came at the 1994 Holden Women 's Australian Open on the ALPG Tour . 
 In the United States , Sörenstam was LPGA Rookie of the Year , had three top @-@ 10 finishes including a tie for second at the Women 's British Open and made her Solheim Cup debut . Her breakout year was 1995 , when she won her first LPGA Tour title at the U.S. Women 's Open . She finished at the top of the Money List and was the first non @-@ American winner of the Vare Trophy . She became the second player ever to be Player of the Year and Vare Trophy winner the year after being Rookie of the Year . A win at the 1995 Australian Ladies Masters and two other wins on the Ladies European Tour put her top of the LET Order of Merit and made her the first player to top both the European and LPGA Tour money lists in the same season . Her success worldwide resulted in her winning the <unk> award in Sweden , the country 's most prestigious award in sports as well as being awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal . 
 1996 saw Sörenstam win her home LET tournament , the Trygg Hansa Ladies ' Open in Sweden and three LPGA tournaments including the U.S. Women 's Open . In defending her title , she became the first non @-@ American to win back to back U.S. Women 's Open titles , passed the $ 1 million mark in LPGA career earnings , and won her second consecutive Vare Trophy . 
 She won six tour events in 1997 , regaining the money list and player of the year titles . Internationally , she won on the <unk> and defended her home LET title at the renamed Compaq Open . She became the first player in LPGA history to finish a season with a sub @-@ 70 scoring average of 69 @.@ 99 en route to retaining the 1998 Player of the Year and Money List titles as well as winning the LET Swedish tour stop for the third time running . September 1999 saw Sörenstam change her on @-@ course team replacing her caddie of six years , Colin Cann , with Terry McNamara . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 At this point in her career , Sörenstam says she lost focus having reached her biggest goals . Karrie Webb became the best LPGA Tour player but Sörenstam still managed to win more LPGA tournaments than any other LPGA Tour player during the 1990s . She qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch 's / Circle K Championship , but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on the LPGA tour in October 2003 . Sörenstam was the first international player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame through the LPGA criteria . 
 Having lost her preeminent position , Sörenstam embarked on a new five @-@ day @-@ a @-@ week exercise program including weight @-@ lifting and balance work which by 2003 added over 20 yards ( 18 m ) to her driving distance . During the 2001 season , she had eight LPGA wins , became the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition and the first LPGA player to cross the $ 2 million mark in single @-@ season earnings . She set or tied a total of 30 LPGA records en route to regaining the Vare Trophy and winning her fourth Player of the Year and Money List titles in 2001 . In a made @-@ for @-@ TV alternate shot competition between the two best male and female players in the world , Sörenstam and Tiger Woods beat Karrie Webb and David Duval . 
 At the end of that season Karrie Webb said she " would eat her hat " if Sörenstam repeated her eight wins in 2002 . Sörenstam accomplished that feat , joining Mickey Wright as the only players to win 11 LPGA tournaments in one season , earning her fifth Player of the Year title and fifth Vare Trophy . She successfully defended the Kraft Nabisco Championship , her fourth major victory , and also won the ANZ Ladies Masters in Australia and Compaq Open in Sweden on the Ladies European Tour giving her 13 wins in 25 starts worldwide in 2002 . 
 Amid notable controversy , Sörenstam was invited to play in the PGA Tour 's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth , Texas , in May 2003 , making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe <unk> , who qualified for the 1945 Los Angeles Open . Vijay Singh , fourth in the world rankings at the time , was particularly critical of her presence ; he was quoted saying she had no business playing and he hoped she missed the cut , although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized . Cheered through each hole , she shot five over par , tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds , missing the cut . After shooting 1 @-@ over @-@ par 71 in the first round , finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot , Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance . Through the first round she led the field in driving accuracy , was in the top 20 in greens in regulation , and was 84th out of 111 in driving distance . Unfortunately , poor putting ( last in the field , averaging over a two @-@ putt ) cost her a spot on the first page of the first round leaderboard and ultimately caused her to miss the cut . 
 Later in the 2003 season , she won the LPGA Championship and the Women 's British Open , becoming only the sixth player to complete the LPGA Career Grand Slam . She had five other victories worldwide , set or tied a total of 22 LPGA records and earned her sixth Player of the Year award . She competed against Fred Couples , Phil Mickelson and Mark O 'Meara in the 2003 Skins Game , finishing second with five skins worth $ 225 @,@ 000 ; Sörenstam holed a 39 @-@ yard ( 36 m ) bunker shot on the ninth hole — the eighth eagle in Skins Game history . In September , she was part of the winning European Solheim Cup team in her native Sweden . She was awarded her second <unk> award in Sweden plus the 2003 Golf Writers ' Trophy by the Association of Golf Writers . 
 Sörenstam 's dominance continued in 2004 with her seventh LPGA Player of the Year award tying Kathy Whitworth for the most in LPGA history . She posted 16 top @-@ 10 finishes in 18 LPGA starts , including eight wins , had two additional international wins , became the first player to reach $ 15 million in LPGA career earnings and took her own LPGA single @-@ season scoring average record to 68 @.@ <unk> , but played too few rounds to win the Vare Trophy . The Women 's Sports Foundation gave her the 2004 Sportswoman of the Year Award , and the Laureus World Sports Academy named her World Sportswoman of the Year . She also released a combination autobiography and golf instructional book , Golf Annika 's Way . 
 Sörenstam 's life both on and off the golf course changed in 2005 . In February , she announced that she had filed for divorce from David Esch , her husband of eight years , and this was finalised in August but it did not adversely affect her golf . Her achievements included being the first player in LPGA history to win a major three consecutive years at the LPGA Championship and the first golfer in LPGA or PGA history to win the same event five consecutive years at the Mizuno Classic . 11 wins in 21 tournaments entered worldwide included victory in the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika where she presented herself the trophy , giving her an eighth Money List title , tying the LPGA record , an eighth Rolex Player of the Year ( POY ) award ( a record ) and a sixth Vare Trophy . She is the only LPGA player ever to win Money List , POY award and Vare trophy in the same year in five different years . Team competition saw her make her seventh consecutive Solheim Cup appearance , her 4 points making her total 21 , the event 's all @-@ time leading points earner , and the inaugural Lexus Cup was played with Sörenstam as the Captain of the victorious International Team . 
 These events resulted in her receiving numerous awards . The Golf Writers Association of America named Sörenstam Female Player of the Year for the eighth time ( 1995 @,@ 1997 , 2000 – 2005 ) , Associated Press voted her Female Athlete of the Year for the third consecutive year and she became the first woman to win the Golf Writers ' Trophy twice in the 55 @-@ year history of European golf 's most prestigious award . Having previously won six Best Female <unk> ESPY Awards ( 1996 , 1998 – 99 , 2002 – 04 ) , Sörenstam also received the 2005 ESPY Award as Best Female Athlete 
 When the first @-@ ever official Women 's World Golf Rankings were unveiled in February 2006 , Sörenstam was confirmed as the number @-@ one player in women 's golf , a position she relinquished to Lorena Ochoa on 22 April 2007 . In partnership with Liselotte Neumann in team Sweden , she won the Women 's World Cup of Golf , opened her LPGA season with a defence of her title in the MasterCard Classic . She then went winless in eight starts , causing some to talk of a slump . Her winning drought ended at the U.S. Women 's Open , where she won an 18 @-@ hole playoff over Pat Hurst for her tenth major championship title , tying her for third on the list of players with most major championship titles . She totalled 3 wins on the LPGA and two on the Ladies European Tour , the inaugural Dubai Ladies Masters and the Swedish tournament she hosts , which she defended in her home town at the course where she learned to play . Her International team lost the second Lexus Cup competition to Team Asia . 
 Sörenstam started 2007 by losing a playoff while defending of her MasterCard Classic title . At the Kraft Nabisco Championship she shot her highest 72 @-@ hole score in a major in nine years , a result explained by her subsequent diagnosis with ruptured and bulging discs in her neck , the first major injury in Sörenstam 's 13 @-@ year LPGA career . After a two @-@ month injury rehabilitation break , Sörenstam returned as the Ginn Tribute tournament hostess where she admitted to being at only 85 % fitness and finished tied for 36th place . She was still not fully fit in her next two tournaments , the LPGA Championship where she finished tied for 15th place , and the US Women 's Open , where , as defending champion , she finished tied for 32nd . 
 After an early round defeat at the World Matchplay Championship , Sörenstam finished sixth at the Evian Masters , 16th at the Women 's British Open and ninth in the Swedish tournament she hosts on the Ladies European Tour . On her return to the US , Sörenstam had three top ten finishes but missed the weekend at the season closing ADT Playoffs for the second year running . However , Sörenstam did win a worldwide title at the Dubai Ladies Masters on the Ladies European Tour in November 2007 . 
 Declaring herself recovered from injury and ready to return to a complete season of competitive golf in 2008 , Sörenstam opened the year at the SBS Open at Turtle Bay where she captured her 70th LPGA Tour victory and first since September 2006 . She won next at the Stanford International Pro @-@ Am in April then following a week off , won again at the <unk> ULTRA Open at Kingsmill in a tournament record score , giving her three wins and over $ 1 million in earnings by mid @-@ May . It was her 72nd and final ever win on the LPGA Tour . 
 In 2008 , Sörenstam was highly critical of other female golfers who tried to play in the PGA Tour – her comments to Michelle Wie for playing on the men 's tour : " I really don 't know why Michelle continues to do this . We have a major this week and , if you can 't qualify for a major , I don 't see any reason why you should play with the men . " 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 On 13 May 2008 , Sörenstam announced at a press conference at the <unk> Classic that she would " step away " from competitive golf at the conclusion of the 2008 season . That night , she threw out the first pitch of the Washington Nationals / New York Mets baseball game at Shea Stadium in New York and the following day read the Top Ten on the Late Show with David Letterman . Her last tournament victory came in a playoff at the Suzhou <unk> Ladies Open , an event co @-@ sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour and the Ladies Asian Golf tour . Her last scheduled tournament on the LPGA Tour was the season @-@ ending ADT Championship in November , where she failed to make the weekend play in the event 's unique playoff structure . Her final sanctioned LPGA appearance was as the winning captain of Team International at the 2008 Lexus Cup in Singapore . Her last professional tournament was the Dubai Ladies Masters on the Ladies European Tour in December 2008 , where she finished tied for 7th .

 = Chana School = 
 Chana School is a Registered Historic Place in the Ogle County , Illinois , in the county seat of Oregon , Illinois . One of six Oregon sites listed on the Register , the school is an oddly shaped , two @-@ room schoolhouse which has been moved from its original location . Chana School joined the Register in 2005 as an education museum . 
 The schoolhouse was built in 1883 , in the village of Chana , Illinois . Due to the elimination of the Chana School District , the school was abandoned by the 1960s . A restoration effort was undertaken in the late 1990s , ending with a move and refurbishment in 2002 and 2003 . The building now stands in a public park along the Rock River in Oregon , Illinois . Its interior also features architectural elements which set it apart from the typical 19th @-@ century schoolhouse . From a distance , the building is dominated by its bell tower . 
 = = History = = 
 The Chana Pine Rock School was founded in 1883 . It operated until 1953 , when the school was retired . It was the only wooden , two @-@ room schoolhouse built in the area . One of the two classrooms was used by students in lower grades , the other by older students , up to eighth grade . Through the late early 1950s , one classroom was still used and the additional space used for storage . 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 The village of Chana was founded in 1871 , half a mile northwest of White Oak School , which was built in 1869 . Chana 's early settlers sent their children to White Oak School up to eighth grade , but White Oak was abandoned in 1883 when Chana School was built in a park in Chana . The White Oak building was used as a storage barn for hay until a fire destroyed it in 1886 . In 1893 , a second classroom was added to the existing structure of Chana School . 
 Chana 's first teacher was D.C. Sears , an Oregon , Illinois resident . The late 19th century saw at least ten individuals teach at Chana School at different times . By 1888 , Pine Rock Township was ready to address the question of whether or not to build a high school ; Chana students attended high school in Oregon . The question was brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to Oregon schools after eighth grade . 
 = = = After closing = = = 
 After the school closed in 1953 , the larger , original room was converted into a bus garage by the Chana School District . A large garage door was cut into the building and the floor completely removed . The smaller , 1893 room became a storage area . In 1962 , the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom . By the mid @-@ 1960s , the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District . Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down . 
 = = = Restoration = = = 
 In 1997 , the property was sold and the Chana School was nearly demolished . Citizens formed the Chana School Foundation to save the building . It was relocated to City Park East in Oregon , Illinois and volunteers began the process of refurbishing the building in August 1998 . Five years later , in September 2003 , the school had its grand opening . Since then , it has operated as a museum to help illustrate 1880s education in the United States . 
 The moving and restoration of the Chana School was facilitated , in part , by a US $ 15 @,@ 000 grant from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources . The grant was intended to help restore the building to its original state , restore a sand hill prairie on the site , develop museum exhibit space , and establish learning links to other museums in support of " the rural education focus " as part of the curriculum . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Chana School is , on one hand , typical of rural schoolhouses , with a gabled roof and trademark bell tower . On the other hand , the building is unique among 19th @-@ century schoolhouses . It does have some stylistic elements , mostly of the Italianate style . Examples include pedimented window crows and pronounced hoods over the belfry openings . However , Chana School 's architectural difference lies in its design and , thus , its floor plan . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The building is designed in the Italianate style , with the specialty leanings demanded by a schoolhouse . The front facade , which faces southwest today , is adorned with three doorways — left , right , and center — which span a front porch beneath the bell tower . When the school was open , the use of the doors was restricted . The left and right doors were used by boys in first through eighth grades while the middle door was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages . Each of the doors feature transoms topped with cornices . 
 The bell tower rises 43 feet ( 13 m ) , and halfway up its length is a large round sign . The sign denotes the school district , Pine Rock , and the year of the school 's foundation . Originally , the sign graced the front exterior wall of the larger of the two rooms . The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches , one on each side . Wooden construction is found throughout the tower , its arches , and the rest of the schoolhouse , save the limestone and cement foundation . At the bottom of each of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles . Inside the tower is the school bell . The bell house is topped with a multi @-@ gabled roof . The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms . 
 The building 's southern facade , that of the original 1883 room , features three windows . The same room has two rear windows of the same style . The windows are all double hung and of four @-@ over @-@ four design . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The south entrance to the larger room is Chana School 's most original portion . A pinewood floor , original closet , built @-@ in water stand , and pressed tin on the ceiling are among the original features found in this portion of the building . The interior of the bell tower is adorned with shelving , coat hooks , and two exits ; one into the smaller classroom and the other , between the semi @-@ circular walls , to the coat room . The bell rope hangs 14 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 4 m ) from the ceiling . 
 The interior of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance . The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter @-@ round , decoratively accented . The two curved and semi @-@ circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original , one @-@ room building . The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards . <unk> cover available space on the north , east , and south walls . Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and is used as a crown molding around the room on the walls from the ceiling to the top of the blackboards . 
 The second , newer room has also been fully restored as a schoolroom and is currently being used as a museum . The rectangular room features a half chimney , partial original oak floors , and original blackboards which are set lower for smaller children . 
 = = = Unique features = = = 
 This building , at least among schoolhouses from the time period ( 1880s ) , is architecturally unique in two ways . One feature that sets this structure apart from most rural schoolhouses of the day is the building 's design . Chana School started off as a simple , run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill , one @-@ room schoolhouse . Ten years later , however , an addition to the building attached a second , smaller classroom , perpendicular to the original . The bell tower was then constructed to connect the two rooms . The result was a unique layout resembling an " L " with its corner shaved off . Inside the building is another unique feature for schoolhouses of the time — the coat rooms are surrounded by two semi @-@ circular front walls in the original wing of the building . 
 = = Outbuildings = = 
 The only other buildings on the site are two outhouses , located to the rear of the school building . Both are non @-@ functional , display models . One outhouse is an original 1870s structure , transported to the site and reassembled . The other outhouse is a copy , built from salvaged materials during the school restoration . Neither outhouse is historically associated with Chana School and both are considered non @-@ contributing factors in the schoolhouse 's National Register of Historic Places listing . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Chana School was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 6 , 2005 . On its original nomination form to the National Register , Chana School was cited as being significant for inclusion in the Register under criteria C , which states a property : " <unk> ( ies ) the distinctive characteristics of a type , period , or method of construction , or that represent the work of a master , or that possess high artistic values , or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction . " In addition , the school was subject to considerations by the Register which allowed its inclusion despite the general policy which does not encourage the nomination of properties that have been moved from their original location . 
 = Genesis of the Daleks = 
 Genesis of the Daleks is the fourth serial of the twelfth season of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who . It was written by Terry Nation and directed by David Maloney , and originally broadcast in six weekly parts from 8 March to 12 April 1975 on BBC1 . 
 In the serial , the Fourth Doctor ( Tom Baker ) and his companions Sarah Jane Smith ( Elisabeth Sladen ) and Harry Sullivan ( Ian Marter ) are sent by members of the Doctor 's race , the Time Lords , to the time of the Daleks ' creation , to avert their future <unk> of other species . The Doctor faces the dilemma of whether he has the right to do so . 
 Genesis of the Daleks was originally commissioned under producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks , who felt that the outline submitted by Nation was too similar to his previous Dalek adventures , and encouraged him to explore the origin of the Daleks . The story introduces the Daleks ' creator Davros ( played by Michael Wisher ) , who had a unique visual design . The script was handed to Letts and Dicks ' successors , producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes , who made changes to the original script which gave it a darker tone . Nation , having intentionally modelled the Daleks on the Nazis , further explored the theme in Genesis . It also addresses the moral issues that come with time travelling and genocide . The story was filmed over January and February 1975 , with some location filming done in a quarry in <unk> . 
 Genesis of the Daleks premiered with 10 @.@ 7 million viewers and concluded five weeks later with 9 @.@ 1 million , with the least @-@ watched episode being Part Three with 8 @.@ 5 million viewers . Since its broadcast it has been widely praised as one of the series ' best . The story was novelised in 1976 by Dicks , and released as a condensed LP in 1979 , before being released on VHS in 1991 and DVD in 2006 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Doctor is intercepted while travelling from Earth to the Ark by the Time Lords for a mission to interfere in the creation of the Daleks to avert a future time when Daleks would dominate the universe . The Doctor is given a Time Ring to use to return to the TARDIS when the task is complete . The Doctor finds that he is already on the planet Skaro and joins his companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan . They find that Skaro is a war @-@ torn planet ; a generations @-@ long war of attrition between the Thals and the Kaleds for dominance of the planet has laid waste to its surface and ecology . In the midst of a poison gas attack by the Thals , the Doctor and Harry are dragged inside the Kaled dome , while Sarah is left outside . She runs into the Mutos , exiled descendants of those mutated by chemical weapons early in the war but they are captured by the Thals . Sarah and the Mutos are forced to load radioactive components into a missile , that is to be launched at the Kaled dome . Sarah attempts to lead an escape by climbing out of the rocket silo but fails . 
 The Doctor and Harry are brought before the Kaled elite : General <unk> , the leader of the Kaled army and Security Commander Nyder . The Doctor attempts to explain that they are aliens but Nyder dismisses this as their greatest scientist , Davros , has stated there is no life outside Skaro . The Doctor and Harry 's possessions , including the Time Ring , are taken but another scientist , Ronson , discovers that they really are alien . Davros enters and demonstrates his new " Mark III travel machine " , which he later dubs as the next stage of their evolution : a " Dalek " . Ronson subsequently confides in the Doctor that he and other scientists believe Davros ' research has become immoral , because he using unethical mutations to create the Daleks . The Doctor promises to tell the Kaled leaders about Davros and the Daleks if Ronson helps them to escape . The Doctor meets <unk> and other Kaled Councillors , who agree to halt Davros ' experiments . When Davros discovers this through Nyder 's spies , he prepares twenty Daleks under computer control and covertly provides the Thal leaders with a chemical to weaken the Kaled dome in order that their rocket will penetrate it . 
 The Doctor and Harry rescue Sarah from the Thal dome but in doing so , the Doctor is captured . He watches helplessly as the Thals launch their rocket and destroy the Kaled dome . At the Kaled bunker , Davros declares the Kaled race is dead , giving birth to the Daleks ; he claims Ronson provided the chemical secret to the Thals and has him executed . He instructs the next scientist , Gharman , to remove compassion and pity from the new Dalek mutations and sends them to the Thal dome to exterminate everyone . In the confusion , the Doctor , Sarah and Harry rejoin the few Thal and Mutos survivors and return to the Kaled bunker . The Doctor instructs the Thals and Mutos to try to destroy the bunker , while he and his companions go inside . They are captured by Davros , who becomes aware of the Doctor 's knowledge of the Daleks ' future . The Doctor is forced to describe all future defeats of the Daleks which Davros records , to ensure that they will never occur , later having a private audience with Davros in a failed attempt to reason with him , before being placed in a cell . 
 The Doctor and his companions are freed by another scientist , while Gharman is making his move to stop Davros ; the group using the opportunity to rig explosives in the Dalek incubation room but the Doctor finds himself unable to detonate it , asking " Have I the right ? " . The Doctor is able to avoid the choice when one of Gharman 's followers reveals that Davros appears to have succumbed to their demands and will stop his research , on the condition of a vote among the councillors . While Davros pleads his case the Doctor recovers their possessions , before he and his companions force Nyder to give him the recording of the Dalek defeats , so they can destroy it . At that time , once the remaining Kaled elite are split between him and Gharman , Davros reveals the voting was a ploy to give the Daleks time to arrive and kill the opposing group . The Doctor and his friends learn that the Thals and Mutos have prepared to detonate explosives to seal the Daleks inside the bunker and there is little time to escape . While Sarah and Harry get out , the Doctor returns to destroy the Dalek incubation chamber with a Dalek inadvertently completing the circuit and destroying the room . The Doctor then escapes before the Thal explosives detonate . 
 Acting on their will and impulses , the Daleks start a production line against Davros ' wishes , while mercilessly killing his supporters . Davros attempts to activate the bunker 's self @-@ destruct but is shot by a Dalek . Though the Daleks know they are trapped , they are confident they will eventually emerge as the superior race and dominate the universe . The Doctor , Sarah and Harry say goodbye to the surviving Thals and Mutos . While the Doctor did not stop the Daleks , he does believe he has hindered their development for perhaps a thousand years and was thus successful in his mission . The three use the Time Ring to return to their own time .

 = = = Conception and writing = = = 
 When planning stories for season 12 , producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks felt that it was time for Terry Nation to return to the series and write another Dalek adventure . Letts and Dicks enjoyed the script Nation sent in , but found it too " reminiscent " of many of his previous Dalek stories . The two suggested that Nation instead write an origin story for the Daleks , originally titled Daleks — Genesis of Terror . The serial was commissioned on 1 April 1974 , and the scripts accepted on 22 July . The stories lined up for the season were handed over to Letts and Dicks ' successors , producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes , with whom Genesis of the Daleks gained a darker tone . Holmes was not a fan of frequent appearances by the Daleks , and only allowed the story because it explored their origins . In an aim to make the series more adult , Hinchcliffe wanted the story to be " pacy " and make the Daleks appear more powerful . In a 2006 interview , Dicks said that he does not believe the story would have been much different if he and Letts were in charge , though he remarked he would have added some lighter moments to soften the " grim " tone . Director David Maloney stated that the images of war at the beginning of the serial were intended to create atmosphere , and he had no intention of losing the younger audience . 
 The production of Genesis of the Daleks saw several changes from the script . Maloney altered the opening scene to show the soldiers gunned down by machine guns in slow motion . Nation was displeased with the change , and Maloney later felt that the violent addition was " a bit much " . Hinchcliffe and Maloney were not keen on the Doctor 's original meeting with the Time Lord , which took place in a lush garden , and changed it to the Skaro war @-@ zone which they felt more appropriate . The Thal soldiers were originally supposed to be boys aged 15 or 16 to illustrate the youth of those fighting in the war , but this was later changed to make them appear more mature . In the Genesis of Terror script , Sarah Jane becomes ill in the third episode from radiation poisoning , and <unk> was a male who was introduced in the fourth episode . Part Five originally had more action in the Dalek incubator room and ended with the Doctor 's question of whether he had the right to destroy them . 
 = = = Casting and costumes = = = 
 Maloney cast John Franklyn @-@ Robbins as the Time Lord because he had worked with him before and intended his character to resemble Death in The Seventh Seal . Hilary Minster , who played a Thal soldier , had also played a Thal in Planet of the Daleks ( 1973 ) . Minster had been considered for the role of <unk> . Peter Miles previously played Dr. Lawrence in Doctor Who and the Silurians ( 1970 ) and Professor Whitaker in Invasion of the Dinosaurs ( 1974 ) . Stephen Yardley , who played the Muto <unk> , later appeared in Vengeance on <unk> ( 1985 ) . During filming of Genesis , Yardley walked into the casting department on his lunch break in costume and asked for a job ; because of his costume , they assumed he was a tramp from the street . Dennis Chinnery , who played Gharman , had previously been seen in The Chase ( 1965 ) and would later appear in The Twin Dilemma ( 1984 ) . 
 The character of Davros was designed by Nation to have created the Daleks in his image , and to also be a " spokesperson " for the Daleks as he felt it was " boring " listening to Daleks giving speeches . The design was inspired by the Mekon , a comic book character with no body but a " green , dome @-@ like head " which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood . Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros ' mask . The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher 's face by make @-@ up artist Sylvia James . Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask . Regular latex instead of the more <unk> foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive . The cast and crew regarded Davros ' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in . Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume ; they thought he was a statue at first . When sitting in Davros ' Dalek @-@ like base , Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable . To prepare during rehearsals , Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the " disorienting " situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face . Wisher , a heavy smoker , put two holes in the top of the bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals . Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton ; in some scenes , he was acting to his own pre @-@ recorded dialogue . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 Genesis of the Daleks was the last serial of the twelfth season to be filmed , after Revenge of the Cybermen . As Sarah Jane had been filmed in Revenge wearing a combat costume , it was added into Genesis that the Doctor would hand her the outfit , to which she changes into by the next scene . The story was mainly filmed in January 1975 , with some studio recording carried into February . Location filming for the serial took place at <unk> quarry in Surrey , which represented the landscape of Skaro . Having had trouble with the Daleks on location in Planet of the Daleks ( 1973 ) , Maloney scheduled shooting so that they only appeared in studio scenes . The three active Dalek props used in the serial were originals from the 1960s , and their wear was covered by new paint . Five " dummy " Daleks which could not be operated were also used . Hinchcliffe wanted the Daleks to appear more powerful , and intended to achieve this through low angles and lighting . Duncan Brown , who was responsible for studio lighting , used colours and dark lighting to make the Daleks seem as if they were " emerging from the shadows " and to suggest rather than show the world created to viewers . 
 The same model was used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes . The gas attack in Part One was achieved through dry ice and green lighting . Some of the Thal guns were re @-@ used props from the First Doctor ( William Hartnell ) serial Galaxy 4 ( 1965 ) . The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests , but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it . The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse at the end of Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume , while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death ( 1970 ) . During the filming of Part Two , Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek . As a result , the scene had to be filmed in two takes , bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor . Part Two is unusual in that it is one of the very few episodes not to begin with a reprise , and also the first to end in a freeze frame . A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah 's fall from the scaffolding , but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet , while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals . Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending . Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again , most notably with The Deadly Assassin . The third episode overran its 25 @-@ minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros ' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted . The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 Nation , who grew up during World War II , intentionally based the Daleks on the Nazis , and this episode contains many deliberate parallels . The Kaleds dress in uniforms reminiscent of the Nazis and display " fascist salutes " . The Kaleds look to " keep [ their ] race pure " by banishing the Thals and Mutos . Cast and crew members described it as a " warning to the world " about the danger of allowing authoritarianism take over . Physical comparisons have been drawn between the appearance of Nyder and Heinrich Himmler ; aside from the resemblance , both wear insignias and spectacles . As production of the third episode began , the producers decided to downplay some of the Nazi symbolism , and took away Nyder 's Iron Cross . 
 Ed Webb and Mark <unk> , in a paper in Doctor Who and Philosophy , interpreted the Dalek history shown in Genesis of the Daleks as a warning that " scientists will be the one to bring about the ultimate destruction , the ultimate evil , and deliberately so " . They also commented that the serial showed that the Daleks were evil by design , rather than evolution . Davros represents a mad scientist who creates a monster that then consumes him . Sarah <unk> and Niall Burr , in the same book , wrote that the corruption of the Daleks showed that creatures should not be created with " such limited moral reasoning , " and that in our world we cannot " impose our own personal human standards on everybody else " . 
 Genesis of the Daleks also displays a battle between good and evil . Letts enjoyed the fact that the story did not have clear heroes and villains , but rather a conflict of principle . The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this . Hinchcliffe described it as the " hero meets antihero " moment , with the two engaged in " intellectual grappling " . The episode also presents the " moral dilemma " of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks , resulting in the famous " Have I the right ? " scene . The Doctor 's comparison to knowingly killing a child who would grow up to be a dictator shows how the Doctor 's ethics are influenced by his non @-@ linear experience of time . ( The Twelfth Doctor would again revisit this theme in the 2015 episodes " The Magician 's Apprentice " and " The Witch 's Familiar " . ) He considers the good things that may come out of the Daleks , such as that " many future worlds would become allies " . The Doctor 's conclusion that he does not have the right is an example of utilitarian reasoning , and a " duty @-@ based ethical " position . Sladen recalled that Baker took the scene very seriously , almost " agonising " over the dialogue . 
 Comparisons to other stories have been drawn . The Time Lord who appears at the story 's beginning is intentionally costumed to resemble Death in Ingmar Bergman 's film The Seventh Seal . Gareth Roberts has compared this character to the ghost of Hamlet 's father , setting the protagonist ( the Doctor ) on a violent mission with which he has moral qualms . Martin Wiggins , senior lecturer and fellow at the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon , suggests that the Doctor 's indecision about destroying the Dalek embryos in the " have I the right ? " scene is derived from The Brothers Karamazov . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 Genesis of the Daleks was first broadcast in six weekly parts from 8 March to 12 April 1975 . Viewership varied from 8 to 10 million ; Parts One and Two were watched by audiences of 10 @.@ 7 and 10 @.@ 5 million , Parts Three and Four were watched by audiences of 8 @.@ 5 and 8 @.@ 8 million , and Parts Five and Six were watched by audiences of 9 @.@ 8 and 9 @.@ 1 million . Audience Appreciation Indexes were taken for the second , fourth , fifth , and sixth episodes , scoring 57 , 58 , 57 , and 56 respectively . 
 At the time of broadcast , there were some complaints about the level of violence portrayed . Mary Whitehouse , of the National Viewers ' and Listeners ' Association , complained that Genesis contained " tea @-@ time brutality for tots " . Scenes objected to included the depictions of war and Nyder hitting the Doctor . However , David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker , in their Doctor Who : The Television Companion ( 1998 ) , recorded a positive reaction from fans in regards to creativity and Davros , though one writer noted the ending did not satisfyingly close the story . The BBC 's Audience Research Report concluded , " A little more complex than some Doctor Who adventures , perhaps , and with underlying questions of conscience , the serial had been ' different ' it was occasionally felt and , although dismissed in some quarters as far @-@ fetched , long drawn @-@ out , confused and / or predictable , had provided acceptable escapist entertainment for the majority . " Howe and Walker themselves described the serial as " well @-@ written and full of new ideas , while still remaining true to the Daleks ' roots by effectively equating them with the Nazis " , and particularly praised the production values , pacing , and moral dilemma . However , they noted a few minor flaws , namely Harry being attacked by a giant clam , dull cliffhangers , and " many of the scientist characters serve no other purpose than to act as Dalek @-@ fodder " . 
 In 2010 , Mark Braxton of Radio Times hailed the serial as " Terry Nation 's finest hour for the series " , especially praising the creation of Davros . He was also positive towards Dudley Simpson 's score and Davros 's allies who were " impeccably written and played " from Nyder to Gharman . However , he was disappointed that Harry did not have much to do . The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn noted that it contradicted some aspects of The Daleks but that it " [ hit ] the emotional target dead @-@ on " . He particularly praised Davros and Skaro . However , Bahn felt the " major problem " with the portrayal of the Daleks was that " we 're not given any choice but to view them as psychopathic murderers " , and the Doctor came across as a " catastrophically incompetent secret agent " . DVD Talk 's Stuart Galbraith gave Genesis of the Daleks four out of five stars , calling it as a " real fan @-@ pleaser " and writing that Wisher was " superb " as Davros . While noting that the story " is mostly concerned with action and suspense , which it does rather well " , he felt it " isn 't especially original " as it dealt with common time @-@ travel issues , despite doing it in " intelligent ways " . In 2009 , SFX listed the scene where the Daleks receive their first blaster as the thirteenth scariest moment of Doctor Who . The magazine also named the scene where Harry is attacked by a giant clam as one of the silliest Doctor Who moments , noting " even the best Doctor Who stories have the occasional dropped stitch " . Charlie Jane Anders of io9 , in a 2010 article , listed the cliffhanger of Episode Four — in which the Doctor is forced to tell Davros how the Daleks will be defeated in the future — as one of the greatest Doctor Who cliffhangers .

 Genesis of the Daleks was one of the most widely known serials of the original run as it was repeated often . It was edited into an 85 @-@ minute omnibus version and broadcast on BBC1 at 3 : 00 pm on 27 December 1975 , attracting 7 @.@ 6 million viewers , and also was repeated in two edited 45 @-@ minute episodes as part of the " Doctor Who and the Monsters " on 26 July and 2 August 1982 , which attracted audiences of 4 @.@ 9 and 5 million . It was then repeated in its original serial form on BBC Two in 1993 ( averaging 2 @.@ 2 million viewers ) and 2000 ( averaging 1 to 1 @.@ 5 million ) . In a 1998 poll of readers of Doctor Who Magazine , over 2500 voters placed Genesis at the top of a poll to find the greatest Doctor Who stories of all time . In the magazine 's 2009 " Mighty 200 " poll , asking readers to rank all of the then @-@ made 200 stories , Genesis came in third place , behind The Caves of Androzani ( 1984 ) and " Blink " ( 2007 ) . In a 2014 poll , the magazine 's readers again placed the episode in third place . In 2008 , The Daily Telegraph named Genesis of the Daleks one of the ten greatest episodes of Doctor Who . 
 Genesis of the Daleks is the first example in the history of Doctor Who of " outright revisionism " ; the creation story of the Daleks is very different from that established in The Daleks ( 1963 ) , where it was said they evolved from creatures known as <unk> , who were once similar to the Thals . Here , the <unk> from the original story are changed to Kaleds . Russell T Davies , who revived Doctor Who in 2005 , suggested that the origins of the Time War , a conflict between the Time Lords and the Daleks which contributed to the storyline of the new series , began with the Time Lords ' attempted genocide of the Daleks in Genesis . 
 Davros is resurrected in Destiny of the Daleks ( 1979 ) , played by David <unk> , and appears in the remaining three Dalek stories of the classic series played by Terry Molloy . He also appears in revived series since " The Stolen Earth " / " Journey 's End " ( 2008 ) , played by Julian Bleach . In The Magician 's Apprentice ( 2015 ) , footage from the episode is used with its plot based on the Fourth Doctor 's moral issue if one has the right to kill a child if they knew " that child would grow up totally evil . " Davros ' early life is additionally covered in the 2006 Big Finish four @-@ part audio series I , Davros , which sees Miles reprising his role as Nyder in fourth episode , Guilt .

 = New Jersey Route 34 = 
 Route 34 is a state highway in the central part of the U.S. state of New Jersey . The route runs 26 @.@ 79 mi ( 43 @.@ 11 km ) from an intersection with Route 35 and Route 70 ( the former Brielle Circle ) in Wall Township , Monmouth County north to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) in Old Bridge Township , Middlesex County . The route is a four @-@ lane divided highway between its southern terminus and the north end of the Route 33 concurrency in Howell Township ; along this stretch , the route intersects the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 195 ( I @-@ 195 ) / Route 138 within a short distance of each other . North of Route 33 , Route 34 is an undivided two- to four @-@ lane road that intersects Route 18 in Colts Neck Township and Route 79 in Matawan . Route 34 passes through mostly suburban areas along its route . 
 The route was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 35 ( present Route 88 ) in Laurelton north to Route 4 ( present Route 79 ) in Matawan . The current alignment of Route 34 north of Matawan was a part of Route 4 ( and later US 9 ) until it became a part of Route 4A following a realignment of US 9 and Route 4 . In 1953 , Route 34 was extended north along Route 4A to end at US 9 in Old Bridge Township . Meanwhile , the southern terminus was cut back to its current location with the route south of that point becoming a part of Route 70 . Since 1953 , the southern portion of the route was widened into a divided highway and the Brielle Circle was replaced . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 34 begins at an intersection with Route 35 and Route 70 in Wall Township , Monmouth County at the former Brielle Circle , heading to the northwest on a six @-@ lane undivided road . A short distance past this intersection , the route becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway that passes through suburban development with some woods . It interchanges with County Route 524 Spur ( CR 524 Spur ) before reaching the Allenwood Circle , where Route 34 intersects CR 524 . Past the Allenwood Circle , the road continues northwest to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway . This interchange has access to the northbound Garden State Parkway from northbound Route 34 , to the southbound Garden State Parkway from southbound Route 34 , and to both directions of Route 34 from the southbound Garden State Parkway . Immediately past this interchange , the road intersects CR 30 before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 195 and Route 138 . Route 34 provides the missing movements between the southbound Garden State Parkway and I @-@ 195 / Route 138 . From here , the road passes through woodland before heading into commercial and industrial areas , where it passes by the Monmouth Executive Airport . The route enters wooded residential and business areas where it intersects Belmar Boulevard and <unk> Road , which are both distinct segments of CR 18 . Route 34 continues north before it intersects Route 33 and CR 547 at the Collingwood Circle . 
 At the traffic circle , Route 34 turns northwest to form a concurrency with Route 33 on a four @-@ lane divided highway that passes businesses , crossing into Howell Township . The two routes eventually split , with Route 34 heading north on a two @-@ lane undivided road . It passes through wooded areas of Naval Weapons Station Earle and enters Colts Neck Township . Upon leaving the grounds of Naval Weapons Station Earle , the route widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway again and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with the Route 18 freeway . Past this interchange , Route 34 becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road that passes development and Delicious Orchards before crossing CR 537 . From here , the road heads past suburban neighborhoods and farmland , intersecting CR 54 before meeting CR 4 . Route 34 forms a brief concurrency with CR 4 until the county route heads northeast on South Street . The route continues into wooded areas of homes , crossing into Holmdel Township , where it has a junction with CR 520 . 
 After this intersection , the road continues past homes and farms before turning northwest and entering Marlboro Township . Here , the road heads through wooded residential and commercial areas , briefly becoming a four @-@ lane road , before it crosses into Aberdeen Township . In Aberdeen , Route 34 heads into business areas as it crosses CR 3 . The road becomes a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane , forming the border of Matawan to the west and Aberdeen Township to the east . At the crossing of an abandoned railroad line that is now the Henry Hudson Trail , the route entirely enters Matawan , continuing northwest as four @-@ lane Middlesex Street . Here , Route 34 intersects CR 516 and Route 79 and CR 516 Spur . Following these intersection , the road heads into residential and business areas , crossing over Lake <unk> . 
 Route 34 crosses into Old Bridge Township , Middlesex County , where it becomes a two @-@ lane road , continuing through commercial areas . The route intersects CR 689 , where it turns to the west and passes through areas of residences and businesses and reaches the CR 687 intersection . At the intersection with CR 699 , Route 34 turns to the north and intersects another segment of CR 699 known as Spring Hill Road . The road continues north and ends at an intersection with US 9 . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 34 was legislated to run from an intersection with Route 35 ( now Route 88 in Laurelton , Ocean County north to Route 4 ( now Route 79 ) in Matawan , with the portion of current Route 34 north of that intersection legislated as part of Route 4 . By the 1940s , US 9 was also designated along the present @-@ day portion of Route 34 that was then a part of Route 4 , this would later become Route 4A after US 9 and Route 4 were moved to a new alignment between Freehold and Cheesequake . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 34 was extended north along the alignment of Route 4A to end at US 9 in Cheesequake while the southern terminus was cut back to the Brielle Circle intersection with Route 35 and Route 70 , the latter having replaced Route 34 south of this point . By 1969 , Route 34 was widened into a divided highway as far north as Route 33 . The Brielle Circle at the southern terminus of the route was converted into at @-@ grade intersections with traffic lights in 2001 .

 = Merle Hay Mall = 
 Merle Hay Mall is an enclosed super @-@ regional shopping mall in Des Moines , Iowa , in the United States . Opened in 1959 , it is the oldest regional shopping center in Iowa , and was the largest mall in Iowa in terms of gross leasable area before the 2004 opening of Jordan Creek Town Center in neighboring West Des Moines . It was also the site of the deadliest fire in Des Moines ' history , which killed ten people in 1978 . 
 Sears , Younkers , Kohl 's , and Target are the mall 's anchor stores , while Applebee 's , IHOP , and Starbucks operate on the outparcels of the mall . Other prominent stores in the mall include <unk> , Old Navy , and Staples . Most of the mall is in the northwest part of Des Moines , but the wing that contains Younkers , Kohl 's , and the food court is inside the city limits of neighboring Urbandale . 
 Merle Hay Mall is independently owned by the Merle Hay Mall Limited Partnership , and the family of one of its original developers continues to manage the mall . A Chicago @-@ based company , Urban Retail Properties , handles the mall 's leasing duties . 
 = = History = = 
 The site of Merle Hay Mall was originally home to St. Gabriel 's Monastery from 1921 until its demolition in 1958 . In 1956 , the <unk> monks who resided there sold the monastery site to Chicago @-@ based developers Joseph Abbell and Bernard Greenbaum . Abbell , in a 1994 interview , stated that the developers chose Des Moines for their mall because of the city 's " reputation as a model urban area in middle America . " The mall was known as Northland Shopping Center early in its planning stages until Younkers executives suggested that it be named for Merle Hay , the first Iowan killed in World War I and namesake of the road in front of the mall , instead . Merle Hay Plaza was originally planned as a strip mall before it was redesigned as an open @-@ air plaza with two department stores and four buildings around a common area shortly before construction began in early 1958 . 
 Merle Hay Plaza opened on August 17 , 1959 . It had 31 stores at the time of its opening , including its first anchor ( Younkers ) , as well as a bowling alley that is still in operation today . A second anchor store opened later in 1959 , as Sears moved from downtown Des Moines to Merle Hay Plaza . Other early tenants included a Safeway supermarket ( whose space later became part of Sears ) , Kresge , Bishop 's Buffet ( which closed in 1995 ) , and Walgreens ( which was replaced by an Old Navy in 1999 ) . A movie theater and six @-@ story office building were added in 1965 . 
 = = = Enclosure = = = 
 Merle Hay Plaza was enclosed in 1972 and became Merle Hay Mall . Two years later , as Valley West Mall and <unk> Mall were under construction , Merle Hay Mall completed a major westward expansion that doubled the size of the mall . Two additional anchors , Montgomery Ward ( which also moved from downtown ) and Younkers Store for Homes , were added to the mall as part of that expansion . By 2000 , Merle Hay Mall attracted an average of 35 @,@ 000 shoppers per day . 
 In a 1994 interview with The Des Moines Register , Iowa State University economist Kenneth Stone stated that Merle Hay Mall successfully adapted to the changing lifestyles of the 1960s and 1970s by offering longer shopping hours during a time when downtown Des Moines merchants began restricting their hours . Author and Des Moines native Bill Bryson commented on how Merle Hay Mall 's opening changed Des Moines in his 2006 memoir The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid : " My father never shopped anywhere else after that . Neither did most people . By the early 1960s , people exchanged boasts about how long it had been since they had been downtown . They had found a new kind of happiness at the malls . " In 1989 's The Lost Continent , Bryson wrote that " Jack Kerouac , of all people , thought that Iowa women were the prettiest in the country , but I don 't think he ever went to Merle Hay Mall on a Saturday " when he commented on the obesity of Iowa women . 
 = = = Younkers fire = = = 
 The original Younkers store at Merle Hay Mall was destroyed by a fire that broke out on the morning of November 5 , 1978 . The fire caused an estimated $ 20 million in damage , and killed ten store employees . The store was closed for nearly a year in order to rebuild . 
 In early 1979 , Des Moines fire officials announced that a hydrogen buildup caused by alkaline water leaking from the store 's heating and cooling system caused the fire . Court documents filed by prosecuting attorneys in 1981 stated that an electrical malfunction caused wires that were covered in polyvinyl chloride to overheat , giving off hydrochloric acid . Lawyers representing Younkers and the families of the ten victims sued more than 20 companies that manufactured or were associated with polyvinyl chloride , including Monsanto Company and <unk> Laboratories . Most of those lawsuits were settled out of court in 1984 , while the last suit against B.F. Goodrich was dismissed by a Polk County district judge in April 1986 . 
 = = = Anchor changes = = = 
 Merle Hay Mall lost its first anchor in 1991 when the Younkers Store for Homes closed after Younkers decided to stop selling furniture and appliances in order to focus on its more profitable fashion business . Kohl 's replaced it in 1993 . 
 In 1998 , during the chain 's first round of Chapter 11 bankruptcy , Montgomery Ward faced eviction from the mall after an analysis by Kenneth Stone showed that Ward was operating a discount store instead of the " first class , full line department store " that its lease required . Montgomery Ward responded by closing in early 1999 , and Famous @-@ Barr opened a new store in that space in August 2000 , while the rest of the mall underwent a $ 20 million renovation that year . Younkers moved into the former Famous @-@ Barr space on July 18 , 2004 , one month after Famous @-@ Barr left the Des Moines market , and the old Younkers was demolished shortly afterwards to make room for a new Target store that opened July 19 , 2005 . Target 's opening ended a period of declining sales at the mall , as sales had decreased by 8 to 10 percent during the first year that Jordan Creek Town Center was open . 
 = = = Present @-@ day redevelopment = = = 
 As of 2009 , the mall is anchored by Sears ( 223 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , Kohl 's ( 73 @,@ 799 sq ft ) , Younkers ( 165 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , and Target ( 126 @,@ 483 sq ft ) , with approximately 95 inline tenants , as well as a food court and a single @-@ screen movie theater with the largest movie screen in Des Moines . It is managed by Abbell Credit Corporation , the same company that has held a majority ownership interest in the mall since 1959 . It has undergone several renovations over time to remain a viable shopping center . According to Elizabeth Holland , the CEO of Abbell Credit Corporation , the Des Moines area is large enough to support only two shopping malls , and the goal of the Merle Hay Mall redevelopment is to make it " become one of the two surviving shopping malls . " 
 On March 10 , 2008 , the Des Moines city council agreed to rezone the area around Merle Hay Mall into a tax increment financing district in order to help the mall 's owners pay for future renovations . The move came as the mall 's assessed property value had declined by over $ 13 million since 2005 . Merle Hay Mall 's owners constructed a new main entrance to the mall and relocate some retailers to other areas of the mall in order to create space for new " junior " anchor stores with exterior entrances . The former Sam Goody , former Waldenbooks and GameStop ( now next to Foot Locker ) were renovated to include Staples and Old Navy moved to a smaller store across from their former location to make way for Shoe Carnival and <unk> . As a result of the redevelopment , Old Navy has relocated to a smaller space within the mall . In 2013 , Dunham 's Sports moved out of the mall , with MC Sports replacing it . The upper level has now become a <unk> Brewhouse movie theater since mid @-@ 2014 . 
 = Abuwtiyuw = 
 The Egyptian dog Abuwtiyuw , ( IPA : ʔ @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) also transcribed as <unk> ( died before 2280 BC ) , was one of the earliest documented domestic animals whose name is known . He is believed to have been a royal guard dog who lived in the Sixth Dynasty ( 2345 – 2181 BC ) , and received an elaborate ceremonial burial in the Giza Necropolis at the behest of a pharaoh whose name is unknown . 
 An inscribed stone listing the gifts donated by the pharaoh for Abuwtiyuw 's funeral was discovered by Egyptologist George A. Reisner in October 1935 . It was apparently part of the spoil material incorporated into the structure of a Sixth Dynasty mastaba ( pharaonic @-@ era tomb ) after the demolition of the funerary chapel belonging to Abuwtiyuw 's owner , where the stone likely had originally been installed . The white limestone tablet measures 54 @.@ 2 × 28 @.@ 2 × 23 @.@ 2 cm ( 21 @.@ 3 × 11 @.@ 1 × 9 @.@ 1 in ) . The inscription is composed of ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs , separated by vertical lines . 
 Abuwtiyuw appears to have been a sighthound , a lightly built hunting dog similar to a greyhound , with erect ears and a curly tail . The tomb in which his tablet was discovered is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field , close to the western side of the Great Pyramid of Giza ( Pyramid of Khufu / Kheops ) .

 Herodotus documents that in ancient Persia dogs were protected animals , held in the highest esteem during their lifetime . According to the ancient Greeks , dogs in ancient Egypt were treated with the same respect as they were in Persia , and were commonly mummified after death before being buried in family tombs . The ancient Egyptians and others of the Near East believed that dogs were spiritual beings , similar to humans , and they were " often associated with particular deities and the powers they wield " . A number of the early dynastic royal burial grounds contain the graves of dogs , along with women and servants of the royal household . Ashkelon cemetery in the South District of Israel is perhaps the best @-@ documented dog cemetery in the ancient world , but dog mummies have been unearthed en masse in sites across Egypt including Rhoda in Upper Egypt , Thebes , Abydos , and near <unk> . 
 The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species , from cats and gazelles to crocodiles , baboons , and birds . Typically , many animal species were consumed as meat after death , but it is highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten . Radiographs of exhumed dogs in the ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis , the jackal @-@ headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The only source from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone inscription tablet that may have come from the funerary chapel of the dog 's owner . The tablet was apparently among spolia used to build another grave in approximately 2280 BC , a sixth @-@ Dynasty mastaba , after the chapel 's demolition . It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University @-@ Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition , and removed from the site four days later . 
 The find was recorded by the main expedition photographer , <unk> Ibrahim , who took more than 9 @,@ 321 large @-@ format glass @-@ plate images on Reisner 's expeditions . The tablet is now held by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo ( inventory number JE <unk> ) . 
 Neither the dog 's grave nor mummy have been recovered . The tomb in which the tablet was unearthed is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field , close to the western side of the Great Pyramid of Giza ( Pyramid of Khufu / Kheops ) . The white limestone tablet measures 54 @.@ 2 × 28 @.@ 2 × 23 @.@ 2 cm ( 21 @.@ 3 × 11 @.@ 1 × 9 @.@ 1 in ) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs , separated from each other by vertical lines . Part of a leash is visible on the upper @-@ right corner , suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner . 
 The text of the inscription translated by Reisner describes the gifts offered by the pharaoh in tribute at Abuwtiyuw 's funeral : 
 The dog which was the guard of His Majesty , Abuwtiyuw is his name . His Majesty ordered that he be buried ( ceremonially ) , that he be given a coffin from the royal treasury , fine linen in great quantity , ( and ) incense . His Majesty ( also ) gave perfumed ointment , and ( ordered ) that a tomb be built for him by the gangs of masons . His Majesty did this for him in order that he ( the dog ) might be Honoured ( before the great god , Anubis ) . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 Although it was common to bury dogs in ancient Egypt , the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate , an honour normally reserved for upper @-@ class humans . The pharaoh 's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified , as was commonly done with humans at the time , in the belief that the Ka of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial . 
 Although no images of Abuwtiyuw have been found , the text characterizes him as <unk> ( Tesem ) , a lightly built hunting dog similar to a greyhound , with erect ears and a curly tail . The Tesem dog features in predynastic depictions , making it one of the oldest known breeds of dog , and images of it are common throughout Ancient Egyptian history . According to Reisner , the name " Abuwtiyuw " is not fully translatable , but he surmised that <unk> ( " bu " ) is an onomatopoeic representation of a dog 's bark , as this component often is found in Ancient Egyptian dog names . Edward C. Martin Jr. claims that the name , or its variant transliteration of <unk> , means " With Pointed Ears " , which would fit the description of the Tesem . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Katrina in Florida = 
 The effects of Hurricane Katrina in Florida were in both in the southern portion of the state and in the panhandle . After developing on August 23 , Katrina made landfall near the border of Broward and Miami @-@ Dade counties with 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) winds on August 25 . While it was crossing the state , the hurricane 's convection was asymmetrical , primarily located to the south and east of the center . As a result , high rainfall totals occurred in the Miami area , peaking at 16 @.@ 43 in ( 417 mm ) in Perrine . The rains caused flooding , and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines , leaving 1 @.@ 45 million people without power . Damage in South Florida was estimated at $ 523 million ( 2005 USD ) , mostly as a result of crop damage . Further south , the hurricane spawned a tornado in the Florida Keys . In the island chain , Katrina dropped heavy rainfall and gusty winds . 
 After emerging from the state , Katrina intensified into one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes , becoming a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . It moved ashore in Louisiana and Mississippi , although the hurricane 's outer periphery produced a 5 @.@ 37 ft ( 1 @.@ 64 m ) storm surge in Pensacola along the panhandle . High waves caused beach erosion and closed nearby roadways . There were five tornadoes in northwestern Florida . Damage was estimated along the panhandle at $ 100 million . Throughout the state , the hurricane killed 14 people , of which 6 were directly related to the storm 's effects . Due to damage from Katrina , 11 Florida counties were declared federal disaster areas . 
 = = Background = = 
 Hurricane Katrina developed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the Bahamas on August 23 , partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten . As it moved slowly northwestward , it developed organized convection , or thunderstorms , and it intensified into a tropical storm on August 24 . A building ridge turned Katrina to the west , bringing it over the Gulf Stream . With warm waters and favorable outflow , the storm continued strengthening . At around 2100 UTC on August 25 , Katrina attained hurricane status , based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters . Intensification of the ridge to its north caused the hurricane to turn to the west @-@ southwest , and as it approached the Florida coastline Katrina developed a well @-@ defined eye . At 2230 UTC on August 25 , Katrina made landfall near the border of Miami @-@ Dade and Broward counties with winds of around 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . The hurricane moved southwestward and crossed Florida in about six hours , during which its eye became better defined . During its passage , northerly wind shear shifted the deepest convection to the south and east of the center , and Katrina briefly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 26 . After emerging from the state , Katrina intensified into one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes , becoming a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Katrina ultimately moved ashore in southeastern Louisiana on August 29 , where it caused severe storm surge flooding and catastrophic damage ; it dissipated the following day . 
 In the preceding 2004 season , Florida was affected by four hurricanes , including hurricanes Frances and Jeanne which hit Martin County and caused billions in damage . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 About nine hours after the system developed on August 24 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) issued a tropical storm watch from the Seven Mile Bridge to Vero Beach . Later that day , the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm 's intensification became apparent . About 25 hours before Katrina made landfall , the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville , and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee . Early on August 25 , a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee . In southeastern Florida , the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31 @.@ 5 and 19 @.@ 5 hours before landfall , respectively ; both were 16 @.@ 5 hours less than the desired lead time . A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key , southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas , and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key . The warning in the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours before the onset of tropical storm force winds . 
 On August 25 , Florida 's Emergency Operations Center was activated in Tallahassee to monitor the progress of the hurricane . Before Katrina moved ashore , schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area . Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing . Officials in Miami @-@ Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate . To the north in Broward County , residents east of the Intracoastal Waterway or in mobile homes were advised to leave their homes . Evacuation orders were issued for offshore islands in Palm Beach County , and for residents in mobile homes south of Lantana Road . Shelters were opened across the region . Officials closed the Miami International Airport , Fort Lauderdale – Hollywood International Airport , Key West International Airport , and Florida Keys Marathon Airport due to the storm . In Monroe and Collier counties , schools were closed , and a shelter was opened in Immokalee . 
 While Katrina was intensifying as a major hurricane on August 28 , the NHC issued a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from the Alabama border to Destin along the panhandle . The warning was later extended to Indian Pass . Officials issued a mandatory evacuation for portions of Walton , Gulf , Franklin , and Wakulla counties .

 Overall , Hurricane Katrina killed 14 people in the state , of which 6 were directly related to the storm . Six of the indirect deaths were in South Florida , of which three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators , one was due to a vehicle accident , one occurred during debris cleanup , and one was associated with a lack of electricity . At least five people were injured due to carbon monoxide poisoning . Overall damage totaled $ 623 million ( 2005 USD ) .

 While moving across Florida , Katrina had an asymmetric area of thunderstorms , which placed the strongest winds and rainfall over Miami @-@ Dade County . The highest precipitation total related to hurricane in the United States was 16 @.@ 43 in ( 417 mm ) in Perrine , or about halfway between Miami and Homestead . Of the total , 15 @.@ 10 in ( 384 mm ) fell in 24 hours . During its passage , the eye of the hurricane moved directly over the office of the National Hurricane Center , which reported a wind gust of 87 mph ( 140 km / h ) . The strongest sustained winds in Florida was a report of 72 mph ( 116 km / h ) on the roof of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science in Virginia Key . The same station recorded a gust of 94 mph ( 151 km / h ) . Unofficially , wind gusts reached 97 mph ( 156 km / h ) at Homestead General Aviation Airport . The hurricane 's accompanying storm surge was small , estimated at around 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) . Consequentially , there was minor beach erosion and isolated coastal flooding . 
 The heavy rainfall flooded neighborhoods in the area , damaging over 100 houses . The storm left about 1 @.@ 4 million people without power in Palm Beach , Broward , and Miami @-@ Dade counties . In Broward County north of Katrina 's first landfall , the hurricane dropped light rainfall , ranging from 2 to 4 in ( 51 to 102 mm ) . Downed trees killed three people in the county . Train and bus service was disrupted in the Miami area . Property damage was estimated at $ 100 million . Widespread flooding affected crop nurseries and greenhouses , and crop damage totaled $ 423 million . Three people drowned in Miami @-@ Dade County , two of whom on boats .

 Katrina weakened into a tropical storm while moving across Monroe County . Tides reached 3 to 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 52 m ) in mainland Monroe County , which flooded several houses and vehicles in Flamingo in Everglades National Park . Most of the Florida Keys reported tropical storm @-@ force winds . A station on Key West reported sustained winds of 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) , with gusts to 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) . While the storm passed to its north , the city reported a storm surge of about 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) . The storm 's outer rainbands spawned an F2 tornado in Marathon on August 26 , which damaged an airport hangar and several homes . This was one of only six F2 tornadoes in the Florida Keys since 1950 . Similar to the Miami area , Katrina dropped heavy rainfall in the Florida Keys , reaching 10 @.@ 05 in ( 255 mm ) in Key West . In the area , the storm left about 5 @,@ 000 people without power . After Katrina re @-@ intensified into a hurricane , a station on the Dry Tortugas reported sustained winds of 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) , with gusts to 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) .

 After striking southeastern Louisiana , Hurricane Katrina made its final landfall in Mississippi , during which it produced a storm surge of about 5 @.@ 37 ft ( 1 @.@ 64 m ) in Pensacola . The hurricane struck months after Hurricane Dennis affected the same area . In St. Marks , the surge flooded several businesses , and in Walton County , high tides flooded several roads , including portions of U.S. Highways 98 and 331 . The storm caused moderate to severe beach erosion along the gulf coast , and washed sand onto many coastal roads . Winds along the Florida panhandle peaked at 56 mph ( 90 km / h ) in Pensacola , with gusts to 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) . High winds briefly closed the Interstate 10 bridge over Escambia Bay in Pensacola . The outer rainbands of the hurricane spawned five tornadoes , all of them weak and not very damaging . Rainfall along the panhandle reached 7 @.@ 80 in ( 198 mm ) in Philpot , which caused flooding . 
 The winds caused damage to some trees and structures and there was some minor flooding in the panhandle . There were two indirect fatalities from Katrina in Walton County as a result of a traffic accident . Along the Florida panhandle , 77 @,@ 000 customers lost power . Damage along the panhandle was estimated at $ 100 million .

 On August 28 , or about three days after Katrina struck the state , President George W. Bush declared a disaster area for Miami @-@ Dade and Broward counties , which allocated federal funding for debris removal and other emergency services . Three days later , Monroe County was also declared a disaster areas , and on the same day the three counties were designated to receive funding for public assistance ; this included aid to repair roads and bridges , water control facilities , public buildings , and recreation areas . The declaration was determined after the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) sent 20 State Emergency Response Teams to determine the extent of damage . After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast , President Bush declared a disaster area for seven counties along the Florida panhandle on September 6 ; the counties were Bay , Escambia , Franklin , Gulf , Okaloosa , Santa Rosa , and Walton . In addition , Collier County in southwestern Florida was added to the list of disaster areas . 
 In the two months after Katrina struck south Florida , Hurricane Rita brushed the region in late September with tropical storm @-@ force winds and flooding rains . In late October , Hurricane Wilma struck southwestern Florida as a major hurricane , affecting the Miami area with hurricane @-@ force winds that left 98 % of south Florida without power . Including Hurricane Dennis in July , FEMA provided $ 1 billion in public assistance to Florida residents in association with the four hurricanes in 2005 . 
 = Seiken Densetsu 3 = 
 Seiken Densetsu 3 ( <unk> , lit . " Legend of the Sacred Sword 3 " ) is a 1995 action role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Square ( now Square Enix ) for the Super Famicom . It is the sequel to the 1993 game Seiken Densetsu 2 ( released as Secret of Mana outside Japan ) , and is the third installment in the Mana series . Set in a high fantasy world , the game follows three heroes as they attempt to claim the legendary Mana Sword and prevent the God Beasts from being unleashed and destroying the world . It features three lengthy main plotlines and six different possible main characters , each with their own storylines , and allows two players to play simultaneously . Seiken Densetsu 3 builds on the gameplay of its predecessor with multiple enhancements , including the use of a time progression system with transitions from day to night and weekday to weekday in game time , and a wide range of character classes to choose from , which provides each character with an exclusive set of skills and status progression . 
 The game was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii , directed by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka , and produced by <unk> <unk> . Artwork was produced by manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki , while the music was composed by Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta . Although the game was only published in Japan , English @-@ speaking players have been able to play Seiken Densetsu 3 due to an unofficial English fan translation , first released in 2000 . Seiken Densetsu 3 received considerable acclaim from reviewers , who praised the graphics as among the best ever made for the Super Famicom and the gameplay as an improved version of its predecessor 's . The plot received mixed reviews by critics , who found the overlapping stories to be interesting and to enhance replayability , but the characters and plotlines themselves to be flat and clichéd . Overall , the game is considered by some critics to be a Super Famicom classic and one of the best role @-@ playing games of the 16 @-@ bit era . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Seiken Densetsu 3 has similar gameplay to its predecessor , Secret of Mana . Like many other role @-@ playing games of the 16 @-@ bit era , the game displays a top @-@ down perspective , in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures . Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time ; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence . The game may be played simultaneously by two players , as opposed to the three of Secret of Mana . There are six possible player characters . At the beginning of the game , the player chooses which three of them will be playable and which one they will start with ; the other two playable characters will join the party when met . The remaining three characters act as non @-@ playable characters ( NPCs ) when encountered . 
 Each character can use one type of weapon , in addition to magical spells . The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell in relation to the enemy . When in battle mode , attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character @-@ specific special attacks . Upon collecting enough experience points in battle , each character can increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion . Options such as changing equipment , casting spells , or checking status are performed by cycling through the game 's Ring Commands — a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member . The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated . Within the Ring , the player has nine slots for storing items ; additional items can be placed into item storage , which is inaccessible in combat . 
 Character level progression is coordinated by the player , as a choice is given as to which statistic to raise by a point at every level up . A " class " system is also present . Once a character reaches level 18 , the player can visit one of several Mana Stones located throughout the game and choose to upgrade them to one of two classes for each character — either a class aligned to " Light " or a class aligned to " Dark " — which provides a different set of skills and different improvements to character statistics . A second class change may be optionally performed at level 38 , again split between a light and a dark choice , if the player has obtained a required rare item for the target class . The class changes do not affect the plot of the game , only gameplay . 
 Seiken Densetsu 3 also employs a calendar function into its gameplay . A week cycles much more quickly than an actual one , with a day passing in a matter of minutes . Each day of the week is represented by a different elemental spirit . On that spirit 's day , magic of that element will be slightly stronger . An in @-@ game day is also divided into day and night . Certain events only happen during certain times of day , such as a nighttime @-@ only black market selling particularly rare items . Enemies encountered in the field also change during certain time periods , and some may be sleeping if the characters approach them at night . In addition , the character Kevin transforms into a werewolf when he fights at night , greatly increasing his attack power . Using an inn 's services allows the player to " skip " the game 's clock to that day 's evening , or the following morning .

 The story takes place in a fictional world where Mana represents an ethereal , but finite , energy source . Some time in the past , the Mana Goddess created the game 's world by forging the powerful Sword of Mana and defeating eight " God Beasts " with it , sealing them within eight Mana Stones , before turning herself into the Mana Tree and falling asleep . The game is set at a time when Mana starts to fade and peace has ended , as several people plot to unleash the God Beasts from the stones so as to gain ultimate power . The game is not a direct sequel to the events in Secret of Mana ; according to series creator Koichi Ishii in 2006 , the Mana games do not take place in exactly the same world , and characters or elements who appear in different games are best considered alternate versions of each other . Instead , the connections between each title are more abstract than story @-@ based . Despite this statement , the 2007 game Heroes of Mana is a direct prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 , taking place 19 years before the latter 's story . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The characters ( and their individual stories ) are grouped into three main sub @-@ plots . Angela and Duran oppose the Dragon Emperor , Hawk and Lise oppose the Dark Prince , and Kevin and Carlie oppose the Masked Mage . The main storyline is determined by the first character chosen , though there is significantly more character interaction and dialogue if the other member of the pair is also in the party . 
 Angela ( <unk> , <unk> ) is the princess of the ice @-@ covered Magic Kingdom of Altena . Her mother uses her magic to keep the citadel in Altena in a perpetual Spring , but the spell weakens as Mana starts to fade . To power the spell , she and her assistant wizard Koren decide to invade other nations to claim their Mana Stones , though the spell to use the Stone is fatal to the caster . When the Queen tries to force Angela to use it , she flees from Altena . Her paired character is Duran ( <unk> , <unk> ) , an orphaned mercenary swordsman of the Grasslands Kingdom of Valsena . His father Loki was lost in battle with the Dragon Emperor . One night , Duran is on guard duty at the castle of Valsena when Koren attacks the castle . Duran is left for dead after confronting him , and after recovering he vows to become the best swordsman in the world and to exact his revenge upon Koren . 
 Hawk ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Hawkeye " ) is a member of a guild of noble thieves based in the desert Sand Fortress of Navarre . The guild 's leader , Lord Flamekhan , suddenly and uncharacteristically declares Navarre to be a kingdom . Hawk decides to confront Flamekhan about it , only to discover he is being controlled by the witch Isabella . Isabella kills Eagle , Flamekhan 's son and Hawk 's friend , framing Hawk for his death and forcing him to flee . His paired character is Lise ( <unk> , <unk> ) , the princess of the mountainous Wind Kingdom of Rolante and captain of its Amazon army . Two mysterious ninjas from Navarre trick her younger brother Elliott into turning off Rolante 's protective winds and kidnap him . With the winds gone , Navarre attacks Rolante with a cloud of sleep powder and kills its king . Devastated , Lise makes her escape . 
 Kevin ( <unk> , Kevin ) is the prince of the Beast Kingdom . He is the son of the Beast King , who is sick of the treatment of his people by " normal " humans . His desired revenge is made possible by the appearance of Deathjester . He shows the king his abilities by forcing Kevin to awaken his werewolf abilities by killing Kevin 's best friend . When Kevin confronts the Beast King on this act and the King 's plans to invade the human Holy City Wendel , Kevin is thrown out of the kingdom and swears revenge . His paired character is Carlie ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Charlotte " ) , the half @-@ elf granddaughter of the Priest of Light in Wendell . An orphan , she is looked after by a fellow cleric , Heath . Feeling an evil influence in nearby Jadd , the Priest of Light sends Heath to investigate , but Charlotte follows to witness Deathjester abduct Heath . She decides to journey to save him . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The story begins in a different place for each playable character . With the exception of Carlie , the main character is soon told ( or otherwise decides ) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel . They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded . Due to the Beastmen 's werewolf powers , they are able to make an escape by night . The main character — now including Carlie — on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light . Following it , it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary , exhausted by her journey . Out of desperation , the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host , and tells them to get to Wendel . There , while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light , the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger . The Priest explains that if the Tree dies , the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world . He goes on to explain further that , because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host , they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree . They can then restore peace to the world , and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies . A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary . The Faerie does not have the strength to do it , and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster 's life . The Stones ' guarding elemental spirits , however , will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined . 
 After journeying across the world to get the spirits , meeting the other two members of the party , thwarting the invasion attempts of Navarre and Altena , discovering the powers of the Fire and Water Mana Stones , and learning the disappearance of the Mana Stone of Darkness along the way , the main character tries to open the gate to the Mana Sanctuary with the spirits ' assistance . The first attempt fails , but the second succeeds ; the Faerie realizes that it was opened because someone else released the power from all the Mana Stones . The characters travel into the Sanctuary and the main character claims the Mana Sword . It is then discovered that the main character 's adversaries — Koren and the <unk> Knight for Angela and Duran ; Jagan and Isabella for Lise and Hawk ; or the Deathjester and a mind @-@ controlled Heath , for Kevin and Charlotte — have defeated the other two sets of primary enemies . The remaining adversaries capture the Faerie and will only release her in exchange for the Mana Sword . The trade is made , and once the enemy receives the Sword , the Mana Stones shatter and the God Beasts are released . 
 The characters must then defeat the God Beasts before they can gather and destroy the world . However , after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy , who their personal enemies were working for — the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela , the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise , and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie . The already powerful villain absorbs the power of the Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god , but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power . After defeating the villain 's minions , the characters go and defeat their main enemy , but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world . The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree ; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years , but until then Mana will not exist in the world . As the game ends , the characters go back to their homelands .

 Seiken Densetsu 3 was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii . The game was directed by Hiromichi Tanaka and produced by <unk> <unk> . Tanaka had previously worked on several titles for Square , including as a designer on the first three Final Fantasy titles . Manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki was responsible for the character concept artwork , based on designs by Ishii . Yūki 's artwork for the game can be found in the Nobuteru Yuki Seiken Densetsu Illustration Book . 
 During the game 's development and after its release in Japan on September 30 , 1995 , Seiken Densetsu 3 became known abroad as Secret of Mana 2 , though a preview in Next Generation in August 1995 called it by its correct name , despite still stating it to be a sequel to Secret of Mana . The preview noted the six characters , calendar system , and a game world " three to four times " the size of the previous game , though it also reported that the game would be playable by three players , not two . Square stated in a 1995 issue of its North American newsletter that they planned to release the game during the second half of the year . A second preview in Next Generation in February 1996 , calling the game Secret of Mana 2 , stated that the game 's North American release had been delayed by Square 's American branch due to programming bugs but still listed the release date as Spring . 
 Seiken Densetsu 3 was never released outside Japan . Retro Gamer stated in 2011 that localizing the game for North America or Europe " would have cost a fortune " , and that the rise of the competing PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles diminished the benefits of spending so much on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) game . Nintendo Power , a few months after Seiken Densetsu 3 was released in Japan , said that the probability of a North American release for the game was low due to issues of " a technical nature " and that it would have been far too costly to produce at the time . This is further supported by Brian Fehdrau , lead programmer for Square 's contemporary game Secret of Evermore , who mentioned that Seiken Densetsu 3 had some software bugs , hindering its likelihood of being certified for release by Nintendo of America without extensive work . 
 There was an apparent misconception among video game fans that the SNES title Secret of Evermore was released in lieu of an English language version of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995 . Secret of Evermore was developed by a new team at Square 's office in Redmond , Washington called Square Soft . According to Fehdrau , no one who worked on the Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3 ; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore . In 2000 , a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch , which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The score for Seiken Densetsu 3 was composed by Hiroki Kikuta , who had previously composed the music for Secret of Mana as his first video game score . Kikuta performed the sound selection , editing , effect design , and data encoding himself . Just as he did for Secret of Mana , Kikuta spent nearly 24 hours a day in his office , alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be , according to him , " immersive " and " three @-@ dimensional " . Similarly , rather than use premade MIDI samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time , Kikuta made his own MIDI samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super Famicom so that he would know exactly how the pieces would sound on the system 's hardware instead of having to deal with audio hardware differences between the original MIDI sampler and the SNES . The soundtrack 's music has been described by Freddie W. of RPGFan as " bouncy , energetic , flowing , and serene " , and is noted for its use of piano and drums . He further called it a " more refined and matured " version of the Secret of Mana soundtrack . 
 The 1995 soundtrack album Seiken Densetsu 3 Original Sound Version collects 60 tracks of music from Seiken Densetsu 3 . It was published by NTT Publishing , and republished by Square Enix in 2004 . The main theme from Secret of Mana , " Angel 's Fear " , is also featured in Seiken Densetsu 3 as a part of " Where Angels Fear to Tread " . In addition to the original soundtrack album , an arranged album of music from Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana + . The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta . Secret of Mana + contains a single track , titled " Secret of Mana " , that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 , which was still under development at the time . The style of the album has been described by critics as " experimental " , using " strange sounds " such as waterfalls , bird calls , cell phone sounds , and " typing " sounds . Secret of Mana + was originally published by NTT Publishing / Square , and was reprinted by NTT Publishing in 1995 and 2004 . 
 The track " Meridian Child " from the original soundtrack was performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra for the fifth Orchestral Game Concert in 1996 . " Meridian Child " was again performed on February 6 , 2011 , when the Eminence Symphony Orchestra played a concert in Tokyo as part of the Game Music Laboratory concert series as a tribute to the music of Kenji Ito and Hiroki Kikuta . One of the companion books of sheet music for the Mana series , the first edition of Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music , included pieces from Seiken Densetsu 3 , rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos , though intended to sound like the originals .

 Due to its Japanese exclusivity , most of the English @-@ language reviews for Seiken Densetsu 3 were published years after the initial release . One contemporary English @-@ language review was in 1995 in GameFan , which covered import games , and rated the game highly . The Japanese Famitsu review also rated the game highly , though slightly lower than Secret of Mana . Critics have also rated the game highly in retrospective reviews , published mostly after the release of the fan translation patch in 2000 . The graphics were praised ; a review from 1UP.com called the game " absolutely gorgeous " , which they attributed to its position towards the end of the era of 2D SNES games , but before developers tried to start working with prerendered 3D graphics . A review by Chris Parsons of RPGamer agreed , terming the graphics " awesome " and positively comparing some of the effects to PlayStation RPGs , which the Cubed3 review by Adam Riley did as well . A preview by Next Generation written after the release of the game in Japan stated that the detailed graphics " puts just about every other recent 32 @-@ bit RPG to shame " , while the review by Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life also noted the game as one of the best graphically on the SNES and called out the unique visual styles of each area in the game as of particular note . The game 's music was also generally praised ; Nintendo Life 's Dillard called it " spectacular from start to finish " , while Cubed3 's Riley said it was " one of the most sonically pleasing out of the whole SNES lifetime " and RPGamer 's Parsons said that " a wonderful job was done in the composition of the music " . The Next Generation preview praised both the quality of the soundtrack and the musical continuity from the Secret of Mana soundtrack . 
 The gameplay was highly rated by most reviewers , though the combat system had detractors . Dillard of Nintendo Life felt that the gameplay was as good as that of Secret of Mana and it had " a much more strategic feel to it " . The 1UP.com and Cubed3 reviews also brought up the day and time system as interesting additions , though the 1UP.com reviewer felt that the combat was not " quite as tight " as in Secret of Mana . The Next Generation preview , while acknowledging that several flaws in the Secret of Mana combat system had been corrected and praising the boss battles , felt that the computer @-@ controlled characters showed no sense of tactics , resulting in a free @-@ for @-@ all . A review by JeuxVideo.com also noted several improvements in the combat system over the prior game , but felt that battles could turn into a chaotic mass of attacks and numbers . Parsons of RPGamer also called out the Ring system as being flawed , as he found it frustrating that the menu could not be brought up while a character was performing an action , making boss battles hectic and difficult . The JeuxVideo.com reviewer also took issue with this restriction . 
 The plot received mixed reviews ; while several reviewers praised the system of choosing different main characters , especially its effect on replayability , Cubed3 's Riley felt that it meant that the story " can be quite confusing " . Parsons noted that the interactions with the characters that were not chosen often left plot holes , as their motivations were not explained . The Famitsu review praised the replayability of the branching narrative . The Next Generation preview , while praising the multiple storylines as an innovation in the genre , felt that it had been attached to a " magic @-@ and @-@ monsters fantasy @-@ formula " plot . The 1UP.com reviewer agreed , saying that the plot was not " too terribly engaging " , suffering from clichés and flat characters . 
 Overall , the game is regarded by many as a SNES classic ; Nintendo Life 's Dillard stated that it was " easily one of the best RPGs to come out of the 16 @-@ bit era " , while the 1UP.com reviewer said that if it had been officially translated into English it " very likely would have become a fondly remembered classic " .

The player can travel the virtual world , a fictionalized version of the Western United States and Mexico , primarily by horseback and on foot . Gunfights emphasize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic called " Dead Eye " that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 Red Dead Redemption is a third @-@ person , open world , western , action @-@ adventure game , in which players control John Marston . Players interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies , using various firearms . Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation , each with different attributes . These horses must be tamed in order to use them . Marston can utilize trains to get from place to place quickly , but he can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver . The game 's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world , featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers , bandits , and wildlife . Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns . Besides the American West , the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States . 
 In addition to following the main storyline , the player character will witness and can take part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world . These include public hangings , ambushes , pleas for assistance , encounters with strangers , ride @-@ by shootings , and dangerous animal attacks . For example , if a group of people ride into town firing guns in the air , Marston can kill them , and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town . The player character can also take part in optional side activities , most of which give the player money . These side activities include dueling , in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent ; bounty hunting , where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters ; herb collecting , which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics ; gambling , where people can be found playing games such as poker and Five Finger Fillet ; and hunting , in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides . 
 Red Dead Redemption makes use of a morality system where players have the ability to gain positive or negative honor . Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices , such as taking in an outlaw alive , or saving a woman from a kidnapping . The player character 's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices . This works in conjunction with another system , fame , which affects how people react based on Marston 's honor status . If Marston has little honor , non @-@ player characters feel insecure around him . If he has a high amount of honor , other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him . He will also receive discounts in some stores , more pay for jobs and other bonuses . A very low honor rating can result in a town 's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives . To combat this he can disguise himself by wearing a bandana when performing criminal acts ; alternatively , a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts , such as Thieves ' Landing . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Gunfights are a major gameplay mechanic in Red Dead Redemption . The player can take cover , target a specific person or animal , <unk> , and free aim . Individual body parts can also be targeted , in order to take targets down non @-@ lethally . When the player shoots an enemy , the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit . The player character can choose from period @-@ accurate weapons including revolvers , pistols , lever or bolt @-@ action rifles , shotguns , sniper rifles , knives , explosives , lassos , mounted Gatling guns , and cannons . Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye . Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time @-@ like manner , allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots . When the targeting sequence ends , Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession . 
 Adopted from the Grand Theft Auto series , Red Dead Redemption has a modified wanted system . When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses , some will run to the nearest police station . The player can bribe them or kill them before they reach the station . If a crime is committed near a police officer , the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed . If Marston 's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations . To evade law enforcement in pursuit , John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears . Alternatively , the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear . Despite the chase being aborted , a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness . It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston 's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless . Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders . The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter . When arrested , Marston pays off his bounty and is then released . If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty , the law will assign bounty hunting activities . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Red Dead Redemption includes online multiplayer with a maximum of 16 players per session . Every multiplayer game , both free @-@ for @-@ all and team based , will begin with a Mexican standoff . Survivors of the standoff will be able to move to any part of the battlefield in preparation for respawning enemies . Crates in the environment contain extra weapons , ammo , and other powerups . Players can level up and complete weapon challenges which earn them rewards such as new character models , golden weapon skins , new titles , and new breeds of animal mounts . Additional multiplayer modes were added via downloadable content ( DLC ) . Stronghold is an attack or defend scenario , with teams switching roles as the round ends . It is included in the Liars and Cheats pack . The Undead Nightmare pack included two new games modes : Undead overrun mode , and Land Grab . It also included eight new zombie characters . 
 The free @-@ for @-@ all and team versions of Shootout mode both follow a traditional deathmatch scenario where players or teams must accumulate the most kills . Many capture the flag variants are also available . Hold Your Own is a traditional mode where each team has to defend their bag of gold to from the enemy team whilst capturing the other . Grab The Bag has both teams attacking one bag placed in a section of the map . Gold Rush is a free @-@ for @-@ all variant , trying to grab and keep as many bags as possible . The multiplayer portion Red Dead Redemption also features open world gameplay . All players in the server can form or join a group of other players , known as a posse , of up to eight players and take part in activities such as hunting or attacking computer @-@ controlled gang hideouts or another player 's posse .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Red Dead Redemption spans two fictitious United States counties and a fictitious Mexican state : New Austin , West Elizabeth , and Nuevo Paraiso . New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent to each other and share a southern border with Mexico . Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state , separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis river . The game takes place primarily in the year 1911 , featuring the final decade of the American Frontier and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it . The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles , machine guns , and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The game begins in 1911 , where John Marston ( Rob Wiethoff ) , a former outlaw , is taken from his family by the Bureau of Investigation . They state Marston will be granted amnesty if he brings the remaining members of his old gang to justice . Marston agrees and sets off to track down Bill Williamson ( Steve J. Palmer ) , who now runs his own gang . Marston confronts Williamson at his stronghold , Fort Mercer , only to be shot and left for dead . A local rancher , Bonnie MacFarlane ( Kimberly Irion ) , finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery . Several days later , Marston begins repaying the <unk> for their help in the form of odd @-@ jobs around the ranch . During this time he works with a U.S. Marshal , Leigh Johnson ( Anthony De <unk> ) and his deputies , the dim @-@ witted Jonah and sarcastic Eli ; Nigel West Dickens ( Don Creech ) , a con artist selling patent medicines ; Seth <unk> ( Kevin <unk> ) , a treasure hunter and grave robber who prefers the company of the dead to that of the living ; and an unreliable alcoholic arms dealer known only as Irish ( K. Harrison Sweeney ) . Marston performs various tasks and favours in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer . Marston and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson 's gang only to find that Williamson had already fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella ( Antonio Jaramillo ) , another member of Marston 's former gang . 
 In Mexico , Marston initially sides with Mexican Army Colonel Agustín Allende ( Gary Carlos Cervantes ) and his right @-@ hand man Captain Vincente de Santa ( Hector Luis Bustamante ) , to help put down a rebellion in return for Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him . However , Allende betrays Marston , who is then forced to side with the rebels . With the initial help of elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts ( Ross Hagen ) , Marston , along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes ( Josh Segarra ) , and Luisa ( Francesca <unk> ) , one of Reyes ' many lovers , eventually turns the tide in favour of the rebels , killing de Santa and launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress , where they find Escuella , who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende 's protection . Escuella manages to escape , with Marston giving chase , who is then given the option to either kill or capture Escuella alive and turn him over to the Bureau . Either way , agents Edgar Ross ( Jim Bentley ) and Archer Fordham ( David Wilson Barnes ) , who meet with Marston at the USA / Mexico border , refuse to let Marston return to his family , stating that after killing Williamson , he must meet with them again in Blackwater and assist in hunting down Dutch van der Linde ( Benjamin Byron Davis ) , the leader of Marston 's former gang . Marston and Reyes then take the fight to Allende , where Luisa is killed during the attack . As Allende 's palace is stormed by the rebels , both he and Williamson flee , who are then apprehended and executed after being chased a short distance . Reyes then takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital , while Marston leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater . 
 Once there , Marston learns that Dutch has been forming his own gang with sympathisers from the local Indian reservation , and joins Ross , Fordham and a group of U.S. soldiers in an attack on Dutch 's hideout . During the assault , Marston chases Dutch up to a cliff overlooking the river and mountains . Dutch ultimately chooses to commit suicide , backing off the cliff and falling to his death , but not before warning Marston that the Bureau will ' just find another monster ' to justify their pay . Marston is then released from his deal with Ross and goes back to his ranch where his wife Abigail ( Sophie <unk> ) and his son Jack ( Josh Blaylock ) are waiting . Marston devotes his time afterward tending to the ranch , having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever . He is then suddenly forced to repel a surprise attack from a combined force of soldiers , lawmen and government agents led by Ross . Marston is able to fend off several waves of attackers and get his family to safety but stays behind to hold back the rest . Despite a valiant last stand , he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men . He is then buried by his grieving family on the hill overlooking the ranch . 
 The game then moves three years ahead to 1914 , where Marston 's son Jack stands over the graves of both his father and his now deceased mother . He leaves home to search for Ross , who retired the year before , and eventually finds the former agent hunting on a riverbank in Mexico . The two duel , with Jack emerging the victor . The fate of John Marston 's companions are later summarized : Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo to be replaced by Jonah , and then moved as far as possible from the town ; Abraham Reyes , though promising to lead Mexico into an age of freedom , was consumed by power and became a tyrant ; Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married ; Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged ; Seth <unk> eventually found the treasure he was looking for and became rich ; and finally , Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep . 
 = = Development = = 
 Rockstar San Diego began to develop Red Dead Redemption in 2005 . Development was conducted by a team of more than 800 people , including Rockstar San Diego 's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games 's studios around the world . The game runs on the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine ( RAGE ) , which was improved for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities . The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks . Having exhausted the use of previous hardware on previous projects , Rockstar felt inspired after realising the potential power of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . Analyst estimations place the game 's combined development and marketing budget between US $ 80 million and US $ 100 million , which would make it one of the most expensive video games ever made . 
 The open world was created to represent iconic features of the American frontier . Key members of the game world product team took research trips to Washington and the Library of Congress in their extensive research on the American frontier . They also captured a multitude of photographs , and analyzed various classic Western films . The team considered creating the open world one of the most technically demanding aspect of the game 's production , in terms of filling the world with enough content to interest players . The team chose 1911 as the game 's setting as they felt that exploring the transformation from " the old West " into a modern world was intriguing . The team viewed Red Dead Redemption as a spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver , and designed it to improve upon the gameplay mechanics . They sought to maintain the shooting mechanic and expand on other game features , attempting to achieve realism with every feature of the game . In particular , the team faced a challenge in creating realistic movement for the horse , resulting in the engagement of a stunt horse to simulate movement for the designers . 
 After an audition process , Rob Wiethoff was selected to portray John Marston . The cast 's performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology , with additional dialogue and sound effects recorded in a studio . Red Dead Redemption also features an original score , which was composed by Bill Elm and Woody Jackson , collaborating with each other over fifteen months . Rockstar also consulted musicians who played traditional Western instruments , such as harmonica player Tommy Morgan . 
 Though a technology demonstration was shown in 2005 , Red Dead Redemption was first formally announced by Rockstar Games on February 3 , 2009 . They released its debut trailer on December 1 , 2009 , introducing the game 's protagonist . The game missed its original projected April 2010 release date , pushed back to May 18 , 2010 to allow for further polishing . To spur pre @-@ order game sales , Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to provide pre @-@ order bonuses . These included exclusive in @-@ game outfits , weapons and horses , as well as the game 's official soundtrack .

 Many critics praised the landscape , environment and graphics of Red Dead Redemption . Erik Brudvig of IGN lauded the environmental details , noting the player can even scare a flock of birds from the bushes as they ride past . He also noted that the game 's dynamic events , weather and ambient sounds provide a rich experience for players . He summarized by stating " you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we 've all been waiting for . " Game Informer called the scenery " breathtaking " , and the cinematic cutscenes " vastly improved " over Grand Theft Auto IV , and named it the " best @-@ looking Rockstar game to date " . 
 The music , sound and voice acting in the game was also widely praised and spoken about . It won the Best Original Music and Best Voice Acting awards from GameSpot .

Eurogamer 's Simon Parkin felt Red Dead Redemption successfully " re @-@ clothes " the Grand Theft Auto framework in an " exciting , distinct and expertly realised scenario " . 
 The multiplayer aspect of Red Dead Redemption received mixed commentary from critics . GamePro 's Will Herring praised the variety of multiplayer modes and the open gameplay , but noted that it put more responsibility on the players for keeping the game interesting . Justin Calvert of GameSpot also gave high marks for the game 's variety of multiplayer modes , but felt that there was a lack in customization options for players . In a more critical view of multiplayer , Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com noted that games can suffer from <unk> due to the open nature of multiplayer gameplay . He also criticized the leveling and unlocking aspects , noting that " The first few minutes spent as a toothless miner riding a <unk> mule can be pretty humiliating " . G4TV 's Jake Gaskill echoed this sentiment . He noted that the game often respawns players in a similar location to their death , which allows the killing player to repeatedly grief the other player . Rockstar has since added a feature which allows for players being <unk> to transport to another area upon respawn .

 = 2012 Paris – Nice = 
 The 2012 Paris – Nice was the 70th running of the Paris – Nice cycling stage race , often known as the Race to the Sun . It started on 4 March in Dampierre @-@ en @-@ Yvelines and ended on 11 March in Nice and consisted of eight stages , including two time trials that bookended the race . It was the second race of the 2012 UCI World Tour season . 
 The race was won by Great Britain 's Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky , who took the lead on the second stage of the race and held the race leader 's yellow jersey to the finish , becoming the first British rider to win the race since Tom Simpson in 1967 . Wiggins also took home the green jersey for amassing the highest number of points during stages at intermediate sprints and stage finishes . Wiggins won the general classification by eight seconds over runner @-@ up Lieuwe Westra ( Vacansoleil – DCM ) , who was winner of the race 's queen stage to Mende . Movistar Team 's Alejandro Valverde completed the podium , 62 seconds behind Westra and 70 seconds down on Wiggins . 
 In the race 's other classifications , Tejay van Garderen of BMC Racing Team won the white jersey for the highest placed rider born in 1987 or later by placing fifth overall in the general classification , while Vacansoleil – DCM rider Frederik Veuchelen won the King of the Mountains classification . Vacansoleil – DCM also finished at the head of the teams classification at the end of a fruitful week for the team , in which their riders also claimed three stage victories .

 4 March 2012 — Dampierre @-@ en @-@ Yvelines to Saint @-@ Rémy @-@ lès @-@ Chevreuse , 9 @.@ 4 km ( 5 @.@ 8 mi ) individual time trial ( ITT ) 
 The race began in the Vallée de Chevreuse for the first time , as it reverted to an opening individual time trial stage after race organisers elected to run a road stage first in 2011 . Apart from the third @-@ category climb of the Côte des Dix @-@ sept Tournants – the hill of seventeen turns – the stage was relatively flat , dropping only 9 metres ( 30 ft ) in altitude from the start , to the end . With rain expected to disrupt the stage , teams decided to spread their time trial specialists across the field in order to maximise their potential of winning the stage . For the first rider to depart the start in Dampierre @-@ en @-@ Yvelines , Project 1t4i 's Alexandre Geniez , weather conditions were cloudy and grey , with slightly damp roads due to overnight rains . He ultimately recorded a time of 12 ' 10 " for the stage . 
 Geniez held the lead for all of a few minutes as Denis Menchov ( Team Katusha ) improved upon his time by eight seconds , before Garmin – Barracuda rider Thomas Dekker was the first rider to set a time below twelve minutes , recording a time of 11 ' 56 " ; a six @-@ second improvement on Menchov 's time . Michael Mørkøv ( Team Saxo Bank ) , and later Maarten Wynants ( Rabobank ) both improved upon Dekker 's time , but by the end of the first wave of riders to depart , it was Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step and Sylvain Chavanel that held the lead , recording a time of 11 ' 31 " . Following a quick start to the stage , Vacansoleil – DCM 's Thomas De Gendt was the next rider to hold the provisional best time on the stage , besting Chavanel 's time by less than a second . De Gendt , who won the opening stage of the race in 2011 , ultimately picked up the polka @-@ dot jersey for the lead in the mountains classification , as he held the quickest time to the intermediate timing point , at the summit of the Côte des Dix @-@ sept Tournants . De Gendt 's time held for a while , as riders struggled to match the pace that he had set , with only Markel Irizar of RadioShack – Nissan coming within touching distance of his time , finishing one second down . 
 It was not until De Gendt 's Vacansoleil – DCM team @-@ mate Gustav Larsson – the Swedish national champion in the discipline – that his time was beaten ; Larsson , although six seconds slower than De Gendt to the intermediate checkpoint , put in a better second element to the race , eventually crossing the finish line in an eventual stage @-@ winning time of 11 ' 19 " . Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step also deployed Levi Leipheimer in the first half of riders to complete the course , and did so in a time four seconds slower than Larsson . The weather closed in for the last batch of riders , providing a tougher test for those riders in wanting to position themselves highly in the stage classification . BMC Racing Team 's Tejay van Garderen and Team Sky 's Bradley Wiggins both attacked the course late on , and were rewarded with finishes inside the top five , as van Garderen finished nine seconds down on Larsson , while Wiggins – a winner of the time trial stage in February 's Volta ao Algarve – fell short by just one second , but ensured he had an advantage of 24 seconds on defending race @-@ winner and world time trial champion Tony Martin ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) , who could only finish 28th .

 Following his crash in the opening day time trial , Team Saxo Bank 's Nick Nuyens became the race 's first abandonment ; he attempted to ride through the pain barrier , but had to withdraw within the neutralised zone prior to the real start of the stage . The peloton itself remained together for the first third of the race , as strong headwinds counteracted against the field and did not allow for any breakaways to be formed efficiently . As such , Olivier Kaisen was the first to make a move for Lotto – Belisol , attacking as the field moved through the commune of Rambouillet . Kaisen managed to extend his advantage out by almost three minutes when he reached the summit of the day 's only categorised climb , in Les Granges @-@ le @-@ Roi . Mountains classification leader Thomas De Gendt ( Vacansoleil – DCM ) placed second , with Sylvain Chavanel third for Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step . 
 As the field reached the midway point of the stage , the windy conditions that had earlier plagued any potential breakaway from forming returned , and the crosswinds provided a large split in the field and echelons forming within it . By the time that the race had been finished , around thirty riders had made it in the lead group on the road , including overall contenders Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky , Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step 's Levi Leipheimer and BMC Racing Team rider Tejay van Garderen . The group was later reduced to 21 riders out front after several small crashes eliminated a handful of riders from contention . Wiggins put more time into his rivals by taking the intermediate sprint , and with it , three bonus seconds on offer that gave him the virtual race lead , without even considering the fact that the overnight leader Gustav Larsson ( Vacansoleil – DCM ) failed to make the split . The gap from the lead pack to the first group of pursuers remained between two and two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes for the rest of stage with many teams electing not to bridge the gap , mainly due to the rain that had commenced within the closing 25 km ( 15 @.@ 5 mi ) . 
 Larsson 's team @-@ mate Lieuwe Westra attacked with around 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) remaining , but his effort was quickly neutralised by Chavanel , one of a number of Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step riders in the group hoping to help Tom Boonen in a sprint finish lead @-@ out . Following another failed attack from Garmin – Barracuda rider Andreas <unk> , it was left to the sprinters to battle it out for the stage honours . Project 1t4i 's John Degenkolb – who had recovered to the group after a puncture with 30 km ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) remaining – was the first to make an attempt for the line , closely followed by José Joaquín Rojas ( Movistar Team ) , but both were out @-@ sprinted by Boonen , who went to the inside of Degenkolb and took out the victory , for the 100th individual victory of his career , and his team 's first at UCI World Tour level . Rojas just beat Degenkolb for second place on the line with Sep Vanmarcke and Francesco <unk> rounding out the top five for Garmin – Barracuda and Astana respectively . Following his finish in the lead group , Wiggins assumed the overall lead from Larsson , with Boonen taking the points classification lead while moving into third place overall behind team @-@ mate Leipheimer , thanks to the bonus seconds on offer at the finish .

 6 March 2012 — <unk> to Lac de <unk> , 194 km ( 120 @.@ 5 mi ) 
 A trio of riders – Project 1t4i 's Roy Curvers , Saur – Sojasun rider Jimmy Engoulvent and Michael Mørkøv of Team Saxo Bank – made the early breakaway from the field , and managed to extend their advantage to the main field to over four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes at one point during the stage , before eventually stabilising at the 4 ' 30 " mark for the majority of the stage . Team Sky and Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step riders occupied the front portion of the peloton , protecting their respective lead riders Bradley Wiggins and Levi Leipheimer in order to not lose time before the final climb at Lac de <unk> . The pack , now fronted by the Movistar Team , steadily cut into the lead for the three escapees , who reached the categorised climb of the Côte de <unk> with an advantage of less than three minutes . Curvers crested the summit first , but posed no threat to the mountains classification leader Thomas De Gendt ( Vacansoleil – DCM ) , who kept a hold of the polka @-@ dot jersey . 
 After the climb , the peloton lifted the pace and cut into the leaders ' advantage , trimming off two minutes within the space of 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . Engoulvent left his two breakaway companions behind with 14 km ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) remaining , as Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step hit the front of the peloton , this time with points classification leader Tom Boonen doing some of the legwork . Engoulvent held his slim lead through the intermediate sprint at <unk> @-@ le @-@ Château , before being engulfed by the field with 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) to go . Vacansoleil – DCM rider Sergey <unk> attacked with 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) to go – just as team @-@ mate Lieuwe Westra did the previous day – but was unsuccessful , and was eventually caught just before the final kilometre of the stage . Westra attacked but was covered off immediately , setting up the uphill sprint to the line . 
 French pair Blel Kadri ( Ag2r – La Mondiale ) and Jérémie Galland ( Saur – Sojasun ) both launched their attacks in the closing stages , but were overhauled by a bunch of riders from which Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) looked to have the legs on the rest of the field , sprinting from 300 m ( 980 ft ) out . Valverde was briefly troubled by the sprint of Australian road race champion Simon Gerrans ( GreenEDGE ) , with Valverde ultimately prevailing at the line – just as was the case at the Tour Down Under in a two @-@ up sprint – by half a wheel length , with Lotto – Belisol 's Gianni Meersman rounding out the podium ahead of Rabobank 's Luis León Sánchez and Team Katusha 's Xavier Florencio ; both of whom had launched their own attacks in the closing metres . Valverde 's victory – his fourth of the season since returning from a doping ban – was enough to move him into the lead of the points classification , while the bonus seconds awarded on the line moved him into sixth place overall , 20 seconds down on race leader Wiggins .

 7 March 2012 — Brive @-@ la @-@ Gaillarde to Rodez , 178 km ( 110 @.@ 6 mi ) 
 A quintet of riders – Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Jean @-@ Christophe Péraud , FDJ – BigMat rider Pierrick Fédrigo , Leigh Howard of GreenEDGE , Lotto – Belisol 's Bart De Clercq and Cofidis rider Luis Ángel Maté – made the early breakaway from the field , and managed to extend their advantage over the main field to in excess of five minutes at one point during the stage . As such , the riders between them managed to take all sub @-@ classification points on offer during the stage , at the single intermediate sprint – coming after 142 km ( 88 @.@ 2 mi ) at Saint @-@ Cyprien @-@ sur @-@ <unk> – and the first three of the five categorised climbs during the stage . Their advantage out front dwindled quickly as the peloton – led by Rabobank and Lampre – ISD – gathered pace , leaving the breakaway with just 90 seconds of a lead out front with around 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) to go . 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) later , Maté sat up with cramping in his knee – stemming from a crash in Stage 2 – having already wrested the lead of the mountains classification away from Thomas De Gendt ( Vacansoleil – DCM ) . The peloton picked up the pace again , with Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step on the front , and the remaining members of the breakaway were caught a short time later . 
 De Gendt himself attacked on the penultimate climb , the Côte d <unk> le <unk> , to limit the points gap between himself and Maté , picking up the four points on offer for reaching the summit first and reducing his gap to Maté to eight points . After a short period off the front of the field , De Gendt was caught by a small gruppetto of riders and ultimately the rest of the field moments later , with the Movistar Team and Team Sky squads making moves in order to get their respective classification leaders Alejandro Valverde and Bradley Wiggins in safe positions for the run to Rodez . Andreas Klöden tried to go clear inside the final 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) for RadioShack – Nissan , taking top points at the final climb , but was caught with around 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) to go . The easing gradient into Rodez set up a sprint to the line with Lampre – ISD 's Grega Bole launching early , but was eventually passed by Lotto – Belisol rider Gianni Meersman , who was third the previous day . Meersman held on to win ahead of Bole and Vacansoleil – DCM 's Lieuwe Westra , whose bonus seconds on the line enabled him to surpass Valverde for sixth place in the general classification . Other than Maté assuming the mountains lead from De Gendt , none of the other jerseys changed hands as Wiggins , Valverde and Tejay van Garderen ( BMC Racing Team ) all finished safely in the pack . 
 = = = Stage 5 = = = 
 8 March 2012 — <unk> @-@ le @-@ Château to Mende , 178 @.@ 5 km ( 110 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 The race 's queen stage consisted of six categorised climbs over the 178 @.@ 5 km ( 110 @.@ 9 mi ) parcours , including three first @-@ category climbs ; the Côte de la <unk> , the Côte de l <unk> and the final climb to Mende , the Côte de la Croix @-@ Neuve – Montée Laurent Jalabert – a 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) climb at an average gradient of 10 @.@ 1 % , named in honour of the three @-@ time Paris – Nice winner Laurent Jalabert – which had featured twice before as a summit finish in 2007 and 2010 , won on both occasions by Alberto Contador . Many riders and teams believed that the stage suited Movistar Team 's Alejandro Valverde , who had finished second on the Mende stage in 2010 before the result was expunged due to his doping suspension later in the year . Four riders – Vacansoleil – DCM 's Frederik Veuchelen , GreenEDGE rider Simon Clarke , David <unk> of Saur – Sojasun and Team Europcar 's Yukiya Arashiro – advanced clear of the main field after just 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) of the stage , and managed to extend their advantage to a maximum of around seven minutes at one point during the stage . 
 Veuchelen earned the majority of points on offer for the mountains classification , summiting the stage 's first three climbs , cresting them all ahead of <unk> and Arashiro . Movistar Team riders began to step up the pace on the front of the peloton , looking to set up the basis for an eventual attack at Mende by Valverde . With around 50 km ( 31 @.@ 1 mi ) to go , Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Blel Kadri exited the race , after breaking his left scapula in a crash . On the Côte de l <unk> , Astana 's Kevin Seeldraeyers and Rabobank 's Laurens ten Dam attacked off the front of the main field , and set off in chase of the lead quartet . As Veuchelen continued to rack up points towards a mountains classification lead , Seeldraeyers and ten Dam continued to close on the lead group , and with around 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining , they latched on to the group as they were on the outskirts of Mende . The peloton caught all bar Veuchelen a short time later , with Veuchelen relenting to the foot of the final climb of the Côte de la Croix @-@ Neuve – Montée Laurent Jalabert , before he too was engulfed by the main field through the advancing pace of several teams on the front of the pack . 
 Team Sky then took up the reins through recent Volta ao Algarve winner Richie Porte , protecting their overall leader Bradley Wiggins ; such was Porte 's high tempo that less than twenty riders remained in the lead group as the race reached the final kilometre . Arnold Jeannesson attacked from the group for FDJ – BigMat , gaining several bike lengths before Wiggins upped his pace , putting youth classification leader Tejay van Garderen ( BMC Racing Team ) into difficulty . As Wiggins bridged up to Jeannesson , Lieuwe Westra , sixth place in the general classification overnight , attacked for Vacansoleil – DCM ; pulling clear and earned the stage victory , six seconds ahead of a small group consisting of Valverde , Wiggins , Levi Leipheimer ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) and Simon Špilak for Team Katusha . Westra moved into second place in the general classification after reducing his deficit to Wiggins , to six seconds , while Valverde and Špilak both moved ahead of van Garderen , into the top five . Jeannesson 's late @-@ stage attack was also beneficial to his overall position , as he also moved inside the top ten , into seventh position . 
 = = = Stage 6 = = = 
 9 March 2012 — Suze @-@ la @-@ Rousse to Sisteron , 178 @.@ 5 km ( 110 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 Just as what occurred on the second stage of the race , crosswinds caused an early fracture in the main field ; inside the first 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , a group of around thirty riders – including all the overall general classification contenders , with the exception of Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) and Maxime Monfort ( RadioShack – Nissan ) – got clear just as the race moved into the commune of <unk> . A second group of another thirty riders also formed out of the main bunch , but were quickly caught by the peloton , mainly through the acceleration of the Movistar Team , helping Valverde to get back into the stage equation . The main field reformed on the day 's second categorised climb , the Côte du Pas de Ventoux , but seven riders – mountains classification leader Frederik Veuchelen ( Vacansoleil – DCM ) , RadioShack – Nissan 's Jens Voigt , Project 1t4i rider Simon Geschke , Luis León Sánchez of Rabobank , Mickaël Cherel ( Ag2r – La Mondiale ) , FDJ – BigMat 's Anthony <unk> and Daniel Navarro of Team Saxo Bank – went clear to form the day 's primary breakaway . 
 By the time the breakaway reached the third climb of the day , the Côte d <unk> , the gap to the main field was just under four minutes , and with Sánchez – the 2009 race @-@ winner – less than four minutes behind overall leader Bradley Wiggins , Team Sky put their men on the front of the field in order to limit any potential gains that Sánchez could have made . The gap to the breakaway was reduced to two minutes inside the final 25 km ( 15 @.@ 5 mi ) of the stage , and as the leaders made their way through Sisteron before a 19 km ( 11 @.@ 8 mi ) finishing circuit , their lead was almost halved to 1 ' 10 " . Sánchez , Voigt and Cherel went clear of their four other companions as they crested the final climb of the day , the Côte des <unk> with around 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) left in the stage . Cherel was dropped several minutes later , and with the main bunch not closing quickly enough to force a field sprint for the honours , it was left to Sánchez and Voigt to do battle themselves . Voigt launched first but Sánchez held enough in reserve to out @-@ sprint his rival , by a wheel length , for his fourth career Paris – Nice stage victory . Garmin – Barracuda 's Heinrich Haussler led home the main field in third place , fourteen seconds in arrears of Sánchez and Voigt , while the overall contenders finished safely in the pack , causing no changes to the top ten placings . 
 = = = Stage 7 = = = 
 10 March 2012 — Sisteron to Nice , 219 @.@ 5 km ( 136 @.@ 4 mi ) 
 Mini @-@ attacks set the course for the stage as the field remained as one , for much of the first hour of racing . It was not until after 48 km ( 29 @.@ 8 mi ) that the stage 's primary breakaway had been formed . Two riders – Thomas De Gendt of Vacansoleil – DCM and Cofidis 's Rein Taaramäe – originally managed to breach the confines of the field , and set off in a bid to extend a substantial advantage of the main field , as both riders featured a long way down the general classification . Taaramäe 's presence in the breakaway came just 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) after he had suffered an accident in the main field ; he was looking to reduce some of his 31 @-@ minute deficit to race leader Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) , while De Gendt was half that margin behind Wiggins , trailing by 15 ' 44 " . 
 By the time that De Gendt and Taaramäe had reached the stage 's opening climb of the day , the Col des <unk> , the duo held an advantage of over eight minutes to the main field , before later extending that gap out to twelve minutes around 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) later . Astana 's Evgeni Petrov gave chase on his own for around 30 km ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) , but was eventually recaptured by the peloton , still twelve minutes in arrears of De Gendt and Taaramäe . The lead duo were in the process of attacking one another on the Col de Vence , with De Gendt eventually breaking Taaramäe 's resistance , and ultimately soloed the remaining 60 km ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) of the stage to take his team 's third victory of the race , after prior victories for Gustav Larsson and Lieuwe Westra . Taaramäe also remained clear of the main field , finishing second , but over six minutes down on De Gendt . 
 A further three minutes passed before the main field crossed the finish line on the Promenade des Anglais , led over the line by Project 1t4i rider John Degenkolb , Greg Henderson of Lotto – Belisol and BMC Racing Team 's Thor Hushovd . Wiggins maintained his six @-@ second lead over Westra in the overall classification , as both riders finished safely in the pack , however this was not the case for Levi Leipheimer , who had been lying in third place overnight for Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step . In the second half of the stage alone , Leipheimer crashed on three separate occasions , and thus finished over seven minutes behind his rivals for overall victory , thereby ending his chances of winning the race and the chances of becoming the first American since Floyd Landis , in 2006 , to win the race . 
 = = = Stage 8 = = = 
 11 March 2012 — Nice to Col d 'Èze , 9 @.@ 6 km ( 6 @.@ 0 mi ) individual time trial ( ITT ) 
 For the final time trial stage , the race returned to the Col d 'Èze for a mountain time trial for the first time since 2001 – although the first time since 1995 in its once traditional place as the final stage of the race – when Dario <unk> of the Fassa Bortolo team triumphed by almost half a minute from his nearest rivals . As was customary of time trial stages , cyclists set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage . Thus , Jarosław <unk> of Team Saxo Bank , who , in 145th place , trailed overall leader Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) by one hour , eighteen minutes and fifty @-@ three seconds , was the first rider to set off on the final stage . <unk> set a time of 23 ' 32 " for the 4 @.@ 7 % average gradient climb . 
 Liquigas – Cannondale rider <unk> Dall <unk> was the first to break 23 minutes for the climb , but his stay at the top of the standings was short as Wiggins ' team @-@ mate Danny Pate , a former world time trial champion at under @-@ 23 level , went substantially quicker than Dall <unk> , setting a benchmark of 21 ' 29 " for the climb . Wiggins shadowed his team @-@ mate 's run , in a car following him up the hill , to gather information about what lay ahead before his start time . Pate 's time held for almost 20 minutes until Lotto – Belisol 's Bart De Clercq bettered his time , breaking the 21 @-@ minute barrier . French riders then lowered the benchmark yet further ; David Moncoutié , who finished fourth in the race 's last time trial at the Col d 'Èze , recorded a time of 20 ' 11 " for Cofidis , but Jean @-@ Christophe Péraud usurped that with the first sub 20 @-@ minute time . The Ag2r – La Mondiale rider , the 2009 national time trial champion , recorded a time of 19 ' 45 " ; a time that left his team manager Vincent <unk> elated , with Péraud later expressing his surprise at such a quick time . 
 Péraud 's time remained untouched until the final group of riders set off , and with Team Katusha 's Simon Špilak coming closest to Péraud in a time of 19 ' 59 " , having faded from a similar time at the intermediate point of the Col des Quatre Chemins , the stage battle ultimately came down to the two riders in contention for the overall honours ; Wiggins and Vacansoleil – DCM 's Lieuwe Westra . Westra set off two minutes before Wiggins , and although noted as proficient in the time trial discipline , he left everything on the hill as he set the fastest time to the intermediate checkpoint ; recording a time of 11 ' 29 " , taking around three seconds per kilometre out of Péraud 's time of 11 ' 47 " . Two minutes later , Wiggins passed the same point two seconds slower than Westra , but a stronger second half to the stage sealed the victory for Wiggins ; as the hill flattened , Wiggins ' time @-@ trial experience proved pivotal as he overhauled the deficit to Westra , and finished the stage with a two @-@ second advantage over Westra , taking the stage win , overall victory and the points classification in one fell swoop . Movistar Team 's Alejandro Valverde , who had held the lead of the points classification prior to the stage , could only muster sixth on the stage , but this result was good enough for him to claim the final remaining place on the podium . 
 = = Classification leadership progress = = 
 In the 2012 Paris – Nice , four different jerseys were awarded . For the general classification , calculated by adding each cyclist 's finishing times on each stage , and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass @-@ start stages , the leader received a yellow jersey . This classification was considered the most important of the 2012 Paris – Nice , and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race . 
 Additionally , there was a points classification , which awarded a green jersey . In the points classification , cyclists got points for finishing in the top 20 in a stage . Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France , the type of stage had no effect on what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale . The win earned 25 points , second place earned 22 points , third 20 , fourth 18 , fifth 16 , and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 20th . In addition , points could be won in intermediate sprints ; three points for crossing the sprint line first , two points for second place , and one for third . 
 There was also a mountains classification , the leadership of which was marked by a red and white polka @-@ dot jersey . In the mountains classification , points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists . Each climb was categorised as either first , second , or third @-@ category , with more points available for the higher @-@ categorised climbs . For first @-@ category climbs , points were awarded on a scale of 10 points for first across the climb , second place earned 8 points , third 6 , fourth 4 , and one point fewer per place down to a single point for seventh . Second @-@ category climbs awarded points on a scale of 7 points for first place , second place earned 5 points , third 3 , and one point fewer per place down to a single point for fifth . Third @-@ category climbs awarded points to the top three riders only ; 4 points for first across the climb , second place earned 2 points , third place earned 1 point . 
 The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification , marked by a white jersey . This was decided the same way as the general classification , but only riders born after 1 January 1987 were eligible to be ranked in the classification . 
 There was also a classification for teams , in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together ; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time .

" Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine deemed it as " the best @-@ looking 2D graphics ever seen in a fighter . " 1UP.com said , " the <unk> , hi @-@ res character art and fluid animation keep XX at the cutting 2D edge . " Dunham , Knutson , Keil , and GamePro commended its similarity with Japanese animated series . The reviewer for GamePro stated it " becomes an art form in its own right . " Greg Kasavin of GameSpot , however , said " many of the moves in the game are animated so strangely that it can be difficult to see exactly what 's going on . " 
 Kasavin commented that its " cohesive musical style ... further helps set this game apart . " Dunham deemed it as having " One of the best soundtracks to come along for quite some time " , and praised Sammy for keeping the original voice actors , as did Knutson , which felt it " gives it a ' cooler aura ' . " Keil and Knutson found the sound effects to be " excellent " and " really great " respectively . On the other hand , GamePro described the sound design as the game 's " major flaw . " EGM remarked " Depending on your tastes , <unk> 's pervasive heavy @-@ metal cheesiness might negatively influence your opinion of the game . " 
 Other features praised include its short loading time , the variety of game modes and characters , the balance between characters ' abilities , the response of the controls , its replay value , and variety of features . Dunham even declared it " reads like the bible of fighting game options . Taking a page from every other title out there , there doesn 't seem to be a single feature on the horizon that 's been left out of <unk> for fear of the <unk> . " In spite of the praise , other criticisms vary from its general difficulty to the lack of an online play mode , position of move list in training mode , and the difficulty to perform moves in Dual Shock .

 = = History = = 
 Dean Witter Reynolds traced its origins to two firms : Dean Witter & Co. founded in 1924 and Reynolds & Co . ( later Reynolds Securities ) founded in 1931 . 
 = = = Dean Witter & Co . ( 1924 @-@ 1978 ) = = = 
 Dean Witter & Company was founded by Dean G. Witter as a retail brokerage firm in 1924 . With its original offices at 45 Montgomery Street in San Francisco , California , Dean Witter would be among the largest West Coast brokerage firms in the U.S. Among Witter 's original partners were his brother Guy and their cousins Jean C. Witter and Ed Witter as well as Fritz Janney . Prior to founding his own firm , Witter partnered with Charles R. Blyth to found Blyth , Witter & Co . , another San Francisco based brokerage in 1914 . After Witter 's departure , Blyth would continue on his own ( ultimately acquired by Paine Webber in 1979 ) and the two firms would remain competitors for decades . 
 Witter 's family had moved to Northern California from Wausau , Wisconsin , settling in San Carlos , California in 1891 . Before founding his own firms , Dean Witter had worked as a salesman for Louis Sloss & Company from his graduation from the University of California , Berkeley in 1909 until 1914 . Dean Witter would lead his company until his death in 1969 . 
 In its early years , Dean Witter focused on dealing in municipal and corporate bonds . The company was highly successful in its first five years , purchasing a seat on the San Francisco Stock Exchange in 1928 and then opening an office in New York and purchasing a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 . Although a relatively young company , Dean Witter survived Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression , posting profits every year during the 1930s and into the 1940s . 
 The company grew rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s , establishing itself as a major U.S. brokerage house and developing a reputation for innovation in the securities industry . In 1938 , Dean Witter established its national research department , and in 1945 , became the first retail securities firm to offer a formal training for account executives . In 1953 , the firm entered into an agreement to merge with Harris , Hall & Co . , a Chicago investment banking and securities firm spun out of Harris Bank after passage of the Glass Steagall Act . In the early 1950s , Harris , Hall was one of the 17 U.S. investment banking and securities firms named in the Justice Department 's antitrust investigation of Wall Street commonly known as the Investment bankers case . In 1962 , Dean Witter became the first firm to use electronic data processing — a feat that paved the way for securities handling on Wall Street . 
 Following Witter 's death in 1969 , and the retirement of Guy Witter the following year , Jean Witter 's son , William M. Witter , became CEO of Dean Witter & Co . After numerous brokerage firm acquisitions , Dean Witter went public in 1972 . Dean Witter 's initial public offering ( shortly after the IPO of Reynolds Securities ) was part of a rush of Wall Street firms to sell an interest in their privately held businesses to public investors , following Merrill Lynch 's initial public offering in early 1971 . 
 = = = Reynolds Securities ( 1931 @-@ 1978 ) = = = 
 Reynolds & Co. was founded in 1931 in New York City by Richard S. Reynolds , Jr . , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old tobacco heir . Reynolds ' father Richard S. Reynolds , Sr. founded U.S. Foil Company , later Reynolds Metals ( Reynolds wrap ) , and his great uncle was the founder of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company ( RJR ) . Among Reynolds ' partners were Thomas F. Staley ( Staley was Reynolds ’ cousin , the grandson of Major D. Reynolds , an older brother of R.J. Reynolds ) , Charles H. Babcock and John D. Baker . 
 Like Dean Witter , the company survived the Depression , generating a profit each year . In 1934 , Reynolds acquired F.A. Willard & Co . With the acquisition , Reynolds tripled its sales and shifted its emphasis toward <unk> . 
 In 1958 , Reynolds passed its leadership to the next generation with Thomas F. Staley departing and naming Robert M. Gardiner to head the firm . Under Gardiner , Reynolds embarks on major expansion , acquiring 26 offices from A.M. Kidder & Co . Reynolds acquired another three offices and opened nine firms in new regions in the U.S. in the early 1960s . 
 Reynolds was incorporated in 1971 as Reynolds Securities in advance of an initial public offering . By early 1971 , there was speculation that Merrill Lynch would sell shares to the public . Reynolds initial public offering ( and shortly thereafter Dean Witter 's IPO ) was part of a rush of Wall Street firms to sell an interest in their privately held businesses to public investors , following Merrill Lynch 's initial public offering . In 1976 , Reynolds implements <unk> , the most sophisticated high @-@ speed wire system in the industry . Meanwhile , the firm was continuing its expansion , acquiring its first international offices in Lugano and Lausanne , Switzerland . A year later , Reynolds acquired Baker Weeks & Co. whose strength was securities research . 
 At the time of its merger with Dean Witter in 1978 , Reynolds Securities had over 3 @,@ 100 employees in 72 offices producing gross revenues of nearly $ 120 million . 
 = = = The Dean Witter Reynolds merger and the Sears acquisition ( 1978 @-@ 1993 ) = = = 
 In 1978 Dean Witter and Reynolds merged to form Dean Witter Reynolds Organization Inc . ( <unk> ) in what was then the largest securities industry merger in U.S. history . The resultant company , Dean Witter Reynolds , was the fifth largest broker in the U.S. One year later Dean Witter Reynolds became the first securities firm to have offices in all 50 U.S. states and Washington , D.C. After completion of the merger , Dean Witter Reynolds generated revenue of more than $ 520 million . 
 In 1981 , Dean Witter Reynolds was acquired by Sears , Roebuck and Company in a $ 600 million transaction . Sears ' core retail business was facing several challenges , and the company decided to diversify into new businesses , including financial services . Sears , which was already in the financial services business through its ownership of the Allstate Insurance Company announced a major acquisition initiative in financial services . In addition to the acquisition of Dean Witter , Sears also acquired Coldwell Banker , the real estate brokerage company in 1981 . Sears intended for Dean Witter to form the foundation for a larger Sears Financial Services Network that would be available to customers through the company 's retail stores . 
 Sears named Philip J. Purcell , a strategic planner at the Sears Chicago headquarters and former McKinsey & Co. consultant , to head Dean Witter . Purcell moved to New York to run the operation from Dean Witter 's office . At the time of the Sears acquisition , Dean Witter Reynolds had a retail broker force of over 4 @,@ 500 account executives in over 300 locations with over 11 @,@ 500 employees in total . For the year ended 1980 , Dean Witter Reynolds generated over $ 700 million of revenue . 
 Under Sears ownership , in 1986 , the firm launched the Discover Card , a new brand of credit card outside the well established Visa , MasterCard and American Express networks . Unlike other attempts at creating a credit card to rival MasterCard and VISA , such as Citibank 's Choice card , the Discover Card quickly gained a large national consumer base . It carried no annual fee , which was uncommon at the time , and offered a typically higher credit limit than similar cards . Cardholders could earn a " <unk> Bonus , " in which a percentage of the amount spent would be refunded to the account ( originally 2 % , now as high as 5 % ) , depending on how much the card was used . Discover offered merchant fees significantly lower than those of other widely accepted credit cards . Eventually Discover grew to become one of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. 
 = = = Dean Witter Discover ( 1993 @-@ 1997 ) = = = 
 Sears ' financial services initiative proved highly successful as Discover grew through the late 1980s and early 1990s . Furthermore , the substantial investment in the Discover business also began to pay off , with the business becoming highly profitable . The early 1990s were also a period of rapid growth for Dean Witter Reynolds as its strategy of focusing on the distribution of proprietary mutual funds through its extensive retail brokerage network began to bear fruit . 
 Dean Witter 's core securities business and its Discover business generated combined revenue of $ 59 billion in 1992 and Sears announced that it would seek to monetize its investment through a public offering . In 1993 , 20 % of the company was spun off from Sears to shareholders , and the company was subsequently renamed Dean Witter , Discover & Co . , with two primary operating subsidiaries : Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card . Later that year , the remaining 80 % of shares were distributed to Sears ' shareholders , giving Dean Witter complete independence from Sears . 
 Dean Witter 's corporate headquarters were located in New York City 's 2 World Trade Center ( i.e. South Tower ) , where the firm had occupied over 864 @,@ 000 square feet ( 80 @,@ 300 m2 ) since 1985 . Dean Witter was one of many tenants whose offices were evacuated as a result of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , which took place during the firm 's spinoff from Sears . Following , the firm 's merger with Morgan Stanley , the firm 's headquarters would be moved to 1585 Broadway on the edge of New York 's Time Square . Morgan Stanley Dean Witter would still have a large presence at the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 . 
 Dean Witter was the first big brokerage company to get into the online trading business when it bought a small San Francisco @-@ based outfit called Lombard Brokerage in 1996 . 
 = = = Merger with Morgan Stanley ( 1997 @-@ 2009 ) = = = 
 In 1997 , Morgan Stanley Group , Inc. and Dean Witter Discover merged to form one of the largest global financial services firms : Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . 
 Although Morgan Stanley was the more prominent partner , Dean Witter 's focus on retail investors , mutual funds and credit cards which were seen by the stock market as generating more stable cash flows than Morgan Stanley 's investment banking business , had by the time of the merger made it the more valuable partner in terms of market capitalization . Dean Witter 's CEO , Philip Purcell , the main architect of the merger , became chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the merged group . The merger marked the pairing of a storied investment banking firm with a retail brokerage ( that had been owned by a retailer ) that was often termed " white shoes and white socks " . In order to avoid tension during the integration of the two firms , Purcell and Morgan Stanley 's CEO John Mack decided not to choose between the two brand names . Instead , they combined the names of the two firms and put the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter brand on almost all of its operations . 
 Eventually , to foster brand recognition and marketing , the Dean Witter name was dropped from the retail services division in 2001 , leaving the current name Morgan Stanley . In 2009 , the Dean Witter retail operations were transferred to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney , a joint venture with Citigroup .

 = New York State Route 268 ( 1934 – 1974 ) = 
 New York State Route 268 ( NY 268 ) was a state highway in northeastern Erie County , New York , in the United States . It served as a connector between NY 5 in the town of Clarence and NY 78 at the Clarence – Amherst town line . The route passed through rural areas of the town of Clarence and did not serve any areas of significant development . The northern portion of NY 268 followed the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek . 
 The route was assigned c . 1934 as a connector between NY 78 and Tonawanda Creek Road , then part of NY 263 . In between the two routes , NY 268 followed Wolcott and Goodrich Roads . NY 268 was moved onto Tonawanda Creek and Salt Roads c . 1938 and remained on those two roads until it was replaced by a reextended NY 263 c . 1974 . NY 263 was truncated back to its current northern terminus within three years time , and ownership and maintenance of all of NY 268 's former routing was transferred to Erie County by April 1980 . Tonawanda Creek Road became County Route 559 ( CR 559 ) while Salt Road was redesignated as County Route 560 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 268 began at an intersection with NY 5 in the hamlet of Clarence in the town of the same name . It headed north , following Salt Road out of the hamlet and into a mostly rural area of northeastern Erie County . Here , the route intersected with several east – west highways of local importance and passed by Beeman Creek Park before meeting Tonawanda Creek Road at a junction on the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek . The highway turned west at this junction , following Tonawanda Creek Road along the edge of the creek to the Clarence – Amherst town line , where NY 268 ended at a junction with NY 78 in the hamlet of Millersport . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of NY 268 date as far back as 1926 , by which time the state of New York had assumed maintenance of several highways in the town of Clarence . The farthest north of these was Tonawanda Creek Road , which was state @-@ maintained from Transit Road ( NY 78 ) in Millersport to Salt Road . From here , state maintenance continued south on Salt Road to a junction with Main Street ( what is now NY 5 ) . Also state @-@ maintained by this time was Goodrich Road , a north – south road connecting Tonawanda Creek Road to Main Street ( modern NY 5 ) , and Wolcott Road , an east – west highway linking Goodrich Road to Transit Road ( what is now NY 78 ) . 
 NY 263 was assigned c . 1931 to an alignment extending from Getzville to Akron via Millersport . Even though Tonawanda Creek Road was state @-@ maintained from NY 78 to Goodrich Road , NY 263 initially followed a more circuitous route via <unk> on NY 78 , Wolcott Road , and Goodrich Road . East of Goodrich Road , the route proceeded generally southeastward along Tonawanda Creek and Salt Roads to a junction with Hunts Corners – Akron Road 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) north of NY 5 . At this point , NY 263 turned east to follow Hunts Corners – Akron Road toward Akron . The remainder of Salt Road between NY 263 and NY 5 was designated as NY 267 . 
 NY 263 was gradually realigned to use all of Tonawanda Creek and Salt Roads between NY 5 and NY 78 . The first change came c . 1934 when it was realigned to head due east from Millersport on Tonawanda Creek Road . The former routing of NY 263 on Wolcott and Goodrich Roads by way of <unk> was redesignated as NY 268 . By the following year , NY 263 was realigned south of Hunts Corners – Akron Road to use Salt Road , supplanting NY 267 . NY 263 was realigned c . 1938 to follow NY 78 north from Middleport instead while NY 268 was shifted onto NY 263 's former routing along Tonawanda Creek and Salt Roads . 
 The routing of NY 268 remained unchanged until c . 1974 , when NY 268 was supplanted by a reextended NY 263 . The extension was short @-@ lived , however , as NY 263 was pulled back to its junction with NY 78 by 1977 . Ownership and maintenance of NY 268 's former routing north of Greiner Road was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County at some point prior to 1980 . The remainder was given to Erie County on April 1 , 1980 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The Tonawanda Creek Road portion of old NY 268 was redesignated as CR 559 while the Salt Road portion was redesignated as CR 560 .

 = King of the Ring ( 1994 ) = 
 King of the Ring ( 1994 ) was the second annual King of the Ring professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . It took place on June 19 , 1994 , at the Baltimore Arena , now known as Royal Farms Arena , in Baltimore . " King of the Ring " is also the name of the tournament that was the focus of this pay @-@ per @-@ view event . The tournament to determine which wrestler would be crowned King of the Ring actually began the month before the pay @-@ per @-@ view , as the wrestlers gained entry in the tournament by participating in qualifying matches . These matches were held throughout May 1994 on WWF television programs , although the WWF did not explain how wrestlers were selected to compete in the qualifying matches . The second , third and fourth rounds of the tournament were televised on the pay @-@ per @-@ view broadcast on June 19 . 
 Owen Hart won the tournament by defeating Tatanka , the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid and Razor Ramon over the course of the evening . He used his coronation ceremony to criticize his brother Bret , with whom he was feuding . The Hart brothers ' feud led to a Steel Cage match for Bret 's WWF World Heavyweight Championship . Although Owen lost the title match , the feud carried on as more family members got involved . 
 In addition to the tournament , several other matches were held at the event . In a grudge match between two semi @-@ retired wrestlers , " Rowdy " Roddy Piper defeated Jerry Lawler . Bret Hart defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Diesel . Diesel won the match when Hart 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Jim Neidhart interfered . As a result , Hart retained the title . The other match was for the WWF Tag Team Championship , in which The Headshrinkers successfully defended the belts against the team of Yokozuna and Crush . 
 = = Background = = 
 Participants in the tournament qualified in matches televised during WWF programs in the weeks prior to the event . The first qualifying match took place on May 7 , 1994 . Irwin R. Schyster ( I.R.S. ) defeated Scott Steiner in a match televised on WWF Superstars . The next qualifying match took place on the May 9 , 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw , when Razor Ramon defeated Kwang with a Razor 's Edge in a qualifying match to enter the tournament . In a match televised on May 14 , 1994 , Mabel ( of Men on a Mission ) defeated Pierre ( of The Quebecers ) to qualify for the tournament . Two days later , the May 16 , 1994 edition of Monday Night RAW , Bam Bam Bigelow qualified for the tournament by defeating Thurman " Sparky " Plugg . 
 The remaining qualifying matches built up to the tournament and developed storylines that played out on the pay @-@ per @-@ view . Lex Luger faced Jeff Jarrett in a qualifying match on May 21 , 1994 . During the match , Crush came to the ring and fought with Luger . Jarrett won the match by countout and advanced to the tournament . Owen Hart was scheduled to wrestle Earthquake on May 23 , 1994 for a spot in the tournament , but the plan was changed after Earthquake left the WWF . To explain Earthquake 's absence , the WWF showed footage of Yokozuna wrestling Earthquake and claimed that Earthquake had sustained an injury . Doink the Clown took Earthquake 's place , but Owen Hart won the match to qualify for the tournament . Next , on May 28 , 1994 , a qualifying match between the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid and Adam Bomb was televised on WWF Superstars . The Kid won after Kwang attempted to interfere on Bomb 's behalf . Kwang accidentally spat green mist in Bomb 's face , allowing the Kid to get the victory . In the final qualifying match , Jimmy Del Ray was originally scheduled to face Tatanka in a match televised on Monday Night Raw on May 30 , 1994 , but Crush took Del Ray 's place . The kayfabe reason given was that Crush 's manager , Mr. Fuji , made a deal with Jim Cornette , Del Ray 's manager , to allow Crush to compete . The match ended in a double countout , after Fuji and Chief Jay Strongbow , who was seconding Tatanka , got involved . This led to a Lumberjack match on Monday Night Raw the following week . Tatanka won the match and the spot in the tournament , after Lex Luger gained revenge for Crush 's interference in his match by attacking Crush . 
 The Headshrinkers had recently become faces after signing Captain Lou Albano as their manager . They received an immediate push and won the World Tag Team Championship by defeating The Quebecers on the May 2 , 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw . Meanwhile , Yokozuna was being buried by the WWF after losing the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania X and being defeated by Earthquake in a Sumo match . He teamed with Crush , who was also managed by Mr. Fuji , to challenge The Headshrinkers for the tag team title at King of the Ring . 
 After beating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in April 1994 , Diesel was in the midst of a major push . He was considered the top contender to Bret Hart 's WWF World Heavyweight Championship , and a match was booked for King of the Ring in which only Hart 's title would be on the line . The feud intensified on the May 30 , 1994 , episode of Monday Night Raw during Jerry Lawler 's interview segment , The King 's Court . During an interview with Hart , Lawler invited Diesel and his friend Shawn Michaels to confront Hart . After a verbal confrontation , Diesel performed his Jacknife Powerbomb on Hart , after which Diesel , Michaels and Lawler attacked Hart . The following week on Monday Night Raw , Bret announced that he would have a family member , whose identity would be a secret until the pay @-@ per @-@ view , in his corner to help prevent Michaels from interfering on Diesel 's behalf . 
 The buildup to the main event match began at WrestleMania X. " Rowdy " Roddy Piper had served as the guest referee during the main event match between Bret Hart and Yokozuna , and Jerry Lawler was a commentator . Following WrestleMania , Lawler used his interview segment , The King 's Court , to insult Piper . After a match was signed between the two , Lawler insulted Piper further by introducing a scrawny fan dressed as Piper on The King 's Court . He claimed that this impersonator was Piper himself , and he made the fan kiss Lawler 's feet .

 King of the Ring 1994 was held at the Baltimore Arena in Baltimore on June 19 , 1994 . Before the pay @-@ per @-@ view broadcast began , Thurman " Sparky " Plugg beat Kwang in a dark match . As the event began , it was revealed that retired football player Art Donovan would be one of the commentators for the evening . Donovan 's appearance would become infamous among wrestling fans for being seemingly uninformed about the product as well as generally befuddled behavior such as repeatedly asking how much certain wrestlers weighed . He was joined by Gorilla Monsoon on play @-@ by @-@ play , who inadvertently referred to Donovan several times as " Art O 'Donnell " , and Randy Savage . Monsoon , who had not called a pay @-@ per @-@ view since 1993 's Royal Rumble after being phased out in favor of Jim Ross and later Vince McMahon , served as McMahon 's replacement due to McMahon 's preparation for his upcoming trial for steroid distribution . To cover up his absence , it was announced that McMahon could not appear because he was recovering from neck surgery . 
 In the first match of the tournament , Bam Bam Bigelow got the early advantage by attacking Razor Ramon from behind . Ramon gained momentum after Bigelow missed a diving headbutt , but Bigelow used his strength and got Ramon in a torture rack . As Bigelow climbed the ropes , however , Ramon threw him back into the ring and scored the pinfall . 
 The following match saw Irwin R. Schyster face Mabel . When Schyster charged at Mabel before the bell , Mabel used his strength to block Schyster and to then powerslam him . Schyster was not able to use much offense due to the size of his opponent . He scored the win , however , when he shook the ropes as Mabel was about to attempt a maneuver from the top rope . Mabel fell to the mat , allowing I.R.S. to pin him . 
 At the beginning of the next match , Tatanka attacked Owen Hart before the bell . The match soon moved into the ringside area , where Hart gained the advantage . After a sleeper hold by Hart and a DDT by Tatanka , Hart reversed Tatanka 's sunset flip attempt and pinned him to advance to the next round . 
 Jarrett used his strength against the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid in the following match . The Kid fought back with a spinning heel kick , but Jarrett regained control . Toward the end of the match , The Kid sustained a kayfabe injury to his knee . Jarrett tried to use this to his advantage by using the Figure Four leglock , but The Kid blocked the hold by using a small package to pin Jarrett for the victory . Upset at being eliminated from the tournament , Jarrett responded by performing three <unk> on The Kid after the match . 
 The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Bret Hart and Diesel came next . Diesel was accompanied by Shawn Michaels , and Hart was joined by brother @-@ in @-@ law and former tag @-@ team partner Jim Neidhart . Diesel used his size against Hart , but Hart managed to perform a Figure Four leglock on Diesel . After this was broken , the wrestlers fought outside the ring . Michaels got involved and attacked Hart . Back inside the ring , the Hart and Diesel fought as Michaels removed the turnbuckle pad . Hart reversed Diesel 's attack , however , and slammed Diesel 's head into the turnbuckle . Hart put Diesel in the Sharpshooter , but Diesel easily reached the ropes to break the hold . Michaels attacked Hart while the referee 's back was turned , which allowed Diesel to perform the Jackknife powerbomb . Before he could pin Hart , however , Neidhart interfered to cause the disqualification and allow Hart to retain his title . After the match , Diesel and Michaels attacked Hart , but Neidhart left the ring . 
 Following the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match , the second round of the tournament began . Razor Ramon attacked his opponent , I.R.S. , in the aisle before the match . The two brawled outside the ring . Afterwards , while using the ropes for leverage , I.R.S. gained the advantage inside the ring by applying a chinlock . Ramon escaped the hold , kicked Schyster and performed the Razor 's Edge for the win . 
 In the other semifinal match , Owen Hart attacked the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid before the bell . Hart used his momentum to wear The Kid down with aerial maneuvers . Although The Kid briefly gained the advantage , Hart performed a powerbomb on him and then used the Sharpshooter to make The Kid submit . 
 The next match was the World Tag Team Championship match . The Headshrinkers gained the early advantage , but Mr. Fuji helped his team by hitting Fatu with the Japanese flag . Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Fatu , but Samu was able to tag in . All four wrestlers fought in the ring before the brawl moved to the arena floor . Crush performed a superplex on Samu , but Lex Luger came to ringside and distracted Crush . This allowed Samu to attempt a roll @-@ up . Crush recovered , but Fatu tagged in and pinned Crush to retain the belts . 
 Razor Ramon began the final match of the tournament by <unk> Owen Hart . Hart used a spinning heel kick and an abdominal stretch to gain the advantage . Ramon performed a back suplex on Hart from the top rope and attempted to use the Razor 's Edge . Hart threw him onto the arena floor , however , where Neidhart attacked Ramon . Hart pinned Ramon and proclaimed himself the " King of Harts " during his coronation ceremony . 
 Prior to the main event match , Piper revealed that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King 's Court segment would be in Piper 's corner during the match . Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler 's face and attacking him . The match consisted mainly of brawling , and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who was standing in Piper 's corner . Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper . He attacked Piper with a foreign object , which knocked Piper to the mat . Then , while trying to pin Piper , Jerry Lawler placed his feet on the ropes for leverage . The fan at ringside pushed Lawler 's feet off , however , which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Owen Hart 's victory intensified his feud with his brother Bret . Having defeated him at WrestleMania X and replicated Bret 's victory in the 1993 King of the Ring tournament , Owen set his sights on Bret 's WWF Championship . The two met at SummerSlam 1994 in a Steel Cage match for the title . Jim Neidhart was in the audience to support Owen . Davey Boy Smith , another brother @-@ in @-@ law of the Hart brothers , got involved with the feud by siding with Bret after Neidhart attacked Smith after the cage match . 
 Because the pay @-@ per @-@ view focused on the tournament , few major feuds were highlighted . Aside from Owen Hart , the tournament did not figure prominently into the future storylines of any of the other participants . The qualifying match between the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid and Adam Bomb did , however , help advance a storyline . Bomb and Kwang , both managed by Harvey Wippleman , began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb . Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result . Their feud did not end with a major blow off match , however . Instead , it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast . 
 Roddy Piper did not reappear on WWF programming again until 1995 , and Lawler returned to doing commentary as well as feuding with Bret Hart . 
 Despite failing to capture the WWF Championship at King of the Ring , Diesel continued to enjoy an unprecedented push . In 1994 , he became the first wrestler in WWF history to win the WWF 's Triple Crown in one calendar year . The Headshrinkers dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Michaels one day before SummerSlam 1994 . Diesel followed this up by winning the WWF Championship on November 26 , 1994 .

 = Cyclone Gwenda = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda was tied for the most intense Australian tropical cyclone on record , with a barometric pressure of 900 hPa ( mbar ) and was the most intense storm worldwide in 1999 . Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2 April 1999 , the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised . On 4 April , the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda . It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day , and in a 30 @-@ hour span ending early on 7 April , the storm 's maximum 10 @-@ minute sustained wind speed increased from 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) to 225 km / h ( 140 mph ) and its barometric pressure decreased to 900 hPa ( mbar ) . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high @-@ end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale . 
 Increasing wind shear and an acceleration in forward speed caused Gwenda to quickly weaken . Less than 18 hours after peaking , the storm made landfall roughly 45 km ( 28 mi ) east of Port Hedland , Western Australia with winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . After moving ashore , Gwenda abruptly stalled before dissipating on 8 April . Although it was once an extremely intense cyclone , the factors that caused its deterioration also prevented significant damage . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 205 mm ( 8 @.@ 1 in ) . Minor structural damage was reported , and only localised flooding was recorded . Following its usage , the name Gwenda was retired at the end of the season . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda originated from a weak tropical disturbance that formed on 1 April over the Arafura Sea . Drifting westward , the system gradually became better organised , and early on 2 April , the Australian Bureau of Meteorology classified it as a tropical low . Over the following two days , the low continued to mature ; on 4 April , the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded it to a Category 1 cyclone and named it Gwenda . Around the same time , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection became concentrated around the centre of circulation and the system 's outflow significantly improved . Located within an environment of low to moderate wind shear , the storm was expected to intensify . 
 By 5 April , the JTWC began issuing advisories on Gwenda , classifying it as a weak tropical storm and designating it as Cyclone <unk> . Tracking southwest in response to a subtropical ridge to the south , Gwenda began to rapidly intensify . Its forward motion significantly decreased as it turned due south before curving towards the southeast , and in a 30 @-@ hour span , maximum winds around the centre of the storm increased from 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) to 225 km / h ( 140 mph ) . The barometric pressure decreased by 90 hPa ( mbar ) , making Gwenda one of the fastest intensifying storms on record . At the end of the intensification phase on 7 April , the Bureau of Meteorology classified the storm as a Category 5 cyclone , the third of the season , with a pressure of 900 hPa ( mbar ) . The JTWC also reported a substantial increase in intensity , classifying Gwenda as a high @-@ end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) . 
 Upon attaining peak intensity , Gwenda displayed a well @-@ defined 30 km ( 19 mi ) eye surrounded by deep convection . At this time , some monitoring satellites estimated that it had attained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane . While Gwenda was active , the Bureau of Meteorology stated that its intensity peaked with winds of 215 km / h ( 125 mph ) and a pressure of 915 hPa ( mbar ) . Hours after attaining this intensity , increasing wind shear began to impact the cyclone , causing convection to become elongated and the eye less defined . Rapid weakening commenced as Gwenda turned southeastward towards the Pilbara coastline . 
 The cyclone continued to deteriorate as it approached Western Australia , with convection displaced ahead of its centre . In addition to the wind shear , Gwenda 's forward speed suddenly increased , leading to further disorganisation . Late on 7 April , the centre of Gwenda made landfall as a Category 2 cyclone roughly 45 km ( 28 mi ) east of Port Hedland with winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . The JTWC estimated the storm to have been slightly stronger at landfall , with winds near 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Shortly after moving inland , the JTWC issued their final advisory on the weakening storm . The Bureau of Meteorology continued to monitor Gwenda as it abruptly stalled just onshore . However , convection associated with Gwenda continued to stream southeastward due to high wind shear . The storm 's remnants persisted for several hours before dissipating early on 8 April . 
 The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses 10 @-@ minute sustained winds , while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one @-@ minute sustained winds . The Bureau of Meteorology 's peak intensity for Gwenda was 225 km / h ( 140 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained , or 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) one @-@ minute sustained . The JTWC 's peak intensity for Gwenda was 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) one @-@ minute sustained , or 220 km / h ( 130 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained . 
 = = Preparations , impact and records = = 
 Already suffering from the effects of Cyclone Vance two weeks earlier , which had destroyed or severely damaged 40 % of the homes in Exmouth , residents in Western Australia heeded warnings of the impending cyclone . By 6 April , the Bureau of Meteorology had issued storm warnings for areas between Port Hedland and Exmouth . State Emergency Services throughout the threatened areas were put on high alert . Several offshore oil platforms were shut down and evacuated on 6 April and did not reopen until 15 April . Hours before the storm made landfall , the State Emergency Services stated that " Gwenda potentially had the destructive power of Cyclone Vance " , and urged residents to seek appropriate shelter . Shortly before the storm struck , Len <unk> , director of the Western Australia Bureau of Meteorology declared , " Port Hedland is now in grave danger . " 
 Despite the cyclone 's strength , its effects were relatively minor . Winds up to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) were recorded in Port Hedland , leading to minor structural damage . The police in Port Hedland reported severe damage to one house , but no deaths or injuries . Emergency crews were sent to the northwest coast of Australia to assist in cleaning up damages , but found no " major incidents " or significant damage as a result of the storm . A group of five people on a camping trip in the Outback were stranded by the storm , when heavy rains swept away their vehicle . The group " would have perished " , but one of its members hiked non @-@ stop for twenty four hours to a manganese mine where he contacted rescuers . 
 In a 12 @-@ hour span , Port Hedland recorded 86 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) of rain , well @-@ above the average April precipitation total of 23 mm ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) . Towns in the Pilbara region of Australia received heavy rainfall , amounting to 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) in some places . <unk> picked up the greatest rainfall total of 205 mm ( 8 @.@ 1 in ) . This rain caused localised flooding , especially in Nullagine where the river traversing the town broke its banks . The rainfall contributed to a long @-@ term cooling effect in northern Western Australia , leading to below @-@ average temperatures for much of April . 
 At its peak Gwenda was the strongest storm on record to form near Australia , surpassing Cyclone Orson in 1989 . Gwenda held this record until 2003 , when its maximum winds were eclipsed by Cyclone Inigo . Despite the minimal damage , the name was retired from the circulating lists of tropical cyclone names for the Australian Region .

 " Movin ' Out ( Brian 's Song ) " was written by series regular John Viener and directed by series regular Cyndi Tang . Brian 's girlfriend Jillian was introduced in season five and this episode marked the end of what the staff called " the Jillian arc " . Executive producer David A. Goodman praised Drew Barrymore 's voice work as Jillian , saying that " she did such an amazing job with the voice " , and was sorry that this was her final episode . The episode was at the time the only Family Guy episode to list the executive producer credits at the end of the episode , because MacFarlane wanted " to wrap it up in kind of a sad way and do it the old @-@ fashioned way . " In the original draft of the episode , Jillian had moved in with Quagmire at the end . It was later changed to Jesus , and then to Mayor West , which was kept for the episode . 
 The episode includes a gag in which Quagmire rapes Marge Simpson , and the two later end up in the Simpson family 's house , where Quagmire kills the family by shooting them . The network executives believed the joke was " personal " and told MacFarlane that he could not do a gag with The Simpsons . MacFarlane responded , saying that they had made fun of Family Guy several times , to which the executives replied that they wanted to " end the feud " . MacFarlane , however , claimed that there was no feud and told them : " You are afraid of [ Simpsons executive producer ] James L. Brooks . [ ... ] And that 's why we can 't do it . " Fox eventually cut the gag , which left the episode without a joke at the end of the first act . Brooks and Al Jean were reportedly very upset with the gag , and because of it , Fox told both the Family Guy and The Simpsons staff that they could no longer make fun of one another . However , the gag was included on the DVD set and broadcasts on Adult Swim . It also aired on Global in Canada .

 Millennium Group member Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) joins his brother Tom ( Philip Anglim ) and sister @-@ in @-@ law Helen ( Liz Bryson ) for their newborn son 's christening . After the child is baptized , Black joins his daughter Jordan ( Brittany Tiplady ) , finding her in hysterics . She claims to have seen a man hurting Helen ; when Black and his brother rush outside , they find the baby in the back of Tom 's car , but Helen is gone . 
 Black 's contact in the Seattle Police Department , Bob Bletcher ( Bill Smitrovich ) , insists that Black should not get involved in the case as he is too close to the victims . However , Black insists he can be of assistance , and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom 's luggage after their flight . Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned , with Helen 's blood inside . Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area — Black recognizes Richard Green ( Dylan Haggerty ) as the man from the airport footage . 
 Tom later searches Black 's office , stealing his gun and finding Green 's name and address . Tom confronts Green at his home , demanding to know where his wife is . The police , who have been watching Green 's house , intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed . Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom , but warns him that his outburst is exactly why he did so . Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods ; blood found there matches both Green and Helen , and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen 's wedding ring . 
 Meanwhile , a mysteriously ill Jordan continues to ask about Helen 's whereabouts , and her remarks about Helen 's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly @-@ psychic visions he is capable of seeing , which allow him to see the evil people are capable of . Elsewhere , Green is arrested . His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found — although another corpse is dug up in the garden , evidently killed nine years before . Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police . He sees a set of tools in Green 's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture , but to <unk> Helen in the basement . Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall , finding Helen injured but alive ; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn , used by his father to lure victims to the house .

 " Sacrament " was written by Frank Spotnitz and directed by Michael W. Watkins . Spotnitz had previously written " Weeds " earlier in the first season , as well as penning " TEOTWAWKI " , " Antipas " and " Seven and One " in the series ' third season . Spotnitz was a prolific writer for Millennium 's sister show The X @-@ Files , receiving his first writing credit for that series for the episode " End Game " . Spotnitz has described " Sacrament " as his favourite script for the series , finding the character of Richard Green to be " creepy " and believing that " the solution to the mystery [ was ] sufficiently unexpected " . 
 " Sacrament " is the only episode of Millennium to have been directed by Watkins . Watkins ' work on the episode led to him becoming a director and executive producer for The X @-@ Files when that series moved production to Los Angeles . The episode features the last appearance in the series by Brian Markinson as Seattle police officer Teeple ; Markinson had previously portrayed the character in the earlier first season episodes " The Judge " and " Blood Relatives " . 
 The treatment of the two victims seen in " Sacrament " — the <unk> of Helen Black and the burial in the garden of the unidentified second victim — appear to have been based on the methods used by real life serial killers John Wayne Gacy , Dennis Nilsen and Dorothea Puente to dispose of their victims . Both Gacy and Nilsen habitually murdered men they had taken home as lovers , with Gacy storing bodies in the crawl space of his home , and Nilsen keeping corpses in wardrobes and under the floorboards . Puente would kill her tenants for their money and bury their bodies in the gardens of the properties they were renting .
