 = Wagiman language = 
 Wagiman ( also spelled <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) is a near @-@ extinct indigenous Australian language spoken by fewer than 10 people in and around Pine Creek , in the Katherine Region of the Northern Territory . 
 The Wagiman language is notable within linguistics for its complex system of verbal morphology , which remains under @-@ investigated , its possession of a cross @-@ linguistically rare part of speech called a coverb , its complex predicates and for its ability to productively <unk> coverbs . 
 Wagiman is expected to become extinct within the first half of the century , as the youngest generation of Wagiman people speak no Wagiman at all , and understand very little . 
 = = Language and speakers = = 
 Wagiman is a language isolate . It was once assumed to be a member of the adjacent Gunwinyguan family that stretches from Arnhem Land , throughout Kakadu National Park and South to Katherine ; however , there was considerable debate about the status of Wagiman within the Gunwinyguan family . 
 Wagiman is the ancestral language of the Wagiman people , Aboriginal Australians whose traditional land , before colonisation , extended for hundreds of square kilometres from the Stuart Highway , throughout the Mid @-@ Daly Basin , and across the Daly River . The land is highly fertile and well @-@ watered , and contains a number of cattle stations , on which many members of the ethnic group used to work . These stations include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Douglas . 
 The language region borders Waray to the north , Mayali ( <unk> ) and <unk> on the east , Wardaman and Jaminjung on the south , and <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Malak Malak on the west . Before colonisation , the lands surrounding Pine Creek , extending north to Brock 's Creek , were traditionally associated with another language group that is now extinct , believed to have been <unk> . 
 = = = Current situation = = = 
 The dominant language of the region is Mayali , a dialect of <unk> Gun @-@ Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida , in Western Arnhem Land . As it is a strong language with hundreds of speakers and a high rate of child acquisition , members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language to their children . As a result , many Wagiman people speak Mayali , while only a handful of elders , possibly no more than six , speak Wagiman . 
 The adults in the community are considered semi @-@ speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words . Their children , the grandchildren of the elders , understand very little Wagiman and speak none . Apart from Mayali , <unk> , a creole language based on the vocabulary of English , is the lingua franca of the area . All members of the Wagiman ethnic group , as well as all other ethnic groups represented in the area , are native speakers of a moderate grade of <unk> . 
 The small number of Wagiman speakers are also partial speakers of a number of other languages besides Mayali , including Jaminjung , Wardaman and <unk> . 
 = = = Dialects = = = 
 Wagiman speakers are conscious of a distinction between two dialects of Wagiman , which they refer to as <unk> no @-@ <unk> @-@ ma ' light language ' and <unk> gu @-@ <unk> @-@ jan ' heavy language ' . The differences are minor and speakers have no difficulty understanding one another . 
 = = Wagiman grammar = = 
 All grammatical information from Wilson , S. ( 1999 ) unless otherwise noted . 
 = = = Parts of speech = = = 
 The three most important parts of speech in Wagiman are verbs , coverbs and nominals . Apart from these , there are a multitude of verbal and nominal affixes , interjections and other particles . Pronouns class with nominals . 
 = = = = Nominals = = = = 
 Like many Australian languages , Wagiman does not <unk> distinguish nouns from adjectives . These form one word class that is called nominals . Wagiman nominals take case suffixes ( see below ) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence . The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive , and the semantic cases include instrumental ( using ) , allative ( towards ) , ablative ( from ) , locative ( at ) , comitative ( with , having ) , privative ( without , lacking ) , temporal ( at the time of ) and <unk> ( resembling ) . The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic , depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb . 
 <unk> are similarly considered nominals in Wagiman , and take the same case suffixes depending on their semantic and syntactic roles ; their function within the sentence . That is , the demonstrative <unk> ' this ' , or ' here ' ( root : <unk> ) , may take case just like any other nominal . 
 <unk> @-@ yi this @-@ ERG ' this one ( did it ) ' 
 <unk> @-@ ga this @-@ ALL ' to <unk> 
 = = = = = Examples of nominals = = = = = 
 <unk> ' fire ' , ' wood ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> ' tree ' , ' stick ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> ' man ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> ' head ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> ' tail ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> ' tongue ' [ <unk> ] 
 = = = = Pronouns = = = = 
 Pronouns are <unk> nominals also , yet their morphosyntactic alignment is nominative – accusative rather than ergative – absolutive . 
 The 3rd person singular and plural nominative forms , <unk> and <unk> , are labeled ' rare ' because they are gradually becoming disused . Speakers prefer to use non @-@ personal pronouns such as <unk> ' that ' or gayh @-@ <unk> ' those ' . Moreover , since the person and number of the subject is contained in the prefix of the verb , nominative free pronouns are often dropped . 
 = = = = = Tripartite alignment = = = = = 
 While the nominal case system distinguishes the ergative case from absolutive , the free pronouns distinguish nominative from accusative , as shown above . However , they inflect for ergative case as well , resulting in a tripartite case system , as in the following : 
 ngagun @-@ yi <unk> <unk> @-@ bu @-@ ng 
 1sg.NOM @-@ ERG <unk> <unk> @-@ hit @-@ PRF 
 'I hit <unk> 
 The nominative pronoun root in this instance , ngagun ' I ' , takes the ergative case suffix <unk> to denote the fact that it is the agent of a transitive clause . Conversely , the same pronoun does not take the ergative case when acting as the argument of an intransitive clause : 
 ngagun maman nga @-@ yu 
 1sg.NOM good <unk> @-@ <unk> 
 'I am <unk> 
 The accusative pronouns on the other hand , may be accusative or dative , depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb . In the traditional terminology , these pronouns can be either direct or indirect objects . 
 ngagun @-@ yi nga @-@ nanda @-@ yi nung 
 1sg.NOM @-@ ERG <unk> @-@ see @-@ PST <unk> 
 'I saw him / <unk> 
 nga @-@ <unk> @-@ ndi <unk> nung 
 <unk> @-@ give @-@ PST water <unk> 
 'I gave the water to him / <unk> 
 For these reasons , the pronouns are also labeled base for nominative – ergative pronouns , and oblique for accusative – dative pronouns . 
 = = = = = <unk> pronouns = = = = = 
 In the table above , genitive pronouns all end with -gin , which is separated <unk> by a hyphen that normally divides morphemes . The -gin form here is not a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented ; there is no such word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing @-@ gin ' my / mine ' . The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings across the entire pronoun paradigm may have been a historical accident . 
 This cannot be a nominal suffix like those listed above , since it may not attach to other nominals ( * warren @-@ gin <unk> ' the child 's hand ' ) . Furthermore , the genitive pronouns may take a further case suffix , as in the example : 
 <unk> nganing @-@ gin @-@ ba 
 house my @-@ ALL 
 <unk> my <unk> 
 This would be prohibited by the restriction against case stacking in Wagiman if the genitive -gin were a case suffix . 
 = = = = Verbs = = = = 
 Verbs are a class of word in Wagiman which contains fewer than 50 members . As it is a closed class , no more verbs are possible . They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel @-@ final . Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments , and for the tense and aspect of the clause . A small set of verbs may take a non @-@ finite suffix <unk> , in which it may not be further inflected for person or tense . That non @-@ finite verb must then co @-@ occur with another auxiliary verb . 
 = = = = = Examples of verbs = = = = = 
 Each verb is listed with its past tense marker , which is the second morpheme . Pronunciation given where appropriate . 
 bu @-@ ni ' <unk> 
 di @-@ nya ' <unk> 
 ra @-@ ndi ' <unk> 
 <unk> @-@ ra ' <unk> 
 nanda @-@ yi ' see ' [ <unk> ] 
 yu @-@ <unk> ' be ' [ <unk> ] 
 = = = = Coverbs = = = = 
 There are so far over 500 recorded coverbs in Wagiman , and more are discovered with continuing research . Compared with verbs , coverbs are far more numerous and far more semantically rich . Verbs express simple , broad meanings such as <unk> ' be ' , <unk> ' go ' and di- ' come ' , while coverbs convey more specific , semantically narrow meanings such as <unk> @-@ na ' make footprints ' , <unk> @-@ nga ' play ( a <unk> ) ' or <unk> @-@ ma ' wade through shallow water using your feet to search for something ' . 
 Coverbs however , cannot inflect for person and cannot , in themselves , head finite clauses . If they are to act as the head of a clause , they must combine with a verb , thereby forming a bipartite verbal compound , commonly called a complex predicate . 
 = = = = = Examples of coverbs = = = = = 
 Each is listed with the -ma suffix ( or its <unk> ) , which signals aspectual <unk> . 
 liri @-@ ma ' swim ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> @-@ ma ' ( go ) around ) ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> @-@ ma ' fish ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> @-@ ta ' jump ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> @-@ na ' whistle ' [ <unk> ] 
 = = = Phonology and orthography = = = 
 The Wagiman phonemic inventory is quite typical for a northern Australian language . It has six places of articulation with a stop and a nasal in each . There are also a number of laterals and approximants , a trill and a phonemic glottal stop ( represented in the orthography by ' h ' ) . Wagiman also has a vowel inventory that is standard for the north of Australia , with a system of 5 vowels . 
 = = = = Consonants = = = = 
 Stops that are fortis ( or ' strong ' ) are differentiated from those that are lenis ( or ' weak ' ) on the basis of length of closure , as opposed to the voice onset time ( <unk> ) , the period after the release of the stop before the commencement of vocal fold activity ( or voice ) which normally differentiates fortis and lenis stops in English and most other languages . 
 <unk> stops in Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are therefore written using the Roman alphabet letters b , d and g . Fortis stops , however , sound more like voiceless stops in English , but are slightly longer than lenis stops . They are written with two voiceless letters , pp , tt and kk when they occur between two vowels . 
 Since the length of closure is defined in terms of time between the closure of the vocal tract after the preceding vowel , and the release before the following vowel , stops at the beginning or end of a word do not have a fortis @-@ lenis contrast . Orthographically in Wagiman , word @-@ initial stops are written using the voiced Roman letters ( b , d and g ) , but at the end of a word , voiceless letters ( p , t and k ) are used instead . 
 = = = = Vowels = = = = 
 As with many languages of the top @-@ end , Wagiman has a standard five @-@ vowel system . However , a system of vowel harmony indicates that two sets of vowels are closely associated with each other . [ ɛ ] aligns closely with [ ɪ ] and similarly , [ ɔ ] merges with [ ʊ ] . 
 In this respect , it is possible to analyse Wagiman 's vowel inventory as historically deriving from a three @-@ vowel system common among the languages from further south , but with the phonetic influence of a typically northern five @-@ vowel system . 
 = = = = Phonotactics = = = = 
 Each syllable of Wagiman contains an onset , a nucleus and an optional coda . This may be generalised to the syllable template CV ( C ) . The coda may consist of any single consonant , a <unk> and a glottal stop , or an approximant and any stop . 
 At the word level , Wagiman has a <unk> minimum , meaning that if a word consists of a single syllable , it must have either a long vowel or a coda . Examples of monosyllabic words in Wagiman include yow [ <unk> ] ' yes ' , or <unk> [ <unk> ] ' <unk> ' . 
 The retroflex approximant ' r ' [ ɻ ] is not permitted word @-@ initially and instead becomes a lateral ' l ' . This only affects verb roots , as they are the only part of speech that takes prefixes and are therefore the only possible part of speech for which word @-@ initial and word @-@ medial environmental effects can be observed . 
 The verb ra @-@ ndi ' throw ' , for instance , surfaces as la @-@ ndi when inflected for third @-@ person singular subjects ( he / she / it ) , which are realised by invisible , or null <unk> but as nga @-@ ra @-@ ndi when inflected for a first @-@ person singular subject ( I ) . When preceded by a syllable with a coda , the ' r ' similarly moves to ' l ' , as in <unk> @-@ la @-@ ndi ' he / she / it threw you ' . In short , the retroflex approximant ' r ' [ ɻ ] is only realised as ' r ' when it occurs between two vowels . Elsewhere , it becomes a lateral approximant ' l ' . 
 = = = = = <unk> clusters = = = = = 
 Consonant clusters across syllable boundaries do not assimilate for place in Wagiman as they do in many other languages . This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will not move to the position of the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation . In English and most other Indo @-@ European languages , this movement occurs regularly , such that the prefix -in , for example , changes to <unk> when it precedes either a p , a b or an m . 
 in + possible → impossible 
 in + balance → imbalance 
 in + material → immaterial 
 Wagiman does not do this . A nasal in a coda retains its position regardless of the following consonant : 
 <unk> ' tongue ' [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> ' bream ' ( fish spec . ) [ <unk> ] 
 <unk> @-@ bu @-@ ni ' s / he hit me ' [ <unk> ] 
 If Wagiman constrained against <unk> clusters and assimilated them for place , as English does , these words would surface as [ <unk> ] , [ <unk> ] , and [ <unk> ] . 
 = = = = = Vowel harmony = = = = = 
 High vowels assimilate in height to following mid vowels across syllable boundaries . That is , [ ɪ ] will become [ ɛ ] , and [ ʊ ] will become [ ɔ ] , when the following syllable contains a mid vowel ; either [ ɛ ] or [ ɔ ] . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( ' put ' ) , becomes <unk> ' you go and put it ' . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( ' stay ' ) , becomes <unk> ' you lot stay ' . 
 Wagiman vowel harmony and other aspects of Wagiman phonotactics require further investigation . It is not known , for instance , whether vowel harmony equally affects unstressed syllables . 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Wagiman is a prefixing language , which , in the context of typology of Australian languages , may refer to its genealogical classification as well as its syntactic properties . Wagiman , along with other Gunwinyguan languages , inflects verbs for person and number of the subject obligatorily , and optionally for the object . In this respect Wagiman displays characteristics of a head @-@ marking language . However , Wagiman also behaves as a dependent @-@ marking language , in that nominals are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles , such as ergative ( the subject of a transitive clause ) or absolutive ( the object of a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause ) . 
 = = = = Morphology = = = = 
 Wagiman is a morphologically rich language and each part of speech has its own set of associated bound morphemes , some of which are obligatory , while others are optional . 
 = = = = = Verbs = = = = = 
 The verbal prefix contains information about the person and number of the subject , sometimes also the person and number of the object , as well as obligatory information about the tense of the clause . Furthermore , a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect . While only a small number of tense and aspect affixes exist , the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix , can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses . 
 Further to these affixes , verbs may be marked for the number of the subject , be it dual or plural , and also for <unk> ; whether the listener is included in the described event ( inclusive ) or is excluded from the event ( exclusive ) . 
 Verb morphology in Wagiman is highly irregular . Of the small inventory of inflecting verbs , many have their own unique tense suffixes , while other tense suffixes are common to several verbs , and while some rudimentary verb classes can be identified - stance verbs always take the past tense suffix <unk> / <unk> / , for instance - the tense suffixes must be learned for each individual verb . 
 The prefixes on the other hand , are regular for each verb , although the complete paradigm of verb prefixes is highly complex . They encode three variables : person , number and tense , and are not <unk> ; one prefix cannot be separated into the three parts . <unk> for example , encodes second @-@ person singular agent ( ' you ' ) , first @-@ person singular patient / <unk> ( ' me ' ) as well as past tense . 
 <unk> @-@ bu @-@ ng 
 <unk> @-@ hit @-@ PRF 
 'you hit me ' . 
 = = = = = Nominals = = = = = 
 Nominal morphology is significantly less complex than that of the verb . There are a number of case suffixes , denoting ergative , absolutive , dative , allative , locative , ablative , <unk> , temporal , instrumental and so on . 
 Apart from the grammatical cases , ergative and absolutive , which are necessary to construct meaningful sentences , an entire range of semantic cases occur with very high frequency , even when their meaning can be expressed without using case . In the following examples , the former , in which no case is used , is far less common than the latter : 
 <unk> nga @-@ nga @-@ <unk> @-@ n <unk> 
 NEG IRR @-@ <unk> @-@ have @-@ PRS money 
 'I don 't have any <unk> 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> nga @-@ yu 
 money @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ be 
 'I am without money ' or ' I am <unk> 
 There are also some bound particles , which appear to function in much the same syntactic manner as cases , but which are not considered ' case ' , for theoretical reasons . <unk> / <unk> / ' only ' is one of these nominal particles , as in : 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ ndi 
 bone @-@ only <unk> @-@ PST 
 's / he left only the bones ' . 
 Nominals are also marked for number with a suffix that adjoins directly to the root , inside the case suffix . <unk> ' two ' , for example , would attach to the nominal root before the case , as in : 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ yi <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ na 
 dog @-@ two @-@ ERG <unk> @-@ bite @-@ PST 
 <unk> two dogs bit me ' . 
 As cases cannot be stacked in Wagiman , these number suffixes cannot be called case suffixes , whereas the nominal suffixes discussed above ( such as <unk> ' only ' ) , show the same syntactic distribution - they occur in the same place - and therefore may be analysed as cases themselves . 
 = = = = = Coverbs = = = = = 
 Coverbs also have their own set of inflectional morphemes , such as aspect , but may also take semantic case suffixes ( all those listed above except for ergative and absolutive ) . For instance , a coverb may take the dative case to convey intention , or purpose , as in : 
 liri @-@ ma @-@ gu 
 swim @-@ ASP @-@ DAT 
 <unk> swimming ' . 
 Coverbs are <unk> differentiated from nominals though , in that a nominal may not take the aspectual suffixes that a coverb obligatorily takes . 
 The morpheme that is glossed as aspect in the above example , referred to in the literature as the -ma suffix , denotes aspectual <unk> . Its absence signifies perfective aspect , and it may be further suffixed with -yan , producing -ma @-@ yan , to denote continuous or imperfective aspect . 
 The -ma suffix exhibits regular <unk> ; it assimilates in place and manner of articulation to any preceding obstruent or nasal , but not to any preceding lateral , rhotic or approximant . That is , it remains -ma following vowels , or following the consonants [ r ] , [ l ] , [ w ] and [ j ] , but when it follows [ p ] , for instance , it assimilates in manner and place , and becomes / <unk> / , as in <unk> @-@ pa ' sit ' . 
 liri + ma → liri @-@ ma 
 wal + ma → wal @-@ ma 
 bey + ma → bey @-@ ma 
 <unk> + ma → <unk> @-@ nya 
 <unk> + ma → <unk> @-@ ja 
 The inclusion of the glottal stop in certain words , is ineffective to the surface realisation of the -ma suffix ; it will change , or remain unchanged , according to whichever segment precedes the glottal stop , as in : 
 <unk> + ma → <unk> @-@ na 
 gayh + ma → gayh @-@ ma 
 Cross @-@ linguistically , the @-@ ma suffix may be related to a <unk> suffix in Jaminjung , a language in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers , but are then suffixed with <unk> , which marks continuous aspect . This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan , which always occur in tandem on coverbs . Together , -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung <unk> . Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes ; whether one language borrowed from the other , or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages , is not at all clear . 
 = = = = Reduplication = = = = 
 Further to derivational and inflectional morphemes , Wagiman coverbs and nominals often undergo reduplication , whereby a part , or often the entirety of the root , is repeated . Reduplication can convey a multitude of meanings . When coverbs are reduplicated , the resulting derived coverb may involve added meaning components such as <unk> , duration or habituality . 
 <unk> @-@ pa ga @-@ ya nu @-@ naw @-@ ma 
 smoke @-@ ASP <unk> lots 
 's / he smokes <unk> 
 <unk> ga @-@ ya 
 <unk> <unk> 
 's / he smokes all the <unk> 
 When nominals are derived by reduplication , the added meaning is usually one of plurality . However , since both a dual and a plural nominal suffix exist , <unk> and <unk> respectively , nominal reduplication is rare . 
 = = = = Complex predicates = = = = 
 A complex predicate is the combination of more than one element , more than one individual word , to convey the information involved in a single event . For instance , the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a combination of a verb <unk> ' go ' and a coverb liri @-@ ma ' swimming ' . There is no verb in Wagiman that , on its own , conveys the event of swimming . 
 <unk> verbal compounds such as these are not peculiar to any language in particular . They are in fact very common , and may even occur in every language , albeit with varying frequency . English has a number of complex predicates , include go sightseeing , have breakfast and take ( a ) bath . The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee ; inflections like <unk> and <unk> are ungrammatical . An event like take ( a ) bath , however , may be described by a single verb bathe , but it arguably has a slightly different meaning . Take ( a ) bath , in any case , is far more common . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Wagiman is differentiated from other Australian languages in that it has a regular and productive process of <unk> , whereby coverbs can become verbs and act as the independent head of a clause . Despite being fully productive , meaning that all coverbs may undergo <unk> , in practice only a handful of coverbs are commonly <unk> . The process appears to be unique to Wagiman within Australian languages . 
 <unk> involves re @-@ analysing the entire coverb - including its suffix -ma , which serves merely to indicate that it is unmarked for aspect - as a verb root , and then to apply the usual obligatory verbal inflection affixes for person , number and tense . As there is no discrete morpheme that serves as a ' <unk> ' , the process is one of conversion . 
 = The Garden of Words = 
 The Garden of Words ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Kotonoha no Niwa ) is a 2013 Japanese anime drama film written , directed and edited by Makoto Shinkai , animated by CoMix Wave Films and distributed by Toho . It stars Miyu Irino and Kana Hanazawa , and featured music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of Tenmon , who had composed the music for many of Shinkai 's previous films . The theme song , " Rain " , was originally written and performed by Senri Oe in 1988 , but was remade for the film and was sung by Motohiro Hata . It was adapted to a manga with illustrations by Midori Motohashi and later novelized by Shinkai , both in the same year as the film . 
 The film focuses on Takao Akizuki , an aspiring 15 @-@ year @-@ old shoemaker , and Yukari Yukino , a mysterious 27 @-@ year @-@ old woman he keeps meeting at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden on rainy mornings . While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes , Yukino is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life . Yukino tells Takao nothing about herself , including her name , while Takao opens up to her , sharing his passion for shoes by offering to make a pair for her . When Takao learns Yukino 's identity , emotions come to a head as both learn that they have been teaching each other " how to walk " . Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of " lonely sadness " , based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for " love " , and uses shoes as a metaphor for life . The story 's motifs include rain , Man 'yōshū poetry , and the Japanese garden . The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and <unk> people mature , where even adults sometimes feel no more mature than teenagers , according to Shinkai . 
 The Garden of Words premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28 , 2013 and had its general release on May 31 , 2013 in Japan . For the Japanese premiere , the film was screened with an animated short called Dareka no Manazashi ( <unk> , lit . Someone 's Gaze ) , also directed by Shinkai . The Garden of Words had an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes the same day as the Japanese theatrical premier , and its DVD and Blu @-@ ray were released while the film was still in theaters , on June 21 . The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America , Anime Limited in the UK , and Madman Entertainment in Australia . The film performed well in theaters for an extended period of time and was hosted at many local and international film events . It ranked highly on iTunes Store during 2013 and was selected as the Year 's Best Animation in iTunes ' Best of 2013 . It won the 2013 Kobe Theatrical Film Award and awards at the Fantasia International Film Festival and the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film . Online reviews were generally favorable with universal praise of the art , though opinions were mixed regarding the story 's length , plot and emotional climax . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Garden of Words is considered a romance and drama film . It opens at the start of the rainy season in Tokyo with Takao Akizuki ( <unk> <unk> , Akizuki Takao ) , a 15 @-@ year @-@ old student and aspiring shoemaker , opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen . There he encounters Yukari Yukino ( 雪野 <unk> , Yukino Yukari ) , a 27 @-@ year @-@ old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate . When she notices the school crest on his uniform , Yukino bids him farewell with a tanka ( a form of Japanese poetry ) , leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning . The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings , but never formally introduce themselves . After Yukino expresses an interest in Takao 's shoemaking , he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size . With the end of the rainy season , Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work . 
 Following summer break , Takao returns to school and spots Yukino . His friends inform him that she is a literature teacher and that she had been the target of gossip and bullying . Out of kindness and to avoid further confrontation , Yukino opted to avoid work and retreat to the park , hoping she would learn to overcome her fears and be able to " walk " again . However , Yukino quits her job and leaves the school . That afternoon , Takao meets Yukino at the park and greets her by reciting the <unk> poem from the Man 'yōshū Japanese poetry collection , the correct response to her tanka , which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook . After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm , both head to Yukino 's apartment and spend the afternoon together . When Takao confesses his love following dinner , Yukino is visibly moved , but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on Shikoku . After Takao abruptly excuses himself , Yukino realizes her mistake and runs after him , finding him in the stairwell . Still upset , Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him . Yukino embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her . 
 The credits show Takao barely passing his final exams , but still working towards his goals , while Yukino moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career . In a post @-@ credits scene , Takao revisits the park that winter , reads a letter from Yukino , places her finished shoes on the bench and then vows that he will find her after he has made progress with his career . 
 In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi , scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version . For example , after the conclusion of the rainy season , Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend , disappointing Yukino who had hoped to see him in the park . Also , at the conclusion of the story , Yukino is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her .

 The Garden of Words was directed by Makoto Shinkai , who also wrote the original story and screenplay . He was responsible for the storyboards , animation composite , key animation , and editing . According to Shinkai , his numerous roles in the production of his works is due to the small size of the company , and in this film , it allowed him to tailor many elements of the film to more accurately portray his ideas . 
 The animated film was produced by Shinkai Creative , CoMix Wave Films , and the producer was <unk> Kawaguchi . Kenichi Tsuchiya was the animation director and was responsible for character design , while Hiroshi <unk> was the art director . Planning for the film began in the spring of 2012 and was announced on December 24 of that year . The Japanese release was initially slated for the first half of 2013 . Production took only six months , starting with location scouting by Shinkai around Shinjuku . Production officially started after he had created storyboards based on the photos he took . 
 Shinkai was approached in early 2013 about adapting the material into a manga , which was then done by Midori Motohashi . In April , Shinkai stated that he was not contributing to the adaptation , leaving the work entirely to the manga artist . However , he did express interest in seeing the finished product . 
 = = = Inspirations , motifs , and metaphors = = = 
 According to Shinkai 's announcement of the film early during its production , The Garden of Words was his first attempt at making a love story using the traditional Japanese meaning of " love " . During the era of the Man 'yōshū , the native Japanese words today known as yamato kotoba ( <unk> , lit . " Japanese words " ) were starting to be written using kanji , and the word for " love " , koi ( today written <unk> ) was written as <unk> , or " lonely sadness " . As noted by Shinkai , a more modern concept of " romance " , represented by <unk> 'ai ( <unk> ) , came about by Western influence . The Garden of Words emphasizes the original meaning of koi — a " longing for someone in solitude " — but in a modern setting . Loneliness is the central element of the film , according to Shinkai . In an interview , he said the he created the film with the hope of cheering up people who feel lonely or incomplete in their social relations . However , he made a point that " this movie doesn 't treat loneliness as something that must be fixed . " 
 Although the story 's central theme is loneliness , it uses shoes and rain as motifs , along with Man 'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden in which it is set . Although rain is typically seen as sad and gloomy , in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society . Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain — that neither can be controlled or stopped . 
 According to Shinkai , shoes were a metaphor for life as Yukino learned to walk again , while Takao 's shoe @-@ making typified their relationship . Similarly , Yukino 's choice of food and beverages — initially beer and chocolate , due to a stress @-@ induced taste disorder — was a metaphor for her emotional health . 
 In many of Shinkai 's films , sad endings resulting from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common . According to Shinkai , his stories are intended to encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences . In an interview , he admitted that he had been accustomed to being turned down by women , and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try , despite being unsuccessful at love . The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume . Shinkai himself could relate with Yukino in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27 , stating , " We 're all still just children at age 27 , " a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with . 
 The original idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai 's desire to capture the beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film . Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku , he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos , upon which he created his storyboards . Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit , Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo . Following the earthquake in March 2011 , he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 Like other Japanese anime , The Garden of Words was created using a combination of hand @-@ drawn animation , rotoscoping and computer animation ( CGI ) , with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film 's rain sequences . Shinkai made half of the film 's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop , while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics . As with his other films , the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail , though they are still convincing and realistic . 
 For the rainy scenes at the park , the color palette was toned down , and pale green shading was used to match the gloomy , rainy weather , thereby increasing the detail and defining the characters . Matching the tones to the background and lighting helped highlight the characters ' faces . According to Shinkai , a novel coloring method was chosen from other coloring methods following careful testing . The method involved integrating the coloring for each character with the background , a " new innovation of sorts " that mimics the refraction of light on the skin as seen in nature . This was accomplished by coloring the outline of the character , including the lines drawn for the separation of lit and shadowed surfaces , and then incorporating the background color onto the surface . Shinkai felt that this coloring method made the anime stand out from others . 
 = = = Character design and casting = = = 
 Shinkai originally envisioned Takao as a boy who wants to help people , but also felt that he should have a passion for making something , since creative work can be rewarding and fulfilling . On a list he made of potential crafts , he picked out the word " shoes " . After testing it out with his initial plans for the story , he found that it worked out , and in hindsight , he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking . 
 When first presenting the original story to the rest of his team , Shinkai learned that Yukino had unintentionally come across as selfish . To remedy this , he gave her character nervous traits and personality flaws , such as letting her emotions spill over during mildly upsetting events . Shinkai later realized that some of these personality quirks and temporary professional challenges seen in Yukino were present in a former girlfriend , for whom he had written his short film She and Her Cat . In addition to making Yukino 's character more convincing , these character flaws also made it more difficult to plan since she had to be both flawed and attractive to a young boy . One aspect of her character that Shinkai focused on was her appearance . He felt that she had to be dressed in nice clothes , and particularly nice shoes . In order to balance realism with fashion , he researched shoemaking , worked with a clothing coordinator and stylist , and held weekly fashion meetings with his staff . 
 One of the " complicated realistic elements " of Yukino 's character was her sense of purity that only her voice could convey . Though it took days of listening to the audition tapes , Shinkai finally chose Kana Hanazawa , who had a very low natural voice , despite typically playing the roles of high @-@ pitched younger girls . One of the things that impressed Shinkai about Hanazawa 's voice was her ability to cover such a broad range of expression . 
 It was the final scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa . He knew that when Yukino cried , it had to be something impressive in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion . According to Shinkai , music alone could not produce the needed effect , and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction . In an interview , he said , " I believe that Ms. Hanazawa 's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film . " This final scene , which was recorded perfectly on the first take , played a pivotal role in the casting decision for Takao 's character . Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a naïve 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy , Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene . Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai 's Children Who Chase Lost Voices . 
 In regards to the English dub , Shinkai did not feel that he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively . He felt that it was good due to the feedback he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters ' voices . However , he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English @-@ speaking audiences . 
 = = = Length = = = 
 The Garden of Words is short , lasting approximately 46 minutes in length , a trend also seen among Shinkai 's earlier works . Although he had stated in an interview with Anime News Network that he does like making shorter films , Shinkai noted that he did not originally plan for the film to be played in theaters . Instead , he intended for people to casually view the film on tablets , computers , and in home theaters . A target length was never specified from the outset , instead the relationship between Takao and Yukino was emphasized , although it was known from early in the production that the film would be short . 
 Shinkai acknowledged that it is difficult to sell 46 @-@ minute films in theaters ; however , many individuals in the industry had requested to show the film in theaters and conventions . During an interview at Anime Expo 2013 , a representative from Toho , the film 's distribution company , emphasized that the quality of the story and the reputation of its director played a key role in the decision to bring it to theaters . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 In Shinkai 's previous films , the music was produced by Tenmon ; however , The Garden of Words features music by Daisuke Kashiwa . Kashiwa had been a fan of Shinkai 's 5 Centimeters Per Second and had sent him several of his albums . Shinkai listened to these albums while writing the screenplay and then elected to base the film 's music off of the songs from one of the albums . In an interview , Shinkai said that the music was primarily responsible for making the movie seem " unlike other anime " . 
 The theme song , " Rain " , was written and composed by Senri Oe , and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988 . Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe 's song regularly while attending university , and since one of the film 's themes was rain , it was the first song that came to mind while he worked on the production . He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life , much like the film . The song was remade for the film in 2013 , and sung by Motohiro Hata . Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata 's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao . Shinkai also felt that Hata 's voice was perfect because to him it carried an " underlying loneliness " and " sounded a little like an anxious young man " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Two common themes among Shinkai 's films , including The Garden of Words , are subtle romances and lingering emotions . However , this film 's focus on " lonely sadness " ( koi ) was interpreted in a couple of ways . According to Cynthia Webb of The Jakarta Post , the loneliness is seen at the end of the film , when Takao learns to cope with Yukino 's move to Shikoku . Luke Carroll at Anime News Network felt the end of the rainy season and the resulting separation created the sense of koi . 
 Kaze of Beneath The Tangles , however , disagreed with these interpretations of koi and the notion that the story was a " bittersweet romance " or " another love story " , and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized . Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding , Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukino lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends , a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer . Together through their conversations — in their " garden of words " — they found companionship : Takao finding someone he can share his passion with , and Yukino finding someone who treats her as a person . However , because of the age difference , this discovery varied between the characters . For Yukino , an older and more experienced individual , her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao , a revelation that she saw as her salvation . For Takao , a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances , he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukino , a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away . According to Kaze , " romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings , but that is not what the story is about " . Instead , the love they shared was more basic , making the age difference immaterial . At the end of film , both characters maintained their friendship through letters , but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people . The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship " without needing to cling to each other " . However , neither could " learn to walk again " if they continued to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen . 
 Another one of the themes discussed by the film 's reviewers was rain or water . According to Cynthia Webb , the rain represented " unfulfilled longing " , while Bradly Storm saw water as a third main character to the story , acting to both bring Takao and Yukino together and to symbolize the renewal of life . Kaze felt that the rain symbolized their lonely states , though also acknowledging Shinkai 's statement that the rain symbolized uncontrollable love . Following the reasoning that rain symbolized their lonely states , Kaze noted that the tanka had not only romantic intentions , but was also a " simple plea " by Yukino for someone to stay with her , even when she 's no longer lonely , and not just out of pity .

Shinkai considered it one of his best films , and reviews of the story in each media form were equally favorable . The digital version ranked 7th on the iTunes store for Western and Japanese films by the end of 2013 . In the year following its initial release , it continued to be a popular at local and international film events . The news and review site , ICv2 , listed the DVD under " The Best of 2013 : Anime " . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 At Anime News Network , Luke Carroll praised the film , calling it a " visual treat " , but was disappointed in the short length and found Shinkai 's new coloring method to be distracting . Jon Hayward was impressed by the " almost photo realistic " quality of the scenery , particularly in Shinjuku Gyoen . The Managing Editor , Bamboo Dong , described it as " beautifully designed and tenderly animated , it is nature eye candy at its finest . " She was impressed by the film 's unrushed yet thorough story despite its short length and praised both the music and art . In particular , she noted the beauty of the light reflections , rain scenes , and camera angles . 
 At UK Anime Network , Andy Hanley gave it a score of 10 / 10 , calling it " visually beautiful with a touching story to match " . He praised the natural progression of their relationship , despite the age gap , and enjoyed the emotional climax of the film . Hanley felt that The Garden of Words had a " tighter focus " than Children Who Chase Lost Voices and a better ending than 5 Centimeters Per Second , concluding it was Shinkai 's best work yet . Dan Rhodes called the film " a real return to form for Makoto Shinkai " following Children Who Chase Lost Voices , which he felt had been an attempt by Shinkai to live up to the common expectation of being the " next Hayao Miyazaki . " He praised the film for its beauty , romance , pacing , and subtlety . Although he felt that the film 's ending was an improvement over the ending to 5 Centimeters Per Second , he described it as rushed and overly emotional . However , he was very critical of the English dub , which he felt adversely affected both content and mood . 
 Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer gave it a 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , describing it as " painfully intimate and touchingly sentimental " and " the single most beautiful animated film ever created " . Despite the film 's length , Storm was impressed that Shinkai was able to connect his audience with his characters faster and more effectively than full @-@ length films . He worried that some viewers might miss the subtle message of the film and view it as a " by @-@ the @-@ books love story that can feel cliche or even trite " . Curtis Stone of <unk> gave it a 5 out of 5 and rated it # 1 in his top five list of anime for 2013 . He praised not only the art and music , but especially the voice acting , which he felt was perfect for the final scene . Lindsay Nelson at Midnight Eye compared the film to Whisper of the Heart by Studio Ghibli for its poetic use of " seemingly bland and uninteresting locations " . She was impressed with both the sound and art , and particularly the sweeping view of the Docomo tower with the sunset in the background . However , she criticized it for its " tearfully over @-@ the @-@ top climax " , " treacly " pop theme song , and lack of reflective silence . 
 Andrew Hamlin at Northwest Asian Weekly gave it a 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , applauding its poetic use of nature while criticizing the film 's brevity . Trung <unk> at Twitch Film also praised the artwork and felt the film displayed " honest and fresh emotions " . He described it as " clean and cute , a little bit cheesy " due to the highly emotional ending . Sam at Otaku 's Study gave the film an A- , describing it as an " immersive love story " and complimenting the Japanese voice acting and music . Allen Moody of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews praised the artwork and claimed it overshadowed the film 's flaws , which he felt were its short length and underdeveloped story . Chris Beveridge at The Fandom Post praised the artwork , but felt that the story was weak , noting the simplicity of the plot , the abrupt ending , and the awkwardness of the age difference between the two main characters . Amy Wong , the editor at Yam , called it " a story of solitude and heartache that comes before love . " She praised the animation as its best feature , but also enjoyed its pace , though she saw the climax as overblown . <unk> at Anime e Manga thought the film could have been a masterpiece , but felt the plot was too straightforward , the film was too short , and the conclusion came too dramatically . 
 Chris Beveridge at The Fandom Post reviewed the Blu @-@ ray release , noting that the dialogue was " clean and clear " throughout the entire playback and described the high definition video as something worth showing off . He also felt the disc included a fair amount of extras given the quick release . Matt Hinrichs at DVD Talk felt the video made a clean transfer from digital to Blu @-@ ray , the atmospheric sound effects were " carefully crafted " , and that the dialog in the center channel was clear . Dan Rhodes at UK Anime Network gave the DVD by Anime Limited a 9 out of 10 , calling it a " barebones release " , though praising its reversible insert .

 = Polio vaccine = 
 Polio vaccines are vaccines used to prevent poliomyelitis ( polio ) . One type uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection ( IPV ) , while the other type uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth ( OPV ) . The World Health Organization recommends all children be vaccinated against polio . The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world , and reduced the number of cases each year from an estimated 350 @,@ 000 in 1988 to 359 in 2014 . 
 The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe . Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection . Oral polio vaccines result in vaccine @-@ associated paralytic poliomyelitis in about three per million doses . Both are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV / AIDS but are otherwise well . 
 The first polio vaccine was the inactivated polio vaccine . It was developed by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955 . The oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961 . They are on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the most important medication needed in a basic health system . The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0 @.@ 25 USD per dose for the oral form as of 2014 . In the United States it costs between 25 and 50 USD for the inactivated form . 
 = = Medical uses = = 
 Interruption of person @-@ to @-@ person transmission of the virus by vaccination is important in the global polio eradication , since there is no long term carrier state for poliovirus in individuals with normal immune function , polio viruses have no non @-@ primate reservoir in nature , and survival of the virus in the environment for an extended period of time appears to be remote . 
 = = = Inactivated = = = 
 When the current formulation of IPV is used , 90 % or more of individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of polio virus after two doses of inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) , and at least 99 % are immune to polio virus following three doses . The duration of immunity induced by IPV is not known with certainty , although a complete series is thought to provide protection for many years . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 OPV also proved to be superior in administration , eliminating the need for sterile syringes and making the vaccine more suitable for mass vaccination campaigns . OPV also provided longer lasting immunity than the Salk vaccine . 
 One dose of OPV produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in approximately 50 % of recipients . Three doses of live @-@ attenuated OPV produce protective antibodies to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 % of recipients . OPV produces excellent immunity in the intestine , the primary site of wild poliovirus entry , which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where the virus is endemic . The live virus used in the vaccine is shed in the stool and can be spread to others within a community . The live virus also has stringent requirements for transport and storage , which are a problem in some hot or remote areas . As with other live @-@ virus vaccines , immunity initiated by OPV is probably lifelong . 
 The trivalent ( against wild type 1 , 2 and 3 ) OPV has been used and nearly eradicated polio infection worldwide . Spearheaded by The Global Polio Eradication Initiative , 155 countries switched to use the bivalent ( against wild type 1 and 3 ) between 17 April and 1 May 2016 . The bivalent OPV is at least 30 % more effective than the trivalent one . 
 = = = Schedule = = = 
 The World Health Organization recommends three or four doses starting at two months of age . It can be begun earlier but then additional doses are needed . 
 = = Side effects = = 
 The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe . Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection . Oral polio vaccine results in vaccine @-@ associated paralytic poliomyelitis in about three per million doses . They are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV / AIDS but are otherwise well . 
 = = = Vaccine @-@ induced polio = = = 
 A potential , but rare , adverse effect of the oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) is its known ability to recombine to a form that may cause neurological infection and cause paralysis . Clinical disease , including paralysis , caused by vaccine @-@ derived poliovirus ( <unk> ) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses . This is believed to be a rare event , but outbreaks of vaccine @-@ associated paralytic poliomyelitis ( <unk> ) , caused by a circulating vaccine @-@ derived poliovirus ( cVDPV ) , have been reported , and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV , presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain .

 In 1960 , it was determined that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus ( Simian Virus @-@ 40 ) . SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys . In 1961 , SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents . More recently , the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans , for instance brain and bone tumors , pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma , and some types of non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphoma . However , it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers . 
 SV40 was found to be present in stocks of the injected form of the polio vaccine ( IPV ) in use between 1955 and 1963 . It is not found in the OPV form . Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40 ; it has been estimated that 10 – 30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40 . Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980 , and used in the USSR , China , Japan , and several African countries , may have been contaminated ; meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40 . 
 In 1998 , the National Cancer Institute undertook a large study , using cancer case information from the Institute 's <unk> database . The published findings from the study revealed that there was no increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40 . Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700 @,@ 000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957 ; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not . The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however , and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy . 
 During the race to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken . By 1958 , the National Institutes of Health had determined that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest . Between 1957 and 1960 , however , Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world . In Africa , the vaccines were administered to roughly one million people in the Belgian territories , now the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda and Burundi . The results of these human trials have been controversial , and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans , causing HIV / AIDS . These hypotheses have , however , been conclusively refuted . By 2004 , cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent , with sporadic cases elsewhere . However , recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns has evolved , often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility . The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations , which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine .

 The Salk vaccine , or inactivated poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) , is based on three wild , virulent reference strains , Mahoney ( type 1 poliovirus ) , MEF @-@ 1 ( type 2 poliovirus ) , and <unk> ( type 3 poliovirus ) , grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture ( Vero cell line ) , which are then inactivated with formalin . The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG @-@ mediated immunity in the bloodstream , which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons , thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post @-@ polio syndrome . 
 In the United States , vaccine is administered along with the diphtheria , tetanus , and acellular pertussis vaccines ( <unk> ) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine . In the UK , IPV is combined with tetanus , diphtheria , pertussis , and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) is an attenuated vaccine , produced by the passage of the virus through non @-@ human cells at a sub @-@ physiological temperature , which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome . Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups , one of which was led by Albert Sabin . Other groups , led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox , developed their own attenuated vaccine strains . In 1958 , the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines . The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio , while retaining a low incidence of <unk> in monkeys . Large @-@ scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine . Based on these results , the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution . There are 57 nucleotide substitutions which distinguish the attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent ( the Mahoney serotype ) , two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain , and 10 substitutions are involved in attenuating the Sabin 3 strain . The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus 's internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) which alters stem @-@ loop structures , and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell . The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut , the primary site of infection and replication , but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue . In 1961 , type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( <unk> ) was licensed , and in 1962 , type 3 <unk> was licensed . In 1963 , trivalent OPV ( <unk> ) was licensed , and became the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world , largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine . A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases . Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans ( roughly 56 % of the population at that time ) received the Sabin vaccine . The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases , even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine . 
 OPV is usually provided in vials containing 10 – 20 doses of vaccine . A single dose of oral polio vaccine ( usually two drops ) contains 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 infectious units of Sabin 1 ( effective against PV1 ) , 100 @,@ 000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain , and 600 @,@ 000 infectious units of Sabin 3 . The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics — neomycin and streptomycin — but does not contain preservatives .

 In generic sense , vaccination works by priming the immune system with an ' <unk> ' . <unk> immune response , via use of an infectious agent , is known as immunization . The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person @-@ to @-@ person transmission of wild poliovirus , thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community . 
 The development of two polio vaccines led to the first modern mass inoculations . The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic transmission of wild virus in the United States occurred in 1979 , with an outbreak among the Amish in several Midwest states . 
 = = = 1936 = = = 
 In 1936 , Maurice Brodie , a research assistant at New York University , attempted to produce a formaldehyde @-@ killed polio vaccine from ground @-@ up monkey spinal cords . His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus . Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself and several of his assistants . He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children . Many of these children developed allergic reactions , but none developed immunity to polio . Philadelphia pathologist John <unk> also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year , but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio , nine of them fatal . 
 = = = 1948 = = = 
 A breakthrough came in 1948 when a research group headed by John Enders at the Children 's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human tissue in the laboratory . This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture . In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue . He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed that there were a few unused tubes . He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes , on the off chance that the virus might grow . The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful . This development greatly facilitated vaccine research and ultimately allowed for the development of vaccines against polio . Enders and his colleagues , Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins , were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Other important advances that led to the development of polio vaccines were : the identification of three poliovirus serotypes ( Poliovirus type 1 — PV1 , or Mahoney ; PV2 , Lansing ; and PV3 , Leon ) ; the finding that prior to paralysis , the virus must be present in the blood ; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio .

 The U.S. experienced an outbreak of 58 @,@ 000 and 35 @,@ 000 polio cases , respectively , up from a typical number of some 20 @,@ 000 a year . Amid this U.S. polio epidemic , millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests , including Lederle Laboratories in New York under the direction of H. R. Cox . Also working at Lederle was Polish @-@ born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski , who claims to have created the first successful polio vaccine , in 1950 . His vaccine , however , being a live attenuated virus taken orally , was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk 's polio vaccine ( a dead @-@ virus injectable vaccine ) had reached the market . Koprowski 's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice . By the seventh passage , the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis . After one to three further passages on rats , the vaccine was deemed safe for human use . On 27 February 1950 , Koprowski 's live , attenuated vaccine was tested for the first time on an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy living at Letchworth Village , an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York . After the child suffered no side effects , Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children .

 The first effective polio vaccine was developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk and a team at the University of Pittsburgh that included Julius <unk> , Byron Bennett , L. James Lewis , and Lorraine Friedman , but it required years of subsequent testing . To encourage patience , Salk went on CBS radio to report a successful test on a small group of adults and children on 26 March 1953 ; two days later the results were published in JAMA . Beginning 23 February 1954 , the vaccine was tested at Arsenal Elementary School and the Watson Home for Children in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Salk 's vaccine was then used in a test called the Francis Field Trial , led by Thomas Francis ; the largest medical experiment in history . The test began with some 4 @,@ 000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean , Virginia , and would eventually involve 1 @.@ 8 million children , in 44 states from Maine to California . By the conclusion of the study , roughly 440 @,@ 000 received one or more injections of the vaccine , about 210 @,@ 000 children received a placebo , consisting of harmless culture media , and 1 @.@ 2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group , who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio . The results of the field trial were announced 12 April 1955 ( the tenth anniversary of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt , whose paralysis was generally believed to have been caused by polio ) . The Salk vaccine had been 60 – 70 % effective against PV1 ( poliovirus type 1 ) , over 90 % effective against PV2 and PV3 , and 94 % effective against the development of bulbar polio . Soon after Salk 's vaccine was licensed in 1955 , children 's vaccination campaigns were launched . In the U.S , following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes , the annual number of polio cases fell from 35 @,@ 000 in 1953 to 5 @,@ 600 by 1957 . By 1961 only 161 cases were recorded in the United States . 
 = = = 1987 = = = 
 An enhanced @-@ potency IPV ( inactivated polio vaccine ) was licensed in the United States in November 1987 , and is currently the vaccine of choice in the United States . The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth , usually between 1 and 2 months of age , a second dose is given at 4 months of age . The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age . A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age , for a total of four doses at or before school entry . In some countries , a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence . Routine vaccination of adults ( 18 years of age and older ) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries . In 2002 , a pentavalent ( five @-@ component ) combination vaccine ( called <unk> ) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States .

 Polio was eliminated in the Americas by 1994 . The disease was officially eliminated in 36 Western Pacific countries , including China and Australia in 2000 . Europe was declared polio @-@ free in 2002 . Since January 2011 , there were no reported cases of the disease in India , and hence in February 2012 , the country was taken off the WHO list of polio endemic countries . If there are no cases of polio in the country for two more years , it will be declared as a polio @-@ free country . As of 2016 , polio remains actively spreading in only two countries : Pakistan , and Afghanistan . Although poliovirus transmission has been interrupted in much of the world , transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio @-@ free regions . If importations of poliovirus occur , outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop , especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation . As a result , high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained . In November 2013 , the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria . In response , the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine . As of 2014 , polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa , Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan , Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers . In 2015 , the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control .

 = Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga = 
 The Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga was a series of military operations by Continental Army forces and New York militia against the Iroquois towns of Unadilla and Onaquaga in what is now upstate New York . In early October 1778 , more than 250 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Butler of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment descended on the two towns ( which had been abandoned because of their advance ) and destroyed them , razing most of the buildings and taking or destroying provisions . The raid was executed in retaliation for a series of raids on frontier communities led by Mohawk chief Joseph Brant and British @-@ supported Loyalists during the spring and summer of 1778 . Unadilla was located in what is now the Village of Unadilla , Town of Unadilla , Otsego County , and Onaquaga was located in what is now the Town of Windsor , Broome County . 
 = = Background = = 
 With the failure of British General John Burgoyne 's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 , the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war . British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments . During the winter of 1777 – 78 Mohawk leader Joseph Brant and other British @-@ allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania . In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga ( present @-@ day Windsor , New York ) . He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May . One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler , who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley . Brant began his campaign in late May with a raid on Cobleskill , and raided other frontier communities throughout the summer . 
 The frontier settlers ' response to the raids was generally with impotence . The local militia were supported by some Continental Army regiments stationed in the area , but these forces generally could not muster in time to catch the raiders before they disappeared . New York Governor George Clinton and militia commander Abraham Ten Broeck considered operations against the principal bases in the Iroquois territory used by the raiders , Onaquaga and Unadilla , early in the campaign , but it was not until an attack by Brant on the settlement of German Flatts ( present @-@ day Herkimer ) on September 17 that an expedition was organized . 
 In response to calls from Governor Clinton , General George Washington authorized the use of Continental Army forces , assigning the operation to Lieutenant Colonel William Butler ( no relation to the Loyalist Butlers ) of the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment . On September 20 Butler sent scouts to investigate conditions at the two towns . They returned with reports that Unadilla had a population of 300 and Onaquaga 400 . 
 = = Expedition = = 
 On October 2 Butler led a force of 267 men ( 214 Continentals and 53 state militia ) from Fort Schoharie up the Schoharie valley toward the two villages . Late in the day on October 6 the force reached the Unadilla area . Butler sent scouting parties out to take prisoners from outlying farms . As the force cautiously advanced toward the town , one of the scouts returned with a prisoner who reported that the community had been abandoned , with most of the inhabitants fleeing to Onaquaga . Butler detached some of his men to destroy the town while he marched with the rest toward Onaquaga . They reached the town late on October 8 , and found it abandoned also , apparently in great haste . 
 Butler and his men spent the next two days destroying the towns . Butler described Unadilla as " the finest Indian town I ever saw ; on the both sides of the River there was about 40 good houses , Square logs , <unk> & stone Chimneys , good Floors , glass windows & c . " All the homes were burned , as was the town 's saw and grist mill , which was the only one in the area . Butler reported taking 49 horses and 52 head of cattle , and destroyed 4 @,@ 000 bushels of grain . Operations were complicated by heavy rains that raised the water levels of the Susquehanna ; Butler 's men had to build rafts to cross some of the river 's tributaries to reach parts of the town . By October 16 the expedition returned to Schoharie . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While the raid was taking place , Brant and his force had been raiding frontier settlements in the upper Delaware River valley . The Indians in his force were especially upset at the destruction of the two towns , a sentiment echoed by Seneca warriors who joined with Brant in the ruins of Unadilla a few days later . This anger contributed to the severity of the actions when a joint British @-@ Seneca @-@ Mohawk force attacked Cherry Valley , and were reported to massacre 30 noncombatants . 
 The severity of the frontier war in 1778 led to calls by the Continental Congress for a response . In 1779 General Washington organized a major Continental Army expedition into the Iroquois lands . Led by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton , the Sullivan Expedition destroyed villages and crops , driving most of the British @-@ supporting Iroquois out of their lands . Despite its apparent success , the frontier war continued with renewed vigor in the following years . 
 = Salford , Greater Manchester = 
 Salford ( / <unk> / ) is a town lying at the heart of the City of Salford , a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester , in North West England . Salford is sited in a meander of the River Irwell , which forms in part its boundary with the city of Manchester to the east . The Salford wards of Broughton and Kersal are on the other side of the river . Together with its neighbouring towns to the west , Salford forms the local government district of the City of Salford , which is administered from Swinton . The former County Borough of Salford , which included Broughton , Pendleton and Kersal , was granted honorific city status in 1926 ; it has a resident population of 103 @,@ 886 and occupies an area of 8 @.@ 1 square miles ( 21 km2 ) . The wider City of Salford district has a population of 219 @,@ 200 . 
 Historically in Lancashire , Salford 's early history is marked by its status as a Royal caput and the judicial seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire , to which it lent its name . It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , in about 1230 , making Salford a free borough . During the early stages of its growth , Salford was of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester , although most contemporary sources agree that since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed . 
 Salford became a major factory town and inland port during the 18th and 19th centuries . Cotton and silk spinning and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with a strong economy . Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal . By the end of the 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered from chronic overpopulation . Industrial activities declined during the 20th century however , causing a local economic depression . Salford subsequently became one of contrasts , with regenerated inner @-@ city areas like Salford Quays next to some of the most socially deprived and violent areas in England . 
 Salford has become a centre of higher education , home to the University of Salford , and has seen several firsts , including the world 's first unconditionally free public library , and the first street in the world to be lit by gas , Chapel Street in 1806 . Salford 's MediaCityUK became the headquarters of CBBC and BBC Sport in 2011 .

 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 The name of Salford derives from the Old English word Sealhford , meaning a ford by the willow trees . It referred to the willows ( Latin : <unk> ) or sallows that grew alongside the banks of the River Irwell . The ford was about where Victoria Bridge is today . Willow trees are still found in Lower Broughton . Salford appears in the pipe roll of 1169 as " <unk> " and in the Lancashire Inquisitions of 1226 as " <unk> " . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The earliest known evidence of human activity in what is now Salford is provided by the Neolithic flint arrow @-@ heads and workings discovered on Kersal Moor and the River Irwell , suggesting that the area was inhabited 7 – 10 @,@ 000 years ago . The raw material for such tools was scarce and unsuitable for working , and as a result they are not of the quality found elsewhere . Other finds include a neolithic axe @-@ hammer found near Mode Wheel , during the excavation of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1890 , and a Bronze Age cremation urn during the construction of a road on the Broughton Hall estate in 1873 . 
 The Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England . With a stronghold at the sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands , opposite Salford 's original centre , their territory extended across the fertile lowland by the River Irwell that is now Salford and Stretford . Following the Roman conquest of Britain , General Agricola ordered the construction of a Roman fort named Mamucium ( Manchester ) to protect the routes to Deva Victrix ( Chester ) and Eboracum ( York ) from the Brigantes . The fort was completed in AD 79 , and for over 300 years the Pax Romana brought peace to the area . Both the main Roman road to the north , from Mamucium to Ribchester , and a second road to the west , ran through what is now Salford , but few Roman artefacts have been found in the area . The withdrawal of the Romans in AD 410 left the inhabitants at the mercy of the Saxons . The Danes later conquered the area and absorbed what was left of the Brigantes . Angles settled in the region during the Early Middle Ages and gave the locality the name Sealhford , meaning " ford by the willows " . According to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , Sealhford was part of the Kingdom of Northumbria until it was conquered in 923 by Edward the Elder . 
 Following the emergence of the united Kingdom of England , Salford became a caput or central manor within a broad rural area in part held by the Kings of England , including Edward the Confessor . The area between the rivers Mersey and Ribble was divided into six smaller districts , referred to as " wapentakes " , or hundreds . The south east district became known as the Hundred of Salford , a division of land administered from Salford for military and judicial purposes . It contained nine large parishes , smaller parts of two others , and the township of <unk> in the parish of Wigan . 
 After the defeat of the Harold II during the Norman conquest of England , William I granted the Hundred of Salford to Roger the Poitevin , and in the Domesday Book of 1086 the Hundred of Salford was recorded as covering an area of 350 square miles ( 906 km2 ) with a population of 35 @,@ 000 . Poitevin created the subordinate Manor of Manchester out of the hundred , which has since in local government been separate from Salford . Poitevin forfeited the manor in 1102 when he was defeated in a failed rebellion attempt against Henry I. In around 1115 , for their support during the rebellion , Henry I placed the Hundred of Salford under the control of the Earldom of Lancaster , and it is from this exchange that the Hundred of Salford became a royal manor . The Lord of the Manor was either the English monarch , or a feudal land owner who administered the manor for the king . During the reign of Henry II the Royal Manor of Salford passed to Ranulf de Gernon , 4th Earl of Chester . 
 Salford began to emerge as a small town early in the 13th century . In 1228 , Henry III granted the caput of Salford the right to hold a market and an annual fair . The fairs were important to the town ; a 17th @-@ century order forced each burgess – a freeman of the borough – to attend , but the fairs were abolished during the 19th century . The Earls of Chester aided the development of the caput , and in 1230 Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester made Salford a burgage , or free borough . The charter gave its burgesses certain commercial rights , privileges and advantages over traders living outside Salford ; one of the 26 clauses of the charter stated that no one could work in the Hundred of Salford unless they also lived in the borough . Salford 's status as a burgage encouraged an influx of distinguished families , and by the Late Middle Ages Salford was " rich in its manor houses " , with over 30 within a 5 @-@ mile ( 8 km ) radius of Ordsall . These included Ordsall Hall ( owned by the Radclyffe family ) and Broughton Hall , owned by the Earls of Derby . 
 During the Civil War of 1640 – 49 , Salford supported the Royalist cause , in contrast to Manchester just across the Irwell which declared in favour of the Parliamentarians . Royalist forces mounted a siege of Manchester across what is now the site of Victoria Bridge , which although short @-@ lived , " did little to improve relations between the two towns " . A century later , in 1745 , Salford was staunchly in support of Bonnie Prince Charlie , in his attempt to seize the Throne of England . He entered the town at the head of his army and was blessed by the Reverend John Clayton before leaving " in high spirits " to march on London ; he returned to Salford in defeat just nine days later . 
 = = = Industrial Revolution = = = 
 Salford has a history of textile processing that pre @-@ dates the Industrial Revolution , and as an old town had been developing for about 700 years . Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians . Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging , cobbling , weaving and brewing . The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution had a profound effect on both on population and urbanisation , as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford . 
 The well @-@ established textile processing and trading infrastructure , and the ready supply of water from the River Irwell and its tributaries , attracted entrepreneurs who built cotton mills along the banks of the river in Pendleton and Ordsall . Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester , most businesses preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell , and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour . Many of these earlier mills had been based on Arkwright @-@ type designs . These relied on strong falls of water , but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream , at Kersal and Pendleton . With the introduction of the steam engine in the late 18th century however , merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester , where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available ( the first steam @-@ powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780 ) . One of the first factories to be built was Philip 's and Lee 's Twist Mill in Salford , completed in 1801 , the second iron @-@ framed multi @-@ story building to be erected in Britain . The large Salford Engine Twist Company mill was built to the west of Salford , between Chapel Street and the Irwell , and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting . It was however outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area , including Nathan Gough 's steam @-@ driven mule spinning mill , near Oldfield Road , where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 ( see illustration ) . 
 Canal building provided a further stimulus for Salford 's industrial development . The opening of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761 improved the transport of fuel and raw materials , reducing the price of coal by about 50 % . The later Manchester , Bolton & Bury Canal ( which terminated at Salford ) brought more cheap coal from pits at Pendleton , Agecroft Colliery and beyond . By 1818 Manchester , Salford and Eccles had about 80 mills , but it was the completion of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 which triggered Salford 's development as a major inland port . Salford Docks , a major dockland on the Ship Canal 35 miles ( 56 km ) east of the Irish Sea , brought employment to over 3 @,@ 000 labourers . By 1914 the Port of Manchester , most of whose docks were in Salford , had become one of the largest port authorities in the world , handling 5 % of the UK 's imports and 4 @.@ 4 % of its exports . Commodities handled included cotton , grain , wool , textile machinery and steam locomotives . 
 For centuries , textiles and related trades were the main source of employment in the town . Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford , carried over from the earlier woollen industry . In the 18th century , before the introduction of chemical bleaching , bleaching fields were commonplace , some very close to the town . In 1773 there were 25 bleachers around Salford , most to the west of the township . Printing was another source of trade ; the earliest recorded in the region was a <unk> printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763 . These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham . As its cotton spinning industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other textiles and to the finishing trades , including <unk> and silk dyeing , and fulling and bleaching , at a string of works in Salford . 
 Both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels spent time in Salford , studying the plight of the British working class . In The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 , Engels described Salford as " really one large working @-@ class quarter ... [ a ] very unhealthy , dirty and dilapidated district which , while other industries were almost always textile related is situated opposite the ' Old Church ' of Manchester " . 
 Salford developed several civic institutions ; in 1806 , Chapel Street became the first street in the world to be lit by gas ( supplied by Phillips and Lee 's cotton mill ) . In 1850 , under the terms of the Museums Act 1845 , the municipal borough council established the Royal Museum and Public Library , said to have been the first unconditional free public library in England , preceding the Public Libraries Act 1850 . 
 The effect on Salford of the Industrial Revolution has been described as " phenomenal " . The area expanded from a small market town into a major industrial metropolis ; factories replaced cottage industries , and the population rose from 12 @,@ 000 in 1812 to 70 @,@ 244 within 30 years . By the end of the 19th century it had increased to 220 @,@ 000 . Large @-@ scale building of low quality Victorian terraced housing did not stop overcrowding , which itself lead to chronic social deprivation . The density of housing was as high as 80 homes per acre . Private roads were built for the use of the middle classes moving to the outskirts of Salford . The entrances to such roads , which included Elleray Road in <unk> o ' th ' Height , were often gated , and patrolled .

 During the early 20th century , improvements in regional transport infrastructure precipitated the decline of Salford 's existing industries , including those at the Salford Docks . Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses . Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and ' 30s , and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford 's population . By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped , and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely . Between 1921 and 1939 , the population of Salford decreased by 29 % , from 234 @,@ 045 to 166 @,@ 386 , far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England . 
 A survey in 1931 concluded that parts of Salford contained some of the worst slums in the country . Many houses were infested by rats and lacked elementary amenities . Inspectors found that of 950 houses surveyed , 257 were in a state of bad repair with leaking roofs , broken flooring and rotten woodwork . The inspectors were " struck by the courage and perseverance with which the greater number of tenants kept their houses clean and respectable under most adverse conditions " . By 1933 slum clearance projects were under way , and by the end of 1956 over a thousand families had been rehoused in overspill estates at Little Hulton . These clearances have , for some , changed the character of the area to such an extent that " observers in search of the typical Salford may have to look in Eccles and Swinton , for much of the community and townscape ... has gone from Salford , replaced by tall blocks of flats " . Large areas of the city were redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s , with Victorian era terraced housing estates that inspired painter L. S. Lowry and soap opera Coronation Street giving way to concrete tower blocks and austere architecture . Life in Salford during the early 20th century was described by Robert Roberts , in his study The Classic Slum . 
 Despite extensive redevelopment , throughout the 1980s and 1990s the area experienced chronic poverty , deprivation and unemployment . This social deprivation led to increased levels of gang crime linked to illegal narcotics , firearms and robberies . Organised crime in Salford , particularly in Ordsall and Pendleton , " began to have a disturbing effect on grass roots democracy . Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives announced they would not contest certain Salford wards " because they regarded them as " unsafe " and would put their " party workers at risk " . Salford 's social amenities and the night @-@ time economy folded amid criminal " intimidation " , " drug use , fights and demands for money " . In early 2005 , the Government of Latvia appealed to the European Union to advise people against travelling to Salford after a Latvian people man was stabbed in the head in Lower Broughton . However , a crackdown by Greater Manchester Police coupled with investment in , and structural changes to the housing stock , began the change in Salford 's fortunes ; population decline has slowed , and Salford 's city councillors have insisted it is a safe place to visit . In August 2005 , a survey by Channel 4 television rated the city as the 9th worst place to live in the United Kingdom , based on criteria of crime , education , environment , lifestyle and employment . 
 = = = Regeneration = = = 
 Salford has suffered from high levels of unemployment and housing and social problems since around the 1960s , although there are regeneration schemes to reverse its fortunes . Many of the high @-@ rise housing blocks from the 1960s and 1970s were demolished during the 1990s , " a sign that the great social engineering schemes ( from that period ) had failed " . However , the high @-@ rises that remain are a striking feature of Salford 's landscape . Work was scheduled to begin on the £ 180 million redevelopment of the Greengate area of Salford in January 2007 . The plans include the construction of what will be the two tallest tower blocks in Salford . Plans also include a five @-@ star hotel , a new public square and park , restaurants , cafes and 403 apartments . Work is ongoing to regenerate the area known as Middlewood Locks , with the restored Salford terminus of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal forming the centrepiece of a brand new residential development . As part of the Pathfinder initiative , Salford was identified in 2002 as one of nine areas in specific need of investment for new homes . Between 2003 and 2006 £ 115M was invested in the Manchester and City of Salford housing markets , £ <unk> of which was invested in central Salford . Rows of terraces in neighbourhoods such as Seedley and Langworthy – once used for the title sequence of Coronation Street – are being compulsorily purchased , demolished and replaced by " modern sustainable accommodation " . Other schemes such as the Charlestown and Lower Kersal New deal for Communities , have concentrated on renovating existing terraced housing stock by block improvement and <unk> , as well as demolishing unsuitable properties and building new facilities , in consultation with the local community . 
 Salford now has many tourist attractions , such as Ordsall Hall , the Bridgewater Canal and the Lowry Centre , an award @-@ winning theatre and art gallery complex , consisting of two theatres and three art galleries . The centre is named after the artist L. S. Lowry , who attended Salford School of Art and lived in nearby Pendlebury for 40 years . Many of his paintings of Salford and Manchester mill scenes , populated with small matchstick @-@ like figures , are on display . 
 The waterfront development at MediaCityUK will make Salford a major centre of UK media production . The development houses BBC departments including CBBC , BBC Sport and Radio 5 Live which moved in 2011 and Breakfast moved from London in spring 2012 . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Salford was anciently part of the Manchester parish of the Salford Hundred , an area much larger than the present @-@ day city of Salford , within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire . A stroke of a Norman baron 's pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford , although it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester , but Manchester , with its humbler line of lords , that was separated from Salford . Salford received its town charter from Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , then Lord of the Manor , in 1230 . From then until 1791 , when police commissioners were appointed , it was governed by a reeve , a medieval administrator and law enforcement official . It was not recognised as a borough in the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , but was granted borough status in 1844 ; the new Salford borough was made up of the township of Salford and part of Broughton . The remainder of Broughton , and a part of Pendlebury , were added in 1853 . 
 When the administrative county of Lancashire was created by the Local Government Act 1888 , Salford was elevated to become the County Borough of Salford and was , in modern terms , a unitary authority area exempt from the administration of Lancashire County Council . Following a campaign supported by William Joynson @-@ Hicks , Home Secretary and MP for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester , city status was granted to the county borough by letters patent dated 21 April 1926 . This was in spite of the opposition of civil servants in the Home Office who dismissed the borough as " merely a scratch collection of 240 @,@ 000 people cut off from Manchester by the river " . In 1961 , a small part of the Municipal Borough of Eccles was added to the city , and in 1966 , Salford was twinned with Clermont @-@ Ferrand in France . 
 In 1974 the City and County Borough of Salford was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 , and was replaced by the metropolitan borough of City of Salford , a local government district of the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester , with triple the territory of the former City of Salford , taking in neighbouring Eccles , Swinton and Pendlebury , and Worsley and Irlam . Both Salford and the wider City of Salford are unparished areas . 
 = = = Parliamentary representation = = = 
 Salford was enfranchised as a parliamentary borough returning a single Member of Parliament ( MP ) by the Great Reform Act of 1832 . From 1868 it returned two MPs to the House of Commons until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 , when the constituency was split into three single @-@ member divisions : Salford North , Salford South and Salford West . Boundaries changed again under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1948 when the constituencies were reorganised into Salford East and Salford West . Since 1997 , Salford has lain within the reconstituted Salford parliamentary constituency . Hazel Blears – a member of the Labour Party – has been the MP for the constituency since 1997 . From the general election of 2010 Salford will be part of the new constituency of Salford and Eccles . The wards of Broughton and Kersal , however , are to be part of the cross boundary constituency of Blackley and Broughton .

 At 53 ° 28 ′ 59 ″ N 2 ° 17 ′ 35 ″ W ( 53 @.@ 483 ° , − 2 @.@ <unk> ° ) , and 205 miles ( 330 km ) northwest of central London , Salford stands about 177 feet ( 54 m ) above sea level , on relatively flat ground to the west of a meander of the River Irwell – the city 's main topographical feature . In 1904 Salford was recorded as " within a great loop of the River Irwell ... roughly three @-@ quarters of a mile from north to south and one mile from east to west " . Salford is contiguous with Manchester , and has been described " in participation of its trade , and for all other practical purposes , an integral part of it ; presents a near resemblance to it in streets and edifices ; contains several public buildings and a great public park , which belong fully more to Manchester than to itself " . Greengate , the original centre of Salford , is located at a fording point on the river opposite Manchester Cathedral . In 1969 Nikolaus Pevsner wrote : 
 That [ neighbouring ] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England . 
 The Irwell , sourced at <unk> in Lancashire , flows from the north and for a distance forms the statutory boundary between Salford and Manchester . Flooding has historically been a problem and the Irwell has seen much modification along its course in Salford with some bends being removed , <unk> , and the construction of levees and bank reinforcements . Salford has expanded along the river valley to the north and south and on to higher ground on the valley sides at <unk> o ' th ' Height and Higher Broughton . <unk> glacial deposits along the riverbank at Broughton have caused several landslides along the riverbank . The City Engineer 's Department of the City of Salford recorded one such incident near Great Clowes Street in February 1882 , and others in 1886 , 1887 and 1888 . In 1892 the road was propped with timber supports . The tram service along the road was discontinued in 1925 , and the road closed to mechanically propelled vehicles in January 1926 . Further slips saw the road closed completely in July 1933 , and although no substantial movements have been recorded since 1948 slow subsidence around the Cliff continues to this day . 
 Salford 's built environment is made up of a range of building stock . Some inner @-@ city areas are noted for chronic urban decay . Salford 's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older , smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century . As demand fell , it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition . As a result , much of the built environment is poor . 
 Land use in Salford is overwhelmingly urban , with a number of green spaces . The largest is Kersal Dale Country Park , which covers about 32 hectares ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . Others include Kersal Moor in Higher Kersal , The Meadow , Peel Park and the adjacent David Lewis Recreation Ground close to the University of Salford , and Albert Park and Clowes Park in Broughton . The territory of Salford is contiguous with other towns on all sides , and as defined by the Office for National Statistics forms the sixth @-@ largest settlement in the Greater Manchester Urban Area , the United Kingdom 's second @-@ largest conurbation . The M602 motorway enters Salford from Eccles to the west . The A580 " East Lancashire Road " terminates at Salford , entering the area from Pendlebury . Heavy rail @-@ lines pass through Salford .

 As of the 2001 UK census , Salford had a population of 72 @,@ 750 . The 2001 population density was 9 @,@ 151 per mi ² ( 3 @,@ 533 per km ² ) , with a 100 to 98 @.@ 4 female @-@ to @-@ male ratio . Of those over 16 years age , 44 @.@ 0 % were single ( never married ) and 36 @.@ 7 % married . Salford 's 32 @,@ 576 households included 44 @.@ 1 % one @-@ person , 22 @.@ 0 % married couples living together , 7 @.@ 6 % were co @-@ habiting couples , and 13 @.@ 3 % single parents with their children . Of those aged 16 – 74 , 37 @.@ 3 % had no academic qualifications , similar to that of 35 @.@ 5 % in all of the City of Salford but significantly higher than 28 @.@ 9 % in all of England . 15 @.@ 9 % of Salford 's residents aged 16 – 74 had an educational qualification such as first degree , higher degree , qualified teacher status , qualified medical doctor , qualified dentist , qualified nurse , midwife , health visitor , etc. compared to 20 % nationwide . 
 As a result of 19th @-@ century industrialisation , Salford has had " a special place in the history of the British working class " ; together with Manchester it had the world 's " first fully formed industrial working class " . Salford has not , in general , attracted the same minority ethnic and cosmopolitan communities as in other parts of Greater Manchester , although it did attract significant numbers of Irish in the mid @-@ 19th century . Many migrated to Salford because of the Great Hunger in Ireland combined with Salford 's reputation as a hub for employment in its factories and docks . In 1848 , Salford Roman Catholic Cathedral opened , reflecting the large Irish @-@ born community in Salford at that time . 
 In the decades following the Second World War , Salford experienced significant population decline , as residents followed employment opportunities to other locations in Greater Manchester , taking advantage of a greater choice in the type and location of housing . 
 In 2011 , Salford had a population of 103 @,@ 886 , which is about the same size as Rochdale . The population increased from 72 @,@ 750 in the previous census , mainly due to boundary changes . 
 In 2011 , 22 @.@ 7 % of the population in the Salford USD ( Urban Subdivision ) were non white British compared with 15 @.@ 6 % for the surrounding borough . The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people . Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census , probably due to the relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012 . This has created lots of jobs and encouraged migration to the area , which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century . 
 = = Economy = = 
 For decades Salford 's economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industry , especially textiles and engineering . Since the Second World War however , Salford has experienced decades of growing unemployment as these sectors diminished and new sectors chose to locate in out of town locations with better transport links . Between 1965 and 1991 the city lost over 49 @,@ 000 jobs , or more than 32 % of its employment base . Several factors contributed to this decline , not least changes in the national and international economies , the introduction of new technology and the concentration of investment in London and South East England . The biggest job losses were experienced in Salford 's traditional industries and although the service sector expanded during this period , it was unable to compensate for the decline in manufacturing . 
 The inner city 's main shopping area is Salford Shopping City , Pendleton – colloquially referred to as " Salford Precinct " – close to the University of Salford . However this area suffers from extreme deprivation and is dominated by the central business district that is Manchester city centre . This is planned to change in the next few years with the implementation of the Pendleton Area Action Plan and the development of the pedestrianised and <unk> A6 corridor . Salford Quays has been shortlisted as the new possible city centre by 2020 . 
 The Lowry Hotel , the first five @-@ star hotel to be built in Greater Manchester , is on the Salford side of the River Irwell . 
 Salford is credited as the birthplace of the Bush Roller Chain . Hans Renold , a Swiss @-@ born engineer , came to Salford in the late 19th century . In 1879 he purchased a small textile @-@ chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company , what is now Renold , a firm which still produces chains . Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it . It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles , motorbikes , to industrial and agricultural machinery to uses as varied as <unk> and escalators . 
 According to the 2001 UK census , the industry of employment of Salford 's residents aged 16 – 74 was 18 @.@ 0 % retail and wholesale , 14 @.@ 4 % property and business services , 12 @.@ 3 % manufacturing , 11 @.@ 7 % health and social work , 8 @.@ 6 % education , 7 @.@ 3 % transport and communications , 6 @.@ 8 % hotels and restaurants , 5 @.@ 8 % construction , 4 @.@ 4 % finance , 4 @.@ 2 % public administration , 0 @.@ 6 % energy and water supply , 0 @.@ 3 % agriculture , 0 @.@ 1 % mining , and 5 @.@ 7 % other .

 Although Salford lacks the number of Grade II * ( and above ) listed buildings accorded to its neighbour ( Manchester ) , it does possess a wide range of both classical and modern architecture , as well as some unique structures , including the 19th @-@ century Barton Swing Aqueduct . One of Salford 's oldest buildings is the Grade I listed Ordsall Hall , a Tudor mansion and former stately home in nearby Ordsall . It dates back over 750 years , although the oldest surviving parts of the present hall were built in the 15th century . Kersal Cell is a Grade II * listed 16th @-@ century timber @-@ framed manor house , currently in use as a private residence . Closer to the centre of the settlement , the tower of the Church of the Sacred Trinity dates from 1635 , the main building from 1752 . It was restored between 1871 and 1874 , and is now used as a library and office space . Another Grade II * listed building , Salford Cathedral , is a decorated neo @-@ Gothic Roman Catholic church built between 1844 and 1848 . 
 Salford is linked to Manchester by a series of bridges , including the Grade II listed Blackfriars Bridge , completed in 1820 . The settlement is dominated by the several railway viaducts built in the 19th century . Salford ( Old ) Town Hall , situated in Bexley Square off Chapel Street , is a Neo @-@ classical brick building dressed in stone , designed by Richard Lane . Public swimming baths were provided , on Blackfriars Road . Now in commercial use , the two @-@ storey building was constructed in about 1890 from brick , with terracotta dressings and a part @-@ glazed roof . The Salford University Campus , visible partly from the Crescent , contains a number of interesting buildings including the Royal Art Gallery and the Peel Building . 
 Salford Lads Club is a recreational club established in 1903 and located in Ordsall . It is a listed building and gained international fame in 1986 when the pop band The Smiths posed in front of it for the inside cover of their album The Queen Is Dead . A report by English Heritage said " The building is thought to be the most complete example of this rare form of social provision to survive in England . " In 2007 , the Manchester Evening News reported that the club was third in a nationwide hunt to find the most iconic buildings in the country . 
 = = Transport = = 
 One of the earliest transport schemes in Salford was constructed by the Salford to Wigan Turnpike trust , by an Act of Parliament of 1753 . Turnpike roads had a huge impact on the nature of business transport around the region . <unk> were superseded by wagons , and merchants would no longer accompany their caravans to markets and fairs , instead sending agents with samples , and despatching the goods at a later date . Road transport was not without its problems however and in 1808 the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal was connected to the River Irwell . In the main a coal @-@ carrying canal , it provided a valuable boost to the economies of Salford and Manchester , with a large number of wharves at its terminus in Salford . Sixteen years later John Greenwood started the first bus operation from Pendleton to Market Street , Manchester . 
 The Liverpool and Manchester Railway – the world 's first steam driven inter @-@ city passenger railway – opened through Salford on 15 September 1830 . The railway was primarily built to provide faster transport of materials and goods between the Port of Liverpool and mills in Manchester and surrounding towns , and stopped along the route at Ordsall Lane railway station . Almost eight years later the Manchester and Bolton Railway was opened , terminating at Salford Central railway station . 
 By 1801 the population of both Manchester and Salford was about 94 @,@ 000 . By 1861 this had risen to about 460 @,@ 000 , and so in the same year John Greenwood Jr. made an application to Salford Borough Council and to the Pendleton Turnpike Trust , to build a tramway from Pendleton to Albert Bridge in Salford . The system was innovative in that the rails were designed to be ' flush ' with the road surface , with a third central rail to accommodate a perambulator wheel attached to the front axle of the omnibus . Approval was granted and work commenced immediately , with the horse @-@ pulled tramway finished in September 1861 . It remained in use for a further eleven years when the condition of the track had deteriorated such that the council ordered it removed . The Tramways Act 1870 allowed councils to construct their own tramways , and on 17 May 1877 the ' Manchester and Salford Tramways ' opened for business . The network of lines was largely complete by September 1880 , the company changed its name to the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company , and the system reached its peak in the 1890s . A steam tramway was opened on 12 April 1883 from Bury to Higher Broughton . The vehicles provoked letters of complaints from residents about the associated noise , dirt , and grease , and by 1888 the route was eventually curtailed to Besses o ' th ' Barn . 
 Electric trams were a common sight in early 20th century Salford , and had from 1901 replaced the earlier horse @-@ drawn vehicles . A network of lines crossed the region , with coordinated services running through Salford , Manchester and the surrounding areas . Many served the new suburban housing and industrial developments built at the time , but in 1947 they were withdrawn in favour of more practical services – buses . The city is served by a complex road infrastructure , with connections from the M602 motorway to several major motorways , and A @-@ roads including the A57 Regent Road and the <unk> Trinity Way . Salford City Council has also created both advisory and mandatory cycle lanes across the city . 
 Public transport in Salford is now co @-@ ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester ( TfGM ) , a county @-@ wide public body with direct operational responsibilities such as supporting ( and in some cases running ) local bus services , and managing integrated ticketing in Greater Manchester . Salford City Council is responsible for the administration and maintenance of public roads and footpaths throughout the city . The city is served by two railway stations , Salford Central and Salford Crescent . Most train services are provided by Northern , although Salford Crescent is also served by TransPennine Express as part of its TransPennine North West network . Buses run to destinations throughout Salford , the City of Salford , across Greater Manchester and further afield : Pendleton is served by a route to Preston and Blackpool . 
 The Eccles line of the Manchester Metrolink runs through Salford , with stations at Exchange Quay , Salford Quays , Anchorage , Harbour City , Broadway , Langworthy , Weaste and more recently MediaCityUK . The line was opened in two stages , in 1999 and 2000 , as Phase 2 of the system 's development . 
 = = Education = = 
 Despite the rapid progress made during the Industrial Revolution , by 1851 education in Salford was judged " inadequate to the wants of the population " , and for those children who did get schooling " order and cleanliness were little regarded ... [ they ] were for the most part crowded in close and dirty rooms " . 
 Salford has thirty @-@ two primary schools , and five secondary schools . Until recently there were three main 6th form and FE colleges : Pendleton College , Eccles College and Salford College . They merged to create Salford City College in January 2009 . 
 The University of Salford , a plate glass university , is one of four in Greater Manchester . It has its origins in the former Royal Technical College , which was granted the status of a College of Advanced Technology ( CAT ) , on 2 November 1956 . In November 1963 the Robbins Report recommended that the <unk> should become technological universities ; and on 4 April 1967 a Charter was established creating the University of Salford . The university is undergoing £ 150M of redevelopment through investment in new facilities , including a £ 10M law school and a £ 22M building for health and social care , which were opened in 2006 . 
 The University of Salford has over 19 @,@ 000 students , and was ranked 81st in the UK by The Times newspaper . In 2007 , the university received nearly 17 @,@ 000 applications for 3 @,@ 660 places , and the drop @-@ out rate from the university was 25 % .

 From the formation of the Hundred of Salford , the entire area was within the Diocese of Lichfield . This diocese was divided in 1541 , upon the creation of the See of Chester . 
 Early worship took place at the parish church of Manchester , however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements . In the 16th century , it was converted into a dungeon , and was later demolished in 1779 . In 1634 – 35 , Humphrey Booth , a wealthy local merchant , opened a chapel of ease , which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel of Sacred Trinity ( the parish of Sacred Trinity was created in 1650 ) . John Wesley preached in the building , before his break with the Anglican Church . Upon his return in 1747 however he preached in the open , at Salford Cross . The chapel was rebuilt in about 1752 – 53 , although the tower probably belonged to the original building . It was restored in 1871 – 74 by the architect J. P. Holden and a chapel was added to the south @-@ east in 1934 . It is now a Grade II * listed building . 
 Salford Cathedral is one of the largest Catholic cathedrals in Northern England . It was built between 1844 and 1848 , and was listed as a Grade II * building in 1980 . It is at the centre of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford , which was founded in 1850 as one of the first post @-@ Reformation Catholic dioceses in Britain . Its current boundaries encompass Manchester and a large part of North West England . The Bishop of Salford 's official residence is at Wardley Hall . 
 Salford Deanery is in the Salford Archdeaconry of the Church of England . The sixteen churches in the deanery include the Parish Church of Saint Paul the Apostle in Paddington , St. Thomas ' in Pendleton , St Philip with St Stephen in Salford and St Clement 's in Ordsall . 
 The Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation was founded in 1861 , in Broughton . It was established by the local Greek immigrant community , who had arrived in the area soon after the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century . It replaced an earlier place of worship on Cheetham Hill Road , and an earlier chapel on Wellington Street . It is the oldest purpose @-@ built Orthodox church in the country .

 Salford has a notable history in sports , which includes hosting some of the events in the 2002 Commonwealth Games : rugby league , speedway , and horse racing . Salford had a venue for horse racing since the 17th century ; the earliest record of racing at Kersal Moor dates from 1687 . 
 Salford Red Devils is the city 's rugby league club and has been based in Salford since 1873 . They participate in the European Super League . Salford now play all home games at the AJ Bell Stadium . Junior rugby league is also played within Salford 's boundaries , with Langworthy Reds , Folly Lane and Salford City Roosters amongst other clubs providing playing personnel to the senior club . 
 The Premiership side Sale Sharks play their home games at the AJ Bell Stadium since the start of the 2012 – 13 season 
 Salford Quays has been used as a major international triathlon site , but a 2009 <unk> was cancelled because of a lack of competitors . 
 During the early part of the 20th century speedway was staged at Albion Stadium . 
 The city is one of the largest settlements in the UK without a professional football team ; in the formative years of the sport the region 's football heartland was in east Manchester , with few teams to the west .

The library was the first unconditionally free public library in the country . 
 Harold <unk> 's play Hobson 's Choice takes place in the Salford of 1880 , and the 1954 film version was shot in the town . Walter Greenwood 's 1933 novel Love on the Dole was set in a fictional area known as Hanky Park , said in the novel to be near Salford , but in reality based on Salford itself . A more modern fictional setting influenced by the area is Coronation Street 's Weatherfield . The Salford of the 1970s was the setting for the BAFTA award winning East is East .

 Under the requirements of the Municipal Corporations Act , 1835 , the County Borough of Salford was obliged to appoint a Watch Committee to establish a police force and appoint a chief constable . On 1 June 1968 the Manchester and Salford city <unk> formed the Manchester and Salford Police . Since 1974 , Home Office policing in Salford has been provided by the Greater Manchester Police . The force 's " ( F ) Division " has its headquarters for policing the City of Salford at Swinton , with further police stations in Little Hulton , Higher Broughton and Salford . The Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service , whose headquarters are on Bolton Road in nearby Pendlebury . 
 Salford Royal Hospital dated back to 1830 and was extended in 1911 . It was closed and converted into flats . The modern Salford Royal , at Hope , near the boundary with Eccles , was opened in 1882 as the Salford Union Infirmary . Later renamed Hope Hospital and then again as Salford Royal , it is a large NHS hospital administrated by Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust . In a 2006 – 07 review of all 394 NHS Trusts in England by the Healthcare Commission , Salford Royal was one of 19 to be rated excellent in its quality of services and its use of resources . The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport . Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small clinics and surgeries . 
 Waste management is co @-@ ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority . Salford 's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is United Utilities ; there are no power stations in the city . United Utilities also manages Salford 's drinking and waste water .

 = Bærum Tunnel = 
 The Bærum Tunnel ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) long double track railway tunnel in Bærum , Norway . Running between <unk> and Engervannet , it will make up most of the 6 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometer ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) long section of the Asker Line between Lysaker Station and Sandvika Station , which was taken into use on 26 August 2011 . The tunnel was constructed from 2007 using the drilling and blasting method with three crosscuts . The tunnel will have double track , be electrified and allow for maximum speeds of 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) . The whole section between the stations is estimated to cost 2 @.@ 7 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . The tunnel will accelerate intercity and regional traffic west of Oslo and free up capacity for the Oslo Commuter Rail .

 The Bærum Tunnel is 5 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) long and is part of the 6 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometer ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) long section of the Asker Line between Lysaker and Sandvika . At Engervannet , at the Sandvika end , the tunnel mouths out with two 400 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) long arms , one on each side of the Drammen Line , allowing trains to connect to the correct direction of traffic through Sandvika . The excavated cross @-@ section is 110 square meters ( 1 @,@ 200 sq ft ) . At the Lysaker end , the tunnel has an end @-@ piece which consists of a 150 @-@ meter ( 490 ft ) long culvert and the Drammen Line branches off on both sides of the tunnel . The three crosscuts , at <unk> , <unk> and Skallum , will be used as emergency exits . In addition , there are three additional exits , to allow for an emergency exit every 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) , located at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Each consists of a spiral staircase up to 55 meters ( 180 ft ) deep . These are primarily intended to allow access for emergency personnel , rather than as an escape route for passengers . Each staircase ends in a smoke @-@ tight room . The line will have double track , be electrified at 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC and allow for maximum speeds of 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) .

 The Asker Line runs from Lysaker Station via Sandvika Station to Asker Station , in the municipalities of Bærum and Asker . The line is built to increase the traffic on the west corridor . The only railway west of Oslo has been the Drammen Line , which has limited capacity , and a mix of local , regional , intercity and freight trains . This has caused many delays and poor utilization of tracks , as some trains make many stops and others only a few . The Asker Line allows regional and intercity trains to by @-@ pass the local stations east of Asker , by running local trains and freight trains on the Drammen Line , while faster trains run on the new track . The Asker Line was built in two stages : the first from Asker to Sandvika was built from 2001 to 2005 , and the second stage , from Sandvika to Lysaker , between 2007 and 2011 . The other two tunnels on the Asker Line are the 3 @,@ 790 @-@ meter ( 12 @,@ 430 ft ) long Skaugum Tunnel and the 3 @,@ 590 @-@ meter ( 11 @,@ 780 ft ) long Tanum Tunnel . 
 There were four main contracts for building the line issued after public tenders . Three of these involved part of the tunnel , and were awarded to Skanska , Veidekke and NCC . Mesta , Mika , <unk> and <unk> bid , but failed to win any contracts . Work was done from 06 : 00 through 02 : 00 , and noisy work was avoided before 07 : 00 or after 22 : 00 . Any work outside the tunnels was only done between 07 : 00 to 18 : 00 , and from 08 : 00 to 16 : 00 on Saturdays . The tunnel is built using the drilling and blasting method , which involved blasting sections of 5 meters ( 16 ft ) of rock at a time , with a progress of 15 meters ( 49 ft ) per week per team . Blasting started on 26 June 2007 . Construction is done from three crosscuts , a 60 @-@ meter ( 200 ft ) long section at Engervannet , a 250 @-@ meter ( 820 ft ) long section at <unk> , and a 420 meters ( 1 @,@ 380 ft ) long section at Skallum . At Skallum , a rinsing system for the water using in the tunneling was established , allowing the water to be recycled . 
 The tunneling resulted in 800 @,@ 000 cubic meters ( 28 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of earthwork , most of which was used for the expansion of the Port of Drammen . It was transported away from the tunnel with up to 12 truckloads per hour . The first breakthrough took place on 5 June 2008 . On 19 October 2008 , there was a ground failure at a storage area of earthwork . This caused a land slip which pressed up earthwork nearby at <unk> Station on the Kolsås Line of the Oslo Metro ; a 50 meters ( 160 ft ) long section of one platform and track was pressed up 3 meters ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) , resulting in the other track lying on its side . Because of changes to European Union regulations after planning of the project , three extra emergency staircases had to be installed in late 2009 . The final breakthrough in the tunnel occurred on 26 July 2009 . The tunneling took place under the groundwater level . To avoid similar problems which occurred during the construction of the Romerike Tunnel , where massive leaks took a year to fix , several test bores were made in the area to measure the groundwater level . Any indications of a change would immediately be automatically communicated to the on @-@ site geologists , who would be able to act accordingly . The system also automatically pumped water into the affected areas to compensate for any leaks until they could be fixed . 
 To make the tunnel water and frost tight , the walls were covered with polyethylene mats . Because they are highly inflammable , they were then covered in a layer of gunite . Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke . To sound @-@ insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing , the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool . By December 2010 , the ballast had been laid , and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started . The work to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice . The contract for the electro @-@ technical installations was awarded to <unk> Building Systems for NOK 120 million . As of 2006 , the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK 2 @.@ 7 billion . 
 Freight trains started using the tunnel on 26 August 2011 , and passenger trains on 28 August . The official opening took place on 2 September . Along with several other projects west of Oslo , including a new Lysaker Station and Høvik Station , and an upgrade to the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Etterstad , the completion of the Asker Line will allow higher service frequency , higher regularity and faster trains west of Oslo . A new high @-@ frequency schedule , named Route Plan 2012 , was planned for introduction in early 2013 following delivery of new Stadler FLIRT trains . This will also allow for more trains that stop at all stations on the Drammen Line and introduce three hourly trains to Vestfold and six hourly trains stopping at the main stations west of Oslo . 
 = HMS Fame ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Fame was an F @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s . Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion , the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 – 36 during the Abyssinia Crisis . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 , she spent time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Fame served in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 before she was severely damaged when she ran aground in October . The ship was refloated several months later and spent a year and a half under repair . Fame was converted into an escort destroyer while under repair and was assigned to escort duties in the North Atlantic when the repairs were completed in mid @-@ 1942 . 
 She sank two German submarines before she was transferred back to British coastal waters in May 1944 to protect the build @-@ up for Operation Overlord . Together with two other destroyers , she sank another German submarine that month and was reassigned to escort duties off the west coast of Scotland in July , where she remained until the war ended in May 1945 . Fame remained on active duty until mid @-@ 1947 when she was paid off . The ship was recommissioned a year later and was then sold to the Dominican Republic in 1949 . She was scrapped in 1968 .

 The F @-@ class ships were repeats of the preceding E class . They displaced 1 @,@ 405 long tons ( 1 @,@ 428 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 940 long tons ( 1 @,@ 970 t ) at deep load . The ships had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet 3 inches ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by three Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . The turbines developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . Fame carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 760 km ; 7 @,@ 310 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ships ' complement was 145 officers and ratings . 
 The ships mounted four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . The F class was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 38 shortly after the war began . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Fame had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun while under repair in mid @-@ 1940 . After running aground in October , she was converted into an escort destroyer . ' A ' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that ' Y ' gun had to be removed to compensate for the weight . A Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge , replacing the director @-@ control tower and rangefinder . The ship also received a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast . Her short @-@ range AA armament was augmented by two 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon guns on the wings of the ship 's bridge and another pair were added on the quarterdeck . By June 1943 , the .50 @-@ calibre machine guns had been replaced by a pair of Oerlikons , ' A ' gun was reinstalled , and the Hedgehog mounted there was converted to a split installation . Later , her single mounts on the bridge wings were probably replaced by twin mounts .

 Fame was ordered on 17 March 1933 from Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company , although her hull was sub @-@ contracted to Vickers Armstrongs . She was laid down at their Walker , Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 5 July , launched on 28 June 1934 , the same day as her sister ship , HMS Firedrake , and completed on 26 April 1935 . The ship cost 244 @,@ 216 pounds , excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament . Fame was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla ( DF ) of the Home Fleet , although she had to have her ammunition hoists modified at Devonport Royal Dockyard from 23 July to 28 August . The ship was then sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet during the Second Italo @-@ Abyssinian War . Fame was refitted at Devonport from 20 July to 10 November 1936 before she began to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non @-@ Intervention Committee until January 1937 . She visited Aarhus , Denmark in July before returning to Spanish waters in August – September . The ship then returned home and spent the next two years with the 6th DF . The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939 , five months before the start of World War II . Fame remained assigned to it until July 1940 , escorting the larger ships of the fleet . 
 In the Norwegian Campaign , she supported the Allied landings on 12 – 13 May at Bjerkvik during the Battle of Narvik . She continued to provide fire support during the battle for the rest of the month . During the nights of 30 and 31 May , the ship helped to evacuate troops from Bodø to Harstad and Borkenes to await further evacuation . Fame was one of the ships that escorted the troop ships evacuating the troops from the Narvik area on 7 and 8 June . 
 While searching for the damaged submarine Shark on 6 July , she was badly damaged by bomb splinters and was under repair until 10 October . A week later , she ran aground , together with the destroyer Ashanti , on the Northumberland coast while escorting the battleship King George V. The ship was severely damaged and could not be refloated until 1 December . Fame received temporary repairs at Sunderland before she was towed to Chatham Royal Dockyard on 2 February 1941 . Heavily overworked , the dockyard took nearly 18 months to repair the ship , although the decision to convert her into an escort destroyer during this time contributed to the time required . 
 In September 1942 , Fame finished her repairs and she was assigned to Escort Group B6 with her captain , Commander R. Heathcote , as the Group 's senior officer . Her first Atlantic convoy action was with SC 104 , a major convoy battle that saw the loss of 8 ships , with 2 warships damaged , and 2 U @-@ boats destroyed , with 2 more damaged and forced to retire . Fame 's ASDIC located German submarine U @-@ 353 on 16 October and a shallow @-@ set pattern of 10 depth charges forced her to the surface where she was rammed and sunk by Fame . The impact badly damaged the destroyer and she was forced to leave the convoy for repairs after rescuing 39 survivors . Her repairs were completed in December , and , while escorting Convoy ON 155 , was dispatched to the aid of Convoy ON 154 , which was under heavy attack . Heathcote was ordered to take command of the escort after the commander of Escort Group C1 collapsed from exhaustion after a five @-@ day battle , during which ON 154 had lost 14 ships for one U @-@ boat destroyed . 
 In February 1943 , Escort Group B6 was escorting Convoy ONS 165 , which lost two ships for two U @-@ boats destroyed . Fame sank one of these , U @-@ 69 , on 17 February . Fame was reassigned to patrol duty in the South @-@ Western Approaches in May 1944 as part of the Normandy landings and became the senior ship of the 14th Escort Group . During this time , Fame participated in the sinking of U @-@ 767 , together with the destroyers Inconstant and Havelock on 18 June . The following month , Fame was transferred to the west coast of Scotland , continuing there until the end of the war . 
 = = = Post war = = = 
 Fame began a refit at Leith in May 1945 that lasted until August . Unlike most of the prewar destroyers , she remained on active duty and was assigned to the Rosyth Escort Force until October when she was transferred to the Londonderry Training Flotilla . A month later , Fame became the senior officer 's ship for the 3rd Flotilla at Londonderry Port . The ship was reduced to reserve in May 1947 , but was reactivated a year later and refitted in June 1948 . Together with the destroyer Hotspur , she was sold on 4 February 1949 to the Dominican Republic for £ 190 @,@ 000 for both ships , plus an additional £ 40 @,@ 000 to refit each ship . By this time the ship carried a Type 291 air @-@ warning radar and an American SG @-@ 1 surface @-@ search radar . She was armed with three 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns , four 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) Bofors light AA guns , one quadruple 21 @-@ inch torpedo mount , four depth charge throwers and two rails for 70 depth charges . Fame was renamed <unk> , but , after the death of Rafael Trujillo , the ship was renamed Sanchez in 1962 . The ship was scrapped in 1968 .

 The Indiana Governor 's Residence is located in the historic district surrounding North Meridian Street in Indianapolis , Indiana . It sits on an estate of 6 @.@ 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 6 ha ) at 4750 North Meridian Street . Designed by Scott Wadley , with the firm of <unk> and Hunter serving as architects , the English Tudor home was built in 1928 . It was acquired by the state of Indiana in 1973 from attorney C. Severin <unk> for US $ 242 @,@ 000 . The home was then renovated for approximately $ 800 @,@ 000 , including $ 125 @,@ 000 in funds from a Lilly Endowment grant . Renovation included the installation of air conditioning and modern wiring . 
 Approximately 10 @,@ 500 sq ft ( 980 m2 ) , with twenty @-@ three rooms , eleven of them bathrooms , it is considered a typical size for an English Tudor home and resembles many of the other homes in the neighborhood that were built in the same time period . Although the appearance is similar to the other homes , it is structurally unique because its support and foundation are made of concrete , whereas typical Tudor homes are entirely wooden . The home 's lower floor is open to the public and tours are offered regularly to visitors . The rooms available for viewing include the foyer , a library , the formal living room , formal and informal dining room , a sun porch , a kitchen , a butler 's pantry , and event space . The second floor is reserved for the first family as a living area and is off limits to the public . The home receives approximately 10 @,@ 000 visitors annually .

 Before Indiana became a state , the Indiana Territory had two governors . William Henry Harrison , the first governor , built a plantation @-@ style home in Vincennes , and named it Grouseland for its many birds . Built in 1804 , it was one of the first brick buildings in the territory . The home is still preserved and is a National Historic Landmark . Thomas Posey , the territory 's second governor , had a home built in Corydon , but lived there only briefly before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a room in a boarding house . The Posey House is preserved as part of a National Historic District . 
 There have been six official residences of Indiana 's governors since Indiana became a state , but only five were actually inhabited by the first family . There were four other unofficial residences that governors also lived in while no other accommodations were available . The first residence of a state governor was in Corydon on a small hill overlooking the first statehouse ; Governor Jonathan Jennings and his wife Anne lived in it from 1816 until 1822 . The home was visited by United States Presidents Andrew Jackson and James Monroe . The building is no longer standing but a new home has been built upon its original foundation and uses its cellar as a basement . Governor William Hendricks also lived in Corydon at Governor Hendricks Headquarters , an unofficial residence purchased by Hendricks from Davis Floyd and located on the same block as Jennings ' home . Floyd had built the home for himself , but lost it after the Panic of 1819 . Hendricks lived there during his term as governor , from 1822 – 1825 , and later sold it . 
 The second official residence for the state 's governor was built in the center of Indianapolis where the Indiana Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument now stands . It was designed by Alexander Ralston , who also laid out most of the city . The mansion cost $ 6 @,@ 500 and was completed in 1827 during the term of Governor James B. Ray . Ray 's wife refused to live in the home because of its lack of privacy ; it was never used by a governor . It was inhabited by Indiana Chief Justice Isaac Blackford from around 1830 until the 1850s . It was demolished in the 1870s . 
 Without an acceptable home for the governor , the state purchased the house of Dr. John H. Sanders to serve as a residence for the Governor in 1837 . The location , on the corner of Market and Illinois Streets in Indianapolis , proved to be damp and unhealthy because of the wetland conditions of the area during that time . Governor James Whitcomb blamed the conditions for his wife 's death . The home was abandoned in 1861 during the term of Oliver Morton , who briefly lived in the house but refused to stay . The house was sold during his term and eventually destroyed . 
 The governors remained without an official residence until 1919 when the state purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St. , Indianapolis , for $ 65 @,@ 000 and furnished it for an additional $ 20 @,@ 000 . It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house . The home had a Gothic interior with high , beamed ceilings and luxurious Wilton carpeting . After a brief renovation , the home was inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945 . The building was sold by the state to the <unk> Hotel , which intended to turn it into a clubhouse , but eventually demolished it in 1962 to clear land for a parking lot . 
 The fifth home for the governor was purchased in 1945 and located at <unk> N. Meridian St. The home was built in 1924 by Harry Lane , an auditor for the Indianapolis Stockyards . Three stories high with slated roofs and 12 rooms , it was famed for its golden bathroom fixtures and its high gilt @-@ tipped iron fence . It was purchased from his widow for $ 72 @,@ 000 . It served as residence for the governor from 1945 until the present mansion was purchased in 1973 . The home was sold at an auction in 1973 to Robert L. Dawson , who in turn sold it to Dr. John C. Klein in 1978 . 
 After the building was auctioned , there was a brief period while the current residence was in renovation . During that period , governors Edgar Whitcomb and Otis Bowen took up residence in Riley Towers located at 650 N. Alabama St. The state leased the penthouse for their residence at a cost of $ 1 @,@ 150 per month .

 = Smokers v Non @-@ Smokers = 
 Two first @-@ class cricket matches billed as " Smokers v Non @-@ Smokers " were played during the 1880s . Featuring players from Australia and England , each match occurred during a tour of one of those countries by the other 's national team . The first match was won by the Non @-@ Smokers , while in the second , which was drawn , the Non @-@ Smokers scored a then @-@ record 803 runs in the first innings . 
 The first match was played at the end of the Australian tour of England in 1884 , and was held at Lord 's in aid of the Cricketers ' Fund Friendly Society . Eight of the tourists took part ; four on each side . The Non @-@ Smokers batted first , and then forced their opponents to follow on , aided by a strong batting performance from George Bonnor . The Smokers , batting twice , only finished thirteen runs ahead , a total which was chased down without the need for the scheduled third day of the contest . 
 In the second match , held in Australia two and a half years later , the contest once again featured a combination of Australian and English players . Aided by a Arthur Shrewsbury double century , the Non @-@ Smokers set a new record for the highest innings in first @-@ class cricket , accumulating 803 runs . As in the original match , the Smokers had to follow on , and when the match finished as a draw they were still almost 500 runs behind . 
 = = First match , 1884 = = 
 The Australia national cricket team toured England in 1884 , playing an itinerary of 32 matches , including three designated as Tests . At the end of the tour , an additional fixture was arranged by V. E. Walker , who went on to become president of both the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) and Middlesex County Cricket Club . The match , which was described in The South Australian Advertiser as being " novel and interesting " , combined Australian and English players into two teams ; those who smoked and those who did not . The match was played to raise money for the Cricketers ' Fund Friendly Society , in which it was considered very successful , raising in excess of £ 561 . Walker also wanted the British public to have an opportunity to see members of the Australian touring party play against each other , to which end Alick Bannerman , George Bonnor , Billy Murdoch and Tup Scott represented the Non @-@ Smokers , while George Giffen , Percy McDonnell , Eugene Palmer and Frederick Spofforth played for the Smokers . The reporter from The South Australian Advertiser judged that the Smokers had the stronger batsmen , while the Non @-@ Smokers had the better bowlers . 
 Lord Harris captained the Smokers , and called the toss wrong ; the captain of the Non @-@ Smokers , W. G. Grace , opted for his side to bat first . The Smokers team amused the crowd by walking out to field smoking cigarettes . The first three wickets fell for the addition of 38 runs ; Grace scored 10 , Murdoch got 4 and Bannerman had 22 , bringing together Bonnor and Dick Barlow . The pair added 152 runs together , with the Lancashire professional Barlow playing a supporting role to the Australian Bonnor . The latter scored 124 runs , and according to Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , he batted against Spofforth " with such astonishing freedom . " Bonnor hit a six and 16 fours during his innings , which was the only score over 50 in the match . Barlow continued to bat carefully , but was eventually dismissed for 39 by the left @-@ arm spinner Edmund Peate , who claimed six of the final seven wickets to finish with figures of six for 30 , and end the Non @-@ Smokers innings on 250 . 
 The Smokers began their innings late on the first day . By that stage , the pitch had deteriorated and light was poor , making batting more difficult . By the end of the day 's play forty minutes later , they had lost four wickets and only scored 25 runs . They fared better the following morning , but only three batsmen reached double figures — Billy Gunn , 18 , Monty Bowden , 29 , and Charles Clarke , 20 not out — as they were bowled out for 111 just before the lunch break . W. G. Grace was the pick of the bowlers , taking five wickets for 29 runs . A first @-@ innings deficit of 139 runs meant that the Smokers were forced to follow on . 
 Beginning their second innings after lunch , there was a little improvement for the Smokers , though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures . Gunn top @-@ scored for his side , remaining 43 not out at the end of the innings , while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly , making 27 and 15 respectively . Despite these scores , the Smokers only reached 152 , leaving the Non @-@ Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match . Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings , but he was bettered by Barlow , who took five for 24 . Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light , the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day , and so the Non @-@ Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required , reaching the total shortly after six o 'clock . The match was played at Lord 's in good weather on both days , and was well attended on the first day , with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground .

 Two and a half years later , another first @-@ class contest with the same title was held at East Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia . The game was played as the penultimate match of the English tour of Australia in 1886 – 87 , led by Alfred Shaw . Once again the two teams contained a mix of Australian and English players , including three who had taken part in the previous match ; Barlow and Palmer each appeared for the same team as previously , but Gunn , who had played for the Smokers in 1884 , switched teams and was on the side of the Non @-@ Smokers in 1887 . The touring side had been due to face a " Combined Australia " team , but as such a team would be missing those players from New South Wales , it was decided to split the teams as in 1884 . The match was sponsored by four companies , with prizes of 500 cigars each for the best batsman and bowler for the Smokers , 250 cigars for the best aggregate batting score for the Smokers , another 250 cigars for the best individual score from either side , and 200 cigars for the best bowling for the Non @-@ Smokers . 
 The match began in similar fashion to the earlier contest ; the Non @-@ Smokers won the toss , and their captain Arthur Shrewsbury chose to bat first . The Smokers , led by the Australian Harry Boyle , walked onto the pitch smoking cigars . Despite the strong bowling attack boasted by the Smokers , which included Johnny Briggs and George Lohmann , the Non @-@ Smokers took advantage of a good batting wicket and accrued 196 runs before the first wicket fell , that of William Bruce for 131 . Billy Bates was dismissed shortly thereafter for four , bringing in Billy Gunn . Shrewsbury and Gunn batted together for the rest of the day , and the following morning , building a partnership of 310 runs ; Shrewsbury was eventually caught off the bowling of Briggs for 236 , while Gunn was bowled by Boyle for 150 . Fifties from Richard Houston , Harry Musgrove and Jack Worrall in the middle @-@ order boosted the score to 803 , a new record for the highest innings total in first @-@ class cricket . The previous record , 775 runs , had also been set in Australia , by New South Wales . The score fell some way short of the highest innings score in any cricket , which was believed to have been the 920 scored by Orleans Club against <unk> Green in 1882 . The score has since been surpassed over twenty times . 
 The Smokers began their response on the third morning of the match , and after losing Maurice Read for 30 , Eugene Palmer and Briggs put together a partnership of 160 , but both were dismissed before the close of play that day , Palmer for 113 and Briggs for 86 . Nevertheless , with the score at 302 for three , it was considered likely that the match would end in a draw . The following morning , wickets fell rapidly ; Bates finished the innings with figures of six for 73 , and the Smokers , who were all out for 356 , were asked to follow on . Briggs recorded a second fifty in the match , but otherwise no player made a significant impact , and the game pestered towards the expected draw . The last ball of the match resulted in a situation described by Gerald Brodribb as " most unusual " . William Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest . Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high @-@ scoring match , he defended the delivery and picked the ball up . The fielders — who also wanted the souvenir — appealed , and Scotton was ruled out , having handled the ball . The match was drawn , with the Smokers still trailing by 491 runs . 
 = Masked shrike = 
 The masked shrike ( Lanius nubicus ) is a bird in the shrike family , <unk> . It breeds in southeastern Europe and at the eastern end of the Mediterranean , with a separate population in eastern Iraq and western Iran . It is migratory , wintering mainly in northeast Africa . Although it is a short @-@ range migrant , vagrants have occurred widely elsewhere , including northern and western Europe . It is the smallest member of its genus , long @-@ tailed and with a hooked bill . The male has mainly black upperparts , with white on its crown , forehead and supercilium and large white patches on the shoulders and wings . The throat , neck sides and underparts are white , with orange flanks and breast . The female is a duller version of the male , with brownish black upperparts and a grey or buff tone to the shoulders and underparts . The juvenile has grey @-@ brown upperparts with a paler forehead and barring from the head to rump , barred off @-@ white underparts and brown wings <unk> from the white primary patches . The species ' calls are short and grating , but the song has melodic warbler @-@ like components . 
 The masked shrike 's preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees . It is less conspicuous than its relatives , avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations . The nest is a neat cup built in a tree by both adults , and the clutch is normally 4 – 6 eggs , which are incubated by the female for 14 – 16 days until hatching . The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18 – 20 days later , and remain dependent on the adults for about 3 – 4 weeks after leaving the nest . The masked shrike eats mainly large insects , occasionally small vertebrates ; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire . Populations are decreasing in parts of the European range , but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns , and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The shrikes are a family of slender , long @-@ tailed passerines , most of its members being in the genus Lanius , the typical shrikes . They are short @-@ necked birds with rounded wings and a hooked tip to the bill . Most occur in open habitats . The affiliations of the masked shrike with other members of the genus are uncertain ; the " brown " shrikes ( brown , red @-@ backed and isabelline shrikes ) and tropical species like the Somali fiscal have both been suggested as possible relatives . The masked shrike has no subspecies . 
 The masked shrike was described by German explorer and naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823 under its current scientific name . Lanius is the Latin for a butcher , and comes from the shrikes ' habit of impaling prey , reminiscent of a butcher hanging carcasses , and nubicus means " Nubian " ( from northeast Africa ) . The bird was independently described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Temminck in 1824 as Lanius personatus , from the Latin personatus " masked " , referring , as does the English name , to the bird 's appearance , but the older name takes precedence . A later synonym from 1844 was L. <unk> from the Greek leukos , " white " , and <unk> , " forehead " , describing a feature of the distinctive head pattern . " Shrike " , first recorded in 1545 , derives from the shrill cries given by this family , and the traditional common name " butcher @-@ bird " again refers to the characteristic prey storage , and has been in use since at least 1668 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The masked shrike is the smallest of its genus , a slender bird which usually weighs 20 – 23 g ( 0 @.@ 71 – 0 @.@ 81 oz ) , measuring 17 – 18 @.@ 5 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 3 in ) long with a 24 – 26 @.@ 5 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 – 10 @.@ 4 in ) wingspan . It has a long tail and relatively small bill , on each side of which is a tomial tooth ; the upper mandible bears a triangular ridge which fits a corresponding notch in the lower mandible . This adaptation is otherwise only found in falcons . 
 The male has mainly black upperparts , a white crown , forehead and supercilium . There are large white patches on the shoulders and primaries , and the outermost tail feathers are also white . The throat , neck sides and underparts are white , with orange on the flanks and breast . The iris is brown , the bill is black and the legs are dark brown or black . The female is a duller version of the male , with brownish @-@ black upperparts and a grey or buff tinge to the white shoulder patches and underparts . The juvenile has grey @-@ brown upperparts with darker bars from the head to rump , a paler grey forehead , barred off @-@ white underparts and brown wings with white primary patches . 
 Masked shrikes are most similar in appearance to woodchat shrikes , but are smaller , more slender and longer @-@ tailed . Adults of the two species are easily distinguished , since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump , whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown , rusty nape and white rump . Juveniles are more similar , but the masked shrike has a longer tail , paler face , and grey back and rump , whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump . 
 Juveniles moult their head , body and some wing feathers a few weeks after fledging , and adults have a complete moult after breeding . In both cases , if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The masked shrike gives the harsh calls typical of this family , with repeated <unk> , <unk> or shek notes and some whistles , and when alarmed produces a rattling <unk> . The bill may be snapped when the bird is agitated . The song , up to a minute long , is soft for a shrike , with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles . It resembles the songs of <unk> species , particularly the olive @-@ tree warbler . On rare occasions , males may sing in flight . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The masked shrike breeds in the Balkans , northeast Greece and some of the Greek islands , Turkey , Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel . It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran . The range in the east is uncertain , and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia . It is migratory , wintering south of the Sahara , mainly in Chad , Sudan and Ethiopia . Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria , and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia . Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September , and return north in February and March . 
 This species is seen in Egypt , Jordan and Israel much more often in spring than autumn , suggesting that the southern movement may be concentrated further east . Birds will hold small territories on about 0 @.@ 5 hectares ( 1 @.@ 2 acres ) on migration , and , unlike other shrikes , may congregate in significant numbers . More than 100 have been seen in one locality in Israel , with five in a single bush . This shrike has occurred as a vagrant in Algeria , Finland , Kenya , Libya , Spain , Sweden , Mauritania and Turkmenistan . At least three individuals have been documented in Great Britain , and two individuals in Armenia . 
 The masked shrike 's preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees . Unlike its relatives , it avoids very open , lightly vegetated country . Orchards and other cultivated land with suitable old trees or large hedges are also used by this species . It is normally found in more wooded areas than sympatric shrikes . It occurs in lowlands and in hills up to 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . In some areas breeding occurs at greater altitudes , up to 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . It may occur in gardens and resorts on migration , and in winter again prefers open country with thorny bushes and large trees like acacia or introduced eucalyptus . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The masked shrike is a solitary species except when on migration . It maintains a breeding territory of 2 – 5 ha ( 5 – 12 acres ) and is also territorial on the wintering grounds , defending an area of about 3 ha ( 7 acres ) . Although unafraid of humans , it is aggressive to its own species and other birds which infringe on its territory . Most other shrikes use high , exposed branches throughout the year , but the masked shrike only uses conspicuous locations at the start of the breeding season , otherwise choosing lower , more sheltered spots . It perches upright , frequently cocking its tail , and has an easy , agile flight . A masked shrike has been recorded as feigning injury when trapped , only to return to normal when the threat receded . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Male masked shrikes sing from perches in their territories from early April , sometimes chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males . The male 's courtship display , usually accompanied by singing , starts with the bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch , and is followed by the shrike stepping down its branch and bowing , either on the move or while temporarily halted . The male may also give a fluttering , zigzagging flight display . The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls . Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes , but stepping @-@ down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species . 
 The nest , built by both sexes , is a small , neat cup of rootlets , stems and twigs , lined with wool or hair , and adorned with lichen externally . It is constructed in a tree 1 @.@ 5 – 10 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 32 @.@ 8 ft ) above the ground and averages 170 mm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) wide and 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) deep , with the cup 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) across and a 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) in depth . Eggs are laid from April to June , mainly in May in the lowlands and about a month later in the mountains . Replacement clutches are laid in June or July if the nest fails , and second broods appear to be common in at least some areas . The first nest is destroyed by the pair to provide material for a replacement breeding attempt . The eggs average 20 mm × 16 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in × 0 @.@ 63 in ) in size and are variable in colour , with a background of grey , cream or yellow , diffuse grey blotches , and a ring of brown markings . The normal clutch is 4 – 6 eggs , which are incubated by the female for 14 – 16 days until hatching . The altricial downy chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18 – 20 days later . They are dependent on the adults for about 3 – 4 weeks after leaving the nest . The masked shrike breeds in its first year , but its average life span is unknown . 
 Vertebrate predators of young birds include cats and crows . This species may also be infected by parasites , such as an <unk> , a tick , Hyalomma marginatum , and at least two species of Haemoproteus blood parasites . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Like its relatives , the masked shrike hunts from a perch , typically 3 – 8 m ( 10 – 26 ft ) high , although usually in less exposed locations than those favoured by most other shrikes . Prey is usually taken from the ground , but occasionally picked off foliage or caught in the air with an agile flycatcher @-@ like flight . The kill may be impaled on thorns or barbed wire as a " larder " for immediate or later consumption . Because passerines have relatively weak legs , impalement holds the corpse while it is dismembered . It was once thought that this behaviour was shown mainly by male shrikes in the breeding season , but this is not the case . Masked shrikes of both sexes are known to impale in winter and on migration . Individual birds may be very tame , following a gardener or feeding close to an observer . 
 The masked shrike feeds mainly on large insects , although other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught . <unk> fatten up before migration , but to a lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way , sometimes taking other tired migrants . Despite its relatively small size , the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift . Vertebrates are killed by bill blows to the back of the head , and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones . 
 = = Status = = 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) estimates the European population of the masked shrike to be between 105 @,@ 000 – 300 @,@ 000 individuals , suggesting a global total of 142 @,@ 000 – 600 @,@ 000 birds . Although the population appears to be declining , the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria . The large numbers and extensive breeding range of about 353 @,@ 000 km2 ( 136 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , mean that this shrike is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern . 
 Numbers have declined in recent decades in Europe , although Bulgaria , Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs . Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90 @,@ 000 pairs . The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss , and a large decrease in Israel is thought to be due to pesticides . In Somalia this bird is now rare . Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean , despite legal protection in most countries , and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria , where this species is considered to be unlucky . There are indications that this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands , which could help populations in the longer term .

 Space Science Fiction Magazine was a US science fiction magazine published by Republic Features Syndicate , Inc. as part of a package of radio shows and related genre magazines . Two issues appeared , both in 1957 . It published short stories by well @-@ known writers , including Arthur C. Clarke and Jack Vance , but it was not successful , and the magazine ceased publication late in 1957 . 
 = = Publication history and bibliographic data = = 
 Science fiction was one of the staple genres of American pulp magazine publishing , beginning in 1926 with Amazing Stories . A brief boom in the late 1930s was cut short by World War II , but the field expanded again in the late 1940s . By 1957 the boom had reached its height ; 24 science fiction magazines published at least one issue that year . One of the most prominent of these magazines , Galaxy Science Fiction , had a successful association with two radio shows , Dimension X and X Minus One . This sparked imitators , and during 1956 Lyle Kenyon Engel of Republic Features Syndicate put together a package of two radio shows and four magazines . The shows were American Agent , a spy drama , and The Frightened , to be narrated by Boris Karloff . The magazine package included a spy magazine and a horror magazine to tie in with the radio shows , and two additional titles : Private Investigator Detective Magazine and Space Science Fiction Magazine . Private Investigator 's first issue was published in 1956 , but problems with the radio schedules delayed the launch of the other magazines until 1957 . 
 Space SF 's first issue was dated Spring 1957 , although its masthead indicated that it would be a bimonthly . It was published by Republic Features Syndicate , Inc . , of New York , and edited by Michael Avallone , who was not credited on the masthead . The second issue was dated August 1957 ; this proved to be the final issue , as shortly thereafter Republic Features Syndicate went out of business . The liquidation of American News Company earlier that year , a major distributor , had led to the extinction of many magazines , as they had to scramble to find new distributors , but it is not known if Space SF was one of the victims . 
 Both issues were digest @-@ sized , with 132 pages , and were priced at 35 cents . The issues were numbered as a single volume with two issues . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Engel obtained stories from moderately well @-@ known science fiction names for both issues , including John Jakes , Mack Reynolds , Jack Vance , and Raymond F. Jones , but many of the stories were " barrel @-@ scrapings " from the Scott Meredith Literary Agency , in the words of one historian ; most had already been rejected at the other active science fiction markets . Space SF also published Arthur C. Clarke 's " Critical Mass " , one of the popular " White Hart " stories . It had already appeared in a 1949 edition of a British magazine , Lilliput , but Clarke revised it for this publication . Overall , in the words of Mike Ashley , " ... [ it ] carried stories by noted sf writers , [ but ] they read like rejects from better magazines , and there was nothing of lasting value " . Ashley comments that the best story was Jakes 's " The Devil Spins a Sun @-@ Dream " , which was atmospheric if poorly plotted ; the protagonist , a human prospector on Mars , finds a fabulous city , but an ancient booby @-@ trap destroys it before his eyes . 
 Almost every story was illustrated , with Bruce <unk> as artist . Both issues ' covers were by Tom Ryan . There were no editorials , review columns , or any other contents other than fiction , and advertisements , all of which were for radio shows , including American Agent and The Frightened . 
 = 2007 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 2007 Pacific hurricane season was a below @-@ average Pacific hurricane season , featuring one major hurricane . The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the central Pacific , and ended on November 30 ; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the region . The first tropical cyclone of the season , Alvin , developed on May 27 , while the final system of the year , Kiko , dissipated on October 23 . Due to unusually strong wind shear , activity fell short of the long @-@ term average , with a total of 11 named storms , 4 hurricanes , and 1 major hurricane . At the time , 2007 featured the second @-@ lowest value of the Accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) index since reliable records began in 1971 . Two tropical cyclones – Cosme and Flossie – crossed into the central Pacific basin during the year , activity below the average of 4 to 5 systems . 
 Impact during the season was relatively minimal . In early June , Tropical Storm Barbara moved ashore just northwest of the Mexico – Guatemala border , causing $ 55 million ( 2007 USD ) in damage and 4 deaths . In late July , Cosme passed south of the island of Hawaii as a weakening tropical depression ; light rain and increased surf resulted . A few days later , Dalila passed offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico , killing 11 and causing minimal damage . Hurricane Flossie followed a similar track to Cosme in mid @-@ August , producing gusty winds and light precipitation in Hawaii . Hurricane Henriette in early September produced torrential rainfall in southwestern Mexico , killing 6 and causing $ 25 million in damage . Baja California received moderate rains from Hurricane Ivo in mid @-@ September , though no damage nor fatalities were reported . In mid @-@ October , Tropical Storm Kiko passed just offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico . Though no deaths were reported on the Mexico mainland , the storm capsized a ship with 30 people on board , 15 of whom were recovered dead , and 9 of whom were reported missing . Overall , the season ended with $ 80 million in damage and 49 deaths .

 On May 21 , 2007 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Central Pacific Hurricane Center released its outlook for the 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season , predicting a total of 2 – 3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin ; in a typical season , 4 – 5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific . A day later , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Climate Prediction Center released its seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season , predicting a total of 11 – 16 named storms , 6 – 9 hurricanes , and 2 – 4 major hurricanes . Below @-@ average activity was expected as a result of either ENSO @-@ Neutral or La Niña conditions , as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995 . 
 = = = Seasonal activity = = = 
 Tropical cyclone activity totaled to 11 named storms , 4 hurricanes , and 1 major hurricane within the 2007 Pacific hurricane season ; all three of these values fall below the 1971 – 2006 long @-@ term average of 15 named storms , 9 hurricanes , and 4 major hurricanes . The main contributing factor to below @-@ average activity was much above @-@ average wind shear across the Pacific basin . Overall energy output was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy ( ACE ) index of 52 units , well below the 1981 – 2010 average of 113 @.@ 3 units , and at the time the second @-@ lowest value observed since reliable records began in 1971 . In May 2007 , two tropical storms – Alvin and Barbara – developed , marking at the time the third such instance of more than one tropical storm developing within the month since official records began in 1949 . In June 2007 , only one tropical depression developed in the East Pacific basin , making 2007 one of only four years in which a tropical storm did not form in the month . By the following month , in terms of ACE , 2007 was considered the third quietest year @-@ to @-@ date since the satellite era began in 1966 ; in September , the season fell to the second quietest year @-@ to @-@ date . Below @-@ average activity continued for the remainder of the year .

 = = = Tropical Storm Alvin = = = 
 The genesis of Alvin can be attributed to a tropical wave that crossed Dakar , Africa on May 9 . The wave remained poorly organized as it moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through mid @-@ May . On May 20 , the disturbance crossed Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean , where convection — shower and thunderstorm activity — gradually began to increase over the well @-@ defined center ; this led to the formation of a tropical depression by 0000 UTC on May 27 , approximately 345 mi ( 555 km ) south of the southern tip of Baja California . Following designation , the depression was slow to organize as a result of moderate easterly shear ; by 0000 UTC on May 29 , however , the system had gained enough organization to be considered a tropical storm . After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1003 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 62 inHg ) , increasingly stable air and higher wind shear caused Alvin to begin a weakening trend . At 0600 UTC on May 30 , it weakened to a tropical depression , and by 0000 UTC on June 1 , Alvin degenerated into a non @-@ convective remnant low . The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation six days later . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Barbara = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on May 14 . After emerging into the eastern Pacific on May 25 , the system acquired enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on May 29 , about 115 mi ( 185 km ) south @-@ southeast of Puerto Escondido , Oaxaca . Within an environment of weak steering currents , the storm became better organized as evidenced by an improving satellite appearance , with the formation of a curved band in the southeast quadrant . At 1200 UTC on May 30 , the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm ; by 0000 UTC on June 1 , however , increased northerly wind shear caused Barbara to weaken back to a tropical depression . After re @-@ intensifying into a tropical storm for a second time six hours later , Barbara attained its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 53 inHg ) at 1800 UTC . Drifting northeast , the storm maintained this intensity until landfall just northwest of the Mexico @-@ Guatemala border at 1300 UTC on June 2 . Rapid weakening ensued thereafter , with the system weakening to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC . The low @-@ level circulation dissipated six hours later , marking the dissipation of Barbara . 
 Heavy rainfall exceeding 4 in ( 100 mm ) caused many rivers to swell . An unspecified island was separated from the Mexico mainland after the bridge connecting the two was washed away , stranding dozens of families . In El Salvador , significant flooding killed four people . Gusts peaked at 58 mph ( 85 km / h ) at an automated weather station in Puerto Madero , Chiapas . Across the affected regions , these winds caused damage limited to house roofs and trees . Barbara caused severe crop damage totaling to 200 million pesos ( 2007 MXN ; $ 55 million ) . About a hundred residents were forced to evacuate after the storm destroyed a dozen palm huts in Guatemala .

 On May 24 , a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa . The wave entered the eastern Pacific around June 6 and shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase shortly thereafter . A broad area of low pressure formed a few hundred miles south of Acapulco , Mexico two days later . Following satellite evidence of a well @-@ defined circulation and organized convective activity , the National Hurricane Center upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on June 11 . After attaining winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1004 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 65 inHg ) , the depression began to traverse cooler waters and much more stable air . This caused all associated convection to fade away , and the depression degenerated to a non @-@ convective remnant low at 0000 UTC on June 13 . The remnant low continued northwest until dissipation by 0600 UTC on June 15 .

 A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on June 23 . It reached the eastern Pacific on July 3 , where associated convection began to increase three days later . Continued slow development occurred thereafter , and following satellite trends , the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four @-@ E at 1800 UTC on July 9 . Tracking westward , the depression began to move across waters too cool to support a tropical cyclone and into an environment of moderate shear . The low @-@ level circulation became ill @-@ defined and exposed , leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600 UTC on July 11 about 910 mi ( 1465 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico .

 On June 21 , a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa . It entered the eastern Pacific on July 10 , and shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase a day later as a result .

Within an environment of moderate wind shear , the low @-@ level center quickly became poorly defined as convection dissipated . Turning west @-@ northwest on July 15 , the depression entered cooler waters and an increasingly stable airmass , causing the system to degenerate into a remnant low by 0000 UTC the following day .

 A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on June 27 and tracked westward to reach the eastern Pacific on July 8 . There , the system steadily gained organization and was declared a tropical depression by 1200 UTC on July 14 . Moving slowly northwest , a low wind shear and warm sea surface temperature environment allowed the system to strengthen to a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on July 15 . Following the development of a curved convection band and appearance of an eye on satellite , Cosme was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane at 1800 UTC the next day ; it is at this time that the system attained its peak with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 15 inHg ) . Cosme tracked over ever cooler waters beginning at that time , causing the system to weaken quickly back to tropical storm strength . It turned west as a result of an intensifying ridge of high pressure to its north while continuing to deteriorate in organization . At 1800 UTC on July 18 , Cosme weakened to a tropical depression after crossing into the central Pacific , and by 1800 UTC on July 22 , no longer sustained enough organization to be considered a tropical cyclone . The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation early on July 25 . 
 Cosme was initially forecast to pass over Hawaii at tropical storm strength . Instead , a strong ridge of high pressure kept the system well south of the island . Outer rainbands produced several inches of rainfall , leading to minor flooding while simultaneously alleviating drought conditions . Winds gusts briefly reached tropical storm strength , though no damage was reported . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Dalila = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the eastern Pacific on July 17 . Tracking west @-@ northwest , the system acquired enough organization to be upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 22 , while positioned 460 mi ( 740 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico . Following formation , moderate northeasterly shear inhibited significant development , causing the system to remain a tropical depression for 48 hours . A mid @-@ level ridge over Mexico caused the system to turn northwest as shear began to decrease ; at 0000 UTC on July 24 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila . After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 995 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 39 inHg ) a day later , the storm tracked over progressively cool waters , causing it to weaken . At 0600 UTC on July 27 , Dalila weakened to a tropical storm , and by 1800 UTC , the system no longer retained enough organization to be considered a tropical cyclone . The remnant low tracked west , southwest , and eventually south prior to dissipation at 1200 UTC on July 30 . 
 Though the center of the storm remained offshore , outer rainbands led to heavy rainfall that triggered substantial flooding . In Michoacán , Dalila flooded ten municipalities with at least 15 in ( 380 mm ) of precipitation , destroying dozens of wooden structures . Heavy rains in Jalisco killed eleven , many of whom occurred in automobile crashes . Flood waters covered numerous roads , causing many accidents , while approximately 50 homes were damaged . Rough seas and heavy rain affected Baja California Sur , though no damage or fatalities were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Erick = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on July 16 . Tracking westward , intermittent bursts of deep convection occurred as it crossed the Leeward Islands on July 22 , but associated activity remained disorganized . The wave crossed Central America three days later , emerging into the eastern Pacific Ocean shortly thereafter . On July 28 , a broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis ; easterly shear , however , prevented thunderstorms from developing over the center . Convective activity increased by July 31 , leading to the formation of a tropical depression at 1200 UTC that day . Despite the unfavorable environment , satellite intensity estimates increased to tropical storm intensity , prompting the National Hurricane Center to upgrade the depression to such . After attained a peak intensity with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1004 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 65 inHg ) at 0600 UTC on August 1 , continued wind shear caused Erick to weaken to a tropical depression . The low @-@ level center became lost organization as it became elongated northeast to southwest on August 2 , leading to degeneration into a tropical wave by 0600 UTC . The remnants of the system dissipated six hours later . 
 = = = Hurricane Flossie = = = 
 An ill @-@ defined tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific on August 1 and steadily organized to attain tropical depression intensity eight days later . Within an environment of light shear , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie at 0000 UTC on August 9 and continued to organize to attain Category 1 hurricane intensity by 1200 UTC the following day as an eye became apparent on satellite . Continuing westward and crossing into the central Pacific basin , the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to its peak intensity with winds of 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949 mb ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 03 inHg ) at 0000 UTC on September 12 , while positioned roughly 980 mi ( 1575 km ) east @-@ southeast of the Big Island . Increased wind shear the next day caused Flossie to begin a slow weakening trend thereafter ; at 1200 UTC on September 14 , the system weakened to a Category 2 hurricane , and by 0600 UTC on September 15 , the cyclone was barely a Category 1 hurricane . Six hours later , it weakened to a tropical storm as the low @-@ level center became exposed on satellite . Flossie weakened to a tropical depression early on September 16 and dissipated by 1800 UTC . 
 In preparation for the cyclone , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Big Island . A tropical storm warning was subsequently issued for the same location , The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) sent 20 transportation , public works , and health experts to the region . Many schools were closed , including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College ; as a result , an estimated 26 @,@ 000 college students were sent home . As a weakening cyclone , Flossie produced light precipitation on the island of Hawaii . Large waves impacted south @-@ facing beaches while the maximum sustained wind observed reached 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) at South Point . No fatalities were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Gil = = = 
 A vigorous tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 16 . Characterized with abundant deep convection , the wave remained organization until it interacted with an upper @-@ level trough across the eastern Caribbean Sea a few days later . On August 26 , the wave split in two , with the northern portion leading the formation of a weak low in the Bay of Campeche and the southern portion continuing westward into the eastern Pacific . After the formation of deep convection over the center and associated convective bands , the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on August 29 . Though the circulation remained positioned on the northeast side of most thunderstorm activity , satellite intensity estimates supported tropical storm strength and it was upgraded to such accordingly . At 1200 UTC on August 30 , Gil attained its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1001 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 56 inHg ) . Shortly thereafter , increasing wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the system to steadily weaken ; at 0000 UTC on September 1 , the system deteriorated into a tropical depression , and by 1800 UTC the following afternoon , the system no longer displayed enough organization to be considered a cyclone . The remnant low continued westward and dissipated twelve hours later . 
 Heavy rainfall was reported throughout the state of Sinaloa . A total of 26 neighborhoods were flooded with up to 4 @.@ 9 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) of water in the town of Culiacán , while a 14 @-@ year @-@ old boy was swept away by a swollen river . 
 = = = Hurricane Henriette = = = 
 A poorly organized tropical wave moved into the eastern Pacific on August 29 and quickly developed into a tropical depression by 0600 UTC the following day . Within an environment of low wind shear , the depression intensified into a tropical storm , acquiring the name Henriette , at 1200 UTC on August 31 . Moving west @-@ northwest around a ridge positioned over inland Mexico , the center passed narrowly offshore after producing squally weather along the coastline . The system moved westward while continuing to intensify , becoming a Category 1 hurricane at 0600 UTC on September 4 and subsequently attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mb ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 71 inHg ) six hours later . An approaching upper @-@ level trough caused Henriette to turn northwest later that day , moving it ashore near San Jose del Cabo , Mexico at 2100 UTC as a minimal hurricane . After crossing Baja California Sur , Henriette weakened to a tropical storm and made a second landfall near Guaymas , Mexico . The system moved inland and quickly weakened , dissipating by 1200 UTC on September 6 . 
 The hardest hit city by Henriette was Acapulco , where heavy rains led to rockslides and mudslides that killed six . In Sonora , the hurricane damaged thousands of structures and killed four , two of whom off the coast . Farther northwest , a woman died while attempting to surf waves off the coast of Baja California Sur . Heavy rains stranded many cars while causing rivers to overflow , flooding communities . Damage totaled to $ 275 million ( 2007 MXN ; $ 25 million ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Ivo = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on September 1 and continued westward until reaching the eastern Pacific fifteen days later . A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September 16 as convective activity organized , and by 0600 UTC on September 18 , the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression . Convective bands began to form near the center a few hours later , leading to an improved satellite presentation overall . Tracking west @-@ northwestward as a result of the mid @-@ level ridge , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000 UTC on September 19 . Turning northwest , a well @-@ defined eye became visible on satellite , prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category 1 hurricane 24 hours later . With an area of deep convection near the center , the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 06 inHg ) at 0000 UTC on September 21 . Westerly flow associated with a large upper @-@ level low began to undercut the outflow of Ivo , and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours . The convective pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear , and despite a brief burst of convection , the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000 UTC on September 23 . Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward , and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly . The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction . 
 Initially , some forecasts predicted the storm would strike the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm ; a tropical storm watch was briefly issued from Sante Fe to Cabo San Lucas accordingly . Over 100 shelters were opened in the municipalities of Los Cabos , La Paz and Comondú , respectively . In all , Ivo contributed to heavy rainfall across Baja California Sur ; however , damage was not reported . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Thirteen @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 27 and reached the eastern Pacific on September 7 . Tracking westward , little development occurred until September 18 , when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase . Following visible satellite trends , the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on September 19 , while located about 1 @,@ 200 mi ( 1930 km ) west @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Baja California . In an environment of cool ocean temperatures and stable air , the depression failed to organize as it turned west @-@ northwest . Associated deep convection dissipated , leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000 UTC on September 20 . Performing a slow counter @-@ clockwise loop , the remnant low dissipated five days later . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Juliette = = = 
 The formation of Tropical Storm Juliette can be traced back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September 12 . After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later , it entered the eastern Caribbean , becoming steadily better defined . Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September 22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter . A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September 27 and convection steadily increased ; around 0000 UTC on September 19 , the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression . Twelve hours later , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette . Turning northwest as a result of an upper @-@ level trough , the system attained its peak with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 44 inHg ) at 1200 UTC on September 30 . Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter , causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000 UTC on October 2 . Twelve hours later , the system degenerated into a remnant low . The low meandered several hundred miles off the coast of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October 5 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Kiko = = = 
 A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa and moved westward across the Atlantic before entering the eastern Pacific on October 8 . Despite strong easterly wind shear , the system acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on October 15 . Within a broad cyclonic gyre , the system moved erratically , first drifting south then east @-@ northeast and eventually northwest . Early on October 16 , the system briefly intensified into a tropical storm as a convective band wrapped around the circulation , but continued strong shear caused associated convection to dissipate and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 1800 UTC . After intensifying back to a tropical storm the following day , a brief reprieve in harsh upper @-@ level winds allowed Kiko to reach its peak intensity with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 27 inHg ) . An increase in southerly shear and entrance into a more stable airmass caused the system to weaken to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on October 23 ; the system degenerated into a remnant low 24 hours later . The remnant low tracked west before turning north and eventually dissipated early on October 27 . 
 Beginning early on October 18 , Kiko was forecast to strike Mexico at tropical storm intensity and cyclone advisories were issued accordingly . However , a building mid @-@ level ridge of high pressure over inland Mexico was then forecast to cause the center of circulation to pass just offshore . Though no damage was reported in association with the cyclone , rough seas created by Kiko capsized a ship with thirty people on @-@ board ; two were found still alive , fifteen bodies were recovered , and nine were reported missing .

 = Vengeance ( 2006 ) = 
 Vengeance ( 2006 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , which took place on June 25 , 2006 , at the Charlotte Bobcats Arena in Charlotte , North Carolina . It was the sixth annual Vengeance event . Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card . The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before , during , and after the event were planned by WWE 's script writers . The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand : a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner . 
 The card featured eight televised matches , including two main events which resulted in Rob Van Dam defeating Edge to retain the WWE Championship and D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) ( Triple H and Shawn Michaels ) defeating Spirit Squad ( Kenny , Johnny , Mitch , Nicky , and Mikey ) in a 5 @-@ on @-@ 2 Handicap match . One bout was featured on the undercard . In which John Cena defeated Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match , which featured superstars from the Raw and ECW brands at ringside . 
 Vengeance grossed over $ 400 @,@ 000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 6 @,@ 800 and received 320 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys , which helped WWE increase its pay @-@ per @-@ view revenue by $ 21 @.@ 6 million compared to the previous year . When the event was released on DVD , it reached the number one position on Billboard 's DVD Sales Chart . The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event a 6 @.@ 5 out 10 stars , higher than the 2005 event rating of 6 out 10 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The event featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots and storylines . Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension @-@ building events , which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . All wrestlers belonged to the Raw brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program , the other two being SmackDown ! and ECW . 
 The main rivalry heading into Vengeance was between WWE Champion and ECW World Champion Rob Van Dam who defending the WWE Championship against Edge in a singles match . The buildup to the match began on the television premiere of ECW on Sci Fi , in which Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship ( which later become simply known as ECW World Championship ) by Paul Heyman , thus making Van Dam a double champion , by holding both the ECW and WWE Championships . Van Dam 's celebration was then interrupted by Edge and his girlfriend Lita . Edge , who was number one contender for the title , informed Van Dam that they both had a lot in common , referring to them being both Money in the Bank winners and successfully becoming WWE Champions . Edge concluded with giving Van Dam some kind words , in which afterwards he performed a Spear on Van Dam . On the June 19 episode of Raw , in retaliation Van Dam attacked Edge , moments after winning a match against Ric Flair . On June 20 episode of ECW , Rob Van Dam and Kurt Angle defeated Edge and Randy Orton in a tag team match when Van Dam pinned Edge after Five Star Frog Splash . 
 Another predominant rivalry scripted into Vengeance was between D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) Triple H and Shawn Michaels versus the Spirit Squad ( Kenny , Johnny , Mitch , Nicky , and Mikey ) in a 5 @-@ on @-@ 2 Handicap match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as five against two . The buildup to the match began after Backlash , Raw 's previous pay @-@ per @-@ view event , where The McMahons ( Vince and Shane ) defeated Michaels and " God " in a tag team match , with help from the Spirit Squad in a no disqualification match , a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified , allowing for weapons and outside interference . Throughout the weeks on Raw , Michaels got revenge on both Vince McMahon and the Spirit Squad , until the May 22 episode of Raw , where the Spirit Squad were scripted to injure Michaels ' left knee . Then , by orders of McMahon , Triple H was to " break Michaels ' skull " , with a sledgehammer . Triple H failed to do what McMahon ordered and instead attacked the Spirit Squad , thus turning into a fan favorite . Two weeks later , McMahon booked Triple H in a gauntlet match , consisting of two wrestlers beginning the match , and replacing whenever one is eliminated , with the last person standing being named the winner , against the Spirit Squad . In the match , Kenny grabbed a steel chair and inserted the chair on Triple H 's left knee , similar to what the group did to Michaels . Mitch , who was the only member not participating in the match , was thrown out from the backstage curtain by Michaels . Following this , he joined Triple H in the ring as they began to beat down the four members of the group . This saw Michaels and Triple H reform D @-@ Generation X since their teased reunion in 2002 . That same night , McMahon scheduled the Spirit Squad and D @-@ Generation X in a 5 @-@ on @-@ 2 handicap tag team match . On the June 19 episode of Raw , DX marked their return , when the duo humiliated the Spirit Squad as DX dumped green slime onto the group and embarrassed the team afterwards , by beating them . 
 One of the featured matches was between John Cena versus Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match , a standard match with the exception that the ring is surrounded by a group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules . On the television debut of ECW on Sci Fi on June 13 , a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge . Edge , who stormed through the ECW crowd , was attacked by Cena , who cost Cena the WWE Championship at ECW 's One Night Stand , and written into the storyline , sought revenge against Edge . Following the attack , Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious , after Heyman awarded the pinfall win to Van Dam at One Night Stand . Following the attack , Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at Raw the following week . The following week on Raw , Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar , Balls Mahoney , who was booked to face Cena in a singles match . The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit . After the match , Cena was attacked by ECW superstar Sabu , who in the premiere of ECW on Sci Fi won a 10 @-@ man Extreme Battle Royal , a multi @-@ competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner , where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a singles match . Sabu assaulted Cena in which he performed a leg drop on Cena , diving onto him and putting Cena through the Raw announcers ' table . The following night on an episode of ECW on Sci Fi , Cena showed up in the ECW locker room , where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme lumberjack match , for which Sabu accepted .

 Before the event went live on pay @-@ per @-@ view , Val Venis defeated Rob Conway in a dark match . 
 = = = Preliminary matches = = = 
 The first televised match was a standard wrestling match between Randy Orton and Kurt Angle . In the early stages both competitors took the advantage over one another . Angle controlled most of the match , as Orton tried to avoid Angle 's assaults . Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron , but did not perform the move . This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor . Mid @-@ way in the match , Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle 's head to drive it over his shoulders , but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle . Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle , leaving it exposed . Following this , Angle began performing a series of belly to back waist lock suplexes on Orton . Angle then applied the ankle lock hold . Orton , however , flipped over and sent Angle face @-@ first into the exposed turnbuckle . As he turned around , Orton performed the RKO , and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory . 
 The next match was between Umaga and Eugene . Before the match got underway , Eugene invited Jim Duggan , Doink the Clown , and Kamala down to ringside . Umaga , who stood at 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) and weighed 350 pounds ( 160 kg ) , used his body size to his advantage as he squashed , or easily and quickly performed moves on , Eugene . The match concluded with Umaga performing the Samoan Spike , a high speed thumb thrust to the throat of Eugene . Umaga pinned Eugene to win the match . After the match , Umaga attacked Jim Duggan and Doink the Clown . 
 The next match that followed was a Two out of three falls match , a match where not one , but two , decisions have to be won by a wrestler before the match is officially over , between Mick Foley and Ric Flair . Foley gained the advantage after he bended Flair forward and hooked each arm behind Flair 's back , tucked his head under one of Foley 's arms , and then fell back to pull Flair down flat on his face . Foley then began to taunt Flair and took out Mr. <unk> , a dirty sock puppet , dressed like Flair . Foley controlled most of the match , until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock , a signature move of Flair 's , but Flair countered it with an inside cradle over Foley to win the first fall . The second match began , frustrated in losing the first match , Foley grabbed a trash can from under the ring and brought it to the ring to hit Flair with it . But , Flair avoided being hit , as he tripped Foley to apply the figure four leglock . The result of the match , saw Foley get disqualified when he hit Flair with the trash can . The referee awarded the win to Flair . After the match , Foley attacked Flair with a barb @-@ wired bat , leaving Flair busted open . 
 The fourth match was a standard match involving three wrestlers , termed as a Triple Threat match , for the WWE Intercontinental Championship , in which champion Shelton Benjamin defended the title against Carlito and Johnny Nitro . The match began with Carlito performing a springboard moonsault from the ring apron hitting both Nitro and Benjamin in the process . A spot in the match saw Carlito set up Nitro in a Tree of Woe , a move in which a wrestler suspends his opponent upside down on a turnbuckle , with the opponent 's back being up against it , Carlito stood on the turnbuckle , in which Benjamin followed by jumping up with Carlito . Nitro lifted Benjamin on his shoulders and threw him down , while Benjamin dropped Carlito , making both men hit the mat . Later in the match , Carlito performed a <unk> on Benjamin . Nitro , who was thrown out of the ring , returned and removed Carlito from making the cover on Benjamin . He instead covered Benjamin for the pinfall victory , thus becoming the new Intercontinental champion .

 The first main match was for the WWE Championship , in which champion Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita . In the beginning of the match , Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring . Van Dam , however , managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring , resulting in the two landing on the outside of the ring floor . Both men took the upper hand in the match , until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious . Edge took advantage , as Lita gave him the title . Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title , but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title , resulting in hitting Edge 's face . Edge , however , got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam , while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner . Edge went for the shoulder block takedown , but Van Dam moved out of the way , resulting in Edge to crash head @-@ first onto the chair . Capitalizing on the situation , Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge , which he followed with a cover and a pinfall , thus retaining the WWE Championship . 
 The sixth match was a singles match between Kane versus Impostor Kane . The match began with Impostor Kane executing a sidewalk slam on Kane , a move in which a wrestler stands side @-@ to @-@ side and slightly behind with the opponent , and reaches around the opponent 's torso with his near arm across the opponent 's chest and under both arms and places the other arm under the victim 's legs . The Impostor tried to grab and lift Kane by the throat and slam him down into the mat , termed as a chokeslam , but Kane countered with driving Impostor Kane 's head onto the wrestling mat . The match concluded with Impostor Kane performing a chokeslam on Kane and pinning him for the pinfall victory . 
 The seventh match was the Extreme lumberjack match between Sabu and John Cena . Before the match began , the ECW and Raw superstars made their way to ringside to take their place as lumberjacks . The match quickly began with Cena throwing Sabu out of the ring onto the Raw lumberjacks , in which they assaulted Sabu and threw him back in the ring . Sabu would later get the upper hand and throw Cena out onto the ECW lumberjacks , at ringside . Throughout the match , Sabu took the advantage over Cena as he performed a somersault leg drop , driving a steel chair onto Cena 's face . Cena got the upper hand when he was able to counter a flying crossbody attempt by Sabu . Mid @-@ way in the match , the ECW and Raw lumberjacks started brawling at ringside . At ringside , the ECW lumberjacks began their assault on Cena , after he was hit with a steel chair by Sabu . They laid his head on a table , in which Sabu attempted to perform a high @-@ flying maneuver . The Raw superstars , however , gave Cena the upper hand to hit Sabu with a kendo stick in mid @-@ air . Back in the ring , Cena lifted Sabu over his shoulders and threw him down on a table that was at ringside to execute the FU . Following this , Sabu was thrown back into the ring where Cena applied the STFU , a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent , in which Sabu submitted to and giving Cena the win . 
 The last match on the card was the five @-@ on @-@ two handicap match between D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) versus the Spirit Squad . During the beginning of the match , Michaels quickly took control of Mitch , before tagging in Triple H. Johnny was tagged in the match , after encouragement from his team , to face off against Triple H. The match was then controlled by the Spirit Squad , after Johnny performed an enzuigiri on Michaels . Nicky , who was tagged in , distracted the referee , allowing the other squad members to pull Michaels out of the ring and hit Michaels with a steel chair . Back in the ring , the assault continued , as each member took the upper hand over him . Michaels came back after countering a double team maneuver and drove both Nicky and Mikey 's heads to the mat . Michaels then tagged Triple H into the match . The match concluded with Triple H performing a Pedigree and Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music . Both Triple H and Michaels got the pinfall victory respectively over the Spirit Squad . After the match , the three remaining members tried to attack DX , but were unsuccessful in doing so .

 On the July 3 episode of Raw , a triple threat match was booked between Rob Van Dam , Edge , and John Cena for the WWE title , after Van Dam made the stipulation . Edge , as part of scripted events , defeated both Van Dam and Cena to become the new WWE champion , after pinning Van Dam . The following night on ECW on Sci Fi , Van Dam lost the ECW title to The Big Show , after the Big Show received assistance from Paul Heyman , who declined to make the three @-@ count for Van Dam , but instead gave the pinfall to the Big Show . Later on WWE 's official website , it was announced that Heyman suspended Van Dam for 30 days without giving a reason . This angle was written after WWE suspended Van Dam for his recent drug possession arrest . 
 The following month at Saturday Night 's Main Event , a title match was scheduled between Edge and Cena . Cena won the match by disqualification , after Lita interfered on behalf of Edge . A singles match was booked between Edge and Cena for the WWE title at Summerslam , with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself , he would have lost the WWE title . At SummerSlam , Edge retained the title after he hit Cena with a pair of brass knuckles , this occurred when the referee was not looking . 
 In a July episode of Saturday Night 's Main Event , DX defeated the Spirit Squad in a 5 @-@ on @-@ 2 Elimination match . The McMahons ( Vince and Shane ) continued their feud with DX , as they became frustrated with DX 's antics . McMahon scheduled a tag team match , where he would team up with Shane to take on DX at SummerSlam in August . Before the match got underway at SummerSlam , the Spirit Squad , Mr. Kennedy , William Regal , Finlay , and The Big Show all interfered on behalf of the McMahons . DX , however , won the match .

 The red @-@ headed myzomela or red @-@ headed honeyeater ( Myzomela erythrocephala ) is a passerine bird of the honeyeater family , Meliphagidae , found in Australia , Indonesia , and Papua New Guinea . Three subspecies are recognised , with the nominate race M. erythrocephala erythrocephala distributed around the tropical coastline of Australia . 
 At 12 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) , it is a small honeyeater with a short tail and relatively long down @-@ curved bill . It is sexually dimorphic and the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey @-@ brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey @-@ brown plumage . Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests . It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy , darting from flower to flower and sallying for insects . It calls constantly as it feeds . While little has been documented on the red @-@ headed myzomela ’ s breeding behaviour , it is recorded as building a small cup @-@ shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval , white eggs with small red blotches . 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela is widely distributed across the northern coastlines of Australia , though it is not abundant within this range . While the IUCN lists one sub @-@ species as being near threatened , as a whole the widespread range means that its conservation is of least concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Myzomela erythrocephala was first described by John Gould in 1840 , from specimens located in King Sound , north Western Australia . As well as the nominate race M. erythrocephala erythrocephala , two additional subspecies are recognised : M. erythrocephala infuscata named by William Alexander Forbes in 1879 , and M. erythrocephala dammermani described by Friederich Wilhelm Sieber in 1928 . Some taxonomic authorities recognize M. erythrocephala dammermani as a separate species , the Sumba myzomela ( Myzomela dammermani ) . 
 It is a member of the genus Myzomela which includes two other Australian species , the scarlet myzomela of eastern Australia , and the dusky myzomela of northern Australia . It belongs to the honeyeater family Meliphagidae . A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found it to be the next closest relative to a smaller group consisting of the scarlet and cardinal <unk> , although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed . Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae ( pardalotes ) , Acanthizidae ( Australian warblers , scrubwrens , thornbills , etc . ) , and the Maluridae ( Australian fairy @-@ wrens ) in a large Meliphagoidea superfamily . Because the red @-@ headed honeyeater occurs on many offshore islands and appears to be an effective water @-@ crosser , it has been hypothesised that north @-@ western Australia was the primary centre of origin for the Myzomela erythrocephala subspecies . 
 The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words <unk> " to suckle " and meli " honey " , and refers to the bird 's <unk> habits , while erythrocephala is from the Greek <unk> " red " and a combining form of the Greek kephale " head " . Other common names are mangrove red @-@ headed honeyeater , mangrove redhead , and blood bird . 
 = = Description = = 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela is a distinctive small honeyeater with a compact body , short tail and relatively long down @-@ curved bill . It averages 12 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) , with a wingspan of 17 – 19 centimetres ( 6 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) and a weight of 8 grams ( 0 @.@ 28 oz ) . The birds exhibit sexual dimorphism , with males being slightly larger and much more brightly coloured than the females . 
 The adult male has a dark red head , neck , lower back and rump ; the red is glossy , reflecting bright light . The rest of the upper body is a blackish @-@ brown , and the upper breast and under @-@ body a light brownish @-@ grey . The bill is black or blackish @-@ brown , and there is a distinct black <unk> stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring . The adult female 's head and neck are grey @-@ brown with a pink @-@ red tint to the forehead and chin . The rest of the female 's upper body is grey @-@ brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and under @-@ body . One study suggested a connection between the female 's bill colour and breeding status , with birds that had a horn @-@ coloured ( grey ) bill also having well @-@ developed brood patches . Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the lower mandible . It seems that males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months , and take a similar period to come into full colour . The subspecies are similar in appearance to the nominate race however M. e. dammermani is slightly smaller than the other subspecies and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band and M. e. infuscata has red extending from the rump onto the back . 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela has a range of contact calls and songs that are primarily metallic or scratchy . Its song is an abrupt tchwip @-@ tchwip @-@ tchwip @-@ tchwip with a slightly softer swip @-@ swip @-@ swip @-@ swip contact call and a scolding <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela in Australia is distributed across the tropical coastlines of Western Australia , the Northern Territory and Queensland . It inhabits coastal areas of the Kimberley and various offshore islands in Western Australia , and is similarly distributed in the Northern Territory , including Melville Island and the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands . It is widespread around the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York Peninsula . M. e. dammermani is found on the island of Sumba in the eastern Indonesian Lesser Sunda Islands , and M. e. infuscata at scattered sites in West Papua and in south Papua New Guinea . 
 Although the red @-@ headed myzomela is widely distributed , it is not abundant within its range . The largest recorded population was 5 @.@ 5 birds per hectare or 2 @.@ 2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory . The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid @-@ dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and the flowering of <unk> australis . 
 The species ' movements are poorly understood , variously described as resident , nomadic or migratory . Population numbers have been reported as fluctuating in some areas with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred mangrove and Melaleuca food trees , and there is some indication that the birds can travel more widely . A single bird was recaptured after being banded nearly five years earlier , 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) from the original banding site , and the species ' occupation of a large number of offshore islands suggests that the red @-@ headed honeyeater is effective at crossing distances over water . 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas , especially thickets of Rhizophora , Bruguiera and Avicennia bordering islands or in river deltas , but it often also occurs in paperbark thickets fringing the mangroves such as those of the <unk> ( Melaleuca <unk> ) . It is a mangrove specialist , an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared . The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites , and they supply the majority of the species ' needs for most of the year . 
 In Australia , mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline , accommodating birds specialized for the habitat . Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests , reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores , and it marks the southern limit of the red @-@ headed myzomela in Western Australia .

 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela is arboreal , feeding at flowers and among the outer foliage in the crowns of mangroves and other flowering trees . It is very active when feeding , darting from flower to flower and sallying for insects . It probes flowers for nectar with its long curved bill , catches insects on the wing and gleans insects from leaves . It predominately feeds on mangrove species , and in north western Australia is the major pollinator of Bruguiera <unk> , however it also feeds in paperbarks and other coastal forests and has been recorded feeding in cultivated bottlebrush and Grevillea in Darwin gardens . 
 = = = Social behaviour = = = 
 While the social organisation of the red @-@ headed honeyeater is relatively unknown , it is reported as being usually solitary or found in pairs , though it has been described as forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters , and other mangrove @-@ feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white @-@ eye . It is an inquisitive bird , and readily responds to <unk> coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder . It calls throughout the day when feeding , and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees . 
 The red @-@ headed myzomela actively defends food trees , engaging in aggressive bill @-@ wiping both in response to a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree . It is very antagonistic even towards its own species ; the males fight by grappling in mid @-@ air and falling close to the ground before disengaging . It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy , though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 There are few scientific reports on the breeding behaviour of the red @-@ headed myzomela , and little detail is available on the breeding season . A study of populations in the west Kimberley reported that the birds hold territories through much of the dry season and then disperse . The nest is built in the foliage of the mangroves , suspended by a rim from a small horizontal fork about 6 – 10 metres ( 20 – 33 ft ) above the ground or water . The nest is small and cup @-@ shaped , and built from small pieces of bark , leaves , plant fibre and sometimes seaweed , bound together with spider web and lined with finer material . It is , on average , 5 @.@ 4 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter and 3 @.@ 7 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) deep . 
 Measuring 16 by 12 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 63 by 0 @.@ 47 in ) , the eggs are oval , smooth and lustreless white , with small spots or blotches of red on the larger end . Clutch size is reported to be two or three eggs . While there is no reliable information on incubation and feeding , it is believed that both parents are active in caring for the young . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 M. e. erythrocephala is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN , because the population is widespread , however Myzomela erythrocephala infuscata is listed as near threatened . The Australian population of this subspecies is confined to three small islands with a combined area of about 100 square kilometres ( 39 sq mi ) . There is no immediate threat to the red @-@ headed myzomela except the risk posed to low islands by rising sea levels , however it has been recommended that community @-@ based ecotourism on the tropical coast be promoted , as it could lead to monitoring of sub @-@ populations and habitat by visiting birdwatchers and local rangers .

 F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon is a survival horror first @-@ person shooter developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment . It was released on October 17 , 2005 , for Microsoft Windows , and ported by Day 1 Studios to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 . <unk> Studios has released two expansion packs , F.E.A.R. Extraction Point in October 2006 , and F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate in November 2007 . A direct sequel titled F.E.A.R. 2 : Project Origin , was released in February 2009 , and a second sequel , <unk> , was released in June 2011 , though it was developed by Day 1 Studios ( now known as <unk> Chicago @-@ Baltimore ) , not by Monolith Productions . 
 The game 's story revolves around a supernatural phenomenon , which F.E.A.R. — a fictional special forces team — is called to contain . The player assumes the role of F.E.A.R. ' s Point Man , who possesses superhuman reflexes , and must uncover the secrets of a paranormal menace in the form of a little girl . 
 F.E.A.R. was well received by critics , scoring 89 % on Game Rankings , and The New York Times calling it " as thrilling and involving as Half @-@ Life . " A " Director 's Edition " DVD version of the game was also released . The DVD included a " Making of " documentary , a director 's commentary , a short live @-@ action prequel and the exclusive first episode of the promotional P.A.N.I.C.S. machinima . A related Dark Horse comic book was also packaged with the DVD . Along with the Director 's Edition , F.E.A.R. Gold Edition was released . Gold Edition included the Director 's Edition and Extraction Point . F.E.A.R. Platinum Edition features the original game and two expansion packs . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 F.E.A.R. simulates combat from a first person perspective . The protagonist 's body is fully present , allowing the player to see his or her character 's torso and feet while looking down . Within scripted sequences , when rising from a lying position or fast @-@ roping from a helicopter for example , or climbing ladders , the hands and legs of the protagonist can be seen performing the relevant actions . 
 A prominent gameplay element is " reflex time " , which slows down the game world while still allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds . This effect is used to simulate the character 's superhuman reflexes . Reflex time is represented by stylized visual effects , such as bullets in flight that cause air distortion or interact with the game 's particle effects . F.E.A.R. lead designer Craig Hubbard stated that Monolith Productions ' primary goal was " to make combat as intense as the tea house shootout at the beginning of John Woo 's Hard @-@ Boiled . " He continued on to say that " defeat [ ing ] ... enemies ... with style " was crucial to this goal and that reflex time plays a large role in " mak [ ing ] the player feel like they are an action movie hero . " 
 The game contains weapons based on non @-@ fictional firearms , such as pistols , assault rifles , and submachine guns , as well as entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons . Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type , accuracy , range , fire rate , damage , and bulkiness . The latter characteristic is crucial , as more powerful / specialized weapons tend to be more cumbersome and slow the player 's maneuvers . Unlike other games of the genre where lighter / smaller weapons tend to be useless , F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve , so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations . Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for " ... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function " , rather than " ... just going with a bunch of real @-@ world submachine guns and assault rifles . " F.E.A.R. ' s heads @-@ up display crosshair 's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement , aim , and the weapon in use . The player may carry only three firearms at a time ; thus , strategy is required when using and selecting weapons . 
 Compared to other shooters where melee is usually a last resort , F.E.A.R. ' s melee is a viable instant @-@ kill alternative for taking down enemies . The stocks of all firearms can be used in close combat . Lighter weapons , while being less powerful , allow the player to move around more quickly , increasing their chances of melee . Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon , which also allows them to engage in hand @-@ to @-@ hand attacks with maneuvers including punches , kicks , and slides . 
 F.E.A.R. ' s artificial intelligence allows computer @-@ controlled characters a large degree of action . Enemies can duck to travel under <unk> , jump through windows , vault over railings , climb ladders , and push over large objects to create cover . Various opponents may act as a team , taking back routes to surprise the player , using suppressive fire or taking cover if under fire . The game 's artificial intelligence is often cited as being highly advanced , using an architecture known as Goal Oriented Action Planning ( <unk> ) and its efficiency helped the game win GameSpot 's " 2005 Best AI Award " , and earn the # 2 ranking on <unk> 's " Most Influential AI Games " . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 F.E.A.R. ' s multiplayer component includes mainstay gameplay modes , such as deathmatch , team deathmatch , capture the flag , and last man standing . " Control " and " Conquer All " gametypes were later added through a patch . Some gametypes in F.E.A.R. ' s multiplayer use the " reflex time " effect : SlowMo deathmatch , SlowMo team deathmatch , and SlowMo capture the flag . Only one player can use / carry the reflex power @-@ up ; when fully charged they can activate it and give themselves ( and the rest of their team if applicable ) a speed advantage over opposing players . However , the one carrying the power @-@ up will have a bluish glow , and they will show up on a foe 's HUD . 
 On August 17 , 2006 , F.E.A.R. ' s multiplayer component was retitled F.E.A.R. Combat and made available for free download . <unk> of F.E.A.R. Combat and owners of F.E.A.R. ' s retail edition may play together online . On December 19 , 2012 Gamespy Industries announced the end of its Gamespy Open Program , which ended F.E.A.R. Combat 's online multiplayer functionality . 
 The PC version of the game uses the PunkBuster program to prevent cheating . However , in December 2007 , Even Balance discontinued PunkBuster support for F.E.A.R. in favor of the second expansion , F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate . While PunkBuster @-@ enabled servers will still check for and protect against known cheats , the program will no longer automatically update . Because of this , many players with an outdated version of PunkBuster are unable to play in PunkBuster @-@ enabled servers without being automatically kicked from the game . 
 The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions , just like the PC edition , only have online multiplayer . There is no split @-@ screen local play .
