 Iyo Railway bus service runs up and down the peninsula , to and from Yawatahama , and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama . However , commuter buses run infrequently and , due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town 's neighborhoods , bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas . Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry . 
 There are no trains in Ikata . The closest station is the JR Yawatahama Station on the <unk> Line .

 = = = Etymology of name = = = 
 The origin of the name Ikata is unclear and there are several competing theories . 
 It may have come from <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " a place with small houses or shacks " . 
 Ika can be found in the names of places surrounded by mountains or located in foothills ; ta can mean " land " . Ikata could therefore be " a place by the mountains " . 
 In the Ainu language , ika means " to pass through the mountains and cross the land " . However , the Ainu are thought to have had little influence as far south as Shikoku . 
 = = = Food = = = 
 Ikata is known for its <unk> and mikan juice . More than 20 different varieties of mikan are grown in Ikata . Old Ikata also has a very old sake brewing tradition that dates back to the Edo Period , with several <unk> <unk> in the local area . There is even a museum dedicated to the Ikata Tōji . 
 The Seto area produces vegetables such as the bright @-@ purple <unk> potato , and also catches baby sardines called <unk> ( <unk> ) . Misaki has a strong fishing tradition , producing lots of horse mackerel ( <unk> , <unk> ) and mackerel ( <unk> , saba ) . Four Misaki Fishing Co @-@ op products are part of the Ehime " With Love " ( 『 愛 』 <unk> , " Ai " aru ) brand : Horse mackerel , mackerel , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , and abalone ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 One Ikata specialty cuisine is <unk> ( <unk> ) , a tempura @-@ fried patty of pressed white fish meat and vegetables . Other variations include <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is the same but fried and breaded like <unk> , and jako @-@ croquette ( <unk> , jako @-@ <unk> ) which is prepared like a croquette . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 Residents of Ikata speak the Iyo dialect of Japanese , which is similar in many respects to the Hiroshima dialect .

For example , Nani <unk> no ? ( <unk> ？ " What are you doing ? " in standard Japanese ) becomes Nani <unk> ga ? ( <unk> ？ ) in Iyo dialect . 
 Ikata 's largest town celebration in late summer , the Kinahaiya Ikata Festival , is another example of the Iyo dialect — <unk> ya ( <unk> ) literally means " come on over " ( <unk> yo <unk> in standard Japanese ) .

 Every September a handful of local men and women gather along the Ōku beach to sing and perform this dance , with the purpose of placating the dead spirit of a woman who is said to have been washed ashore in Ōku long , long ago . 
 October 
 Autumn Festival ( <unk> , aki @-@ matsuri ) 
 Each main region of Ikata holds its own separate Autumn Festival . Misaki 's is perhaps the most spectacular of the three . The main attraction is the battle between the Ox Demon ( <unk> , <unk> ) and the 4 @-@ meter tall Four Drums ( <unk> , <unk> ) , which are two ceremonial mikoshi floats carried by the young local men and women . Participants compete in repeatedly pulling the floats up along a giant 10 @-@ meter scaffold , then trying to drop theirs on top of the other . 
 3 important deities and demons make their appearance at most of Ikata 's autumn festivals . 
 1 . Ox Demon ( <unk> , Ushi Oni ) 
 The tradition of the Ox Demon and festivals in Ikata dates back to the middle of Edo Japan ( 1800s ) . It is said that that Ox Demon and the voices of the men yelling <unk> 、 <unk> 、 <unk> 、 <unk> ( <unk> , en , en , e ~ n ) keeps away the evil spirits from the Portable Shrines ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) as they make their way through the center of town . 
 <unk> Lion ( <unk> , Karashishi ) 
 The Karashishi is most notably found in Japan at the entrance of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward @-@ off bad spirits or welcome good spirits . The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to the beat of the drum of a young boy . Ikata 's performers are especially well @-@ known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance . 
 <unk> Deer ( <unk> , Itsu <unk> ) 
 Although the origins of the five @-@ deer dance are unknown , it is said that its traditions were brought over from Uwajima during the [ <unk> ] ( <unk> ) period .

 Relations with Ikata 's only overseas sister city , Red Wing , Minnesota , USA , originally began as an exchange of technical knowledge and skills between engineers at the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant and Red Wing 's Prairie Island plant . The two towns became official sister cities in August 1995 . 
 Since then , Ikata has put much effort into expanding the horizons of its residents through English language education via the JET Programme , and an annual international student exchange with Red Wing . Beginning in 1995 , Ikata middle school students have traveled almost yearly to Red Wing for home stays of one to two weeks , and students from Red Wing likewise come to Ikata to learn about life in rural Japan . 
 Ikata 's high school , Misaki High School , maintains an exchange program with Australia . 
 Ikata has two sister cities , both of which also have nuclear power plants : 
 Tomari , Hokkaidō , Japan , since February 1998 
 Red Wing , Minnesota , United States , since August 1995 
 = = Politics = = 
 Ikata experienced significant political turbulence leading up to and immediately following the April 1 , 2005 merger with Seto and Misaki . 
 To begin with , multiple potential merger plans were put forth , one of which was for all of the contiguous Nishiuwa District towns ( Misaki , Seto , Old Ikata , and Honai ) to merge . However , when Honai announced that it would merge with the nearby city of Yawatahama , polls indicated that Misaki residents still preferred to merge with Honai and Yawatahama , rather than Seto and Old Ikata , despite their being discontiguous ( a Misaki @-@ Honai @-@ Yawatahama merger would make Misaki an exclave ) . Ultimately this was found to be impractical , and the Misaki @-@ Seto @-@ Ikata merger was approved with some grumbling over the naming of the new town . 
 Once the merger was decided upon , suggestions for the new town 's name were solicited from the residents . Despite the many other reasonable suggestions and the seeming unfairness toward Seto and Misaki , the " new " name was chosen to be " Ikata . " 
 Following the merger a heated mayoral race was held , with 11 members of incumbent <unk> Nakamoto 's campaign arrested for electoral fraud . Challenger Yoshihisa Hatanaka ultimately won , only to be arrested in February 2006 for corruption relating to government construction contracts . He resigned soon thereafter . 
 A second race was held in April 2006 , with Kazuhiko Yamashita defeating rival Kiyohiko <unk> by only 90 votes . Voter turnout was 87 @.@ 43 % . 
 There has been and remains political resistance among some Ikata residents to the nuclear power plant . 
 The most recent mayoral election took place on April 13 , 2014 which found incumbent Yamashita in seat for his third term as mayor . 85 @.@ 33 % of the total 9 @,@ 190 eligible voters turning out to cast a ballot . Mr. Yamashita garnered a total of 3 @,@ 266 of the electorate while a certain Mr. Yoshihisa Hatanaka ( see above ) came in second place with a total of 2 @,@ 399 votes .

 = Eurasian blackcap = 
 The Eurasian blackcap ( Sylvia <unk> ) usually known simply as the blackcap , is a common and widespread typical warbler . It has mainly olive @-@ grey upperparts and pale grey underparts , and differences between the five subspecies are small . Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head , black in the male and reddish @-@ brown in the female . The male 's typical song is a rich musical warbling , often ending in a loud high @-@ pitched crescendo , but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas , such as valleys in the Alps . The blackcap 's closest relative is the garden warbler , which looks quite different but has a similar song . 
 The blackcap breeds in much of Europe , western Asia and northwestern Africa , and its preferred habitat is mature deciduous woodland . The male holds a territory when breeding , which is defended against garden warblers as well as other blackcaps . The nest is a neat cup , built low in brambles or scrub , and the clutch is typically 4 – 6 mainly buff eggs , which hatch in about 11 days . The chicks fledge in 11 – 12 days , but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest . The blackcap is a partial migrant ; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe , around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa . Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland . Insects are the main food in the breeding season , but , for the rest of the year , blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit . Garden birds also eat bread , fat and peanuts in winter . 
 Despite extensive hunting in Mediterranean countries and the natural hazards of predation and disease , the blackcap has been extending its range for several decades , and is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern . Its rich and varied song has led to it being described as the " mock nightingale " and it has featured in literature , films and music . In Messiaen 's opera Saint François d 'Assise , the saint is represented by themes based on the blackcap 's song . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Sylvia , the typical warblers , forms part of a large family of Old World warblers , the Sylviidae . The blackcap and its nearest relative , the garden warbler , are an ancient species pair which diverged very early from the rest of the genus at between 12 and 16 million years ago . In the course of time , these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera , with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in <unk> . These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat . The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn 's thrush @-@ babbler , both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera , <unk> and <unk> respectively . 
 The blackcap was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae of 1758 as Motacilla <unk> . The current genus name is from Modern Latin <unk> , a woodland sprite , related to <unk> , a wood . The species name , like the English name , refers to the male 's black cap . <unk> is from the Latin ater , black , and <unk> , hair ( of the head ) . 
 Fossils and subfossils of the blackcap have been found in a number of European countries ; the oldest , dated to 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 0 million years ago , are from the Early Pleistocene of Bulgaria . Fossils from France show that the Sylvia genus dates back at least 20 million years . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 The differences between subspecies are small , making subspecific boundaries hard to define , and the exact distribution of S. a. <unk> is unclear , since birds from northwest Africa may be of this form . About 2 % of male blackcaps on Madeira and the Azores are melanistic , with black plumage on the whole head and upper breast . Melanistic females are rarer , and are characterised by grey @-@ brown underparts . This dark morph has also been recorded from the Canary Islands , but not from Cape Verde . The melanistic birds were formerly sometimes considered to be a distinct subspecies , S. a. obscura . 
 = = Description = = 
 The blackcap is a mainly grey warbler with distinct male and female plumages . The nominate subspecies is about 13 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) long with a 7 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) wing length . The weight is typically 16 – 25 g ( 0 @.@ 56 – 0 @.@ 88 oz ) , but can be up to 31 g ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) for birds preparing to migrate . The adult male has olive @-@ grey upperparts , other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head . The underparts are light grey , becoming silvery white on the chin , throat and upper breast . The tail is dark grey , with an olive tint to the outer edge of each feather . The bill and long legs are grey , and the iris is reddish @-@ brown . The female resembles the male , but has a reddish @-@ brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts . Juveniles are similar to the female , but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge , and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone ; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts . This species is unmistakable ; other dark @-@ headed Sylvia species , such Sardinian and <unk> warblers have extensive black on the head instead of a small cap . They are also larger and have white edges on the tail . 
 Blackcaps have a complete moult in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration . Some birds , typically those migrating the greatest distances , have a further partial moult between December and March . Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage , starting earlier , but taking longer to complete , than the adults . Blackcaps breeding in the north of the range have an earlier and shorter post @-@ juvenile moult than those further south , and cross @-@ breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The male 's song is a rich musical warbling , often ending in a loud high @-@ pitched crescendo , which is given in bursts of up to 30 seconds . The song is repeated for about two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes , with a short pause before each repetition . In some geographically isolated areas , such as islands , peninsulas and valleys in the Alps , a simplified fluting song occurs , named the <unk> ( drawling ) song by the German ornithologists who first described it . The song 's introduction is like that of other blackcaps , but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes , as in a great tit 's call but more fluting . The main song is confusable with that of the garden warbler , but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species , more broken into discrete song segments , and less mellow . Both species have a quiet subsong , a muted version of the full song , which is even more difficult to separate . The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds , the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale . The main call is a hard tac @-@ tac , like stones knocking together , and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm , and a low @-@ pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler . 
 Male blackcaps will sometimes sing even when incubating , especially with the second brood . This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female . Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially , but start singing in January or February prior to their return north . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 The continental breeding range of the blackcap lies between the 14 – 30 ° July isotherms , and is occupied by the nominate subspecies , the other forms being restricted to islands or fringe areas in the Caucasus and eastern Iberia . Birds on the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands and in the milder west and south of the main Eurasian distribution often winter within the nesting range , but populations elsewhere are migratory . The blackcap is a leap @-@ frog migrant ; birds from the north of the breeding range travel furthest south , whereas Mediterranean breeders move much shorter distances . The wintering areas overlap with the breeding range , but also include extensive areas in West Africa , East Africa south to Lake Malawi , and further north in Ethiopia , South Sudan and Eritrea . The large majority of birds wintering in eastern Africa are of the southwest Asian race , S. a. <unk> . 
 There is a migratory divide in Europe at longitude 10 – 11 ° E. Birds to the west of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa , whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa . Cross @-@ breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled , the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time . Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria , on opposite sides of the migratory divide , demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined . Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap . Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously , and blackcaps and juvenile ( but not adult ) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s . Birds of both species are longer @-@ winged and lighter than in the past , suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards . 
 In recent decades , substantial numbers of central European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain , and , to a lesser extent , Ireland , where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor . Although the British climate is sub @-@ optimal , compensatory factors include the ready availability of food , ( particularly from bird tables ) , a shorter migration distance , and the avoidance of the Alps and the Sahara Desert . These wintering birds come from Germany , and isotope analysis ( which enables the wintering location to be determined ) showed that the German birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only among themselves , and do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa . This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean , and form pairs before the southern birds arrive . Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction , which would take them into the Bay of Biscay . 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 The blackcap 's main breeding habitat is mature deciduous woodland , with good scrub cover below the trees . Other habitats , such as parks , large gardens and overgrown hedges , are used as long as they meet the essential requirements of tall trees for <unk> and an established understory . Where other Sylvia warblers also breed , blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives , preferably those with a good canopy , such as pedunculate oak . In prime habitat , breeding densities reach 100 – 200 pairs per square kilometre ( 250 – 500 pairs per square mile ) in northern Europe , and 500 – 900 pairs per square kilometre ( 1 @,@ 250 – 2 @,@ 250 pairs per square mile ) in Italy . Densities are much lower in poorer habitats such as conifer forests . Breeding occurs in Europe at altitudes up to 2 @,@ 200 m ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) . 
 The preferred winter habitat around the Mediterranean is scrub and olive orchards , where densities approach the levels found in the best breeding areas . The British wintering population is atypical , with 95 % found in gardens , mostly in towns at altitudes below 100 m ( 330 ft ) . In Africa , habitats include cultivated land , acacia scrub , mangroves and forest , and these warblers are found at altitudes up to 3 @,@ 600 m ( 11 @,@ 800 ft ) in the east of the continent . Wintering birds wander in search of good fruit supplies , but often stay in good feeding areas , and return in subsequent winters . Migrants may occur in a wide variety of habitats , such as reed bed and fen , but show a preference for shrubland . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Territory = = = 
 When male blackcaps return to their breeding areas , they establish a territory . Adults that have previously bred return to the site they have used in previous summers , whereas inexperienced birds either wander until they find a suitable area , or establish a very large initial territory which contracts under pressure from neighbours . Territorial boundaries are established initially by loud singing , performed while the male displays with his crown raised , tail fanned and slow wingbeats . This display is followed , if necessary , by a chase , often leading to a fight . The typical territory size in a French study was 1 @.@ 12 hectares ( 2 @.@ 8 acres ) , but in insect @-@ rich tall maquis in Gibraltar , the average was only 0 @.@ 16 hectares ( 0 @.@ 40 acres ) . Females feed within a home range which may overlap other blackcap territories , and covers up to six times the area of the defended zone . 
 Sylvia warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics . Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same wood , yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap . Similar songs are a feature of the Sylvia warblers as a group , and it has been suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species . It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species , other than the blackcap and garden warbler , is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Blackcaps first breed when they are one year old , and are mainly monogamous , although both sexes may sometimes deviate from this . A male attracts a female to his territory through song and a display involving raising the black crown feathers , <unk> the tail , slow wingbeats , and a short flapping flight . He also builds one or more simple nests ( cock nests ) , usually near his <unk> . The final nest , which may be one of the cock nests or built from scratch , is a neat cup of roots , stems and grasses lined with fine material such as hair . The nest is typically 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) deep and 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) across , and is built in the cover of bramble , scrubs or trees . It is constructed mainly by the female , and may be up to 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) above the ground , although lower than 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) is more typical . The clutch is typically 4 – 6 eggs ( range 2 – 7 ) , which are usually buff with grey and brown blotches and a few dark brown spots . The average size of the egg is 19 @.@ 7 mm × 14 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 78 in × 0 @.@ 58 in ) . 
 The eggs are incubated for an average of 11 days ( range 10 – 16 ) . Both adults incubate , although only the female stays on the nest at night . The chicks are altricial , hatching naked and with closed eyes , and are fed by both parents . They fledge about 11 – 12 days after hatching , leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly . They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks . If the nest is threatened , the non @-@ incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet . A male blackcap may mob a potential predator , or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground . The blackcap normally raises just one brood , but second nestings are sometimes recorded , particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands ; triple brooding has been observed once , the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season . 
 Of eggs laid , 65 – 93 % hatch successfully , and 75 – 92 % of the chicks go on to fledge . The productivity ( young fledged per nest ) varies with location , level of predation and quality of habitat , but the national figure for the UK was 2 @.@ 5 . The adult annual survival rate is 43 % ( males 46 % , females 29 % ) , and 36 % of juveniles live through their first year . The typical life expectancy is two years , but the record is 13 years and 10 months for a bird in the Czech Republic . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The blackcap feeds mainly on insects during the breeding season , then switches to fruit in late summer , the change being triggered by an internal biological rhythm . When migrants arrive on their territories they initially take berries , pollen and nectar if there are insufficient insects available , then soon switch to their preferred diet . They mainly pick prey off foliage and twigs , but may occasionally hover , flycatch or feed on the ground . Blackcaps eat a wide range of invertebrate prey , although aphids are particularly important early in the season , and flies , beetles and caterpillars are also taken in large numbers . Small snails are swallowed whole , since the shell is a source of calcium for the bird 's eggs . Chicks are mainly fed soft @-@ bodied insects , fruit only being provided if invertebrates are scarce . 
 In July , the diet switches increasingly to fruit . The protein needed for egg @-@ laying and for the chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration . Aphids are still taken while they are available , since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed . Blackcaps eat a wide range of small fruit , and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp . This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe . The mistle thrush , which also favours that plant , is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds . Although any suitable fruit may be eaten , some have seasonal or local importance ; elder makes up a large proportion of the diet of northern birds preparing for migration , and energy @-@ rich olives and <unk> are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean . 
 The German birds wintering in British gardens rely on provided food , and the major items are bread and fat , each making up around 20 % of the diet ; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake . Fruit is also eaten , notably cotoneaster ( 41 % of the fruit consumed ) , ivy and honeysuckle , and apple if available . Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders . Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild , and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds . Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Blackcaps are caught by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the breeding range , and by Eleonora 's falcons on migration . Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young , as do mammals such as stoats , weasels and squirrels . Domestic cats are the most important predator , possibly killing up to 10 % of blackcaps . Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo , a brood parasite . The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo 's eggs are often rejected . Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed , despite the cuckoo 's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host . Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs , and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch , making it easier to spot the intruder . There is , however , considerable variation between different clutches , making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg . The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo ; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past , and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved . 
 The only blood parasites found in a study of blackcaps trapped on migration were protozoans from the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium . Of those affected , 45 @.@ 5 % were males and 22 @.@ 7 % were females , but the number of parasites was small , and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired . Seventeen strains of H. <unk> are found only in the blackcap , and form a monophyletic group ; three further members of that group are found only in the garden warbler , and another three occur in the African hill babbler , supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species . The protozoan Isospora <unk> was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt . Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts . External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites . The latter do little damage , although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically . 
 = = In culture = = 
 Aristotle , in his History of Animals , considered that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap . The blackcap 's song has led to it being described as the " mock nightingale " or " country nightingale " , and John Clare , in " The March Nightingale " describes the listener as believing that the rarer species has arrived prematurely . " He stops his own and thinks the nightingale / Hath of her monthly reckoning counted wrong " . The song is also the topic of Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli 's " La Capinera " [ The <unk> ] . 
 Giovanni <unk> 's 1871 novel Storia di una <unk> , according to its author , was inspired by a story of a blackcap trapped and caged by children . The bird , silent and pining for its lost freedom , eventually dies . In the book , a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera falls in love with a family friend , only to have to return to her confinement when the disease wanes . The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917 , 1943 and 1993 . The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli , and its English @-@ language version was retitled as Sparrow . In Saint François d 'Assise , an opera by Messiaen , the orchestration is based on bird song . St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap . 
 Folk names for the blackcap often refer to its most obvious plumage feature ( black @-@ headed <unk> , King Harry black cap and coal hoodie ) or to its song , as in the " nightingale " names above . Other old names are based on its choice of nesting material ( Jack Straw , hay bird , hay chat and hay Jack ) . There is a tradition of the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm bases being named for birds . A former base near <unk> in Cheshire was called HMS <unk> . 
 = = Status = = 
 The blackcap has a very large range , and its population in Europe is estimated at 25 – 49 million breeding pairs . Allowing for birds breeding in Africa and Asia , the total population is between 80 – 196 million individuals . It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern . 
 Blackcaps and other small birds are illegally trapped in large numbers in Mediterranean countries , particularly in Cyprus , where they are considered a delicacy . Despite hunting and natural hazards , the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards , for example to Scotland and Denmark . There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range , such as in northern Israel and the Faroes , and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia . In the Baltic , the spread of the blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler . 
 = Frank Spedding = 
 Frank Harold Spedding ( October 22 , 1902 – December 15 , 1984 ) was a Canadian American chemist . He was a renowned expert on rare earth elements , and on extraction of metals from minerals . The uranium extraction process helped make it possible for the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs . 
 A graduate of the University of Michigan and University of California , Berkeley , Spedding became an assistant professor and head of the department of physical chemistry at Iowa State College in 1937 . His efforts at building up the school were so successful that he would spend the rest of his career there , becoming a professor of chemistry in 1941 , a professor of physics in 1950 , a professor of metallurgy in 1962 , and ultimately professor emeritus in 1973 . He co @-@ founded , along with Dr. Harley Wilhelm , the Institute for Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission , and directed the Ames Laboratory from its founding in 1947 until 1968 . 
 Spedding developed an ion exchange method of separating and purifying rare earth elements using ion exchange resins , and later used ion exchange to separate isotopes of individual elements , including hundreds of grams of almost pure nitrogen @-@ 15 . He published over 250 peer @-@ reviewed papers , and held 22 patents in his own name and jointly with others . Some 88 students received their Ph.D. degree under his supervision . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Spedding was born on October 22 , 1902 , in Hamilton , Ontario , Canada , the son of Howard Leslie Spedding and Mary Ann Elizabeth ( Marshall ) Spedding . Soon after he was born , the family moved to Michigan , and then Chicago . He became a naturalized U.S. citizen through his father . The family moved to Ann Arbor , Michigan , where his father worked as a photographer , in 1918 . He entered the University of Michigan in 1920 , receiving a Bachelor of Science ( B.S. ) degree in chemical engineering in 1925 and a Master of Science ( M.S. ) in analytical chemistry the following year . 
 As an undergraduate , Spedding took issue with the prevailing explanation by Friedrich August Kekulé of how the six carbon atoms in benzene hold together and proposed an alternate explanation . His professor , Moses Gomberg , recognised this as being the same as the ( incorrect ) model advanced by Albert Ladenburg in 1869 . At Gomberg 's suggestion , Spedding applied to the University of California , Berkeley , to study for his doctorate under Gilbert N. Lewis . Gomberg wrote a recommendation so that Spedding was not only accepted , but given a teaching fellowship as well . Under Lewis 's supervision , Spedding earned his Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D. ) in 1929 , writing his thesis on " Line absorption spectra in solids at low temperatures in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum " . It was published that year in the Physical Review . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Spedding 's graduation coincided with the onset of the Great Depression , and jobs became hard to find . Spedding received a National Research Fellowship from 1930 to 1932 , enabling him to stay at Berkeley and continue his research into the spectra of solids . While hiking in northern California , he met Ethel Annie MacFarlane , who shared his passion for camping , hiking and mountain climbing . Born in Winnipeg , Manitoba , she was a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Toronto , where she had earned a master 's degree in history . When they met , she was teaching at Victoria High School in Victoria , British Columbia . They were married on June 21 , 1931 . They had a daughter , Mary Anne Elizabeth , who was born in 1939 . 
 From 1932 to 1934 , Spedding worked for Lewis as a chemistry instructor . Around this time , he became interested in the chemistry of the rare earths . These were expensive and hard to find , and generally available only in minute amounts . In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist . The award came with a cash prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 . He borrowed money to travel to Chicago to collect it . While he was there , he was approached by a man offering several pounds of Europium and Samarium . His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy , a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago , who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company , where they were a byproduct of thorium production . A few weeks later , Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals . 
 In 1934 , Spedding was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship , allowing him to study in Europe . To save money , Spedding and his wife travelled to Europe by heading westward across the Pacific . His intention was to study in Germany under James Franck and Francis Simon , but they fled Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power in March 1933 . Instead he went to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England , where he was welcomed by Ralph H. Fowler . Spedding worked with John Lennard @-@ Jones , and attended lectures given by Max Born . He paid a visit to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen , and gave a lecture in Leningrad . 
 When Spedding returned to the United States in 1935 , the country was still in the grip of the Great Depression , and the job market had not improved . He was George Fisher Baker assistant professor at Cornell University from 1935 to 1937 . It was another temporary position , but it did allow him to work with Hans Bethe . At one point he drove out to Ohio State University hoping to find a tenure track position . The position had already been filled , but the professor of chemistry there , W. L. Evans , knew that Winfred F. ( Buck ) Coover at Iowa State College in Ames , Iowa , had a position . " I wouldn 't normally have chosen the place , " Spedding later recalled , " but I was desperate . I thought : I can go there and build up physical chemistry and when jobs really open up I can go to another school . " 
 Spedding took up the position as assistant professor and head of the department of physical chemistry at Iowa State College in 1937 . His efforts at building up the school were so successful that he would spend the rest of his career there , becoming a professor of chemistry in 1941 , a professor of physics in 1950 , a professor of metallurgy in 1962 , and ultimately professor emeritus in 1973 . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 By February 1942 , the United States had entered World War II , and the Manhattan Project was building up . At the University of Chicago , Arthur H. Compton established its Metallurgical Laboratory . Its mission was to build nuclear reactors to create plutonium that would be used in atomic bombs . For advice on assembling the laboratory 's Chemistry Division , Compton , a physicist , turned to Herbert McCoy , who had considerable experience with isotopes and radioactive elements . McCoy recommended Spedding as an expert on the rare earth elements , which were chemically similar to the actinide series that included uranium and plutonium . Compton asked Spedding to become the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory 's Chemistry Division . 
 Due to lack of space at the University of Chicago , Spedding proposed to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames , where he had colleagues who were willing to help . It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames , and half in Chicago . The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build . The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company , using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $ 20 per gram . Edward Creutz , the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium , wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments . With Westinghouse 's process , it would have cost $ 200 @,@ 000 and taken a year to produce . 
 The other major problem was the purity of the uranium . Impurities could act as neutron poisons and prevent a nuclear reactor from working , but the uranium oxide that Fermi wanted for his experimental reactor contained unacceptably large amounts of impurities . As a result , references published before 1942 typically listed its melting point at around 1 @,@ 800 ° C ( 3 @,@ 270 ° F ) when pure uranium metal actually melts at 1 @,@ 132 ° C ( 2 @,@ 070 ° F ) . The most effective way to purify uranium oxide in the laboratory was to take advantage of the fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether . Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition ; ether was explosive , and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down . Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis , Missouri , which had experience with ether . Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt 's chemical engineers , Henry V. Farr and John R. <unk> , on 17 April 1942 . Within a few months , sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced . 
 Spedding recruited two chemistry professors at Ames for his group there , Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns . Spedding and Wilhelm began looking for ways to create the uranium metal . At the time , it was produced in the form of a powder , and was highly pyrophoric . It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans , but to be useful , it needed to be melted and cast . The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container . Although graphite was known to react with uranium , this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched . 
 To produce uranium metal , they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen , but this did not work . They then investigated a process ( now known as the Ames process ) originally developed by J. C. Goggins and others at the University of New Hampshire in 1926 . This involved mixing uranium tetrachloride and calcium metal in a calcium oxide @-@ lined steel pressure vessel ( known as a " bomb " ) and heating it . They were able to reproduce Goggin 's results in August 1942 , and by September , the Ames Project had produced a 4 @.@ 980 @-@ kilogram ( 10 @.@ 98 lb ) ingot . Starting in July 1943 , Mallinckrodt , Union Carbide , and DuPont began producing uranium by the Ames process , and Ames phased out its own production by early 1945 . As a result , the Ames Laboratory never moved to Chicago , but Spedding was present at the University of Chicago on 2 December 1942 , to witness the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in Fermi 's Chicago Pile @-@ 1 . 
 Throughout the war , the laboratory held regular information sessions known as " <unk> " . In addition to its work with uranium , the Ames Laboratory produced 437 pounds ( 198 kg ) of extremely pure cerium for the cerium sulphide crucibles used by the plutonium metallurgists . Fears that world supplies of uranium were limited led to experiments with thorium , which could be irradiated to produce fissile uranium @-@ 233 . A calcium reduction process was developed for thorium , and some 4 @,@ 500 pounds ( 2 @,@ 000 kg ) was produced .

 After World War II , Spedding founded the Institute for Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission . He directed the Ames Laboratory from its founding in 1947 until 1968 . It was initially established on the grounds of Iowa State College . Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950 , and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall . Spedding was " universally acknowledged as one of the world ’ s foremost experts on the identification and separation of rare earths " . He developed an ion exchange method of separating and purifying rare earth elements using ion exchange resins . He later used ion exchange to separate isotopes of individual elements , including hundreds of grams of almost pure nitrogen @-@ 15 . 
 During his career , Spedding published over 260 peer @-@ reviewed papers , and held 22 patents in his own name and jointly with others . Some 88 students received their Ph.D. degree under his supervision . After his retirement in 1972 , he authored 60 books . He received the William H. Nichols Award from the American Chemical Society in 1952 , the James Douglas Gold Medal from the American Institute of Mining , Metallurgical , and Petroleum Engineers in 1961 and the Francis J. <unk> Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1969 . He was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in chemistry , but never won . An award called the Frank H. Spedding Award is presented at the annual Rare Earth Research Conference . 
 Spedding suffered a stroke in November 1984 , and was hospitalised , but sent home . He died suddenly on December 15 , 1984 , and was buried in the cemetery at Iowa State University . He was survived by his wife , daughter , and three grandchildren . His papers are housed in the Special Collections Department of Iowa State University .

 = 2001 Italian Grand Prix = 
 The 2001 Italian Grand Prix ( formally the LXXII Gran Premio Campari d 'Italia ) was a Formula One motor race held on 16 September 2001 at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza , Monza , Italy . It was the fifteenth round of the 2001 Formula One season and the 72nd Italian Grand Prix . The 53 @-@ lap race was won by Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya after starting from pole position . Rubens Barrichello finished second in a Ferrari with Montoya 's teammate Ralf Schumacher third . 
 Montoya maintained his start @-@ line advantage and led until he was passed by Barrichello on the ninth lap . Barrichello pulled away from Montoya and held the lead until his one and only pit stop on lap 19 which proved problematic because of a faulty refuelling rig . Montoya was utilising a one @-@ stop strategy and made a pit stop on lap 29 , which allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to lead for six laps . Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36 , until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made a pit stop for the second time . Barrichello started to reduce the gap between himself and Montoya but was unable to challenge the Williams driver who won his first Formula One victory . 
 The result meant Montoya moved up into fifth place in the Drivers ' Championship , 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who clinched the title two races beforehand . Barrichello 's third position finish allowed him to close the gap to David Coulthard . Williams ' strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points with two races remaining in the season .

 The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams with two drivers each . The teams ( also known as constructors ) were Ferrari , McLaren , Williams , Benetton , BAR , Jordan , Arrows , Sauber , Jaguar , Minardi and Prost . Before the race , both the Drivers ' Championship and Constructors ' Championship were already settled , with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having claimed the Drivers ' Championship two rounds earlier in the Hungarian Grand Prix and Ferrari took the Constructors ' Championship at the same event , with McLaren too many points behind to be able to catch them . 
 After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September , the teams conducted mid @-@ season testing at various European race circuits between 4 – 7 September to prepare for the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza . Ferrari , Williams , BAR , Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit . Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days . The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit , suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti @-@ stall system . BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes . On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 : 24 @.@ 226 , four @-@ tenths ahead of Panis . Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team 's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control . 
 After the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington D.C. , Formula One 's governing body , the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) announced that the Italian Grand Prix would go ahead as scheduled . Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said that his team would approach the race as a normal racing event instead of a traditional Ferrari festival . Furthermore , di Montezemolo stated Formula One should continue its normal schedule and not cancel races . Additionally , the Automobile Club d 'Italia urged fans and spectators to behave " in keeping with the gravity of the situation and in collective participation in the pain of American citizens . " <unk> celebrations were also cancelled and all pre @-@ race ceremonies including a flypast by the Italian Tricolour Arrows display team were called off . Three teams altered their car 's liveries as a mark of respect . Ferrari stripped their cars of all advertising and painted their nose cones black . Jaguar fitted black engine covers to their R2 cars on Saturday morning , and Jordan sponsor Deutsche Post replaced its branding with the flag of the United States on the Jordan cars engine cover on Sunday morning . Michael Schumacher was reluctant to take part in the race and said in 2002 that he felt it was a " bad sign " to be driving after the September 11 attacks . 
 There were two driver changes heading into the race . The Minardi team replaced regular driver <unk> Marques with Yoong . Yoong received backing from the Magnum Corporation and was granted a super licence after a two @-@ day test at the Mugello Circuit . He became the first Malaysian driver to compete in Formula One . Marques was kept on as the team 's test and reserve driver , and assisted with developing the Minardi <unk> . Czech Formula 3000 driver Tomáš Enge ( who had been signed as the test driver for Prost ) replaced Luciano Burti who had been recovering from an concussion and bruising he sustained in an accident at the previous race in Belgium . 
 Due to the configuration of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza , with its high average speed , the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible . Williams introduced a revised <unk> specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium . Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher 's car on Sunday morning . Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved aerodynamics . 
 = = = Practice and qualifying sessions = = = 
 Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race , two each on Friday and Saturday . The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour ; the third and fourth sessions , on Saturday morning , lasted 45 minutes each . The first practice session was moved from the usual start time from 11 : 00 CEST ( UTC + 02 : 00 ) to 10 : 50 to comply with a planned silence for one minute that was observed at 12 : 00 throughout Europe . Michael Schumacher set the pace in the first practice session , which took place in dry weather conditions , with a time of 1 : 25 @.@ 524 ; David Coulthard had the second @-@ fastest time . Barrichello was third fastest , ahead of Nick Heidfeld ( who crashed his car at Variante Ascari ) in fourth . Mika Häkkinen recorded the fifth fastest time , with Jenson Button in sixth . Kimi Räikkönen , who was seventh fastest , collided with a barrier at Variante Goodyear which removed his front @-@ right wheel . Ralf Schumacher , Jarno Trulli and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session 's top ten fastest drivers . Arrows driver Jos Verstappen did not set a lap time because he collided with a tyre barrier at the Curva di Lesmo early in the session . In the second practice session , where a brief rain shower hit the circuit early in the session , Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time of the day , a 1 : 24 @.@ 667 ; Montoya had the second fastest time despite going off the circuit during the session . Michael Schumacher ( with a time of 1 : 25 @.@ 131 ) was third fastest , ahead of de la Rosa . Barrichello , Häkkinen and Coulthard filled the next three positions . Despite not going onto the circuit , Heidfeld was the eighth fastest driver . Alesi and Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen ( who slowed in his car and went off the circuit and slid wide of the track and avoided colliding with the barriers ) followed in the top ten . 
 Montoya took the fastest lap of the third practice session , a 1 : 25 @.@ 558 which was held on a damp track . Barrichello was second fastest with a time 0 @.@ 336 slower than <unk> de la Rosa was running quickly and set the third fastest lap , a 1 : 26 @.@ 542 . BAR drivers Villeneuve and Panis set the fourth and fifth fastest times . Räikkönen , Eddie Irvine , Verstappen , Enrique Bernoldi and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten . Giancarlo Fisichella , Yoong , Jenson Button , Jean Alesi , Michael Schumacher , Coulthard , Häkkinen and Fernando Alonso did not set lap times during the session . The circuit dried up for the final practice session where Michael Schumacher had the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a 1 : 23 @.@ 178 ; Barrichello had the fastest time when circuit conditions improved but fell down to fourth . The two Ferrari drivers were separated by Montoya and Trulli . Coulthard was fifth quickest with Ralf Schumacher sixth . Heidfeld , Häkkinen , de la Rosa and Räikkönen rounded out the top ten drivers ahead of qualifying . Enge spun but regained control of his car . 
 Saturday afternoon 's qualifying session lasted for an hour . Each driver was limited to twelve laps , with the grid order decided by the drivers ' fastest laps . During this session the 107 % rule was in effect , requiring each driver to remain within 107 % of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race . The session was held in dry weather conditions ; the air temperature was 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) and the track temperature was 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) . Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1 : 22 @.@ 216 . Although he was happy with the feel of his car , he did not feel confident that he could take pole position . Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0 @.@ 312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying . Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time . Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position . He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag . Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres . Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car 's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip . Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car . Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes . 
 The two Sauber drivers were eighth and ninth with Heidfeld in front of Räikkönen ; Heidfeld was happy with his position after losing track time on Friday while Räikkönen complained that he had been blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap. de la Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an issue with understeer on de la Rosa 's car . Button took eleventh position and reported that his Benetton was well balanced . Frentzen took twelfth and said his qualifying position was more significant than his fourth @-@ place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix . Irvine struggled with brake balance which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar which meant he managed thirteenth . He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car . Fisichella used his Benetton team 's spare car because his race car developed an <unk> failure in practice but had an engine issue in the spare car which restricted him to fourteenth . BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis took the fifteenth and seventeenth positions and both reported that there was a lack of aerodynamic grip but mechanical grip was fine . The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as " the worst qualifying session I could imagine on a circuit which love " because he had brake balance and handling issues . Verstappen and Bernoldi took the eighteenth and nineteenth positions for the Arrows team . Enge set the twentieth fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session , and had two engine problems in both his race car and the spare monocoque tuned for Frentzen . The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Fernando Alonso ahead of Yoong ; both drivers stopped on their out laps with gearbox actuator failures and were required to share the spare Minardi car .

 The drivers took to the track at 09 : 30 local time for a 30 @-@ minute warm @-@ up session . It took place in sunny and warm weather conditions . Michael Schumacher maintained his good performance , setting a time of 1 : 26 @.@ 029 . Coulthard was the second @-@ fastest driver . Montoya was third , two @-@ tenths of a second behind Schumacher . Barrichello completed the top four fastest drivers . After the end of the warm @-@ up but before the race , a second minute of silence was held at the end of the Drivers ' Parade . 
 The race started at 14 : 00 local time . The race was held in sunny weather conditions ; the air temperature was 19 ° C ( 66 ° F ) and the track temperature 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) . During the buildup to the race , Michael Schumacher attempted to organise a pact that would see no overtaking at the first two chicanes . The plan failed , with Villeneuve , Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore and Arrows owner Tom Walkinshaw refusing to accept the pact . Schumacher had been keen to avoid any accidents at the start , due to a combination of the effects of the 11 September 2001 attacks earlier that week ; the death of fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti in a pile @-@ up at the beginning of the previous year 's race ; and the horrific accident in the previous day 's <unk> race in Germany , in which former Formula One driver Alex Zanardi was critically injured , resulting in the amputation of both legs . 
 Heidfeld lost hydraulic pressure on the grid ; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane . Fisichella did the same because he had a fuel leak in his car . When the race started , Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner , with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third . Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo . Further back , Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race . Button made a pit stop at the end of the lap for a replacement front wing . Irvine made a good start , rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap , while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth . Verstappen made the best start , moving from nineteenth to eighth . At the end of the first lap , Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello , who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher , Ralf Schumacher , Coulthard , de la Rosa , Irvine , Verstappen , Räikkönen , Alesi , Villeneuve , Bernoldi , Häkkinen , Panis , Frentzen , Alonso , Enge , Heidfeld , Yoong , Fisichella and Button . 
 Barrichello and Michael Schumacher started to maintain the gap between themselves and Montoya , and started to pull away from Ralf Schumacher . Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two , while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen . He later fell behind Alesi , Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap . Button 's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five . Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen , Panis and Frentzen one lap later . Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven , which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth . Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking , and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap . Three laps later , Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13 . Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working . Verstappen fell down to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16 . Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell to the back of the field . 
 Michael Schumacher battled for Montoya for third position until he became the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 18 , and rejoined the track in fourth place . The Williams and Ferrari teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Williams team were planning a one @-@ stop strategy whereas the Ferrari team were planning for two stops . Barrichello ( on a lighter fuel load ) was able to quickly extend his lead over Montoya to ten seconds by his first pit stop on lap 19 . However , Barrichello 's pit stop proved problematic : his refuelling rig failed to work which meant he was stationary for around six to seven seconds longer than planned . Barrichello exited the stop in third position , ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher . Häkkinen lost second during the course of the 19th lap , and then lost all gears on the previous lap which forced him to retire . Verstappen retired on the 26th lap because his engine stopped working . At the front of the field , Ralf Schumacher moved into the lead of the race when Montoya made his pit stop on lap 28 , where his pit crew made an adjustment to his front wing to rectify an issue Montoya had with oversteer , and he rejoined in third place with a deficit of 5 @.@ 5 seconds . Frentzen retired from ninth position with a gearbox failure on lap 29 . Villeneuve made a pit stop from sixth on lap 34 and retained the position . 
 Ralf Schumacher opened a gap of 6 @.@ 1 seconds over Barrichello by his one and only pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in <unk> de la Rosa was the last one @-@ stop driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth , which he maintained upon rejoining the track . Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 40 , and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher . Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher . At the completion of lap 42 , with the scheduled pit stops completed , the order was Montoya , Ralf Schumacher , Barrichello , Michael Schumacher , de la Rosa , Villeneuve , Räikkönen , Alesi , Panis , Fisichella , Heidfeld , Bernoldi , Enge , Alonso and Yoong . Further down the field , Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43 . Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start / finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position , allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47 . Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a gravel trap . Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed a crankshaft sensor problem on the same lap . 
 Barrichello closed the gap between himself and Montoya but was unable to catch up to the Colombian who crossed the finish line on lap 53 to clinch his first Formula One <unk> in a time of 1 ' 16 : 58 @.@ 393 at an average speed of 239 @.@ 321 kilometres per hour ( 148 @.@ 707 mph ) . Barrichello finished in second position 5 @.@ 1 seconds behind Montoya , Ralf Schumacher came in third , Michael Schumacher took fourth , de la Rosa took his best result of the season after he finished fifth and Villeneuve rounded out the points @-@ scoring positions in sixth . Räikkönen was the final driver on the lead lap in a close seventh place , and Alesi , Panis , Fisichella , Heidfeld , Enge and Alonso were the last of the classified finishers . 
 = = = After the race = = = 
 The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference . Montoya said he was " so happy " and " pleased " that he won his first race which was the first for a Colombian driver . He also said that he was not frustrated on not achieving his first victory in the past fourteen races as he was not expecting to win during the season . Barrichello said that he felt that Ferrari put on " a good show " despite his slow pit stop from a fuel rig problem on lap 19 . He also believed that his two @-@ stop strategy was the right move and described his weekend as " one of my best " . When asked if his car was inconsistent during the Grand Prix , Ralf Schumacher said this was not the case and stated although he had problem with his tyres he felt the Williams finish of first and third was " a great achievement " . 
 Alesi attacked Briatore 's role in preventing the drivers from abiding by the pact that was to see no overtaking in the first two chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race . Nevertheless , he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he " behaved like a perfect leader " . Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place : " We are race car drivers , Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars . Because we knew a year ago that there would be a race at Monza and nobody complained . " FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix . 
 The result allowed Michael Schumacher to extend his lead in the Drivers ' Championship to 50 points over Coulthard . Barrichello 's third @-@ place finish allowed him to narrow the gap to Coulthard to be three points behind . Ralf Schumacher remained in fourth position , while Montoya 's victory meant he moved into fifth . Ferrari remained in the lead of the Constructors ' Championship with an 80 @-@ point advantage over McLaren , who 's points advantage over Williams had reduced to eight points . Sauber maintained fourth place , while BAR took over fifth position .

 " Jai Ho " is a song composed by A. R. Rahman for the 2008 film , Slumdog Millionaire . When Danny Boyle , the director of Slumdog Millionaire , approached Rahman to compose its soundtrack , he included the song . " Jai Ho " accompanies a choreographed dance sequence at the end credits of Slumdog Millionaire . The song features vocals from Sukhvinder Singh , Mahalaxmi Iyer and Vijay Prakash in Hindi , Urdu and Punjabi . Indian singer <unk> Shah wrote and provided vocals for a Spanish section of the song . 
 " Jai Ho " was , at the time of its release " the toast of the town in almost every part of the world " . Covers and remixes of the song and performances of the " Jai Ho " dance were posted on YouTube . " Jai Ho " received universally favorable reviews from music critics , who cited it as the best song on the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack . The song won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture , Television or Other Visual Media . It was also the official campaign song of the Indian National Congress during the 2009 election . 
 American girl group The Pussycat Dolls recorded an English interpretation of " Jai Ho " . Entitled " Jai Ho ! ( You Are My Destiny ) " , and credited to " A. R. Rahman and the Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger " , the song appeared on the re @-@ release of the group 's second studio album Doll Domination ( 2008 ) .

 In 2008 , while working on several films , A. R. Rahman received an email from Danny Boyle , the director of the film Slumdog Millionaire , stating : " Hey I 'm Danny Boyle , I like your work , and it would be great for us to have you on our film " . Rahman was unsure how to answer , but after exchanging several more emails , they met in Mumbai . Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying " when I talked to him , I had some interest and I wanted to see the film . He had a first cut of the film already , and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it . So I left another film to do this one . I made time for it . " 
 While composing the soundtrack to the Slumdog Millionaire , Rahman aimed to mix modern India with eighties Hindi film soundtracks . Boyle , who " hated sentiment and cello " , told Rahman to " never put a cello in my film " . Boyle also insisted on a " <unk> " score . Rahman stated that Boyle wanted " edgy , upfront " music that did not suppress sound . He noted that " There 's not many cues in the film . Usually a big film has 130 cues . This had just seventeen or eighteen : the end credits , beginning credits " . 
 The soundtrack for Slumdog Millionaire took Rahman two months to plan and two weeks to complete . He recalled that : " Usually it takes six months with the musical films I 'm doing in India " . Rahman said the soundtrack " isn 't about India or Indian culture . The story could happen anywhere : China , Brazil , anywhere . Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is on in every damn country . " 
 = = Writing and composition = = 
 Rahman composed " Jai Ho " using Logic Pro , a digital audio workstation and MIDI sequencer software application created by Apple Inc . At the time of the song 's production , Rahman had been using the software for almost 12 years . For " Jai Ho " , Rahman made extensive use of Logic instruments , including the <unk> , which comprises the <unk> electric piano and ES2 synth mixed with a few plugins , such as the Channel EQ , <unk> and Guitar Amp Pro . The bassline and the " trancey , arpeggiated " musical line used ES2 presets . For the " long chorus vocals " in the song , Rahman created a " robotic , stair @-@ stepping pitch @-@ bend effect " with Logic 's Pitch Correction plugin to achieve the " exaggerated tuning effect " . 
 The lyrics to " Jai Ho " were written by Gulzar and are a combination of Hindi , Urdu and Punjabi . Lyrics in Spanish are also included in the song " to go along with his [ Rahman ] Latin American touch of music " . According to the India @-@ EU Film Initiative , this inclusion " really makes the song quite unique and international " . Of the three singers credited , Sukhwinder Singh is the principal vocalist . Vijay Prakash sang the portion with the words " Jai Ho " , which takes a high pitch at numerous junctures of the song . Mahalakshmi Iyer sang the Hindi words between the " Jai Ho " chants and the portions of the verses not sung by Singh . <unk> Shah sang and wrote the song 's Spanish words . 
 According to Rahman , " Jai Ho " was meant to create " a vision of the whole world celebrating this victory " . The song contains a mix of " multiple motifs from the traditional pieces on the soundtrack " with " the big drums and blasting horns of the present " . It was originally composed and shortlisted for Subhash Ghai 's 2008 film Yuvvraaj . Although Rahman was excited about the song , Ghai " wasn 't too kicked about it " . Ghai felt it was " too subtle and soft to be <unk> on the character played by Zayed Khan " . Rahman and Gulzar believed the song had " immense potential " and used it in Slumdog Millionaire . Following the song 's win at the Oscar 's , Rahman stated that : " He [ Ghai ] said the words had a positive feel . It was like a prayer . I honestly didn 't think the song would win me an Oscar though . But like the film Slumdog suggests , everything has its own destiny " . 
 When asked if he considers " Jai Ho " as his best creation , Rahman stated : " Sometimes it 's not about a best creation , but the best for a particular moment of the film . ' Jai Ho ' was right for that particular moment , that particular mindset in Slumdog Millionaire . I know there 's lot of debate over this song winning the Oscars . But then , I didn 't send the song to the Oscars , the makers did . I just composed the tune in three weeks and was done with it . However , I too feel ' Jai Ho ' was apt for that particular moment in the film — the protagonist comes out of darkness and pain to light amid ' Jai Ho ' hammering in the background . "

He described it as " two lovers consummating their long , winding courtship not with sex but a hand @-@ waving , side @-@ stepping , totally cathartic shimmy " . 
 Emily Heward of Music OMH called " Jai Ho " an " exuberant Bollywood dance number " that " encapsulates the film 's feel @-@ good @-@ factor , and reminds us just how much this score deserves the accolades it has already won and the many it is sure still to receive – just as India 's most treasured composer deserves the new @-@ found global recognition it has earned him " . In a review of the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack , Joginder <unk> of Bollywood Hungama deemed " Jai Ho " the " flagship number " of the film . <unk> complimented Sukhwinder Singh 's vocals as being " energetic " and concluded that the singer " can comfortably add on another big <unk> to his name " . He also stated that the song , while " boasting of an amazing mix of melody and rhythm " remains " Indian at heart " and is " instantly catchy " . He concluded that : " No wonder , it is the lone promotional song of the film and also sees a music video being dedicated to it . Gulzar <unk> celebrates the spirit of love and life with ' Jai Ho ' and infuses enough power in it that justifies all the nominations it is receiving today . "

 Ahmedabad ( / <unk> / ; also known as <unk> Gujarati pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is the largest city and former capital of Gujarat . It is the administrative headquarters of the Ahmedabad district and the seat of the Gujarat High Court . With a population of more than 6 @.@ 3 million and an extended population of 7 @.@ 2 million , it is the sixth largest city and seventh largest metropolitan area of India . Ahmedabad is located on the banks of the Sabarmati River , 30 km ( 19 mi ) from the state capital Gandhinagar . 
 Ahmedabad has emerged as an important economic and industrial hub in India . It is the second largest producer of cotton in India , and its stock exchange is the country 's second oldest . Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad , which houses the 54 @,@ 000 @-@ seat Sardar Patel Stadium . The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city 's economy towards tertiary sector activities like commerce , communication and construction . Ahmedabad 's increasing population has resulted in an increase in the construction and housing industries resulting in recent development of skyscrapers . 
 In 2010 , it was ranked third in Forbes 's list of fastest growing cities of the decade . In 2012 , The Times of India chose Ahmedabad as the best city to live in in India . As of 2014 , Ahmedabad 's estimated gross domestic product was $ 119 billion . 
 Ahmedabad has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi 's flagship Smart Cities Mission . 
 = = History = = 
 The area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century , when it was known as <unk> ( or <unk> ) . At that time , <unk> I , the Solanki ruler of <unk> ( modern Patan ) , waged a successful war against the Bhil king of <unk> , and established a city called <unk> on the banks of the Sabarmati . Solanki rule lasted until the 13th century , when Gujarat came under the control of the <unk> dynasty of Dholka . Gujarat subsequently came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century . However , by the earlier 15th century , the local governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar established his independence from the Delhi Sultanate and crowned himself Sultan of Gujarat as Muzaffar Shah I , thereby founding the Muzaffarid dynasty . This area finally came under the control of his grandson Sultan Ahmed Shah in 1411 A.D. who while at the banks of Sabarmati liked the forested area for a new capital city and laid the foundation of a new walled city near <unk> and named it Ahmedabad after the four saints in the area by the name Ahmed . According to other sources , he named it after himself . Ahmed Shah I laid the foundation of the city on 26 February 1411 ( at 1 @.@ 20 pm , Thursday , the second day of Dhu al @-@ Qi 'dah , Hijri year 813 ) at Manek Burj . He chose it as the new capital on 4 March 1411 . 
 In 1487 , Mahmud Begada , the grandson of Ahmed Shah , fortified the city with an outer wall 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) in circumference and consisting of twelve gates , 189 bastions and over 6 @,@ 000 battlements . In 1535 Humayun briefly occupied Ahmedabad after capturing Champaner when the ruler of Gujarat , Bahadur Shah , fled to Diu . Ahmedabad was then reoccupied by the Muzaffarid dynasty until 1573 when Gujarat was conquered by the Mughal emperor Akbar . During the Mughal reign , Ahmedabad became one of the Empire 's thriving centres of trade , mainly in textiles , which were exported as far as Europe . The Mughal ruler <unk> spent the prime of his life in the city , sponsoring the construction of the Moti Shahi Mahal in <unk> . The Deccan Famine of 1630 – 32 affected the city , as did famines in 1650 and 1686 . Ahmedabad remained the provincial headquarters of the Mughals until 1758 , when they surrendered the city to the Marathas . 
 During the period of Maratha Empire governance , the city became the centre of a conflict between two Maratha clans ; the Peshwa of Poona and the Gaekwad of Baroda . In 1780 , during the First Anglo @-@ Maratha War , a British force under James Hartley stormed and captured Ahmedabad , but it was handed back to the Marathas at the end of the war . The British East India Company took over the city in 1818 during the Third Anglo @-@ Maratha War . A military cantonment was established in 1824 and a municipal government in 1858 . Incorporated into the Bombay Presidency during British rule , Ahmedabad became one of the most important cities in the Gujarat region . In 1864 , a railway link between Ahmedabad and Mumbai ( then Bombay ) was established by the Bombay , Baroda , and Central India Railway ( BB & CI ) , enabling traffic and trade between northern and southern India via the city . Over time , the city established itself as the home of a developing textile industry , which earned it the nickname " Manchester of the East " . 
 The Indian independence movement developed roots in the city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams – the <unk> Ashram near <unk> in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram ( now Sabarmati Ashram ) on the banks of the Sabarmati in 1917 – which would become centres of nationalist activities . During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919 , textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War . In the 1920s , textile workers and teachers went on strike , demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions . In 1930 , Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March . The city 's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests , and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement . Following independence and the partition of India in 1947 , the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947 , Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan , who expanded the city 's population and transformed its demographics and economy . 
 By 1960 , Ahmedabad had become a metropolis with a population of slightly under half a million people , with classical and colonial European @-@ style buildings lining the city 's thoroughfares . It was chosen as the capital of Gujarat state after the partition of the State of Bombay on 1 May 1960 . During this period , a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city , making it a centre for higher education , science and technology . Ahmedabad 's economic base became more diverse with the establishment of heavy and chemical industry during the same period . Many countries sought to emulate India 's economic planning strategy and one of them , South Korea , copied the city 's second " Five @-@ Year Plan " . 
 In the late 1970s , the capital shifted to the newly built , well planned city of Gandhinagar . This marked the start of a long period of decline in the city , marked by a lack of development . The 1974 Nav <unk> agitation – a protest against a 20 % hike in the hostel food fees at the L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad – snowballed into a movement to remove <unk> Patel , then chief minister of Gujarat . In the 1980s , a reservation policy was introduced in the country , which led to anti @-@ reservation protests in 1981 and 1985 . The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes .

 Ahmedabad lies at 23 @.@ 03 ° N 72 @.@ 58 ° E ﻿ / 23 @.@ 03 ; 72 @.@ 58 in western India at 53 metres ( 174 ft ) above sea level on the banks of the Sabarmati river , in north @-@ central Gujarat . It covers an area of 464 km2 ( 179 sq mi ) . The Sabarmati frequently dried up in the summer , leaving only a small stream of water , and the city is in a sandy and dry area . However with the execution of the Sabarmati River Front Project and Embankment , the waters from the Narmada river have been diverted to the Sabarmati to keep the river flowing throughout the year , thereby eliminating Ahmedabad 's water problems . The steady expansion of the Rann of Kutch threatened to increase desertification around the city area and much of the state ; however , the Narmada Canal network is expected to alleviate this problem . Except for the small hills of <unk> @-@ Jodhpur <unk> , the city is almost flat . Three lakes lie within the city 's limits — Kankaria , <unk> and <unk> . Kankaria , in the neighbourhood of Maninagar , is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Delhi , Qutb @-@ ud @-@ din Aybak , in 1451 . 
 According to the Bureau of Indian Standards , the town falls under seismic zone 3 , in a scale of 2 to 5 ( in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes ) . 
 Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions . The eastern bank of the river houses the old city , which includes the central town of Bhadra . This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars , the pol system of closely clustered buildings , and numerous places of worship . It houses the main railway station , the main post office , and some buildings of the Muzaffarid and British eras . The colonial period saw the expansion of the city to the western side of Sabarmati , facilitated by the construction of Ellis Bridge in 1875 and later the relatively modern Nehru Bridge . The western part of the city houses educational institutions , modern buildings , residential areas , shopping malls , multiplexes and new business districts centred around roads such as Ashram Road , C. G. Road and <unk> @-@ Gandhinagar Highway .

 Wipeout 64 is a 1998 futuristic racing game developed by Psygnosis and published by Midway Games exclusively for the Nintendo 64 . It is the third game in the Wipeout series and remains the only one published on a Nintendo console . At the time of the game 's release , developer Psygnosis had been owned for five years by Sony Computer Entertainment , for whose hardware all subsequent Wipeout games have been released exclusively . 
 Set in <unk> , just a year after Wipeout 2097 , Wipeout 64 introduced several new elements to the Wipeout series including analogue control which benefited from the Nintendo 64 's controller , new weapons , teams and tracks . The game received mixed opinions from critics . Comparing the game with F @-@ Zero X , which was released a month earlier , many critics praised the game for its individuality among the Wipeout series , offering more tracks and racing craft , unique atmosphere and " superior track design " . However , the game was criticised for its slow frame rate , and opinion is divided whether Wipeout 64 is a ' true sequel ' to Wipeout 2097 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Most aspects of the gameplay did not differ from the previous two titles . Wipeout is based on a futuristic anti @-@ gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer @-@ controlled AI opponents to finish in the highest position possible . Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels ; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down @-@ force for faster turning speeds , Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force . 
 Wipeout 64 provides most of the same features as Wipeout 2097 along with new weapons unique to each team . New additions to the weapons interface include the ability to fire three rockets at a time and rear @-@ locking missiles . Returning weapons include the homing missiles , machine guns and plasma bolts . Exclusive to Wipeout 64 is an unlockable weapon power @-@ up called the " Cyclone " which allows the player to strengthen the power of their weapons . There is also the inclusion of an elimination counter that gauges how many opponents were eliminated in a race by the player . This paved the way for the Eliminator mode introduced in Wipeout 3 . 
 Wipeout 64 also introduced split @-@ screen multiplayer for the first time , as well as a new addition named ' Challenge Mode ' . Challenge Mode is where the player has to complete sets of challenges in predefined classes and tracks through either getting the fastest time in a Time Trial , the highest placing in a race , or eliminating the most opponents through a weaponry @-@ based ' deathmatch ' . 
 Most of the tracks in Wipeout 64 feature mirrored layouts of circuits from select tracks in Wipeout and Wipeout 2097 , set in different locations . Some conversions are not perfectly accurate , as some corners were eased or cut entirely , elevations were changed , and there were no split track sections . The only truly original circuit is the hidden <unk> track , obtained by completing all six Race Challenges . 
 = = Development = = 
 As with all games in the series , Wipeout 64 was developed by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and was published by Midway Games - marking the first and only time in the Wipeout series where one of the games were not published by Psygnosis or SCE Studio Liverpool ( as they are known after 2001 ) . The game is one of the few N64 titles to have noticeable load times , disguised by the request ' Please Wait ' . Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need for sound decompression , according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN . " Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64 's analogue stick to their benefit ; thus rendering the D @-@ Pad obsolete so that ships could respond quickly and more precisely in improvement regarding to the older games . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Despite the limited capacity of a game cartridge , Wipeout 64 managed to fit nine music tracks , mostly by composers Rob Lord & Mark <unk> ( credited as " PC MUSIC " in @-@ game ) , with additional tracks by Fluke and Propellerheads .

 The game received mixed reviews among both considerable praise and criticism from critics . The game received an aggregate score of 84 / 100 from Metacritic . Reviewers were generally impressed with the innovation and complexity the game offered ; mostly stating that Wipeout 64 had " everything a futuristic racer needs , a large variety of tracks , well designed craft , weapons , numerous game modes and speed " . 
 The graphics were well received from critics . IGN remarked that Wipeout 64 was a superior game to F @-@ Zero X. IGN praised the game on its graphics , saying in the verdict that the visuals " are absolutely beautiful " and that the in @-@ game soundtrack and sound @-@ effects were " top @-@ notch " , and that it included clean boost audio and excellent " scrape " noises . Despite the considerable praise , a negative review came from Joe Fielder of GameSpot , saying that regarding the graphics , the visuals in Wipeout 64 did not meet the par set by Wipeout 2097 that was released for the PlayStation two years prior . Fielder noted , however , that the new multiplayer mode was the game 's main advancement over the previous titles . 
 Most reviews compared the game with F @-@ Zero X which was released a month earlier , with the general assumption that Nintendo 's own futuristic racer offered more tracks and racing craft , but Wipeout 64 contained superior track design and atmosphere . GameSpot gave the game a lower score of 6 @.@ 9 out of 10 , stating that " <unk> 64 isn 't horrible , it just feels like the developer 's first effort for the system at times - which it is " . " <unk> " of Gaming Age gave Wipeout 64 8 out of 10 stars , praising its new innovations , especially its analogue control , saying that " adapting analogue controls was the biggest improvement racing games made and Wipeout 64 demonstrates that beautifully " . <unk> also noted that the game still had a " learning curve " , saying that " it ’ s not as brutal as the first game but definitely harder than the far easier XL " . However , despite being complimentary of Wipeout 64 , both GameSpot and Gaming Age recommended purchasing F @-@ Zero X instead . 
 Opinion is divided on whether Wipeout 64 simply merges the good points of the previous two games , or is different enough to be considered a sequel in its own right . Praised elements include " prettier " and " grittier " graphics compared to F @-@ Zero X. Pop @-@ up and a slow frame @-@ rate are repeatedly mentioned as problems , but only when the screen is split up to three or four times in multiplayer mode .

The film 's dialogue was written by <unk> Chohan , and <unk> <unk> essayed the role of the film 's production designer . 
 Pre @-@ production work began in July 2014 , when the film was picked up for production .

She wanted an entirely different setting for the film and decided to set the story in Kerala .

It was reported that , Koechlin will be playing the role of Tara Deshpande , a young and brash social media @-@ savvy .

Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film the highest praise and deemed it " a well @-@ chiselled marvel " saying : " Waiting is at once heart @-@ wrenching and uplifting [ ... ] marked by deep philosophical undertones , but it is never unduly ponderous . " . A reviewer writing for The New Indian Express too spoke highly of the film saying , " Not since Ritesh Batra ’ s The <unk> have I seen an indie film addressing itself to the ageless issue of human desolation and individual grief with such warmth , dignity , grace , honesty and humour . " Namrata Joshi writing for The Hindu called the script " dignified " and " without any false notes " and added , " Waiting manages to stand on its own emotional ground [ ... ] The people , situations , relationships , feelings are layered , warm and humourous , ringing true in their complexities .

 Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror lauded the film 's direction and cinematography saying , " Menon has the tenacity of a Sofia Coppola to produce frames where not much happens but one is unable to look away " , and concluded by saying that , " The film deserves a watch for being one that doesn 't try too hard and for its approach to an extreme situation . " Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle while also praising the technical expertise saying , " Neha Parti <unk> beautifully captures the beautiful city of Kochi . " called the film " unmissable " saying , " ' Waiting ' is a refreshing subject that is engaging enough right up till its open ended climax . " Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express thought that the film was " too explanatory , too talky " , and that " the most effective moments in the film occur when the two leads are allowed to fall silent , to just be in that moment , to loosen up " .

" In her review for Rediff.com Sukanya Verma called the film " absolutely riveting " , and also lauded Koechlin saying , " There ’ s something stunningly unhindered about Kalki and her aura .

 = Thelma ( 1910 film ) = 
 Thelma is a 1910 American silent short drama film produced by the Thanhouser Company . The story was based on Marie Corelli 's 1887 novel of the same name , it focuses on a Norwegian maiden who meets Sir Phillip and the two are wed . Lady Clara conspires to ruin the marriage and tricks Thelma with a letter purported to be from her husband . Thelma returns to Norway and to the death of her father . Thelma , alone in the world , prays at her mother 's grave for strength . Sir Phillip searches for Thelma , ultimately finding her , uncovers the tricks which have been played on them and they fall back in love . Released on June 21 , 1910 , the film was met with praise in The Moving Picture World . An incomplete print of the film survives in the Library of Congress archives . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Though the film is presumed lost , a surviving synopsis was published in the The Moving Picture World on June 25 , 1910 . It states : " Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father in the land of the midnight sun . Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings , famous in history . As such he is held in great reverence by his servants , who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king , and his daughter a princess . Outside of the years spent at school , Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone , her mother having died when she was a baby . When on a visit to her mother 's grave , Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington , a distinguished young Englishman , who is touring Norway in his private yacht . Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and , obtaining information as to where she lives , presents himself to Olaf , the Viking , and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter . Sir Phillip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride , and with her sails back to England . In London , Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip 's friends , who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis . Lady Clara , alone , of all Sir Philip 's old friends , wishes Thelma harm . She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip , and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far @-@ off Norway . This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma 's happiness , and force her to leave England . This she contrives to do , in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her , but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara . As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend , who is in love with Lady Clara , and wishes her to become his wife . This Lady Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her . Thelma , heartbroken , believing she has lost her husband 's love , returns to Norway , just as her father , the Viking , breathes his last . She , with his faithful followers , complies with his last wishes , which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him – sent out to sea in his burning ship . This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past . After straining her eyes for a final look at the departing ship , Thelma retraces her steps to her mother 's grave , and there , feeling that she is absolutely alone , prays for the strength to live . Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother , where first she met the man who won her heart , Sir Philip again finds Thelma . A few words suffice to show her how she has been tricked , and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart . In Sir Philip 's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father ; she starts out bravely to again face the world , now sure of his unending love . "

 Thelma is a film adaptation of the 1887 novel of the same name , it was written under the pen name Marie Corelli by Mary Mackay . During the era , her novels were so well @-@ known that some reviewers did not need to include a summary of the plot of the film to reader . A brief review in The Moving Picture World went so far as to say , " Practically everybody has read the novel , hence no long explanation is required . " Film historian Q. David Bowers , states , " Although present @-@ day scholars consider her works to be of no serious literary importance , she is remembered by the science @-@ fiction world for her vivacious imagination and her " scientific discoveries , " including interstellar travel via personal electricity . Her writings were known in her time for sublimated sex , fervent religiosity , and far @-@ fetched fantasy . " The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser , averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915 . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film assigns Theodore Marston as the director this film , but this would seem to be in error . The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film @-@ Index 1908 – 1915 . Bowers consulted one of the co @-@ authors of the book , Gunnar Lundquist , and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error . Theodore Marston worked with Pathé , Kinemacolor , Vitagraph and other companies , but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser . Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . 
 Cast in the role of Thelma was Anna Rosemond , one of two leading ladies , of the Thanhouser Company at the time . The more minor role of Sir Philip Errington was played by Frank H. Crane , who acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser . The conspiring Lady Clara Ashley was played by Yvonne Marvin , an actress that Bowers cites as her first and only known credit with Thanhouser . The role of Thelma 's father was played by Alphonse Ethier , a stage actor who had intermittent credited appearances in Thanhouser productions .

 The single reel drama , approximately 1000 feet long , was released on June 21 , 1910 . A review in The Moving Picture World praised the film by stating , " The picture is admirably staged and acted and maintains the interest from beginning to end . Of course the picture does not contain the detail of the novel , but it is a distinct improvement upon the play . It deserves a long run . " Identifying the theaters in which the film was show is made difficult by the number of Thelma plays and later Selig Polyscope 's own version of Thelma which appeared in 1911 . The popularity of the play predates the film adaptation by Thanhouser , one of the troupes to perform the play in 1910 were the Preston & <unk> Majestic Players . Once the Selig film was released , the two productions were often not distinguished in advertisements . One of the last known advertisements , conclusively for the Thanhouser production , was in 1913 . An incomplete 35 mm print of the film survives in the Library of Congress archives . This print is missing the main title , credits , and likely the conclusion of the film . Only the funeral scene shows red film tinting . 
 = The Concert for Bangladesh = 
 The Concert for Bangladesh ( or Bangla Desh , as the country was originally spelled ) was the collective name for two benefit concerts organised by former Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison and Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar . The concerts were held at 2 : 30 and 8 : 00 pm on Sunday , 1 August 1971 , at Madison Square Garden in New York City . The shows were organised to raise international awareness and fund relief efforts for refugees from East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) , following the Bangladesh Liberation War @-@ related genocide . The concerts were followed by a bestselling live album , a boxed three @-@ record set , and Apple Films ' concert documentary , which opened in cinemas in the spring of 1972 . 
 The event was the first @-@ ever benefit concert of such a magnitude and featured a supergroup of performers that included Harrison , fellow ex @-@ Beatle Ringo Starr , Bob Dylan , Eric Clapton , Billy Preston , Leon Russell and the band Badfinger . In addition , Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan – both of whom had ancestral roots in Bangladesh – performed an opening set of Indian classical music . Decades later , Shankar would say of the overwhelming success of the event : " In one day , the whole world knew the name of Bangladesh . It was a fantastic occasion ... " 
 The concerts were attended by a total of 40 @,@ 000 people , and raised close to US $ 250 @,@ 000 for Bangladesh relief , which was administered by UNICEF . Although the project was subsequently marred by financial problems – a result of the pioneering nature of the venture – the Concert for Bangladesh is recognised as a highly successful and influential humanitarian aid project , generating both awareness and considerable funds as well as providing valuable lessons and inspiration for projects that followed , notably Live Aid . By 1985 , through revenue raised from the Concert for Bangladesh live album and film , an estimated $ 12 million had been sent to Bangladesh in relief . 
 Sales of the live album and DVD release of the film continue to benefit the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF . 
 = = Background = = 
 As East Pakistan struggled to become the separate state of Bangladesh during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War , the political and military turmoil and associated atrocities led to a massive refugee problem , with at least 7 million displaced people pouring into neighbouring India . East Pakistan had recently endured devastation as a result of the Bhola cyclone , and the Bengalis ' desperate plight increased in March that year when torrential rains and floods arrived in the region , threatening a humanitarian disaster . Quoting figures available at the time , a Rolling Stone feature claimed that up to half a million Bengalis had been killed by the cyclone in November 1970 and that the Pakistani army 's subsequent campaign of slaughter under Operation Searchlight accounted for at least 250 @,@ 000 civilians , " by the most conservative estimates " . Following the mass exodus to Calcutta , a new threat arrived as the refugees faced starvation and the outbreak of diseases such as cholera . 
 Appalled at the situation affecting his homeland and relatives , Bengali musician Ravi Shankar first brought the issue to the attention of his friend George Harrison in the early months of 1971 , over dinner at Friar Park , according to Klaus Voormann 's recollection . By April , Shankar and Harrison were in Los Angeles working on the soundtrack to the film Raga ( 1971 ) , during which Harrison wrote the song " Miss O 'Dell " , commenting on corruption among the Indian authorities as aid shipments of rice from the West kept " going astray on [ their ] way to Bombay " . After returning to England to produce Badfinger 's Straight Up album ( 1971 ) and take part in sessions for John Lennon 's Imagine ( 1971 ) – all the while , being kept abreast of developments by Shankar , via newspaper and magazine cuttings – Harrison was back in LA to finish the Raga album in late June . By then , the Sunday Times in London had just published an influential article by Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas , which exposed the full horror of the Bangladesh atrocities , and a distraught Shankar approached Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering . Harrison later talked of spending " three months " on the phone organising the Concert for Bangladesh , implying that efforts were under way from late April onwards ; it is widely acknowledged that the project began in earnest during the last week of June 1971 , however , five or six weeks before the event took place on 1 August . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Shankar 's original hope was to raise $ 25 @,@ 000 through a benefit concert of his own , compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers . With Harrison 's commitment , and the record and film outlets available to him through the Beatles ' Apple Corps organisation , the idea soon grew to become a star @-@ studded musical event , mixing Western rock with Indian classical music , and it was to be held at the most prestigious venue in America : Madison Square Garden , in New York City . According to Chris O 'Dell , a music @-@ business administrator and former Apple employee , Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised , and started enthusing with wife Pattie Boyd and her about possible performers . Ringo Starr , Lennon , Eric Clapton , Leon Russell , Jim Keltner , Voormann , Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming . 
 O 'Dell set about contacting local musicians from the Harrisons ' rented house in Nichols Canyon , as Harrison took the long @-@ distance calls , hoping more than anything to secure Bob Dylan 's participation . Almost all of Harrison 's first @-@ choice names signed on immediately , while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers . A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good time in which to stage the concert , and as things transpired , the 1st of that month , a Sunday , was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice . 
 By the first week of July , Harrison was in a Los Angeles studio recording his purpose @-@ written song , " Bangla Desh " , with co @-@ producer Phil Spector . The song 's opening verse documents Shankar 's plea to Harrison for assistance , and the lyrics " My friend came to me with sadness in his eyes / Told me that he wanted help before his country dies " provided an enduring image for what United Nations Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan later recognised as the basic human aspect behind the cause . 
 Harrison then met with Badfinger in London to explain that he would have to abandon work on Straight Up , before flying to New York on 13 July to see Lennon . During the middle of July also , once back in Los Angeles , Harrison produced Shankar 's Bangladesh benefit record , an EP titled Joi Bangla . The latter featured contributions from East Bengal @-@ born Ali Akbar Khan , on sarod , and tabla player Alla Rakha . As with Harrison 's " Bangla Desh " , all profits from this recording would go to the newly established George Harrison – Ravi Shankar Special Emergency Relief Fund , to be distributed by UNICEF . Also around the middle of July , the upcoming concert by " George Harrison and Friends " was announced " via a minuscule ad buried in the back pages of the New York Times " , author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977 . Tickets sold out in no time , leading to the announcement of a second show . 
 Towards the end of the month , when all parties were due to meet in New York for rehearsals , Harrison had the commitment of a backing band comprising : Preston , on keyboards ; the four members of Badfinger , on acoustic rhythm guitars and tambourine ; Voormann and Keltner , on bass and drums , respectively ; and saxophonist Jim Horn 's so @-@ called " Hollywood Horns " , which included Chuck Findley , Jackie Kelso and Lou McCreary . Of the established stars , Leon Russell had committed also , but on the proviso that he be supported by members of his tour band . Eric Clapton insisted that he too would be there , even if O 'Dell and other insiders , knowing of the guitarist 's incapacity due to severe heroin addiction , were surprised that Harrison had considered him for the occasion . 
 Among Harrison 's former bandmates , Lennon initially agreed to take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono , as Harrison had apparently stipulated . Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts . Starr 's commitment had never been in question , and he interrupted the filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria , Spain , in order to attend . Paul McCartney declined to take part , however , citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles ' legal problems on their break @-@ up . 
 = = Rehearsals = = 
 The Harrisons decamped to the Park Lane Hotel in New York City , and the first rehearsal took place on Monday , 26 July , at Nola Studios on West 57th Street . Harrison had written a possible setlist for the concert while sketching design ideas for Shankar 's Joi Bangla picture sleeve . As well as the songs he would go on to perform on 1 August , Harrison 's list included his own compositions " All Things Must Pass " – " with Leon [ Russell ] " , apparently – " Art of Dying " and the just @-@ recorded B @-@ side " Deep Blue " ; Clapton 's song " Let It Rain " appeared also , while the suggestions for Dylan 's set were " If Not for You " , " Watching the River Flow " ( his recent , Leon Russell @-@ produced single ) and " Blowin ' in the Wind " . Only Harrison , Voormann , the six @-@ piece horn section , and Badfinger 's Pete Ham , Joey Molland , Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins were at Nola Studios on that first day , and subsequent rehearsals were similarly carried out in " <unk> and drabs " , as Harrison put it . Only the final run @-@ through , on the night before the concert , resembled a complete band rehearsal . 
 On Tuesday , 27 July , Harrison and Shankar , accompanied by a pipe @-@ smoking Allen Klein , held a press conference to promote the two shows ; notoriously performance @-@ shy , Harrison admitted : " Just thinking about it makes me shake . " The " Bangla Desh " charity single was issued in America on 28 July , with a UK release following two days later . Ringo Starr arrived on the Thursday , and by Friday , 30 July , Russell was in town , interrupting his US tour . Russell 's band members Claudia Linnear and Don Preston were added to Don Nix 's choir of backing singers ; Preston would switch to lead guitar for Russell 's solo spot during the shows , just as bassist Carl Radle would replace Voormann temporarily . By this point , Clapton 's participation was gravely in doubt , and Harrison had drafted in Jesse Ed Davis as a probable replacement . The ex @-@ Taj Mahal guitarist received last @-@ minute coaching from Voormann , who was more than familiar with Harrison 's songs , as well as those by Billy Preston and Starr . 
 The final rehearsal , or the first for some of the participants , was combined with the concert soundcheck , at Madison Square Garden , late on 31 July . Both Dylan and Clapton finally appeared at the soundcheck that night . Even then , Clapton was in the early stages of heroin withdrawal – only a cameraman supplying him with some methadone would result in the English guitarist taking the stage the following day , after his young girlfriend had been unsuccessful in purchasing uncut heroin for him on the street . To Harrison 's frustration , Dylan was having severe doubts about performing in such a big @-@ event atmosphere and still would not commit to playing . " Look , it 's not my scene , either , " Harrison countered . " At least you 've played on your own in front of a crowd before . I 've never done that . " 
 Through Harrison 's friendship with the Band , Jonathan Taplin served as production manager , while Chip Monck was in charge of lighting . Gary Kellgren from the nearby Record Plant was brought in to record the concerts , overseen by Spector , and " Klein 's people " , led by director Saul Swimmer , would handle the filming of the event . The official concert photographers were Tom Wilkes and Barry Feinstein , the pair responsible for the artwork on Harrison 's acclaimed 1970 triple album , All Things Must Pass .

 = = = Afternoon show = = = 
 Except for brief support roles in December 1969 for both the Delaney & Bonnie and Friends band and Lennon 's Plastic Ono Band , the Concert for Bangladesh was Harrison 's first live appearance before a paying audience since the Beatles had quit touring in August 1966 . Dylan had stopped touring that same year , although he had made a moderately successful comeback in August 1969 at the Isle of Wight Festival , his most recent live performance at this point . Speaking in 2005 , Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described the " buzz " preceding the first Concert for Bangladesh show as being at a level unexperienced in New York since the Beatles ' 1966 visit . 
 In his role as " master of ceremonies " , Harrison began the afternoon show ( or matinee ) by asking the audience to " try to get into " the opening , Indian music portion of the programme . He then introduced Ravi Shankar and the latter 's fellow musicians – sarodya Ali Akbar Khan , tabla player Alla Rakha , and Kamala Chakravarty on tamboura . Shankar first explained the reason for the concerts , after which the four musicians performed a traditional <unk> , in the format of a khyal rather than a standard raga , titled " Bangla Dhun " . Their set included a second piece , authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest , citing Harrison 's own description that each show 's Indian music segment lasted for three @-@ quarters of an hour , whereas only seventeen minutes of music appears on the Concert for Bangladesh live album . The recital was afforded a " fidgety respect " from fans eager to discover the identity of Harrison 's advertised " Friends " , although the audience 's goodwill was more than evident . A short intermission ensued while the stage was cleared and a Dutch TV film was shown , displaying footage of the atrocities and natural tragedies taking place in former East Pakistan . 
 To thunderous applause from the New York crowd , Harrison appeared on stage along with his temporary band , comprising Ringo Starr , a very sick Eric Clapton , Leon Russell , Billy Preston , Klaus Voormann , Jim Keltner and eighteen others . Backed by this " full Phil Spector / All Things Must Pass rock orchestra " , Harrison began the Western portion of the concert with " Wah @-@ Wah " , followed by his Beatles hit song ' " Something " and the gospel @-@ rocker " Awaiting on You All " . Harrison then handed the spotlight over to Preston , who performed his only sizeable hit ( thus far ) , " That 's the Way God Planned It " , followed by Starr , whose song " It Don 't Come Easy " had recently established the drummer as a solo artist . Nicholas Schaffner was in the audience for this first show and later described Starr 's turn as having received the " biggest ovation " of the afternoon . 
 Next up was Harrison 's " Beware of Darkness " , with guest vocals on the third verse by Russell , who covered the song on his concurrent album , Leon Russell and the Shelter People ( 1971 ) . After pausing to introduce the band , Harrison followed this with one of the best @-@ received moments in both the shows – a charging version of the White Album track " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " , featuring him and Clapton " duelling " on lead guitar during the long instrumental playout . Both the band introduction and " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " are among the few selections from the afternoon show that were included on the album and in the film . Another one was Leon Russell 's medley of the Rolling Stones ' " Jumpin ' Jack Flash " and the Coasters ' " Young Blood " , which was also a highlight of Russell 's live shows at the time . With Don Preston crossing the stage to play lead guitar with Harrison , there were now temporarily four electric guitarists in the line @-@ up . Don Preston , Harrison and Claudia Linnear supplied supporting vocals behind Russell . 
 In an effective change of pace , Harrison picked up his acoustic guitar , now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second capo @-@ ed acoustic , and Don Nix 's gospel choir , off to stage @-@ left . The ensuing " Here Comes the Sun " – the first live performance of the song , as for Harrison 's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received . At this point , Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and , as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987 , he looked down at the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word " Bob " followed by a question mark . " And I looked around , " Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan 's entrance , " and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on , coming [ pumps his arms and shoulders ] ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure he was going to do it . " Among the audience , Schaffner wrote , there was " total astonishment " at this new arrival . 
 As Harrison had envisaged , Dylan 's mini @-@ set was the crowning glory of the Concert for Bangladesh for many observers . Backed by just Harrison , Russell ( now playing Voormann 's Fender Precision bass ) and Starr on tambourine , Dylan played five of his decade @-@ defining songs from the 1960s : " A Hard Rain 's A @-@ Gonna Fall " , " Blowin ' in the Wind " , " It Takes a Lot to Laugh , It Takes a Train to Cry " , " Love Minus Zero / No Limit " and " Just Like a Woman " . 
 Harrison and the band then returned to perform a final segment , consisting of " Hear Me Lord " and his recent international number 1 hit , " My Sweet Lord " , followed by the song of the moment – " Bangla Desh " . 
 = = = Evening show = = = 
 Harrison was reportedly delighted with the outcome of the first show , as was Dylan , who accompanied him back to the Park Lane Hotel afterwards . They discussed possible changes to the setlist for the evening performance , beginning at 8 pm . 
 The songs played and their sequence differed slightly between the first and second shows , most noticeably with Harrison 's opening and closing mini @-@ sets . After " Wah @-@ Wah " , he brought " My Sweet Lord " forward in the order , followed by " Awaiting on You All " , before handing over to Billy Preston . The afternoon 's " creaky " " Hear Me Lord " was dropped , so that the post @-@ Dylan band segment consisted of only two numbers : " Something " , to close the show , and a particularly passionate reading of " Bangla Desh " , as an encore . Dylan likewise made some changes , swapping " Blowin ' in the Wind " and " It Takes a Lot to Laugh " in the order , and then playing a well @-@ received " Mr. Tambourine Man " in place of " Love Minus Zero " . 
 The second show was widely acknowledged as superior to the afternoon performance , although Village Voice reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar – Khan opening set with a lack of respect . Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha 's hand drums , Heckman observed , so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod . 
 During the Western portion of the show , Harrison 's voice was more confident this time around , the music " perhaps slightly more lustrous " , according to Rolling Stone . Towards the end of " That 's the Way God Planned It " , Preston felt compelled to get up from behind his Hammond organ and take a show @-@ stealing boogie across the front of the stage . 
 Dylan 's walk @-@ on was again the show 's " real cortex @-@ snapping moment " , Heckman opined . Dylan finished his final song , " Just Like a Woman " , with a victorious salute – " holding up both fists like a strongman " , Rolling Stone 's reviewer remarked shortly afterwards . Following Dylan 's set , Harrison introduced the band , before taking the show " to yet another peak " with " Something " . Watching from the wings , Pattie Harrison described her husband 's performance throughout that evening as " magnificent " . 
 Following the two sellout concerts , all the participants attended a celebratory party in a basement club known as Ungano 's . Dylan was so elated , Harrison recalled sixteen years later , " he picked me up and hugged me and he said , ' God ! If only we 'd done three shows ! ' " Like Harrison , the experience of playing at Madison Square that day did not lead to Dylan immediately re @-@ embracing the concert stage ; only a brief guest appearance with the Band on New Year 's Eve 1971 – 72 and sitting in during a John Prine club gig eventuated before he returned to touring in January 1974 . 
 The post @-@ concert party featured live performances from Harrison and Preston , after which a " roaring drunk " Phil Spector played a " unique " version of " Da Doo Ron Ron " . The celebrations broke up in the early hours once Keith Moon of the Who began smashing up the drum kit , which actually belonged to Badfinger 's Mike Gibbins . 
 = = Reviews = = 
 Harrison 's manager , Allen Klein , immediately boasted of the entirely peaceful nature of the event : " There was no rioting . Not one policeman was allowed in there ... Zero ! " In fact , as reported in The Village Voice on 12 August , midway through the evening show , a crowd of 200 non @-@ ticket @-@ holders charged and broke through the doors of Madison Square Garden . Aside from this episode , press reports concerning the Concert for Bangladesh shows were overwhelmingly positive . 
 The appearance of Bob Dylan on the same stage as two former Beatles caused a sensation , and lavish praise was bestowed on George Harrison . " Beatlemania Sweeps a City ! " was a typical headline , and in Britain the NME declared the concerts " The Greatest Rock Spectacle of the Decade ! " Billboard described the artists ' performances as " their best music ever " and commented on the likelihood of a live album from the concerts : " there is no politics involved . What is involved is starving children and for once , relief through 35 musicians who should represent the feeling of anyone who loves their music . " 
 Dylan 's choice of songs , particularly the " apocalyptic " " A Hard Rain 's A @-@ Gonna Fall " , were found to have a new relevance in the context of the early 1970s – the words made " the more chilling for the passage of years " , opined Rolling Stone . The same publication stated of Starr 's contribution : " Seeing Ringo Starr drumming and singing on stage has a joy in it that is one of the happiest feelings on earth still . " Ravi Shankar 's role as concert instigator and the true conscience of the UNICEF shows was also noted . Musically , The Village Voice observed , the pairing of Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan was " almost as unique as the mix of Dylan and Harrison " . 
 In the wider countercultural context of the time , with disillusion increasingly rife with each post @-@ Woodstock rock event , commentators viewed the concerts as , in the words of Rolling Stone , " a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties " . Writing in 1981 , NME critic Bob Woffinden likened it to a " rediscovery of faith " , adding : " Harrison had put rock music back on course . " Among Harrison 's biographers , Alan Clayson describes the 1971 – 72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as " the George Harrison Moment " , while Gary Tillery has written : " The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison 's stature as something more than just a major celebrity ... He changed the perception of recording artists , making it clear they could be good world citizens too – willing to set aside their egos and paychecks in order to help people who were suffering . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Politically , as Bangladeshi historian Farida Majid would note , the " warmth , care and goodwill " of the August 1971 concerts " echoed all over the world " , inspiring volunteers to approach UNICEF and offer their assistance , as well as eliciting private donations to the Bangladesh disaster fund . Although the altruistic spirit would soon wane once more , the Concert for Bangladesh is invariably seen as the inspiration and model for subsequent rock charity benefits , from 1985 's Live Aid and Farm Aid to the Concert for New York City and Live 8 in the twenty @-@ first century . Unlike those later concerts , which benefitted from continuous media coverage of the causes they supported , the Harrison – Shankar project was responsible for identifying the problem and establishing Bangladesh 's plight in the minds of mainstream Western society . According to Gary Tillery : " Because of its positioning as a humanitarian effort , all descriptions of the show included a summary of the catastrophe in South Asia . Overnight , because of their fascination with rock stars , masses of people became educated about geopolitical events they had not even been aware of the week before . The tragedy in Bangladesh moved to the fore as an international issue . " One of these revelations was that America was supplying weaponry and financial aid to the Pakistani army , led by General Yahya Khan . 
 Harrison 's musical biographer , Simon Leng , identifies friendship as the key factor behind the success of the two UNICEF shows , both in bringing all the participants together on the stage and in the affection with which the audience and music critics viewed the event . Klaus Voormann , a close friend of Harrison 's since 1960 , has often cited this quality as well . 
 Friendship played out through the next , significantly more lucrative stages of the Bangladesh relief project , as the associated live album and concert film were prepared for release . Harrison had assured all the main performers that their appearance would be removed from these releases if the event turned out " lousy " , to save anyone having to risk possible embarrassment . Having sent out personalised letters of thanks to all the participants on 1 September , he expressed his gratitude further by guesting on Billy Preston 's first album on A & M Records that autumn and donating a new song to Jesse Ed Davis . 
 Around the same time , there were rumours of a possible repeat of the New York concert triumph , to be held at London 's Wembley Stadium in early October . Harrison and Klein quashed the idea , but an English version of the Concert for Bangladesh did take place , on 18 September , before 30 @,@ 000 fans at The Oval in south London , with a bill featuring the likes of the Who , the Faces , Mott the Hoople , America and Lindisfarne . On 22 September , George and Pattie Harrison arrived home in the UK , with mixing having been completed on the upcoming live album , and Harrison due to meet with Patrick Jenkin of the British Treasury , to deal with the unforeseen obstacle of a " purchase tax " being levied on the album . This was one of a number of problems that hindered Harrison 's Bangladesh project following the Madison Square Garden shows , and the British politician would allegedly tell him : " Sorry ! It is all very well for your high ideals , but Britain equally needs the money ! " 
 On 5 June 1972 , in recognition of their " pioneering " fundraising efforts for the refugees of Bangladesh , George Harrison , Ravi Shankar and Allen Klein were jointly honoured by UNICEF with its " Child Is the Father of the Man " award . In 2008 , moves were under way in the Bangladeshi High Court to have Harrison officially recognised and honoured as a hero for his role during the troubled birth of the nation . 
 = = Funds and controversy = = 
 The two Madison Square Garden shows raised US $ 243 @,@ 418 @.@ 50 , which was given to UNICEF to administer on 12 August 1971 . By December , Capitol Records presented a cheque to Apple Corps for around $ 3 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 for advance sales of the Concert for Bangladesh live album . 
 Aside from complaints regarding the high retail price for the three @-@ record set , particularly in Britain – a result of the government 's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project 's fundraising . Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand , and was therefore not granted tax @-@ exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein 's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years . In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s , Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $ 8 million and $ 10 million . Before then , in early 1972 , New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein 's accounts . Klein responded by suing the magazine for $ 150 million in damages , and although the suit was later withdrawn , the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein 's mismanagement of The Beatles ' finances . That year , an estimated $ 2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way ; finally , in 1981 , $ 8 @.@ 8 million was added to that total following the audit . 
 By June 1985 , according to an article in the Los Angeles Times , nearly $ 12 million had been sent to Bangladesh for relief . Around this time , Harrison would give Bob Geldof " meticulous advice " to help ensure that Live Aid 's estimated £ 50 million found its way , as intended , to victims of the Ethiopian famine . 
 Speaking in the 1990s , Harrison said of the Bangladesh relief effort : " Now it 's all settled and the UN own the rights to it themselves , and I think there 's been about 45 million dollars made . " Sales of the DVD and CD of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh continue to benefit the cause , now known as the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF .

 The Concert for Bangladesh was satirised in two episodes of The Simpsons : " Like Father , Like Clown " and " I 'm with Cupid " . In the former , Krusty plays the album while a visitor at the Simpsons household . In " I 'm with Cupid " , Apu 's record collection contains The Concert Against Bangladesh , which features a picture of a mushroom cloud on the cover , reflecting Indian − Pakistani nuclear rivalry in the region . ( In fact , India supported Bangladesh during its struggle for independence . ) 
 The July 1974 ( " Dessert " ) issue of National Lampoon magazine satirised Tom Wilkes ' original cover design for The Concert for Bangladesh , by using a chocolate version of the starving child , the head of which has had a bite taken out of it . Two years before this , the National Lampoon team spoofed Harrison 's humanitarian role on record , in their track " The Concert in Bangla Desh " on the Radio Dinner album . In the sketch , two Bangladeshi stand @-@ up comedians ( played by Tony Hendra and Christopher Guest ) perform to starving refugees in an attempt to collect a bowlful of rice so that George Harrison can mount a hunger strike . 
 Crowd noises from the Concert for Bangladesh were put into Aerosmith 's cover of " Train Kept A @-@ Rollin ' " by producer Jack Douglas . Some of stills photographer Barry Feinstein 's shots from the 1971 concerts were used on the covers of subsequent albums by the participating artists , notably the compilations Bob Dylan 's Greatest Hits Vol .

 George Harrison himself sent up the benefit @-@ show concept on film , in the Dick Clement @-@ directed HandMade comedy Water , in 1985 .

 = 1940 Louisiana hurricane = 
 The 1940 Louisiana hurricane caused record flooding across much of the Southern United States in August 1940 . The second tropical cyclone and hurricane of the annual hurricane season , it formed from a frontal low off the west coast of Florida on August 3 . Initially a weak disturbance , it moved generally westward , slowly gaining in intensity . Early on August 4 , the depression attained tropical storm intensity . Ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a much stronger tropical cyclone than initially suggested . After reaching hurricane strength on August 5 south of the Mississippi River Delta , the storm strengthened further into a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 71 inHg ) at 0600 UTC on August 7 . The hurricane moved ashore near Sabine Pass , Texas later that day at peak strength . Once inland , the storm executed a sharp curve to the north and quickly weakened , degenerating into a tropical storm on August 8 before dissipating over Arkansas on August 10 . 
 Reports of a potentially destructive hurricane near the United States Gulf Coast forced thousands of residents in low @-@ lying areas to evacuate prior to the storm moving inland . Offshore , the hurricane generated rough seas and a strong storm surge , peaking at 6 @.@ 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 95 m ) on the western edge of Lake Pontchartrain . The anomalously high tides flooded many of Louisiana 's outlying islands , inundating resorts . Strong winds caused moderate infrastructural damage , primarily in Texas , though its impact was mainly to communication networks along the US Gulf Coast which were disrupted by the winds . However , much of the property and crop damage wrought by the hurricane was due to the torrential rainfall it produced in low @-@ lying areas , setting off record floods . Rainfall peaked at 37 @.@ 5 in ( 953 mm ) in Miller Island off Louisiana , making it the wettest tropical cyclone in state history . Nineteen official weather stations in both Texas and Louisiana recorded 24 @-@ hour rainfall totals for the month of August as a result of the slow @-@ moving hurricane . Property , livestock , and crops – especially cotton , corn , and pecan crops – were heavily damaged . Entire ecosystems were also altered by the rainfall . Overall , the storm caused $ 10 @.@ 75 million in damages and seven fatalities . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In early August , an extratropical trough moved off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia , with a stationary front extending from it . A weak low @-@ pressure area began to develop at the southern end of the front just offshore of Jacksonville , Florida . Initially , the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida , and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time . Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico , however , observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation . As a result , the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200 UTC on August 3 . At the time , weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation , though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012 @.@ 5 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 90 inHg ) . Moving west @-@ southwest , the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000 UTC on August 4 . Late that evening , the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve . Strengthening continued into the following day , and ships in the storm 's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested . A ship reported the first gale @-@ force winds associated with the storm at 2100 UTC on August 4 . The S.S. Connecticut observed force 11 winds , the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel . A minimum pressure of 995 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 39 inHg ) was analyzed for the system at 0600 UTC on August 5 based on an observation from a nearby ship . 
 At 1800 UTC on August 5 , the storm strengthened to hurricane strength , the first tropical cyclone of the season to do so . At the time , the hurricane was moving very slowly westward , allowing it to strengthen despite its close proximity to land . The hurricane reached Category 2 intensity by 0600 UTC on August 7 . The storm made landfall at peak intensity at around 2100 UTC later that day near Sabine Pass , Texas . At the time , the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , with the storm 's maximum winds extending out 10 mi ( 15 km ) from its center . A weather station in Sabine Pass recorded a barometric pressure of 972 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 71 inHg ) , which was analyzed to have been the lowest pressure measured in association with the storm . After moving inland , the storm immediately curved northward and began to gradually weaken . At 0600 UTC on August 8 , the cyclone weakened to tropical storm strength while situated over East Texas , and later degenerated to a tropical depression by 1200 UTC the following day . The depression persisted into Arkansas , where it transitioned into a trough of low pressure at 1800 UTC on August 10 after its center of circulation lacked the well @-@ defined closed circulation characteristic of tropical cyclones . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Upon reaching hurricane strength off the United States Gulf Coast , hurricane warnings were issued for coastal regions from Lake Charles , Louisiana to Sabine Pass , Texas on August 7 . Storm warnings were placed for areas east of Lake Charles to Grand Isle , Louisiana and areas west of Sabine Pass to Velasco , Texas . Offshore vessels were also warned of the storm in areas between Bay St. Louis , Mississippi and Galveston , Texas . At the time , the hurricane was forecast to make landfall slightly east of Port Arthur , Texas . In Texas , these warnings were delivered to residents via factory whistles . Evacuation procedures also began as a result of the approaching storm . The Spindletop near Beaumont , Texas and other nearby oil fields were evacuated . Coastal cities near Port Arthur , Texas were also evacuated by state highway police . Evacuees took shelter in refitted schools nearby . In the New Orleans , Louisiana area , several thousand residents were evacuated in advance of the storm . On Delacroix Island , Louisiana , 1 @,@ 000 residents evacuated . Rail and airline operations were halted as a precautionary measure , but were later resumed after the storm passed . All storm warnings were ceased by midnight on August 8 . 
 Even before making landfall , the hurricane caused extensive damage in Louisiana , due in part to the hurricane 's slow speed and close proximity to the state coast . Winds as high as 60 mph ( 100 km / h ) brushed the coastline , causing extensive damage . Storm surge pushed coastal waters to near @-@ record heights , inundating low @-@ lying areas . Near Morgan City , Louisiana , 19 people went missing after going on a fishing trip ; they were later found marooned at Atchafalaya Basin . The schooner J.W. <unk> was abandoned during the storm 135 mi ( 215 km ) south of the Mississippi River Delta , though its crew was also later rescued . Storm surge peaked at 6 @.@ 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 95 m ) above @-@ average in western portions of Lake Pontchartrain . A bridge crossing Thunder Bayou , which extended west of the lake , was washed out by the waves . Similarly , a station at Calcasieu Pass reported a storm surge 4 @.@ 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 46 m ) high . Conservation officials feared the disturbance would disrupt the seafood and muskrat production . After the storm , it was estimated 75 @,@ 000 muskrats were killed by the storm 's effects . Offshore , Grand Isle was inundated by the strong waves . Around Houma , sugar cane crops were damaged . The hurricane was the strongest to impact Cameron since the tenth hurricane of the 1886 Atlantic hurricane season ; strong gusts peaked at 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) , disrupting communication lines , thus isolating the city from other locations in the state . The high tides inundated town streets under 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) . Other areas extending from western Louisiana to Mobile , Alabama reported communication disruptions . In New Orleans , strong winds uprooted signboards and blew debris across the city streets . Several houses in Shell Beach and Delacroix Island were leveled by strong winds . 
 Due to the storm 's slow movement just offshore the Louisiana coast , the hurricane became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history , with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state . Of the state 's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones , the two highest were measurements taken during the hurricane . Precipitation peaked at 37 @.@ 5 in ( 953 mm ) on Miller Island . For any given 20 @,@ 000 mi2 ( 50 @,@ 000 km / h2 ) area of Louisiana , the maximum rainfall averaged 12 @.@ 1 in ( 307 @.@ 3 mm ) . Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24 @-@ hour rainfall total records . The highest of these was in Crowley , where 19 @.@ 76 in ( 501 @.@ 9 mm ) of precipitation fell on August 9 ; the station would record 33 @.@ 71 in ( 856 @.@ 2 mm ) of rain over the course of the storm . The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) of floodwater . In Cameron , the storm dropped 21 in ( 533 mm ) of rain was reported . In St. Landry Parish , bayous flowed over their banks , causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas . In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana , the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauvé 's Crevasse in 1927 . There , whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall , and only one was known to be alive by 1947 . The floods inundated roughly 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 800 @,@ 000 hectares ) of land in Louisiana . Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October 1940 . As a result , cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses , as well as pecans . Livestock also saw large losses . <unk> areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company 's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa . Across the state , the hurricane caused $ 9 million in damages , though only six fatalities resulted , relatively less than most storms of similar scale . The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm , as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles . 
 In East Texas , where the hurricane made landfall late on August 7 , strong winds were felt across the region . Sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) were widespread , with occasional gusts peaking in excess of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . In Port Arthur , a barometer recorded a minimum pressure of 978 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 87 inHg ) , establishing a new record for the lowest pressure measured by the particular weather station . The same station recorded 5 @.@ 87 in ( 149 @.@ 1 mm ) of rainfall . Elsewhere in Port Arthur , strong winds caused significant damage to local oil refineries , with slight to moderate damage to other homes and businesses . Six people were injured in the city . Property damage in Jefferson County , containing Port Arthur and nearby suburbs , was estimated at $ 1 million . The city 's communication and power service was cut during the storm . A weather station near Sabine Pass recorded a similarly low pressure of 973 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 74 inHg ) . In Sabine Pass , strong winds unroofed houses , uprooted trees , and destroyed billboards . At the nearby Ged Oil Field , four wooden oil derricks were blown down . In Beaumont , three people were injured due to flying window and structural debris . Further inland , the hurricane produced considerable rainfall , though relatively less than in Louisiana . Six weather stations in the state set new 24 – hour precipitation records for August . A measurement of 6 @.@ 99 in ( 177 @.@ 4 mm ) on August 8 in <unk> was the highest of these records . However , maximum rainfall in the state was estimated to be in excess of 10 in ( 255 mm ) . The rice crop was particularly damaged by the rainfall . In Jefferson County , crop damage was estimated between $ 450 @,@ 000 – $ 500 @,@ 000 . In Texas , the hurricane caused $ 1 @.@ 75 million in damages and resulted in one fatality . 
 = 1995 India cyclone = 
 In November 1995 , a tropical cyclone struck southeastern India and later spawned a rare snowstorm in Nepal , triggering the deadliest mountain trekking incident in the country 's history . The storm originated from the monsoon trough on November 7 in the Bay of Bengal , east of India , becoming the penultimate storm of the 1995 North Indian Ocean cyclone season . Moving northwestward , the system gradually intensified while moving toward land , eventually developing an eye in the middle of the convection . Reaching peak winds of at least 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) classified the system as a very severe cyclonic storm on November 8 , in line with intensity estimates from the American @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) . On November 9 , the cyclone made landfall near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa . Atypical for most November storms , the system continued to the north and dissipated over Nepal on November 11 . 
 In India , the cyclone 's strong winds were accompanied by heavy rainfall and a storm surge of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) that inundated the coastline several hundred feet inland . Power lines , crops , and houses were damaged , and many boats were damaged , causing several nautical fatalities . The cyclone killed at least 128 people in India , with hundreds remaining unaccounted for , and damage was estimated at RS $ 1 @.@ 1 billion ( US $ 32 @.@ 2 million ) . In neighboring Bangladesh , high waves killed 45 people after sinking or sweeping away four ships . The cyclone later spawned a rare November snowstorm across eastern Nepal , with depths reaching 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 in ) . The snowfall occurred without warning amid the busy mountain trekking season , and there were several avalanches and landslides across the country . One such incident killed 24 people at a lodge near Gokyo , and there were 63 deaths related to the cyclone in the country . The Nepal government launched the largest search and rescue mission in the country 's history , rescuing 450 people , some of whom trapped for days in the snow .

 In early November 1995 , the monsoon trough was active across the Bay of Bengal , with several associated circulations . A disturbance near the Andaman Islands became the focus of the overall system on November 6 . Located south of the subtropical ridge , the system moved to the west @-@ northwest . Based on the improved organization , the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on November 6 , and at 00 : 00 UTC the next day initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03B just west of the Andaman Islands . Six hours later , the IMD likewise classified the system as a depression . 
 After development , the depression steadily intensified while moving through the Bay of Bengal ; rounding the ridge , it accelerated and turned more to the northwest . The IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression by 12 : 00 UTC on November 7 , and further to a cyclonic storm by 00 : 00 UTC on the following day . The convection , or thunderstorms , organized into a comma @-@ like structure , which further evolved into a central dense overcast . Intensification was also aided by increased upper @-@ level divergence , or the increased upward movement of air . At 09 : 00 UTC on November 8 , the IMD upgraded the system to a severe cyclonic storm , and six hours later to a very severe cyclonic storm . By that time , an eye had developed , described by the IMD as a " banding @-@ type eye " . As such , the agency estimated peak 3 minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The minimum barometric pressure was estimated at 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . The JTWC estimated slightly higher 1 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . 
 Around 05 : 00 UTC on November 9 , the cyclone made landfall at peak intensity in eastern India , near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha , and close to the city of <unk> . Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , winds could have been as high as 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) , based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique . After moving ashore , the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land . By 12 : 00 UTC on November 9 , the JTWC discontinued advisories . The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November 10 . On the next day , the system degenerated into a remnant low , by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal . The circulation dissipated , although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Moving ashore eastern India , the cyclone brought strong winds , with a peak gust of 115 km / h ( 68 mph ) at the Visakhapatnam Airport , well southwest of the landfall location . Winds in Gopalpur , Odisha were estimated at 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The lowest barometric pressure in India was 982 @.@ 1 mbar ( 29 @.@ 00 inHg ) in Kalingapatnam . The storm produced a storm surge of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) , which spread several hundred feet inland . In addition to the winds and surge , the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall along its path , particularly in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha , peaking at over 200 mm ( 8 in ) . 
 Along the Indian coast from Andhra Pradesh to West Bengal , 2 @,@ 688 boats were damaged , accounting for 48 fishermen deaths in Visakhapatnam alone . An Indian Coast Guard ship was washed ashore near Bhubaneswar , trapping the crew inside until they were rescued . In Andhra Pradesh , the high winds damaged 21 km ( 13 mi ) of power lines , affecting 12 @,@ 733 electrical units . The storm damaged 27 @,@ 945 houses , mostly in Orissa . In the state , the storm 's high winds and rainfall wrecked stalls for a festival in Paradip , and canceled a test cricket match in Cuttack to be held between India and New Zealand . There was also widespread crop damage on 11 @,@ 043 @,@ 653 ha ( 27 @,@ 289 @,@ 460 acres ) of crop fields . In West Bengal , paddy crops , mustard trees , and potatoes were damaged . Throughout India , the cyclone killed 73 people , with 402 people missing after the storm . The International Disaster Database indicated that the storm killed 128 people and caused US $ 46 @.@ 3 million in damage . 
 Farther east , officials in Bangladesh evacuated residents along offshore islands , while boats were ordered to return to the coast . The storm ultimately produced 60 to 80 km / h ( 37 to 50 mph ) winds along with heavy rainfall in the country . High seas , reaching 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) in height , capsized a boat in the <unk> River and left three other boats missing , killing 45 people . The waves also flooded about 3 @,@ 000 ha ( 7 @,@ 400 acres ) of crop fields . 
 Atypical for November , the storm continued northward and became the most intense cyclone to affect Nepal in the autumn in 50 years . The country 's Department of Meteorology did not issue warnings for the storm , as no mountain trekking teams requested a forecast . As a result , many mountain climbers and guides were caught off guard , and thousands of mountaineers from around the world were in the region when the cyclone struck . When the energy from the storm spread into the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal , a process known as orographic lift occurred , whereby the moisture coalesced in mountainous regions . At elevations generally below 3 @,@ 500 m ( 11 @,@ 500 ft ) , the precipitation resulted in 50 to 200 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) of rainfall , reaching 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) in <unk> . In some areas , totals were 3 @,@ 000 % of the average November rainfall , which is usually a dry month . At higher elevations , the precipitation caused intense snowfall , reaching up to 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 in ) deep in <unk> . <unk> recorded 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 47 in ) of snowfall . The Khumbu region of eastern Nepal received rare snowfall , as it is normally part of a rain shadow . The village of Thame was buried for eight days until people could travel freely again ; the rarity of the snowfall meant that residents did not have skis or snow shoes . By November 14 , or five days after the arrival of the storm , the snow had receded . 
 The heavy snowfall across Nepal produced landslides and avalanches , mostly on November 10 and into the following day . Near Gokyo , two avalanches combined and destroyed a lodge housing 25 mountain climbers , killing all but one ; the survivor was rescued after being trapped for 40 hours . The hikers were climbing Gokyo Ri , a mountain 18 km ( 11 mi ) southeast of Mount Everest . This marked the deadliest avalanche in Nepal to affect a hiking expedition . Another avalanche killed seven people in Kangchenjunga . With levels reaching as high as the roofs of houses , the heavy snowfall damaged the roofs of several buildings , including one school , and killed about 100 animals . Across the country , the storm killed 63 people , 33 of them related to avalanches , including 22 foreigners , although the Trekking Workers ' Association believed the death toll was higher . Several of the deaths were the result of collapsed houses , while others were the result of people freezing to death . The Mani <unk> festival likely prevented additional deaths , as over 1 @,@ 000 residents in the hardest hit areas left for the ceremony . After the snowfall , the Nepal government coordinated the largest search and rescue mission in the country 's history , utilizing helicopters to rescue 450 stranded people , encompassing an area of 600 km2 ( 230 sq mi ) , before the mission was ended on November 15 . Several of the rescued people required medical attention . Stranded victims had to stay in the snow for a day and a half before being spotted and rescued , and inclement weather disrupted efforts . 
 = Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey = 
 Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a motion @-@ based dark ride located in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed areas of Islands of Adventure in Orlando , Florida , Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City , California , and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka , Japan . The ride takes guests through scenes and environments in and around Hogwarts Castle from the Harry Potter series of books and films . Mark Woodbury , president of Universal Creative , described the ride as an in @-@ depth look at the world of Harry Potter , which utilizes never before seen technology which transforms " the theme park experience as you know it " . The ride first opened at Islands of Adventure with The Wizarding World of Harry Potter on June 18 , 2010 , at Universal Studios Japan on July 15 , 2014 and at Universal Studios Hollywood on April 7 , 2016 . 
 = = Summary = = 
 This summary describes the attraction at Islands of Adventure . The attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood may have significant differences , mainly the integration of 3D technology . 
 Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey uses KUKA <unk> technology , which allows the seats to pivot while being held above the track by a robotic arm . However , the ride is not a roller coaster but a scenic dark ride . The experience includes a flight around Hogwarts castle , an encounter with the Whomping Willow and a horde of Dementors , and a Quidditch match . The ride drops , spins around , twists and turns , but does not turn upside down , though passengers sometimes lie flat on their backs . Over @-@ the @-@ shoulder bars are used to secure guests in their seats , and a single parabolic metal bar is used as a hand grip . At the conclusion of the ride , guests exit into " Filch 's Emporium of Confiscated Goods " gift shop . As of September 2015 , Universal Express Pass is not available for this attraction , but a single rider queue is available . 
 = = = Queue area = = = 
 To enter the ride , guests walk through the gates of Hogwarts and begin their journey in the dungeons where they see items featured in the movies and books . Passengers enter through the castle doors , go to the lockers , queue outside in the green house and then enter the back castle doors . Objects recognizable from the series include the Mirror of Erised , the Hogwarts House Jewels and talking portraits . As guests proceed throughout the hallways , they encounter replicas of the rooms of Hogwarts castle , including the Headmaster 's office , the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom and the Gryffindor common room . In the Headmaster 's office , Professor Dumbledore extends a warm welcome to all Muggles , informing them that Professor Binns is hosting a lecture on the history of the school . In the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom , Harry , Ron , and Hermione appear from under the Invisibility Cloak , urging guests to meet them in the Room of Requirement in order to sneak everyone down to a Quidditch match . Ron tries to perform a magic trick which goes wrong , and one of several special effects , such as falling snow , is triggered . Before continuing on , visitors receive a safety reminder from the Sorting Hat and several paintings in the next two rooms . 
 = = = Station = = = 
 Next , riders board an enchanted bench inside the Room of Requirement , which lifts off the ground and through the Floo Network for a journey with Harry . The ride combines real sets and animatronics with segments that use wrap @-@ around projection screens . 
 = = = Ride = = = 
 The ride begins with a dousing of Floo Powder from Hermione Granger , who asks the guests to say , " Observatory " in order to transport them to their desired location , and the enchanted bench flies off through the Floo Network to the Astronomy Tower . The guests leave the room of requirement through its fireplace and enter the Observatory , where they look out through the open arches to the hills and lake outside Hogwarts ' boundary . As the guests fly out of one of the Observatory 's arches , the ride smoothly switches to a wrap @-@ around projection screen and they follow Harry Potter and Ron Weasley around Hogwarts ' buildings and towers to a Quidditch match . As Harry and Ron travel under a bridge , Hagrid yields the riders and asks them if they have seen a dragon . As Harry redirects the riders ' attentions back to their journey , Hagrid 's pet Hungarian Horntail dragon begins to chase the riders . The bench flies out of the projection screen and into a set of the uneven bridge that crosses the valley behind Hogwarts and , after falling out of a hole in the floor of the bridge , they encounter an animatronic dragon , which breaths pressurized water mist with red lighting pointed to it to make it resemble fire . 
 The riders descend into a set of the Forbidden Forest where they encounter a figure of Aragog a large , sentient spider who spits water at them . As Hermione tries to help the riders away from Aragog and towards the castle , encountering many spiders on the way , they encounter an animatronic Whomping Willow which swipes at them , knocking them into the Quidditch pitch . The ride returns to a projection screen as the riders become caught up in Harry 's and Ron 's game of Quidditch . As Slytherin scores into Gryffindor 's goal , Dementors arrive at the Quidditch pitch and Harry attempts to lead the riders away through the structure of the pitch and back to the school , but their bench falls into the long @-@ abandoned Chamber of Secrets through a cave entrance in a cliff which Harry , Ron , Ginny , Fawkes , and Gilderoy Lockhart departed through from the Chamber in the second Harry Potter installment . The riders return to a real set as the Dementors appear from the pipelines and chase them . The skeleton of the long @-@ deceased Basilisk lies on the floor of the Chamber , and expels Lord Voldemort 's Dark Mark into the air as the benches are drawn into the mouth of Salazar Slytherin 's statue . 
 Dozens of Dementors emerge from the darkness while one descends and attempts to suck out the rider 's souls . This effect is achieved by projecting the rider 's faces onto a cloud of fog in front of the Dementor , blasting cold air towards the riders , and using a heartbeat @-@ like sound played through the sub @-@ woofers built into the benches . After shaking the riders out of the trance , Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus charm . After the final Dementor , and while Harry uses his Patronus , the riders enter the final video dome segment , where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in . They fly over the Black Lake , back into Hogwarts and through the Main Hall and Grand Staircase , where they are cheered on by a series of on @-@ screen characters from the movies who appear three @-@ dimensional . Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement , where they exit their bench . 
 = = = Restrictions = = = 
 While everyone may walk through the queue , all riders must be at least 48 inches ( 120 cm ) tall . The ride has no maximum weight limit , and riders can test whether the attraction accommodates their size using test seats at the queue entrance and again at the end of the queue , which are equipped with red , yellow , and green lights that indicate whether the rider can be accommodated . Persons requiring modified seating on other rides may have difficulty closing the ride 's over @-@ the @-@ shoulder harness . If passengers are unable to secure the harness , they are not permitted to ride the attraction . In an attempt to alleviate this problem , Universal has modified the restraint system on some of the seats to accommodate larger guests . These modifications will not affect the size of the seat nor create a dangerous situation for smaller guests . Guests who receive a yellow light on the test seats may sit in modified seating . Modified seating is not available on the Hollywood version of the ride . 
 According to the Universal Orlando Resort Rider 's Guide , both legs must protrude from under the restraint and form a lap . In practice , above @-@ knee amputees will not be permitted to ride unless their residual natural limb reaches the edge of the seat ( or at least includes a knee ) , even if the lock @-@ bar appears to successfully engage the limb . Lower @-@ limb prosthetics will not offset this requirement since they must be removed prior to boarding the ride . These particular restrictions are not clearly posted at the ride or on the website , which lists the height requirement only . The lower limb prosthetic removal requirement can be found at the " Accessibility Information " page under " Guests with Prosthetic Limbs . " The residual limb length requirement is not listed there but will be enforced at the ride prior to boarding . Wheelchair users who are able to transfer directly to the ride vehicle may do so at a separate area , which does not contain the introductory theming of the Floo Network . Instead , wheelchair users pass through a series of <unk> elevators and corridors to arrive at the accessible loading area . Only one accessible ride vehicle is available , and each party must wait for the previous group to return before they may enter the loading area .

 In January 2007 , rumors arose about the possibility of a Harry Potter themed island at Universal 's Islands of Adventure theme park . This was followed by further rumors that part of the project was codenamed " Strong Arm " in reference to the KUKA robotic arm technology it would utilize . On May 31 , 2007 , Universal , in partnership with Warner Bros. , officially announced that The Wizarding World of Harry Potter would be coming to Islands of Adventure . Preparation of the site for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter began in late October 2007 , and the construction of Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey began in February 2008 . Construction ended in the first half of 2010 . Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey began operating on June 1 , 2010 , and officially opened to the public on June 18 , 2010 . 
 On December 6 , 2011 , Universal Parks & Resorts announced that it would open The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2016 , and that one of the attractions would be Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey . On May 5 , 2012 , the Los Angeles Times reported that Universal Studios Japan would also be receiving a The Wizarding World of Harry Potter , with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey confirmed as one of the attractions . The Japanese ride opened on July 15 , 2014 and , unlike the Orlando version , uses 3 @-@ D projection . 
 On April 7 , 2016 , The Wizarding World of Harry Potter : Hogsmeade opened at Universal Studios Hollywood with rides Harry Potter and The Forbidden Journey and Flight of The Hippogriff debuting with the new section . Unlike its Florida counterpart , Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey features 3D HD Technology , in which guests wear 3D " Quidditch " goggles .

 Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey features a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures , KUKA and RoboCoaster . The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform , while the second @-@ generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track . The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions ( IAAPA ) Trade Show in 2003 . At around the same time , rumors began circulating about the possibility of Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing @-@ themed ride using this technology . These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride . The ride 's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track . This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride 's show elements ( animated props , projection surfaces , etc . ) . This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions ( IAAPA ) Trade Show . The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down , some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions , such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces . 
 For the three sections of the ride where wrap @-@ around projection is used , each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling at exactly the same pace . Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen . The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets . The robotic arms can then freely dive , turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area , giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection , whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves . This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length , as each ride arm must follow each identically @-@ sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time .

 Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey has been widely praised for its innovation and theming . Arthur Levine of About.com stated that he felt he " had been taken to a truly magical place . For a few glorious moments , the Floo Network , flying benches , and willows that <unk> seemed not just possible , but actual . " He gave the ride a rating of 5 stars out of 5 , and wrote that the ride was the best of its kind . Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider commended Universal Creative for its attention to detail on the ride . Niles wrote that the company had set its expectations almost impossibly high , and that the ride is " the most advanced and engaging attraction in theme park industry history " . Ricky <unk> of Inside the Magic described the ride as a " jaw @-@ dropping journey that no one should miss " , but criticized the lack of continuity with the story . 
 In Amusement Today 's annual Golden Ticket Awards , Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey debuted as the best new ride of 2010 . It went on to win the Best Dark Ride category for five consecutive years from 2011 to 2015 . 
 = Eugenio Espejo = 
 Francisco Javier Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo ( Royal Audiencia of Quito , 1747 – 95 ) was a medical pioneer , writer and lawyer of mestizo origin in colonial Ecuador . Although he was a notable scientist and writer , he stands out as a polemicist who inspired the separatist movement in Quito . He is regarded as one of the most important figures in colonial Ecuador . He was Quito 's first journalist and hygienist . 
 As a journalist he spread enlightened ideas in the Royal Audiencia , and as a hygienist he composed an important treatise about sanitary conditions in colonial Ecuador that included interesting remarks about microorganisms and the spreading of disease . 
 Espejo was noted in his time for being a satirist . His satirical works , inspired by the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment , were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito , the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia , the corruption of its authorities , and aspects of its culture in general . Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 The Royal Audiencia of Quito ( or Presidency of Quito ) was established as part of the Spanish State by Philip II of Spain on August 29 , 1563 . It was a court of the Spanish Crown with jurisdiction over certain territories of the Viceroyalty of Peru ( and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada ) that now constitute Ecuador and parts of Peru , Colombia and Brazil . The Royal Audiencia was created to strengthen administrative control over those territories and to rule the relations between whites and the natives . Its capital was the city of Quito . 
 By the 18th century , the Royal Audiencia of Quito began to have economic problems ; a lack of roads led to limited communications . <unk> — a type of textile factory — had provided jobs , but now found themselves in decline , mainly due to a crackdown on smuggled European cloths and a series of natural disasters . <unk> were replaced by haciendas , and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population . 
 In the Royal Audiencia , the education situation worsened after of the expulsion of the Jesuit priests ; too few learned people lived in Quito to be able to fill the void . The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well . On the other hand , the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique . Scholasticism , which was in decline in these times , was still taught ; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions . As a result , the intellectual people in Quito — most of whom were clerical — had affected manners when expressing themselves , while having no new ideas . Furthermore , in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito , of which one was Espejo ; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by curanderos . In Quito at the time , ethnic prejudice was common , and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm , which differed by racial origin . Because of this , a person 's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices . 
 A slackening of social customs occurred on all social levels ; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common . Because poverty was on the rise — especially in the lower classes — many women were forced to find lodgings quickly , for example in convents , o . This explained the abundance of the clergy in a small city like Quito ; often men were ordained not because of a vocation but because it solved their economic problems and improved their community standing . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 He was baptized Francisco Javier Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo in the El <unk> parish on February 21 , 1747 . According to most historians , his father was Luis de la Cruz <unk> , a Quichua Indian from <unk> , who arrived in Quito as an assistant to the priest and physician José del Rosario , and his mother was Maria Catalina <unk> , a mulatta native to Quito . However , some historians , especially Carlos <unk> <unk> , argue that contemporary documents imply that Espejo 's mother was white ; for instance , his parents ' marriage was recorded in the book for white marriages ( as they were deemed as criollos ) , and the birth certificates of Espejo and his siblings were entered in the same book . 
 Espejo had two younger siblings , Juan Pablo and María Manuela . Juan Pablo was born in 1752 ; he studied with the Dominicans and served as a priest in various parts of the Audiencia of Quito . María Manuela was born in 1753 , and after the death of her parents she came to be cared for by her brother Eugenio . Despite his family 's somewhat unstable economic situation , Espejo had a good education . He instructed himself in medicine by working alongside his father at the Hospital de la Misericordia . According to Espejo , he learned " by experience , which cannot be known without studying with pen in hand . " 
 Overcoming racial discrimination , he graduated from medical school on July 10 , 1767 , and shortly afterwards graduated in jurisprudence and canon law ( having studied law under Dr. Ramón <unk> from 1780 to 1793 ) . On August 14 , 1772 , he asked for permission to practice medicine in Quito , and it was granted on November 28 , 1772 . After that , no information exists about Espejo 's whereabouts until 1778 , when he wrote a somewhat polemical sermon .

 Between 1772 and 1779 , Espejo provoked the colonial authorities , who regarded him as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters . These posters were attached to the doors of churches and other buildings , and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities , the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient . Although no surviving posters have been found , evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them . 
 In 1779 , a reproachful and satirical manuscript was circulated , the El nuevo Luciano de Quito ( The New Lucian of Quito ) , signed by " don Javier de <unk> , <unk> y <unk> , " a pseudonym for Espejo . This work imitated the satire of Lucian , and was especially unsympathetic to the Jesuits . It showed the culture of its author , who lived in the isolated and intellectually backward city of Quito . El Nuevo Luciano de Quito was written in dialogues , in order to present his ideas to the common people in an easy way , instead of using tedious explanations meant for scholars . It satirized the many defects of the society of Quito , especially the corruption of the colonial authorities and the people 's lack of education . The use of a pseudonym , a common practice in Europe and the Americas during the Age of Enlightenment , was important to Espejo . Not only did it provide anonymity , it attempted to remove any hint of his crossbreeding in a culture which granted any white person importance and prestige . His pseudonym implied that he had white or European relatives in his mother 's lineage . 
 Beginning in 1779 , Espejo continued writing satires against the government of the Audiencia , stirred by the condition of society . In June 1780 , Espejo wrote Marco Porcio Catón ( Marcus Porcius Cato ) , Once again , Espejo used a pseudonym , " Moisés <unk> . " In this work , a parodied censor 's response to the Nuevo Luciano , he scorned the notions and ideas of its critics . In 1781 he wrote La ciencia blancardina , which he referred to as the second part of Nuevo Luciano , as an answer to the criticism of a Mercedarian priest from Quito . Because of his works , by 1783 he was labeled as " restive and subversive . " To get rid of him , the authorities named him head physician for the scientific expedition of Francisco de <unk> to the Pará and Marañon rivers to set the limits of the Audiencia . Espejo tried to decline the appointment , and after that failed , he tried unsuccessfully to flee . His arrest order details one of the few remaining physical descriptions of him . Captured , he was sent back as a " criminal of serious offense , " but he was not prosecuted and suffered no significant consequences .

 In 1785 , he was asked by the cabildo ( town council ) to write about smallpox , the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced . Espejo used the opportunity to write his most complete and best @-@ written work , Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas ( Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox ) , denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation . This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America . 
 Reflexiones was sent to Madrid , where it was added as an appendix to the second edition of the medical treatise <unk> <unk> ( 1786 ) by Francisco Gil , a member of the Real Academia Médica de España . Instead of recognition , Espejo acquired enemies because his work criticized the physicians and priests in charge of public health in the Royal Audiencia for their negligence , and he was forced to leave Quito . 
 On his way to Lima , he stopped in Riobamba , where a group of priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto , chief tax collector . The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in order to take their money . Espejo gladly accepted the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba , among them José Miguel Vallejo , who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee <unk> 's expedition to the Marañón river . He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba ( Defense of the clergy of Riobamba ) , a detailed study of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto 's report . 
 In March 1787 , he continued his attack against his enemies from Riobamba with a series of eight satirical letters which he called Cartas <unk> . In response , his enemies denounced Espejo before the President of the Royal Audiencia , Juan José De Villalengua . On August 24 , 1787 , Villalengua requested that Espejo either to go to Lima or return to Quito to occupy a post in the government , and subsequently arrested him . Espejo was accused of writing El Retrato de Golilla , a satire against King Charles III and the Marquis de la Sonora , colonial minister of the Indies . He was taken to Quito , and from prison he sent three petitions to the Court in Madrid , which decreed , on Charles III 's behalf , that the case was to be taken to the Viceroy of Bogotá . President Villalengua feigned ignorance of the matter and sent Espejo to Bogotá to defend his own cause . 
 There he met Antonio Nariño and Francisco Antonio Zea and began to develop his ideas on liberty . In 1789 , one of his followers , Juan Pio <unk> , arrived in Bogotá , and both men got the approval of important members of the government for the creation of the Escuela de la Concordia , called later the Sociedad <unk> de Amigos del País de Quito ( Patriotic Society of Friends of the Country of Quito ) . The Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País ( Economic Society of Friends of the Country ) was a private association established in various cities throughout Enlightenment Spain and , to a lesser degree , in some of her colonies . Espejo successfully defended himself on the charges against him , and on October 2 , 1789 , he was set free . On December 2 he was notified he could return to Quito . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 In 1790 , Espejo returned to Quito to promote the " Sociedad <unk> " ( Patriotic Society ) , and on November 30 , 1791 , a branch was established in the Colegio de los <unk> ; he was elected director and formed four commissions . In the same year , he became director of the first public library , the National Library , originally established with the forty thousand volumes left by the Jesuits after their expulsion from Ecuador . 
 The main duty of the Society was improving the city of Quito . Its 24 members came together weekly to discuss agricultural , educational , political and social problems and to promote the physical and natural sciences . The Society founded Quito 's first newspaper , <unk> de la Cultura de Quito , published by Espejo starting on January 5 , 1792 . Through this newspaper liberal ideas , already somewhat known in other parts of Hispanic America , were spread among the people of Quito . 
 On November 11 , 1793 , Charles IV dissolved the society . Soon the newspaper disappeared as well . Espejo had no choice but to work as a librarian in the National Library . Because of his liberal ideas , he was imprisoned on January 30 , 1795 , being allowed to leave his cell only to treat his patients as a doctor and , on December 23 , to die at his home from the dysentery he acquired during his imprisonment . Eugenio Espejo died on December 28 . His death certificate was registered in the book for Indians , mestizos , blacks and mulattoes . 
 = = Character = = 
 Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact , and he claimed with pride that he never left any book in his hands unread , and if he did , he would make up for it by observing nature . However , his desire to read everything indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments , which appear in his manuscripts . Through his own written work , it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development . He understood that reading was basic in the formation of the self , and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment , based on observation and in the application of the law of his time . 
 By his writing , Espejo wanted to educate the people and to awaken a rebellious spirit in them . He embraced equality between Indians and criollos , an ideal that was ignored during the future processes of independence . He also favored women 's rights but did not really develop these ideas . He had an advanced understanding of science , considering the circumstances in which he lived . He never traveled abroad but nonetheless understood the relation between microorganisms and the spreading of disease . 
 When he was arrested , it was rumored that his detention resulted from his support of the " <unk> " of the French Revolution . However , Espejo was one of the few people at the time who distinguished between the actual deeds of the French Revolution and the irreligious spirit connected to it , while his contemporaries in Spain and the colonies erroneously identified the emancipation of the Americas with loss of the Catholic faith . The accusation of impiety was calculated to incite popular hatred against him . Espejo never lost his faith in Catholicism throughout his lifetime . He condemned the decadence of the clergy , but he never criticized the Church itself . Eugenio Espejo had a restless desire for knowledge and was anxious to reform by his works a state that seemed to him , influenced as he was by the Enlightenment , to be barbarian in every way . 
 = = Thought = = 
 = = = Views on education = = = 
 The goal of Espejo 's first three works was the intellectual improvement of Quito . El Nuevo Luciano de Quito ridiculed the outdated educational system maintained by the clergy . Espejo argued that the people of Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could quote the Bible in a pompous and insubstantial way . Marco Porcio Catón exposed the ignorance of the <unk> of Quito . La ciencia blancardina , in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works , condemned the results of the clergy 's educational system : ignorance and affectation . All three works caused polemic . 
 Through these three books , Espejo advanced the ideas of European and American scholars such as <unk> and the Jesuits Verney and Guevara , among others . As a result , many religious orders modified their educational programs . Espejo resented the <unk> who misled the thought of the city of Quito , disregarding people who were actually knowledgeable . 
 Espejo particularly criticized the Jesuits for , among other things , teaching ethics not as a science but as a guide to good manners and for their adoption of <unk> as a moral guide . He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students . As a result , the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study . In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito , he lamented the large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors . In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education . 
 = = = Views on theology = = = 
 In 1780 , in his first discussion of purely religious matters , Espejo wrote a theological letter , Carta al Padre la Graña sobre <unk> ( Letter to Father la Graña about indulgences ) . In this work , he looked at indulgences in the Catholic Church . The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and dogma . It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and bulls written about abuses of indulgences . In this work , Espejo staunchly supported the authority of the Pope . 
 On July 19 , 1792 , Espejo wrote another letter , Segunda carta <unk> sobre la Inmaculada Concepción de María ( Second theological letter about Mary 's Immaculate Conception ) , in response to a request by the inspector of the Holy Office . This letter dealt with the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary . Once more , this work showed its author 's deep knowledge of this religious subject and his appreciation of its standing in the 18th century . ( The Immaculate Conception was not formally decreed as dogma until 1950 . ) 
 Espejo also wrote a series of sermons , which were notable in their simplicity . Ecuadorian historian and cleric Federico González Suárez considered these sermons worthy of study , even though he mentioned that they lacked an " evangelic spirit . " Espejo can be considered a deeply religious man . 
 = = = Views on economics = = = 
 Starting in 1785 , Espejo took an interest in the welfare of his community and the prosperity of Quito . His works between that year and 1792 clearly show the influence of Enlightenment philosophers , whose ideas Espejo adapted to local conditions . As many thinkers realized the power of economics as a social force , Espejo , influenced by <unk> and Adam Smith among others , showed his desire for commercial and agricultural reforms , especially conservation and proper use of land . To advance these ideas , he founded the Escuela de la Concordia ( School of Concord ) . 
 His Voto de un ministro <unk> de la Audiencia de Quito and Memorias sobre el corte de quinas rejected a proposed monopoly of quinine production by the Crown intended to prevent the destruction of the cinchona tree and to expand the Royal Treasury 's income . Memorias was dedicated to Fernando Cuadrado , who opposed the monopoly . 
 Espejo divided his cinchona study into four parts . In the first , he argued that the monopoly would leave workers without jobs and that it would mean the loss of capital invested in cinchona trees . In the second part , he made a number of suggestions , such as developing certain " natural " products of a region with the aim of exporting them . For instance , in Chile the production of wines should be prioritized , in Argentina the production of leather , and so forth . In the third part he showed that many workers benefited from the quinine industry , that without it there would be unemployment and unrest , and that the Crown should designate officials to regulate the proper cultivation of the cinchona tree , including reforestation . In the fourth part he made recommendations , such as the need to repress indigenous hostility in the cinchona tree region . 
 = = = Work as a lawyer = = = 
 His Defensa de los curas de Riobamba was written in response to a report from Ignacio Barreto that accused the clergy in Riobamba of various unethical practices . Among other things , the report said that the large number of religious celebrations in Riobamba ( frequented by Indians ) were prejudicial to Catholic faith , agriculture , industry and the interests of the Crown ; also , that priests demanded money from the Indians for entrance into churches and for certain ceremonies , that priests in Riobamba were immoral and finally that most sermons were incomprehensible to the Indians . 
 Espejo attacked Barreto 's report in three ways . First , he claimed that Barreto , supposed author of the report , was not capable of writing it . Then he argued that the allegations were exaggerated semi @-@ truths or outright lies . And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources ( the Indians ) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region . 
 Espejo realized that the charges against the clergy were so serious that he had to focus on destroying Barreto 's credibility . Therefore , he implied that Barreto 's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women . Additionally , he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo , whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy . Thus , Espejo claimed the report should not be believed . 
 It appears that Espejo was motivated more by the opportunity to attack his personal enemies in this work than to analyze the case and defend the clergy of Riobamba . Still , his talent as a lawyer can be seen in his <unk> ( Representations ) , which caused him to be freed after his arrest in 1787 for his supposed authorship of El Retrato de Golilla . In these documents , he defended his loyalty to the Crown , commented on the unfairness of his captivity by mentioning the indignation that many distinguished men felt about his arrest , and clarified his writing goals . This served him as a prelude to his main subject : denying being the author of El Retrato de Golilla 
 = = = Scientific work = = = 
 The Spanish Crown was deeply concerned with public health . Diseases had always troubled the colonies , and town councils spent money to bring physicians or sanitary equipment from other parts of the Americas . Reports by doctors about the sanitary and hygienic conditions of various neighborhoods of the cities were frequent . As a man of science , Eugenio Espejo demonstrated his knowledge of the latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas . Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources , such as the Mémoires of the French Academy of Sciences . 
 The Presidency of Quito was especially concerned with prevention of smallpox . Villalengua , President of the Audiencia , gathered all of Quito 's physicians to discuss the application of methods suggested by the Spanish scientist Francisco Gil , and Espejo was asked to write his Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas . " Reflexiones , completed on November 11 , 1785 , was divided in two parts : the first dealt with prevention of smallpox in Quito , while the second dealt with obstacles on the path to its eradication . Espejo 's knowledge of inoculations and the quarantine of smallpox victims was remarkably advanced for his day . 
 Reflexiones recommended using proven methods supported by Spanish and foreign doctors . It refuted the common belief that the separation and destruction of contaminated clothes was impractical , and it promoted personal hygiene among the people of Quito . Espejo tried to convince people of the dangers of smallpox . He understood the current European medical theories about contagious diseases and warned against the incorrect belief that smallpox was transmitted by polluted air . Citing the English doctor Thomas Sydenham , he suggested the construction of an isolated country house as a hospital . 
 Dealing with sanitation , Espejo observed that the hospital ( Hospital de la Misericordia ) of the city , the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics . He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches ; instead , he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council . Finally , he condemned the management of the hospital by the <unk> . He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service . The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this , and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor , José del Rosario . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Espejo is considered the precursor of the independence movement in Quito . He died in 1795 , but his ideas had a powerful influence on three of his close friends : Juan Pío <unk> , Juan de Dios Morales and Juan de Salinas . They , along with Manuel Rodriguez Quiroga , founded the revolutionary movement of August 10 , 1809 , in Quito , when the city declared independence from Spain . 
 Espejo published Quito 's first newspaper , and therefore he is regarded as the founder of Ecuadorian journalism . He is considered Ecuador 's first literary critic ; according to Spanish scholar Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo , Espejo 's Nuevo Luciano is the oldest critical work written in South America . 
 His influence can as well be seen in Ecuadorian thought in general , as his work has been one of its principal influences ; Ecuadorian education , as he promoted new pedagogical ideas , such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge , and finally Ecuadorian science , as he was , along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado , one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador . Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito , the poverty of its people and their lack of good education , and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities . 
 Since 2000 , Espejo has been depicted on the obverse of Ecuador 's 10 centavo coin .

 = Grizzly Rage = 
 Grizzly Rage is a 2007 Canadian television horror film produced by RHI Entertainment that premiered in Canada on the video @-@ on @-@ demand channel Movie Central On Demand on June 7 , 2007 . It aired in the United States on the Syfy on September 16 , 2007 . Filmed in Winnipeg , Manitoba , the film is the 2nd title in the Maneater Series produced under an agreement with Syfy . Featuring a cast of four , the film focuses on a group of teenagers who struggle to survive in a restricted forest while an enraged grizzly bear hunts them relentlessly seeking retribution for killing its cub . 
 Grizzly Rage breaks the standard mold for many Syfy natural horror films in that the bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal . However , the bear and actors never appear together in the same frame , rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear . Critics heavily panned the film , feeling its plot , script , characters , and special effects were substandard . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Sean ( Graham <unk> ) , Ritch ( Brody Harms ) , Wes ( Tyler Hoechlin ) , and Lauren ( Kate Todd ) celebrate their college graduation by breaking into <unk> Grotto , a forest heavily marked with " No Trespassing " signs and surrounded by a tall fence . While speeding down a dirt road , they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub , sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator . As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub , they hear its mother coming and run . The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water . The Grizzly Bear finds and attacks Ritch . Having heard Ritch 's screams to run , Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him . The other two arrive and rescue Wes , but are unable to help Ritch . The Bear kills him while the others flee to the Jeep . 
 The vehicle starts again and they leave , but Wes panics and tries to force Sean to turn around and go back for Ritch , causing the car to go over a cliff . Calmer , he wants to wait for help , but no one knows where they are because they had told their families they were going somewhere else . They winch the vehicle back up to the road , but they cannot get it to start . 
 Sean leaves to jog the 15 kilometers ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) out of the forest to find help while Wes and Lauren wait at the Jeep . He comes across some run down buildings where he finds a hunting paraphernalia , a bear trap , and dead animals . As he leaves , the bear appears . He tries to sneak past the bear , but instead he runs into the bear and it throws him on the roof of the shack and then he falls into a chicken coop . Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep , but his leg is injured . Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone . It does not work and the Bear nearly catches him . He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it still will not start . He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back . 
 The bear follows and climbs on top of the Jeep , smashing up the car and eventually overturning it before leaving as the sun sets . Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia , crying about wanting to go home before he dies . Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up , load him back in the car , then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits . Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing , they arrive near the buildings . While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap , the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap , which impales her back . She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean 's body . 
 Wes grabs a can of gasoline and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods . They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire . The Jeep explodes , but the bear is unharmed . They decide to try another plan and split up . Wes climbs a tree , leaving his blood covered clothes on the ground to fool the Bear . While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes , Wes accidentally drops a tire iron , calling the bear 's attention up . The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap . They lure the bear into the shack , and use a trigger to close the front door behind it , locking it in . They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape . Unfortunately , Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up , refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run . As the Bear catches up to them , Wes is killed and it is unknown if Lauren survived or not .

 In October 2006 , RHI Entertainment made a deal with the Sci Fi Channel to produce a series of ten made @-@ for @-@ television natural horror films to air on the network the following year . Dubbed the " Maneater " series by RHI Entertainment , Grizzly Rage was the sixth film released . Although the agreement called for the films to premiere on SciFi , the first six films in the series actually premiered in Canada on the video on demand ( VOD ) channel Movie Central on Demand first due to a pre @-@ licensing agreement . It also aired on other VOD channels before its Sci Fi airing . 
 Grizzly Rage was filmed in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada . It breaks from the standard mold many natural horror films follow in that the bear attacking the main characters is not a mutant or genetically altered , rather it is a normal , but furious mother bear . The mother bear is played by Koda , a 1 @,@ 600 @-@ pound ( 730 kg ) male grizzly bear , working at the direction of a trainer . To induce the bear to appear to be roaring , the trainer gave it marshmallows to make it smile . The roaring sounds were dubbed in later . Both Tyler Hoechlin and Graham <unk> noted that they were a little afraid of the bear and director David <unk> felt that working with such a powerful live animal added element of danger for the cast and crew during filming . As such , the bear is never actually filmed together with any of the actors . For scenes where the bear is supposed to interact with the characters , a man in a bear suit takes over the role .

 = = Reception = = 
 Critics heavily panned Grizzly Rage . Film historian Paul Mavis called the film " a pathetically undernourished effort " , feeling the film was plagued with a bad plot , bad acting , bad direction , and bad special effects . In comparing Grizzly , a 1976 natural horror film , and Grizzly Man , a 2005 documentary showing the life and death of amateur bear enthusiast Timothy Treadwell , he found it sorely lacking . Mavis states that it was a horror film that did not show anyone getting " sliced , diced , <unk> on and stomped " by the bear . He also heavily criticizes the film for not having any scenes where the bear is actually in the same frame as any of the actors , wondering if the actors and / or trainers were afraid something tragic would happen . As a whole , he recommended skipping the film . Film critic David Walker agreed . Like Mavis , Walker compared the film to the 1976 Grizzly and found it severely lacking . He also felt the plot was poorly conceived and was combined with a badly written script and uninteresting characters : 
 At the very least you would hope that Grizzly Rage is laughably bad , but it doesn 't even inspire a chuckle or half a grin . It is as bad as bad can get , and without some of the more common exploitation elements we should expect from a journeyman hack like director David <unk> — the man responsible for classics like Sorority Babes in the <unk> Bowl @-@ O @-@ Rama and Test Tube Teens from the Year 2000 — there is no reason to watch this movie . 
 Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and <unk> repeated many of the same sentiments in his review of the film . He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks . Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film 's cover , but was also quickly disappointed by " insipid dialog " amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other " dude . " The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness , where bears are plentiful , amused him , though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene . His final rating of the film was an " F. " DVD Verdict 's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together . He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion , and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air : " I don 't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild , but it comes in handy when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a healthy dose of comeuppance . " He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than " ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen . " Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either , and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality . 
 Tim Anderson , reviewer for the website Bloody @-@ <unk> , disagreed on some points . He found the film to be cheesy , but very watchable . He praised <unk> 's pacing of the film and felt the cast of four was " serviceable . " He also praised the use of a real bear . Like other reviewers , was disappointed by the bear not being in the same scenes with the actors though he notes that at least the bear suit used in such scenes was well made . As a whole , he notes that " ridiculous is the very nature of the Maneater Series . So , I don 't fault them for following suit on this production ... " and concludes with the remark that Grizzly Rage is " a pretty silly but satisfying little fright flick " and rated it a seven out of ten .

 = Progressive Field = 
 Progressive Field is a baseball park located in downtown Cleveland , Ohio , United States . It is the home field of the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball , and together with Quicken Loans Arena , is part of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex . It was ranked as Major League Baseball 's best ballpark in a 2008 Sports Illustrated fan opinion poll . 
 The ballpark was named Jacobs Field after team owners Richard and David Jacobs , from its inaugural season in 1994 until 2008 , when its name was changed to Progressive Field after its naming rights were purchased by locally based Progressive Insurance Company . The ballpark is still referred to as " The Jake " , based on its original name . 
 = = History = = 
 The Cleveland Indians previously played at Cleveland Stadium , which they shared with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League . The Indians first played at the stadium , which seated nearly 80 @,@ 000 people for baseball , for the 1932 and 1933 seasons , then returned to the smaller League Park . From 1936 – 1946 , they played weekend and holiday games there , and eventually night games and other dates where larger crowds were expected , moving to the stadium full @-@ time in 1947 . Cleveland Stadium was the largest stadium in the American League during its tenure as a baseball facility and was the largest stadium in Major League Baseball for all but a few seasons . 
 Plans for a new stadium first began in 1984 when Cuyahoga County voters defeated a property tax for building a 100 % publicly funded domed stadium , which would have been shared by the Indians and Browns . Later that year , committee leaders met to re @-@ evaluate these plans , and a location was later agreed upon . The eventual site of the stadium , the location of the Central Market , was acquired in December 1985 . In April 1986 , designs for the new stadium were agreed upon and about a year later , demolition at the site started . In May 1990 , Cuyahoga County voters approved a 15 @-@ year sin tax on alcohol and cigarette sales to finance the new Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex , which included the ballpark , an adjacent arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , and two parking garages . Construction started in January 1992 , and by May of that year , the concrete construction had been poured . In June 1992 , Mel Harder , who pitched the opening game at Cleveland Stadium in 1932 , and contemporary stars Charles Nagy and Sandy Alomar , Jr . , executed the ceremonial first pitch at the site of the new ballpark before construction began . The installation of seating was completed in October 1993 . The ballpark , which was referred to as " Cleveland Indians Baseball Park " on blueprints , cost approximately $ 175 million to build , of which $ 91 million was provided by Indians owner Richard Jacobs . The remaining $ 84 million was raised by the sin tax . 
 The ballpark opened on April 4 , 1994 . It was the first new major sporting facility in the city of Cleveland since Cleveland Arena opened in 1937 . President Bill Clinton threw out the ceremonial first pitch , and the Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners 4 – 3 in 11 innings . 
 In 1995 , the Indians qualified for the World Series for the first time since 1954 ; it was the first time the World Series was played at Jacobs Field . The Indians lost to the Atlanta Braves in six games . Two years later , Jacobs Field hosted its first All @-@ Star Game and the first All Star Game in Cleveland since 1981 . Later that year , the Indians hosted the 1997 World Series , which they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games . On July 3 , 1999 , Jim Thome hit the longest home run in Jacobs Field history , with a 511 feet ( 156 m ) hit to center field . 
 On October 5 , 2007 , in the eighth inning of a playoff game against the New York Yankees , a swarm of insects believed to be midges from Lake Erie , enveloped the playing field , distracting relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain . Chamberlain walked Grady Sizemore , who later scored the tying run on a wild pitch . The incident became known as the " Bug Game " . However , this was not the first time the insects plagued Jacobs Field . 
 An event called " Snow Days " debuted at Progressive Field in November 2010 . The first day , called " <unk> Day " , was held on November 26 and the event continued until January 2 , 2011 . An ice skating track called the " Frozen Mile " was installed around the warning track , the " <unk> " was a snow tubing hill on the bleachers and other events were staged around the field and home run porch . " Snow Days " returned in November 2011 , and closed on January 16 . The <unk> was moved to the Toyota Home Run porch and the Frozen Mile was rerouted . The park also added the " Frozen Diamond " , an ice rink covering the infield . On January 15 , 2012 , the park hosted its first ice hockey game , a match between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Michigan Wolverines , the first outdoor college hockey game in Ohio . On June 1 , 2012 , it was announced that " Snow Days " would not run in 2012 due to low attendance in 2011 . In part , this was caused by the warmest winter on record , with temperatures of 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) on " <unk> Day . "

 Progressive Field set a major league record between June 12 , 1995 and April 4 , 2001 by selling out 455 straight games . Demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons . The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout record . The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9 , 2008 . The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set on Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45 @,@ 274 people attended the game . On Saturday , April 2 , 2011 , the Indians ' lowest attendance record was broken by a crowd of 9 @,@ 853 , and again the following day with an attendance figure of 8 @,@ 726 .

 Naming rights were acquired in 1994 by team owner Richard Jacobs , who paid for rights until the end of 2006 . The Jacobs Field name gave rise to the nickname " The Jake " for the ballpark . 
 The Indians announced on January 11 , 2008 , that naming rights to the park had been purchased by Progressive Corporation , an insurance company headquartered in nearby Mayfield , Ohio . Removal of the iconic Jacobs Field sign on the front of the building began the morning of January 18 , and the replacement sign was installed on March 25 . Progressive agreed to pay $ 57 @.@ 6 million for the naming rights for 16 years . There were discussions about instead naming the ballpark " Progressive Park " , but it was later realized that this name belonged to a picnic facility in Council Bluffs , Iowa , so the name " Progressive Field " was used instead . 
 The Indians extended their lease agreement with Gateway Economic Development Corp. for the stadium in August 2008 from 2013 to 2023 . The agreement gives the team four five @-@ year renewal options after 2023 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The ballpark was designed by HOK Sport , now known as Populous , a division of Hellmuth , Obata and Kassabaum . HOK designed it as the second retro @-@ modern ballpark , with asymmetrical fences of varying heights , a smaller upper deck , and stepped tiers . It is similar to HOK 's Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore , which was the first retro @-@ modern ballpark . The ballpark was sited to give a favorable view of Cleveland 's downtown skyline . The structural engineering was done by a Cleveland company , Osborn Engineering , which helped design League Park , Cleveland Municipal Stadium , " Old " Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park . It was designed to blend in with the city of Cleveland with its exposed steel design and the vertical light towers . 
 = = Features = = 
 The ballpark has numerous unique structural features . The field is situated on 12 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 9 ha ) of Kentucky Bluegrass . It is illuminated by 19 white vertical light towers ; three behind the scoreboard , six behind first base , six behind third base and four in right field , which stand 200 feet ( 61 m ) above street level and 218 feet ( 66 m ) above the playing field and are said to resemble toothbrushes . The distinctive light towers were incorporated into a version of the original Jacobs Field logo and the 1997 MLB All @-@ Star Game logo . 
 The park features distinctive dimensions ; left and right field are both 325 feet ( 99 m ) from <unk> , but left field has a 19 @-@ foot ( 6 m ) high wall , known as the " Little Green Monster " . The center and right field walls are 9 feet ( 3 m ) high . The park features traditional hunter green seats angled at 8 @-@ 12 ° on three tiers around the park except for center field which has no seats and left field which uses bleachers . 
 The bullpens , reconfigured between the 2014 and 2015 seasons , are raised above the playing field , which allows fans to see players warming up . Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right @-@ center field , with the Indians ' bullpen closer to the field . Unlike most ballparks , the Indians ' dugout is along the third base line and the visitors ' dugout is located along the first base line . When the ballpark was built it contained 121 luxury boxes . A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 2015 seasons removed six of them for a total of 115 , the second most in Major League Baseball . 
 Prior to the start of the 1997 season , two sections with 480 seats were added onto the ends of the bleacher section . In 2004 , South Dakota @-@ based company Daktronics installed the then @-@ largest video display at a sports venue in the world , measuring 36 feet ( 11 m ) high by 149 feet ( 45 m ) wide . The out @-@ of @-@ town scoreboard along the left field wall was also replaced . A new scoreboard system was installed for the 2016 season . The main scoreboard above the bleachers measures 59 feet ( 18 m ) high by 221 feet ( 67 m ) wide with 13 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m2 ) of screen space . 
 In 2007 , the Indians became the first American League team to install solar panels on their stadium . They also spent $ 1 @.@ 1 million to convert a picnic area behind the center field fence into " Heritage Park " , which features 27 plaques honoring the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame and 38 bricks , representing the team 's most memorable moments . There is also a memorial plaque commemorating Ray Chapman that was originally installed at League Park . The area is shielded by plantings so it does not interfere with the batter 's eye . Prior to Opening Day 2012 , the Indians installed a corkscrew @-@ shaped wind turbine atop Progressive Field , the first major league team to do so . The corkscrew – shaped wind turbine , however , was subsequently removed prior to Opening Day 2013 .
