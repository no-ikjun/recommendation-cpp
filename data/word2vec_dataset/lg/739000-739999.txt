 = = Plot = = 
 On July 2 , 1996 , an enormous alien mothership that has one fourth the mass of the Moon enters orbit around Earth , deploying 36 smaller spacecraft , each 15 miles ( 24 km ) wide , that take positions over some of Earth 's major cities and military bases . David Levinson , an MIT @-@ trained satellite technician , decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack . With the help of his former wife , White House Communications Director Constance Spano , Levinson , and his father Julius , gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile . Whitmore orders large @-@ scale evacuations of New York City , Los Angeles , and Washington D.C. , but it is too late ; the timer reaches zero and the ships activate devastating directed @-@ energy weapons , killing millions . Whitmore , the <unk> , and a few others , narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed , along with other locations over which the ships are positioned . 
 On July 3 , international military leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks . Their aviation forces attack destroyer ships positioned above the ruins of the cities , but they are protected by force fields . Each destroyer launches a swarm of attack fighters , which wipe out the human fighter squadrons . Captain Steven Hiller of the Los Angeles USMC squadron survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane , forcing the alien to crash @-@ land . He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees , hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse . They transport the unconscious alien to nearby Area 51 where Whitmore 's group has landed . Through Secretary of Defense Albert <unk> , they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947 , when one of the invaders ' attack fighters crashed in Roswell . Area 51 houses the refurbished attacker ship and three alien corpses recovered from the crash . 
 When eccentric scientist Brackish Okun examines the alien , it regains consciousness and attacks . It telepathically invades Okun 's mind and uses his vocal cords to communicate with Whitmore before launching a psychic attack against him . Whitmore begins seeing visions of the aliens collecting resources by moving from planet to planet and exterminating all life . After Secret Service agents and military officers kill the alien , he reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack ; a B @-@ 2 Spirit fires a nuclear cruise missile at a destroyer positioned above Houston , but the ship remains intact . 
 On July 4 , Levinson demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is deactivating their force fields , and devises a way to do it by uploading a computer virus into the mothership . He proposes using the refurbished attack ship to gain entry which Hiller volunteers to pilot . The two are able to implant the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board . With military pilots in short supply , Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience including Casse and leads an attack on a destroyer ship bearing down on Area 51 . Although the fighters are able to inflict damage , their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted . As the destroyer prepares to fire on the base , the last missile jams and Casse decides to sacrifice his own life . He flies his plane kamikaze @-@ style into the directed @-@ energy weapon port , which results in an explosion that destroys the ship . Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other craft using this vulnerability . As humankind is rejoicing in victory , Hiller and Levinson have returned to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families . They and military officers nearby accompany Whitmore and his daughter and watching the wreckage from the mothership burns up , resembling a fireworks display , as it enters Earth 's atmosphere .

 The idea for the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe promoting their film Stargate . A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate if he did not believe in aliens . Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival , and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile @-@ wide spaceships were hovering over the world 's largest cities . Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said , " I think I have an idea for our next film . " 
 Emmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large @-@ scale attack , with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that " for the most part , in alien invasion movies , they come down to Earth and they 're hidden in some back field ... [ o ] r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone 's head . " Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy , " would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance ? " The two wrote the script during a month @-@ long vacation in Mexico , and just one day after they sent it out for consideration , 20th Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay . Pre @-@ production began just three days later in February 1995 . The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel , vehicles , and costumes for the film ; however , they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script 's Area 51 references . 
 A then @-@ record 3 @,@ 000 @-@ plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film . The shoot utilized on @-@ set , in @-@ camera special effects more often than computer @-@ generated effects in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results . Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City , California , where the film 's art department , motion control photography teams , pyrotechnics team , and model shop were headquartered . The production 's model @-@ making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings , city streets , aircraft , landmarks , and monuments . The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film , including a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) destroyer model and a version of the mother ship spanning 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . City streets were recreated , then tilted upright beneath a high @-@ speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards . An explosion would be ignited below the model , and flames would rise towards the camera , engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling " wall of destruction " look seen in the film . A model of the White House was also created , covering 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) by 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) , and was used in forced @-@ perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene . The detonation took a week to plan and required 40 explosive charges . 
 The film 's aliens were designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos . The actual aliens in the film are diminutive and based on a design Tatopoulos drew when tasked by Emmerich to create an alien that was " both familiar and completely original " . These creatures wear " bio @-@ mechanical " suits that are based on another design Tatopoulos pitched to Emmerich . These suits were 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) tall , equipped with 25 tentacles , and purposely designed to show it could not sustain a person inside so it would not appear to be a " man in a suit " .

 Principal photography began in July 1995 in New York City . A second unit gathered plate shots and establishing shots of Manhattan , Washington D.C. , an RV community in Flagstaff , Arizona , and the Very Large Array on the Plains of San Agustin , New Mexico . The main crew also filmed in nearby Cliffside Park , New Jersey before moving to the former Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana , California to film the post @-@ attack Los Angeles sequences . The production then moved to Wendover , Utah , and West Wendover , Nevada , where the deserts doubled for Imperial Valley , and the Wendover Airport doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors . It was here where Pullman filmed his pre @-@ battle speech . Immediately before filming the scene , Devlin and Pullman decided to add " Today , we celebrate our Independence Day ! " to the end of the speech . At the time , the production was nicknamed " ID4 " because Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title Independence Day , and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in dailies , the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title . The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later . 
 The production team moved to the Bonneville Salt Flats to film three scenes , then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles , including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant . Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material . The filmmakers originally intended to use the chroma key technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass ; but the composited images were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a " clinical look " . The attacker hangar set contained an attacker mock @-@ up 65 feet ( 20 m ) wide that took four months to build . The White House interior sets used had already been built for The American President and had previously been used for Nixon . Principal photography completed on November 3 , 1995 . 
 The film originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism . He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission . According to Dean Devlin , test audiences responded well to the scene 's irony and comedic value . However , the scene was re @-@ shot to include Russell 's acceptance as a volunteer , his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft , and him flying an F / A @-@ 18 instead of the biplane . Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life , and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F / A @-@ 18s was " just not believable " . The film was officially completed on June 20 , 1996 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The Grammy Award @-@ winning score for the film was composed by David Arnold and recorded with an orchestra of 90 , a choir of 46 , and " and every last ounce of stereotypical Americana he could muster for the occasion " . The film 's producer Dean Devlin commented that " you can leave it up to a Brit to write some of the most rousing and patriotic music in the history of American cinema . " The soundtrack has received two official CD releases . RCA released a 50 @-@ minute album at the time of the film 's release , then in 2010 , La @-@ La Land Records released a limited edition 2 @-@ CD set that comprised the complete score plus 12 alternate cues . The premiere of Independence Day live will take place at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2016 , with the film 's score performed live to a screening of the film . This celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the film 's release , and the event will also feature a pre @-@ film talk by David Arnold .

 While the film was still in post @-@ production , Fox began a massive marketing campaign to help promote the film , beginning with the airing of a dramatic commercial during Super Bowl XXX , for which it paid $ 1 @.@ 3 million . The film 's subsequent success at the box office resulted in the trend of using Super Bowl air time to kick off the advertising campaign for potential blockbusters . 
 Fox 's Licensing and Merchandising division also entered into co @-@ promotional deals with Apple Inc . The co @-@ marketing project was dubbed " The Power to Save the World " campaign , in which the company used footage of David using his PowerBook laptop in their print and television advertisements . Trendmasters entered a merchandising deal with the film 's producers to create a line of tie @-@ in toys . In exchange for product placement , Fox also entered into co @-@ promotional deals with Molson Coors Brewing Company and Coca @-@ Cola . 
 The film was marketed with several taglines , including : " We 've always believed we weren 't alone . On July 4 , we 'll wish we were " , " Earth . Take a good look . It could be your last " , and " Don 't make plans for August " . The weekend before the film 's release , the Fox Network aired a half @-@ hour special on the film , the first third of which was a spoof news report on the events that happen in the film . Roger Ebert attributed most of the film 's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns , acknowledging them as " truly brilliant " . 
 The film had its official premiere held at Los Angeles ' now @-@ defunct Mann Plaza Theater on June 25 , 1996 . It was then screened privately at the White House for President Bill Clinton and his family before receiving a nationwide release in the United States on July 2 , 1996 , a day earlier than its previously scheduled opening . 
 After a six @-@ week , $ 30 million marketing campaign , Independence Day was released on VHS on November 22 , 1996 .

 Upon its release , Independence Day received praise for its visuals and sense of fun , but criticism of its writing . Rotten Tomatoes reports a score of 61 % , based on 59 reviews , with the site 's critical consensus reading : " The plot is thin and so is character development , but as a thrilling , spectacle @-@ filled summer movie , Independence Day delivers . " On Metacritic , the film has a score of 59 out of 100 , based on 19 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Critics noted that the film had " cardboard " and " stereotypical " characters , and weak dialogue . Yet the shot of the White House 's destruction has been declared a milestone in visual effects , and one of the most memorable scenes of the 1990s . In a 2010 poll , readers of Entertainment Weekly rated it the second @-@ greatest summer film of the previous 20 years , ranking only behind Jurassic Park . 
 Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating , declaring it the " apotheosis " of Star Wars . Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B + for living up to its massive hype , adding " charm is the foremost of this epic 's contemporary characteristics . The script is witty , knowing , cool . " Eight years later , Entertainment Weekly would rate the film as one of the best disaster films of all time . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film did an " excellent job conveying the boggling immensity of [ the ] extraterrestrial vehicles [ ... ] and panic in the streets " and the scenes of the alien attack were " disturbing , unsettling and completely convincing " . 
 However , the film 's nationalistic overtones were widely criticized by reviewers outside the U.S. Movie Review UK described the film as " a mish @-@ mash of elements from a wide variety of alien invasion movies and gung @-@ ho American jingoism . " The speech during which Whitmore states that victory in the coming war would see the entire world henceforth describe July 4 as its Independence Day , was described in a BBC review as " the most jaw @-@ droppingly pompous soliloquy ever delivered in a mainstream Hollywood movie . " In 2003 , readers of Empire , voted the scene that contained this speech as the " <unk> Movie Moment of All @-@ Time " . Conversely , Empire critic Kim Newman gave the film a five @-@ star rating in the magazine 's original review of the film . 
 Several prominent critics expressed disappointment with the quality of the film 's special effects . Newsweek 's David Ansen claimed the special effects were of no better caliber than those seen nineteen years earlier in Star Wars . Todd McCarthy of Variety felt the production 's budget @-@ conscious approach resulted in " cheesy " shots that lacked in quality relative to the effects present in films directed by James Cameron and Steven Spielberg . In his review , Roger Ebert took note of a lack of imagination in the spaceship and creature designs . Gene Siskel expressed the same sentiments on At the Movies review of the film .

 Disaster elements portrayed in Independence Day represented a significant turning point for Hollywood blockbuster films . With advancements in CGI special effects , events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed , such as 1998 's Armageddon and Deep Impact .

The novel presents the film 's finale as originally scripted , with the character played by Randy Quaid stealing a missile and roping it to his <unk> biplane . 
 Following the film 's success , a prequel novel entitled Independence Day : Silent Zone was written by Molstad in February 1998 . The novel is set in the late 1960s and early 1970s , and details the early career of Dr. Brackish Okun . 
 Molstad wrote a third novel , Independence Day : War in the Desert in July 1999 . Set in Saudi Arabia on July 3 , it centers around Captain Cummins and Colonel Thompson , the two Royal Air Force officers seen receiving the Morse code message in the film .

Emmerich , however , made assurances that the films would be shot back @-@ to @-@ back , regardless of Smith 's involvement . 
 In March 2013 , Emmerich stated that the titles of the new films would be ID Forever Part I and ID Forever Part II . In November 2014 , the sequel was given the green light by 20th Century Fox , with a release date of June 24 , 2016 . This would be a stand @-@ alone sequel , that would not split into two parts as originally planned , with filming beginning in May 2015 and casting being done after the studio locked down Emmerich as the director of the film .

 = Marsh rice rat = 
 The marsh rice rat ( Oryzomys palustris ) is a semiaquatic North American rodent in the family Cricetidae . It usually occurs in wetland habitats , such as swamps and salt marshes . It is found mostly in the eastern and southern United States , from New Jersey and Kansas south to Florida and northeasternmost Tamaulipas , Mexico ; its range previously extended further west and north , where it may have been a commensal in corn @-@ cultivating communities . Weighing about 40 to 80 g ( 1 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 8 oz ) , the marsh rice rat is a medium @-@ sized rodent that resembles the common black and brown rat . The upperparts are generally gray @-@ brown , but are reddish in many Florida populations . The feet show several specializations for life in the water . The skull is large and flattened , and is short at the front . 
 John Bachman discovered the marsh rice rat in 1816 , and it was formally described in 1837 . Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s , mainly from Florida , but there is disagreement over their validity . The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species , the silver rice rat ( Oryzomys argentatus ) . Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west , which suggests that the western populations may be recognized as a separate species , Oryzomys texensis . The species is part of the genus Oryzomys , which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico , Central America , and northwestern South America , some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of the marsh rice rat . One , Oryzomys couesi , occurs with the marsh rice rat in Tamaulipas and southern Texas . 
 The marsh rice rat is active during the night , makes nests of sedge and grass , and occasionally builds runways . It has a diverse diet that includes plants , fungi , and a variety of animals . Population densities are usually below 10 per ha ( 4 per acre ) and home ranges vary from 0 @.@ 23 to 0 @.@ 37 ha ( 0 @.@ 57 to 0 @.@ 91 acres ) , depending on sex and geography . Litters of generally three to five young are born after a pregnancy of about 25 days , mainly during the summer . Newborns are helpless at birth , but are weaned after a few weeks . Several animals prey on the marsh rice rat , including the barn owl , and it usually lives for less than a year in the wild . It is infected by many different parasites and harbors a hantavirus that also infects humans . The species is not of conservation concern , but some populations are threatened . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The marsh rice rat is classified as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys , which is distributed from the eastern United States ( marsh rice rat ) into northwestern South America ( O. gorgasi ) . Oryzomys previously included many other species , which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than 40 species from the genus . All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , a diverse assemblage of over 100 species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents , most of which occur in South and Central America . In the United States , the marsh rice rat is the only oryzomyine rodent except for Oryzomys couesi in a small area of southern Texas ; the only other sigmodontines present are several species of cotton rats ( Sigmodon ) in the southern half of the country . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The marsh rice rat was discovered in 1816 in South Carolina by John Bachman . Bachman intended to describe the species as Arvicola <unk> , but sent a specimen to Richard Harlan and Charles Pickering at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia to confirm its identity . Another specimen , from New Jersey , was found in the Academy 's collection , and Harlan took it upon himself , against Pickering 's wishes , to describe the new species as Mus palustris , proclaiming it one of the few true rats of the United States . The specific name palustris is Latin for " marshy " and refers to the usual habitat of the species . 
 In 1854 , in The quadrupeds of North America , Bachman redescribed it as Arvicola <unk> , considering it more closely related to the voles then placed in the genus Arvicola , and also recorded it from Georgia and Florida . Three years later , Spencer Fullerton Baird argued that the referral of the species to Arvicola was erroneous and introduced a new generic name for the marsh rice rat , Oryzomys . The name combines the Greek <unk> " rice " and mys " mouse " and refers to the rat 's habit of eating rice . At the time , Oryzomys was recognized either as a full genus or as a subgenus of the now @-@ defunct genus Hesperomys , but since the 1890s , it has been universally recognized as a genus distinct from Hesperomys , with the marsh rice rat ( Oryzomys palustris ) as its type species . 
 = = = Species boundaries and subspecies = = = 
 In the 1890s , several subspecies of the marsh rice rat were described from the United States : O. p. natator from Florida in 1893 , O. p. texensis from Texas in 1894 , and O. p. coloratus from elsewhere in Florida in 1898 . Clinton Hart Merriam recognized O. p. natator as a separate species in 1901 and described a subspecies of it , O. p. floridanus , but considered O. p. texensis to be nearly identical to nominate O. p. palustris . In his 1918 revision of North American Oryzomys , Edward Alphonso Goldman again recognized all these as a single species , Oryzomys palustris . He distinguished four subspecies , which he said formed a " closely intergrading series " — O. p. palustris from New Jersey to southeastern Mississippi and eastern Missouri ; O. p. natator in central Florida ; O. p. coloratus ( including O. natator floridanus Merriam ) in southern Florida ; and O. p. texensis from western Mississippi and southeastern Kansas to eastern Texas . Two additional subspecies were described by William J. Hamilton in 1955 from southern Florida : O. p. planirostris from Pine Island and two miles ( 3 km ) north of Fort Myers and O. p. sanibeli from Sanibel Island . Also in 1955 , Claude W. Hibbard described a new species of Oryzomys , O. fossilis , from Pleistocene deposits in Kansas , on the basis of small differences in characters of the tooth with living marsh rice rats . In 1965 , Walter <unk> demoted this species , later also found in Texas , to a subspecies , because it does not differ more from living marsh rice rats than the latter differ from each other . 
 Merriam and Goldman had recognized that a number of Central American species , including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions , are related to the marsh rice rat . O. couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas , where its distribution meets that of the marsh rice rat . In 1960 , Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O. couesi and the marsh rice rat , and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat . While reporting on the ecology of Texan O. couesi in 1979 , Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O. couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct , with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color ; their karyotypes were also distinct . Since then , the two have generally been retained as distinct species , as supported by further research ; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places ( in sympatry ) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas , Mexico . 
 In 1973 , rice rats were discovered at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys , and in 1978 Spitzer and <unk> described this population as a new species , Oryzomys argentatus . The status of this form — either a distinct species or not even <unk> distinct from O. palustris natator — has remained controversial since ; the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World does not recognize O. argentatus as a separate species , but acknowledges a need for further research . A 2005 study using microsatellite DNA found that Florida Keys rice rats exhibit low genetic variation and are significantly different from Everglades rice rats ; the study concluded in favor of classifying the Keys rice rat as a " distinct vertebrate population " . This population probably diverged from mainland rice rats about 2000 years ago . 
 Among the described subspecies , a 1989 morphometrical study by Humphrey and Setzer separated only two — O. p. natator from much of Florida ( including O. p. coloratus , O. p. planirostris , O. p. sanibeli , and O. p. floridanus , as well as O. p. argentatus ) and O. p. palustris from the rest of the range ( including O. p. texensis ) . However , Whitaker and Hamilton in their 1998 book on the Mammals of the Eastern United States recognized O. p. planirostris and O. p. sanibeli as separate subspecies , but merged all others into O. p. palustris , and placed O. argentatus as a separate species ; their classification was based on their emphasis of overwater gaps as agents of biological diversification and a critique of shortcomings in Humphrey and Setzer 's study , not on a reanalysis of the data . 
 In 2010 , Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study of the relationships among populations of Oryzomys on the basis of data from three genes — the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b ( Cytb ) and two nuclear markers , exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid @-@ binding protein gene ( Rbp3 ) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 ( Adh1 @-@ I2 ) . The Cytb data placed all marsh rice rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O. couesi ; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11 @.@ 30 % . The marsh rice rats fell into two main groups , differing on average by 6 @.@ 05 % , one containing animals from Mississippi , southwestern Tennessee , and further west , and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east . Within the eastern group , variation was only about 0 @.@ 65 % , though examples of the putative subspecies O. p. palustris , O. p. coloratus , O. p. sanibeli , and O. p. planirostris were all included . Data from both of the slower @-@ evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1 @-@ I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades , but did not recover the western and eastern groups of the marsh rice rat as separate clades . In addition , Adh1 @-@ I2 placed a Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O. couesi group . The combined data supported the western and eastern clades within the marsh rice rat and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O. couesi . Using the genetic species concept , the authors suggested that the western populations of the marsh rice rat be recognized as a separate species , Oryzomys texensis . They recommended further research in the Mississippi – Alabama – Tennessee region , where the ranges of the two meet . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 Many common names have been proposed for the marsh rice rat . Early describers used " Rice Meadow @-@ Mouse " and " Rice @-@ field Mouse " and in the early 1900s , name such as " rice rat " , " marsh mouse " , and " swamp rice rat " came into use . Some of the subspecies received their own common names , such as " Florida Marsh Mouse " , " Swimming Rice Rat " , and " Central Florida Rice Rat " for O. p. natator ; " Bangs ' Marsh Mouse " , " Cape Sable Rice Rat " , and " Everglades Rice Rat " for O. p. coloratus ; and " Texas Rice Rat " for O. p. texensis . The species is now usually known as the " marsh rice rat " , although " marsh oryzomys " has also been in recent use . The Florida Keys form ( argentatus ) is known as the " silver rice rat " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The marsh rice rat is a medium @-@ sized rodent that looks much like the common black and brown rats , but has greater differences in color between the upper- and underparts . The fur is thick and short . The upperparts are generally gray to grayish brown , with the head a bit lighter , and are sharply delimited from the underparts , which are off @-@ white , as are the feet . There are small cheek pouches . The ears are about the same color as the upperparts , but there is a patch of light hairs in front of them . The tail is dark brown above and may be paler below . The guard hairs are long and have unpigmented , silvery tips . When rice rats swim , air is trapped in the fur , which increases buoyancy and reduces heat loss . As in most other oryzomyines , females have eight mammae . 
 The forefeet have four and the hindfeet five digits . On the forefeet , the ungual tufts ( tufts of hair on the digits ) are absent . The hindfeet are broad and have a short fifth digit . Many of the pads are reduced , as are the ungual tufts , but there are small interdigital webs . The Florida Keys form , argentatus , has even more reduced ungual tufts . Many of these traits are common adaptations to life in the water in oryzomyines . 
 There is some geographic variation in fur color : western populations ( texensis ) are lighter than those from the east ( nominate palustris ) , and Florida populations are generally more tawny or reddish than either , with those from southern Florida ( coloratus ) being brighter than those from the center of the state ( natator ) . The Florida Keys form ( argentatus ) is silvery , and the two other Florida forms — planirostris and sanibeli — lack the reddish tones of mainland Florida populations and are instead grayish , resembling nominate palustris ( planirostris ) , or brownish ( sanibeli ) . In 1989 , Humphrey and Setzer reviewed variation in color among Florida populations . They found argentatus to be substantially lighter and planirostris and sanibeli to be somewhat darker than mainland populations , and argentatus to have a less yellow fur , but found no significant differences in redness . There was also substantial variation within populations . 
 Total length is 226 to 305 mm ( 8 @.@ 9 to 12 @.@ 0 in ) , tail length 108 to 156 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 to 6 @.@ 1 in ) , hindfoot length 28 to 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 5 in ) , and body mass 40 to 80 g ( 1 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 8 oz ) , with males slightly larger than females . The largest individuals occur in Florida and along the Gulf Coast east of the Mississippi River delta . 
 The stomach has the characteristic pattern of sigmodontines ( unilocular @-@ hemiglandular ) : it is not split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part ( antrum ) is covered by a glandular epithelium . The gall bladder is absent , a synapomorphy ( shared @-@ derived character ) of Oryzomyini . The karyotype includes 56 chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60 chromosomal arms ( 2n 
 = 56 , FN = 
 60 ) . The form of the sex chromosomes has been used to distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi , but may be too variable among Oryzomys to be useful in differentiating species . X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat , even though the animal lacks LINE @-@ 1 <unk> , which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process . Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies ; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation . At about 50 % , hematocrit ( the proportion of red blood cells in the blood ) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents ; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming underwater . 
 = = = Male reproductive anatomy = = = 
 The glans penis is long and robust , averaging 7 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 29 in ) long and 4 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 18 in ) broad , and the baculum ( penis bone ) is 6 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 26 in ) long . As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae , the marsh rice rat has a complex penis , with the distal ( far ) end of the baculum ending in three digits . The central digit is notably larger than those at the sides . The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines , but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue . The papilla ( nipple @-@ like projection ) on the dorsal ( upper ) side of the penis is covered with small spines , a character the marsh rice rat shares only with Oligoryzomys and Oryzomys couesi among oryzomyines examined . On the urethral process , located in the crater at the end of the penis , a fleshy process ( the subapical lobule ) is present ; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except O. couesi and Holochilus brasiliensis . The baculum is deeper than it is wide . 
 Some features of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines . In the marsh rice rat , a single pair of preputial glands is present at the penis . As is usual for sigmodontines , there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands . Part of the end of the vesicular gland is irregularly folded , not smooth as in most oryzomyines . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 The marsh rice rat has a large , flattened skull with a short and broad rostrum ( front part ) . The nasal and premaxillary bones extend back beyond the point where the lacrimal , frontal , and maxillary bones meet . In planirostris , the rostrum is flatter than in mainland Florida forms , in which it is more convex , and the nasals are said to be relatively longer in argentatus . The zygomatic plate , the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) , is broad and develops a notch at its front end . The arches themselves are robust and contain small but distinct jugal bones . The sphenopalatine foramen , a foramen ( opening ) in the side of the skull above the molars , is large ; it is much smaller in O. couesi . The narrowest part of the interorbital region ( located between the eyes ) is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves . The marsh rice rat has a narrow braincase lined by prominent ridges and a narrow interparietal bone . According to Goldman , Florida animals ( coloratus and natator ) generally have the largest and broadest skulls , and western specimens ( texensis ) have somewhat smaller and narrower skulls than those from the east outside Florida ( nominate palustris ) . In argentatus , the skull is also relatively narrow . 
 The incisive foramina , openings in the front part of the palate , reach backward between the molars . The palate is long , extending substantially beyond the third molars . The back part , near the third molars , is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits , which are recessed into fossae ( depressions ) . The mesopterygoid fossa , the gap behind the end of the palate , is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities , which are set far to the front . The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived . The subsquamosal fenestra , an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone , is present . The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani , the roof of the tympanic cavity , a defining character of oryzomyines . There are some openings in the mastoid bone . 
 In the mandible ( lower jaw ) , the mental foramen , an opening just before the first molar , opens sidewards , not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines . The upper and lower masseteric ridges , which anchor some of the chewing muscles , join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point . The capsular process , a raising of the bone of the back of the mandible that houses the back end of the incisor , is present , but not as large as in O. couesi . 
 = = = Teeth = = = 
 The dental formula is 1 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 @.@ 31 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 @.@ 3 × 2 = 16 ( one upper and one lower incisor and three upper and three lower molars ) , as usual in muroid rodents . The upper incisors are well @-@ developed and strongly opisthodont , with the chewing edge located behind the vertical plane of the teeth . The molars are bunodont , with the cusps higher than the connecting crests , and brachydont , low @-@ crowned , as in most other oryzomyines . Many accessory crests , including the mesoloph on the upper molars and the mesolophid on the lower molars , are present , another trait the marsh rice rat shares with most but not all other oryzomyines . The flexi and <unk> ( valleys between the cusps and crests ) at the labial ( outer ) side of the molars are closed by cingula ( ridges ) . 
 The upper molars have two longitudinal rows of cusps , not three as in the black and brown rats . The first and second upper molar are oval in form and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars . The anterocone , the front cusp of the upper first molar , is not divided in two by an indentation at its front ( anteromedian flexus ) , but does display a hollow in the middle , the anteromedian fossette , which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual ( inner ) sides of the molar . A crest , the anteroloph , is present behind the labial cuspule , but in older animals , the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear . In the third upper molar , the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable . As in most oryzomyines , the upper molars all have one root on the inner ( lingual ) side and two on the outer ( labial ) side ; in addition , the first upper molar usually has another small labial root . 
 The first lower molar is rounded at the front end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid , the frontmost cusp , are barely distinct . The second lower molar is elongate and has a crest , the anterolophid , before the two cusps that form the front edge of the molar in some other oryzomyines , the protoconid and metaconid . There is a distinct ridge ( anterolabial cingulum ) at the outer front ( anterolabial ) edge of the molar , before the protoconid . The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid , albeit a less well @-@ defined one . The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between , at the labial and lingual side . The second and third lowers molars have either two roots , one labial and one lingual , or only one at the front , and another large root at the back . 
 = = = Postcranial skeleton = = = 
 As usual in oryzomyines , there are twelve ribs . The first rib articulates with both the last cervical ( neck ) and first thoracic ( chest ) vertebrae , a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae . <unk> , processes at the back of a vertebra , are absent from the fifth lumbar . Between the second and third caudal vertebrae , hemal arches ( small bones ) are present with a spinous back border . The entepicondylar foramen is absent , as in all members of the Sigmodontinae ; if present , as in some other rodents , this foramen perforates the distal ( far ) end of the humerus ( upper arm bone ) . 
 = = = Physiology = = = 
 Studies have shown that in poor conditions the weight of the adrenal gland may increase up to 200 % , that rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated , and that in water contaminated with oil they swim less and their mortality increases . The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5 @.@ 25 Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7 @.@ 20 mg / kg ; both values are relatively low for <unk> rodents . In one study , wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease . Experiments have found that exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats . When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats , the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The marsh rice rat currently occurs in much of the eastern and southern United States , northeast to southern New Jersey , and south to southeastern Texas and far northeastern Tamaulipas , Mexico . The northernmost records in the interior United States are in eastern Oklahoma , southeastern Kansas , southern Missouri and Illinois , and the southern half of Kentucky , but the species is absent in much of the Appalachians . Fossils of the marsh rice rat are known from Rancholabrean ( late Pleistocene , less than 300 @,@ 000 years ago ) deposits in Florida and Georgia and remains referred to the extinct subspecies O. p. fossilis are from the Wisconsinan and Sangamonian of Texas and Illinoian and Sangamonian of Kansas . In the Florida Keys , rice rats occur on most of the Lower Keys , but are absent from the Upper Keys , which are of a different geological origin and were probably never connected to the mainland . The western and eastern Cytb clades within the marsh rice rat may represent expansions from different glacial refugia which the species was restricted to during a glacial period . 
 Cave and archeological remains indicate that the range of the marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene , into central Texas , eastern Nebraska , southwestern Iowa , central Illinois , southern Indiana , southern Ohio , West Virginia , and southwestern Pennsylvania . Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000 CE and are associated with corn cultivation , but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus <unk> , suggesting warm climatic conditions . Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled , relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn @-@ cultivating Native American communities . Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats , possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations . 
 In Tamaulipas and southern Texas , the ranges of the marsh rice rat and the related Oryzomys couesi meet ; in parts of Kenedy , Willacy and Cameron counties , Texas , and in far northeastern Tamaulipas , the two are sympatric ( occur in the same places ) . In experimental conditions , they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild . Compared to O. couesi , the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone , probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast . 
 The marsh rice rat occurs in several habitats , ranging from coastal salt marshes to mountain streams and clearings . It is semiaquatic , spending much time in the water , and usually occurs in wetland habitats . It prefers areas where the ground is covered with grasses and sedges , which protect it from predators . In southern Illinois , marsh rice rats are more likely to occur in wetlands with more herbaceous cover , visual obstruction , and nearby grasslands . The species also occurs in drier uplands , which serve as sinks for young , dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide . Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers ; studies on islands off Virginia 's Delmarva Peninsula show that they readily cross 300 @-@ m ( 1000 ft ) channels between islands . 
 = = Behavior and ecology = = 
 Marsh rice rats are active during the night and for this reason are rarely seen , although they may be among the most common small mammals in part of their range . They will build nests of sedge and grass , about 13 cm ( 5 in ) large , which are placed under debris , near shrubs , in short burrows , or high in aquatic vegetation . They may also use old nests of marsh wrens ( <unk> palustris ) , red @-@ winged blackbirds ( <unk> <unk> ) , muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus ) or round @-@ tailed muskrats ( Neofiber alleni ) . Marsh rice rats sometimes make large runways or dig burrows . They are accomplished and willing swimmers , easily swimming for more than 10 m ( 33 ft ) under water , and will often seek safety in the water when alarmed . Rice rats in the Florida Keys occasionally climb in vegetation , but never higher than 90 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) . Marsh rice rats are very clean and extensively groom themselves , perhaps to keep their fur water @-@ repellent . They are aggressive towards conspecifics and emit high @-@ pitched squeaks while fighting . In dense vegetation , the perceptual range ( the distance from which an animal can detect a patch of suitable habitat ) of marsh rice rats is less than 10 m ( 33 ft ) . When released outside of their natural wetland habitat , marsh rice rats generally move either upwind or downwind ( <unk> ) , perhaps in order to move in a straight line , which is an efficient strategy to find suitable habitat . 
 Many animals prey on marsh rice rats . The barn owl ( Tyto alba ) is among the most important ; one study found that 97 @.@ 5 % of vertebrate remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats . Other predators include birds ( marsh hawks , Circus cyaneus ; and barred owls , Strix varia ) , snakes ( cottonmouth moccasins , Agkistrodon piscivorus ; and others ) , alligators , and carnivorans ( raccoons , Procyon lotor ; red foxes , Vulpes vulpes ; minks , <unk> vison ; weasels of the genus Mustela ; and striped skunks , <unk> <unk> ) . Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat , including various ticks and mites , lice , and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans , a <unk> , and several <unk> among internal parasites ( see parasites of the marsh rice rat ) . 
 <unk> , a bacterial disease affecting the jaws , is particularly virulent in marsh rice rats ; the animal has been proposed as a model for research on the disease in humans . The identity of the bacterial agent remains unknown . Vitamin E , fluoride , and iodide protect against bone loss associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high @-@ sucrose diet increases the severity of periodontitis . A case of <unk> has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat . 
 = = = Population dynamics = = = 
 The population density of the marsh rice rat usually does not reach 10 per ha ( 4 per acre ) . The weather may influence population dynamics ; in the Everglades , densities may exceed 200 per ha ( 80 per acre ) when flooding concentrates populations on small islands , In the Florida Keys , population density is less than 1 per ha ( 0 @.@ 4 per acre ) . On Breton Island , Louisiana , perhaps an atypical habitat , home ranges in males average about 0 @.@ 37 hectares ( 0 @.@ 91 acres ) and in females about 0 @.@ 23 hectares ( 0 @.@ 57 acres ) . A study in Florida found male home ranges to average 0 @.@ 25 hectares ( 0 @.@ 62 acres ) and female 0 @.@ 33 hectares ( 0 @.@ 82 acres ) . 
 Population size is usually largest during the summer and declines during winter , although populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more seasonally stable . Animals also often lose weight during winter . Population size varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas . In coastal Mississippi , a study found that storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially and in Texas inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density . However , another study in Mississippi found that flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance . 
 In the northern part of its range , the species often occurs with the meadow vole ( Microtus pennsylvanicus ) , but there is no evidence that they compete with each other . In the south , the hispid cotton rat ( Sigmodon hispidus ) and the rice rat regularly occur together ; water levels are known to influence relative abundance of these two species in Florida . The cotton rat is mainly active during the day , which may help differentiate its niche from that of the rice rat . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The marsh rice rat takes both vegetable and animal food , and is more carnivorous than most small rodents are ; dominant food items vary seasonally . Plants eaten include species of Spartina , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , among others ; it mainly eats seeds and succulent parts . A 2004 study found that it prefers Spartina alterniflora that have been fertilized with nitrogen and mainly eats the inner tissue of the stem , perhaps because nitrogen @-@ fertilized plants contain much less <unk> in their inner tissues . The marsh rice rat was a major pest on rice plantations , feeding on the rice when it was newly planted . It also eats the fungus <unk> at times . 
 Animals that are important to the marsh rice rat 's diet include insects , fiddler crabs , and snails , but the species is known to eat many other animals , including fish , clams , and juvenile <unk> and Chrysemys turtles . They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats , deermice , and sparrows , and may be the most important predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren . Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow ( Ammodramus maritimus ) and are aggressive towards the sparrow , apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida . On islands in North Carolina , rice rats consume eggs of Forster 's tern ( Sterna forsteri ) . They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia . 
 Laboratory studies have found that rice rats assimilate 88 % to 95 % of the energy in their food . They lose weight when fed on Spartina , fiddler crabs , or sunflower seeds alone , but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight . In an experiment , marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior , but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest . Even when they live in uplands , they mostly eat water plants and animals , although they consume some upland plants . 
 = = = Reproduction and life cycle = = = 
 Breeding occurs mostly during the summer . Some studies report that breeding ceases entirely during the winter , but winter breeding occurs as far north as Virginia . This is primarily because photoperiod influences their circadian rhythm which determines breeding . In both Texas and Virginia , there is less variation in reproductive activity in females than in males . In the south of its range , animals may breed less when the summer is at its warmest . The duration of the estrous cycle ranges from 6 to 9 days , with an average of 7 @.@ 72 days . Estrus occurs again after a litter is born . A 1970 study reported that copulatory behavior in the marsh rice rat is similar to that in laboratory brown rats . Before mating starts , " the male pursues the running female from behind . " The male then repeatedly mounts and dismounts the female ; not all mounts result in an ejaculation . Penetrations only last for about 250 ms , but during mating the penetrations and the intervals between them become longer . Even when a male is satiated after mating , it is able to copulate again when a new female is introduced ( the Coolidge effect ) . Partly because of resistance by the female , the frequency of ejaculation during mating is rather low in marsh rice rats as compared to laboratory rats , hamsters , and deermice . 
 After a gestation of about 25 days , three to five young are usually born , although litter sizes vary from one to seven . Females may have up to six litters a year . Newborns weigh 3 to 4 g ( about 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 15 oz ) and are blind and almost naked . About as many males as females are born . The external ears ( pinnae ) soon unfold and on the first day claws are visible and the young emit high @-@ pitched squeaks . On the second day , they are able to crawl and during the third to fifth days the whiskers and eyelids develop . On the two subsequent days , the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active . Between the eighth and eleventh day , the eyes open , the fur develops , and the young begin to take solid food . Weaning occurs on the eleventh to twentieth day according to different studies . There is considerable variation in reported body masses at different ages , perhaps because of geographic variation . Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60 days old . In the wild , rice rats usually live for less than a year ; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The marsh rice rat is generally of little importance to humans , which is perhaps why it is not as well @-@ studied as some other North American rodents . In 1931 , Arthur <unk> noted that virtually no information had been published on the habits and life history of the marsh rice rat since the 1854 publication of Audubon and Bachman 's description . Writing on Everglades mammals , Thomas E. Lodge notes that although the name " rat " may associate it unpleasantly with the introduced black and brown rats , its appearance is more endearing , even cute . J.S. Steward proposed the marsh rice rat as a model organism in 1951 to study certain infections that other rodents used at the time are not susceptible to . The marsh rice rat is quite susceptible to periodontitis and has been used as a model system for the study of that disease . 
 The marsh rice rat is the primary host of the Bayou virus ( BAYV ) , the second most common agent of hantavirus infections in the United States . About 16 % of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old , heavy males . The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights . It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta . Two related hantaviruses , <unk> virus and Playa de Oro virus , are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico , respectively . An <unk> normally associated with woodrats ( <unk> ) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats . Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi , the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States , have been found in marsh rice rats in Virginia , Maryland , North Carolina , and Tennessee . Another pathogenic bacterium , <unk> , is known from Georgia marsh rice rats . 
 The 2009 IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of the marsh rice rat as " Least Concern " , because it is a common , widespread , and stable species without major threats that occurs in several protected areas . The Florida Keys form is rare and in decline and is threatened by competition with the black rat , predation by domestic cats , habitat loss , and loss of genetic variation ; it is considered endangered . At the northern edge of its distribution , the marsh rice rat is listed as threatened in Illinois and whether it persists in Pennsylvania is unclear ; it probably formerly occurred in tidal marshes on the Delaware River . In Illinois , its population may have regenerated because wetlands have been developed to protect waterfowl and shorebirds and because suitable wetlands often develop in abandoned coal @-@ mining operations . A 2001 study projected that climate change would reduce the range of the marsh rice rat in Texas , where it is now common but may become threatened by habitat loss in the future . A study at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant found that rice rats accumulate more PCBs but less heavy metal than white @-@ footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) .

The design for U @-@ 23 was based on submarines of the Royal Danish Navy 's Havmanden class ( three of which had been built in Austria @-@ Hungary ) , and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war . 
 U @-@ 23 was just over 127 feet ( 39 m ) long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes , a deck gun , and a machine gun . In February 1918 , U @-@ 23 was sunk with all hands by the Italian torpedo boat [ [ Italian torpedo boat Airone ( 1907 ) | Airone ] ] while attempting an attack on the Italian transport <unk> .

 When it became apparent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short one , they moved to bolster their U @-@ boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines , three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume . Although the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design , which was largely obsolete , it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for U @-@ 23 and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915 . 
 U @-@ 23 was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Hungarian <unk> yard in Fiume . Due to demands by the Hungarian government , subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms , and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design , resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general . 
 U @-@ 23 was an ocean @-@ going submarine that displaced 173 tonnes ( 191 short tons ) surfaced and 210 tonnes ( 231 short tons ) submerged and was designed for a complement of 18 . She was 127 feet 2 inches ( 38 @.@ 76 m ) long with a beam of 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . For propulsion , she featured a single shaft , a single 450 bhp ( 340 kW ) diesel engine for surface running , and a single 160 shp ( 120 kW ) electric motor for submerged travel . She was capable of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) while surfaced and 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 23 , the Havmanden class , upon which the U @-@ 20 class was based , had a range of 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) , surfaced , and 23 nautical miles ( 43 km ) at 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) submerged . 
 U @-@ 23 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 66 mm / 26 ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun .

 = Reginald Pinney = 
 Major @-@ General Sir Reginald John Pinney , KCB ( 2 August 1863 – 18 February 1943 ) was a British Army officer who served as a divisional commander during the First World War . While commanding a division at the Battle of Arras in 1917 , he was immortalised as the " cheery old card " of Siegfried Sassoon 's poem " The General " . 
 Pinney served in South Africa during the Boer War with the Royal Fusiliers , and at the outbreak of the First World War was given command of a brigade sent to reinforce the Western Front in November 1914 . He led it in the early part of 1915 , taking heavy losses at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle . That September he was given command of the 35th Division , a New Army division of " bantam " soldiers , which first saw action at the Battle of the Somme ; after three months in action , he was exchanged with the commander of the 33rd Division . 
 He commanded the 33rd at Arras in 1917 , with mixed results , and through the Spring Offensive in 1918 , where the division helped stabilise the defensive line after the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was routed . After the war , he retired to rural Dorset , where he served as a local justice of the peace , as High Sheriff for the county , and as a Deputy Lieutenant ; he was also the ceremonial colonel of his old regiment , the Royal Fusiliers . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Reginald Pinney was born in 1863 in Clifton , Bristol , the eldest son of the Reverend John Pinney , vicar of Coleshill , Warwickshire , and his wife , Harriet . His paternal grandfather was Charles Pinney , a prominent merchant and former mayor of Bristol , whilst his maternal grandfather , John Wingfield @-@ Digby , was a previous vicar of Coleshill ; an uncle , John Wingfield @-@ Digby , would later be the Conservative MP for North Dorset . John and Harriet Pinney had five more children , four sons and a daughter , before Harriet 's death in 1877 . At least one of Reginald 's brothers , John , also passed into the Army , joining the Central India Horse . 
 After four years at Winchester College , Pinney entered the Royal Military Academy , Sandhurst in 1882 . He passed out of the Academy and was appointed to the Royal Fusiliers ( 7th Foot ) as a lieutenant on 6 February 1884 . He spent five years with his regiment before attending the Staff College , Camberley in 1889 – 90 ; after leaving Camberley , he was promoted to captain in December 1891 . From 1896 to 1901 he served on the staff as the deputy assistant adjutant @-@ general at Quetta , in India , with a promotion to major in December 1898 . He married Hester Head in 1900 ; the couple had three sons and three daughters . 
 Pinney saw active service in the Boer War , arriving in South Africa in November 1901 as second @-@ in @-@ command of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Fusiliers . He served with the battalion until the end of the war , following which he was promoted to lieutenant @-@ colonel and given command of the 4th Battalion , with a brevet promotion to colonel in 1906 . He relinquished command of the battalion in 1907 , going on to half pay , and later took up the position of assistant adjutant @-@ general in Egypt in 1909 . He held this posting until 1913 , aged fifty , when he was transferred to command a reserve unit , the Devon and Cornwall Brigade of the Wessex Division in the Territorial Force . 
 = = Brigadier in France = = 
 Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 , an Expeditionary Force of seven regular divisions was mobilised for service in France . At the same time , the Territorial Force was activated to replace them for home defence duties . The Expeditionary Force represented almost all the regular units stationed in the United Kingdom , but only about half the strength of the regular Army ; the remainder was scattered in various stations around the Empire , mainly in India and the Mediterranean . These units were withdrawn as quickly as they could be replaced by Indian or Territorial units , and formed into new divisions to reinforce the Expeditionary Force . 
 The Wessex Division — now numbered as the 43rd — had been assigned for duty in India to free up regular units there , with its staff and support units held back to form the framework of the new 8th Division , which was formed from returning regular battalions . As a result , Pinney was relieved from command of his Territorial brigade in October and assigned to command the newly formed 23rd Brigade , made up from three battalions that had been on garrison duty in Malta and one from Egypt . All were regular units , with very few reservists , but having spent a long period in colonial stations they were considered as only partially trained compared to the units serving with the Expeditionary Force . 
 The 8th Division was sent to France in November 1914 ; immediately after arrival , two battalions were deployed to hold a section of the front line for a week during the closing stages of the First Battle of Ypres . However , the brigade did not see its first major action under Pinney 's command until 10 March 1915 , when it was committed to action as part of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle . The 23rd Brigade met heavy resistance when it began its attack , due to a failure by the divisional artillery to bombard a large section of the defenders ' trenches ; the 2nd Middlesex , making a frontal attack , were wiped out almost completely . The other lead battalion of the brigade , the 2nd Cameronians , was enfiladed from the undamaged sector and took heavy losses , losing almost all its officers and retreating in confusion . Pinney quickly learned of this — he was only two hundred yards from the front line — and decided to continue the attack . As he was not able to call for artillery support , the only possible approach was to send in the two reserve battalions . The second assault suffered heavy casualties at the outset , and quickly had to be called off when it was discovered that the corps artillery was about to fire on the positions being attacked ; the Devonshires and West Yorkshires were withdrawn , having taken high casualties and achieved little . After this , the attack continued to bog down , and whilst there was some success elsewhere in the divisional sector , nothing more was achieved by 23rd Brigade . Following Neuve Chapelle , the brigade was reinforced with two Territorial battalions . At the Battle of Aubers on 9 May , 23rd Brigade was held in reserve by 8th Division and so escaped the heavy casualties of the two attacking brigades . Around noon a scratch force of all available infantry was pushed forward by the divisional commander to support these two brigades , including some units of Pinney 's brigade . 
 = = Divisional command = = 
 Pinney relinquished command of the brigade to Travers Clarke in late June , when he was promoted to major @-@ general and returned to England to take command of the newly formed 35th Division , a New Army volunteer division . The division was mainly drawn from industrial areas of Northern England , with a high proportion of " bantams " , men who were under the normal regulation height of 5 ft 3 in ( 160 cm ) for Army service . Among the officers Pinney first encountered in the 35th was Bernard Montgomery , recently posted as brigade major of the 104th Brigade , who would later serve under him as the GSO2 in the 33rd Division . 
 The division was transferred to France in early 1916 , in preparation for the summer offensive of that year . It moved into the line in February , and Pinney ordered a series of small raids in company or battalion strength through the following months . The 35th was deployed for the Battle of the Somme , assigned to XIII Corps in Fourth Army . It was held in reserve during the Battle of Albert , the opening phases of the attack in early July , but fought in the Battle of Bazentin Ridge and the subsequent attacks on High Wood , where it took heavy casualties ; in a week , one brigade lost a thousand men , a third of its strength . The division rested for a week in early August , but returned to the line almost immediately . At the end of the month , a badly planned and potentially suicidal attack on <unk> Farm was cancelled by Pinney at the last minute when the " facts were pointed out " by Montgomery , and a new plan substituted ; the attacking battalion took the farm with light casualties . Following this , it was withdrawn to a quiet sector of the line . 
 In September , Major @-@ General Herman Landon , commanding the neighbouring 33rd Division was relieved of his command . It was arranged that he would exchange with Pinney in the 35th Division , and the transfer was made on 23 September . The decision to rotate commanders appears to have been a desire to give Landon a less active command , as the 35th was occupying a relatively quiet sector ; presumably , it was felt that Pinney was a more effective commander for an active division . When Pinney met the officers of one of his new battalions in early October 1916 , they recorded that he seemed " pleasant and human " , and " not too old " . However , some of his habits were unpopular ; most <unk> to his men , he stopped the regular issue of rum in the division shortly after taking command , replacing it with tea instead . The infantry were greatly displeased , with one NCO describing him as " a bun @-@ pinching crank , more suited to command of a Church Mission hut than troops " . There was some justification to the jibe ; as well as being teetotal , Pinney did not smoke , and was devoutly religious . The most lasting description of him was written in this period by Siegfried Sassoon , then an officer in one of the 33rd 's battalions , who used Pinney as the subject of his satirical poem " The General " . 
 The 33rd was a New Army division of the same wave as the 35th , but it had lost its original New Army composition ; by late 1916 , it was composed equally of Territorial , Regular and New Army battalions . Rather than the 35th 's bantams , the 33rd had originally been formed from " Pals battalions " , units drawn from local communities so that men could serve alongside their friends and colleagues , and the Public Schools Battalions , made up of former pupils of the elite public schools . Many of the initial units had been transferred out — or , in the case of the latter units , disbanded so that their men could be trained as officers — but a number of these close @-@ knit units still remained in the division . 
 Following Pinney 's arrival the division was withdrawn for two months to reorganise , missing the Battle of Flers @-@ Courcelette , and saw some fighting in the very end of the fighting on the Somme when a " pretentious " plan produced by the divisional command to capture a German trench system at night failed . The 33rd remained on the Somme front until March 1917 , when it was transferred to Amiens to participate in the Arras Offensive . Here , the division fought at the Second Battle of the Scarpe in late April , where it took 700 prisoners but suffered heavy losses . This was followed by a series of attacks on the Hindenburg Line in late May , the first of which , on the night of 20 May , was masterminded by Pinney — one observer noted that " his tail is right up over his back ... he was out for a gamble with his troops and he had it " , though sadly added that despite its great success , he still refused to authorise an issue of rum . A second attack on 27 May was a complete failure ; Pinney later explained the attack as having been a distraction in support of the coming Battle of Messines , an interpretation greeted with some cynicism by observers . 
 Following the fighting around Arras , the 33rd was moved to Nieuwpoort , Belgium , as part of the build @-@ up for the planned Operation Hush , a breakthrough along the coastal front coupled with an amphibious landing behind German lines . After the operation was cancelled , the division remained at <unk> , where Pinney was hospitalised and temporarily relinquished command . He remained in hospital for two months , during which time he missed heavy fighting by the 33rd at the Battle of Passchendaele . After VIII Corps Commander Hunter @-@ Weston had sacked the current divisional commander , Philip . R. Wood , for lack of aggression ( unjustifiably , in Simon Robbins ’ view ) , Pinney returned to the division on 30 November , amid rumours that he had got the return posting through personal influence . 
 The division remained in reserve until April 1918 , when German forces attacked as part of the Spring Offensive . During the Battle of the Lys , the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was effectively wiped out , leaving a two @-@ mile wide gap in the British lines . The 33rd was ordered into position , and Pinney personally commanded the divisional machine @-@ gun battalion , which — with the assistance of various stragglers from retreating units — helped turn back a heavy German attack at the Battle of Hazebrouck on 12 and 13 April . For his service in April , Pinney , along with the commanders of the 12th , 55th and 61st Divisions , was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath . The 33rd was used to train the American 30th Infantry Division through the summer , but went over to the offensive in September , seeing action at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal , the Battle of Cambrai , and the Battle of the Selle . At the Selle , Pinney organised a dawn attack with improvised bridges , allowing the 33rd to force a bridgehead and successfully clear the opposing bank in a short time . The division finished the war in the Sambre valley , and began demobilisation . In February 1919 , with the division mostly demobilised , Pinney retired from the Army , aged fifty @-@ six , after thirty @-@ five years service . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Following the end of his Army career , Pinney took up residence at <unk> Manor , in the village of <unk> , Dorset , where he lived the life of a retired country gentleman . He became a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county , and served as its High Sheriff in 1923 . He did not return to an active Army post , though he held the ceremonial colonelcy of the Royal Fusiliers from 1924 to 1933 , as well as the honorary colonelcy of the Dorset Coastal Brigade , Royal Artillery , and the 4th ( Territorial ) Battalion of the Dorsetshire Regiment . 
 Pinney died on 18 February 1943 , survived by his wife and five of his children . All three of his sons served in the Second World War ; his eldest son , Bernard , was killed in action in November 1941 , commanding J Battery Royal Horse Artillery at Sidi Rezegh in North Africa . His daughter Rachel was part of the notorious " Ferguson 's Gang " who hit the headlines in the interwar years with masked appearances with bags of money to save properties for the National Trust . A scholarship fund , to provide access to higher education for the children of Dorset ex @-@ servicemen , was established in Pinney 's name in June 1943 , and remains in existence . 
 = Al @-@ Mundhir III ibn al @-@ Harith = 
 Al @-@ Mundhir ibn al @-@ <unk> ( <unk> بن الحارث ) , known in Greek sources as ( <unk> ) <unk> ( Φλάβιος <unk> ) , was the king of the Ghassanid Arabs from 569 to circa 581 . A son of Al @-@ Harith ibn Jabalah , he succeeded his father both in the kingship over his tribe and as the chief of the Byzantine Empire 's Arab clients and allies in the East , with the rank of patricius . Despite his victories over the rival Persian @-@ backed Lakhmids , throughout Mundhir 's reign his relations with Byzantium were lukewarm due to his staunch Monophysitism . This led to a complete breakdown of the alliance in 572 , after Mundhir discovered Byzantine plans to assassinate him . Relations were restored in 575 and Mundhir secured from the Byzantine emperor both recognition of his royal status and a pledge of tolerance towards the Monophysite Church . 
 In 580 or 581 , Mundhir participated in an unsuccessful campaign against the Persian capital , Ctesiphon , alongside the Byzantine general ( and future emperor ) Maurice . The failure of the campaign led to a quarrel between the two and Maurice accused Mundhir of treason . Byzantine agents captured Mundhir , who was brought to Constantinople but never faced trial . His arrest provoked an uprising among the Ghassanids under Mundhir 's son al @-@ Nu 'man VI . When Maurice ascended the throne in 582 , Mundhir was exiled to Sicily although , according to one source , he was allowed to return to his homeland after Maurice 's overthrow in 602 . 
 Mundhir was the last important Ghassanid ruler ; in 584 , the Byzantines would break up the Ghassanid federation . A capable and successful military leader , his rule also saw the strengthening of Monophysitism and a cultural flowering among the Arabs under his rule . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Succession and early career = = = 
 Mundhir was the son of al @-@ Harith ibn Jabalah , ruler of the Ghassanid tribe and supreme phylarch of the Arab foederati in the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire . Situated on the southern flank of the frontier , the Ghassanids faced the Lakhmids , another powerful Arab tribe who were in turn the chief client of Byzantium 's main antagonist , the Sassanid Persian Empire . Harith had been raised to the kingship and to the position of supreme phylarch by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) , who wished thereby to create a strong counterpart to the Lakhmid rulers . Mundhir had been confirmed as his father 's heir as early as 563 , during the latter 's visit to Constantinople , and succeeded after Harith 's death in 569 . It appears that Mundhir inherited his father 's Byzantine titles one at a time , as they were not hereditary : the rank of patricius , the honorific appellation <unk> ( most honorable ) and the prestigious honorific <unk> " Flavius " , borne by the Byzantine emperors and consuls . 
 Soon after Harith 's death , Ghassanid territory was attacked by Qabus ibn al @-@ Mundhir , the new Lakhmid ruler , who sought to take advantage of the situation . Qabus 's forces were repulsed and Mundhir invaded Lakhmid territory in turn , seizing much plunder . As he turned back , the Lakhmids again confronted the Ghassanid army , but suffered a heavy defeat . After this success , Mundhir wrote to the Byzantine emperor Justin II ( r . 565 – 578 ) asking for gold for his men . This request reportedly angered Justin , who sent instructions to his local commander to lure the Ghassanid ruler into a trap and have him killed . But the letter fell into Mundhir 's hands , who then severed his relations with the Empire and refused to commit his forces during the war with Persia that began in 572 . 
 = = = Return to Byzantine allegiance = = = 
 As the Byzantines relied upon the Ghassanids to cover the approaches to Syria , Mundhir 's withdrawal left a gap in the Byzantine southern flank , which persisted for three years until 575 when Mundhir returned to the Byzantine allegiance through the mediation of the general Justinian , who met Mundhir at Sergiopolis . Immediately after this reconciliation , Mundhir assembled an army in secret and launched an attack against Hirah , the Lakhmid capital , arguably the Arab world 's largest , richest , and most culturally vibrant city at the time . The city was sacked , plundered , and put to the torch , except for the churches . According to John of Ephesus , Mundhir donated much of his booty from this expedition to monasteries and the poor . The same year , Mundhir visited Constantinople , where he was awarded a crown or diadem ( stemma ) , marking the formal renewal of his role as Byzantium 's chief Arab client @-@ king . 
 The war with Persia was interrupted by a three @-@ year truce agreed in 575 . In 578 , hostilities were renewed , but the sources on the period , fragmentary as they are , do not mention any Ghassanid participation for the first two years . In 580 , Mundhir was invited by Emperor Tiberius II ( r . 578 – 582 ) to visit the capital again . He arrived in the city on 8 February , accompanied by two of his sons , and was lavishly received . On this occasion , among a multitude of other gifts , he was also presented with a royal crown , instead of the simpler coronet or diadem he had been awarded before . 
 While at Constantinople , Mundhir received permission from the emperor to hold a Monophysite church council , which convened on 2 March 580 . This council managed , albeit for a brief time , to reconcile the various factions and sects of the Monophysites . It was a goal towards which Mundhir had long striven , as when he intervened in the quarrel between Jacob <unk> and Paul the Black , the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch . Before leaving the imperial capital , the Ghassanid ruler also secured a pledge from the emperor that the persecutions of the Monophysites would cease . When he returned home , Mundhir discovered that the Lakhmids and Persians had used his absence to raid his domains . Gathering his forces , he fell upon their army , defeated them , and returned home laden with booty . 
 In the summer of 580 or 581 , Mundhir went to Circesium on the river Euphrates , where he joined the Byzantine forces under the new magister militum per Orientem , Maurice , for a campaign deep into Persian territory . The combined force moved south along the river , accompanied by a fleet of ships . The allied army stormed the fortress of <unk> and moved on until it reached the region of Beth <unk> in central Mesopotamia , near the Persian capital of Ctesiphon , but there they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Persians . With any possibility of a march to Ctesiphon gone , they were forced to retreat , especially since at the same time the Persian commander Adarmahan had taken advantage of the Byzantine army 's absence and was raiding freely in Osroene , where he sacked the provincial capital Edessa . The retreat was arduous for the exhausted army , and Maurice and Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition 's failure . Mundhir and Maurice cooperated however in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw , and defeated him at Callinicum . Upon returning to his lands , Mundhir learned that a combined Persian @-@ Lakhmid force was preparing another attack against the Ghassanid realm . Immediately he set out to meet them , engaged their army and comprehensively defeated it , before going on to capture the enemy camp . It was to be his last victory . 
 = = = Arrest and exile = = = 
 Despite his successes , Mundhir was accused by Maurice of treason during the preceding campaign . Maurice claimed that Mundhir had revealed the Byzantine plan to the Persians , who then proceeded to destroy the bridge over the Euphrates . The chronicler John of Ephesus explicitly calls this assertion a lie , as the Byzantine intentions must have been plain to the Persian commanders . Both Maurice and Mundhir wrote letters to Emperor Tiberius , who tried to reconcile them . Finally , Maurice himself visited Constantinople , where he was able to persuade Tiberius of Mundhir 's guilt . The charge of treason is almost universally dismissed by modern historians ; Irfan Shahîd says that it probably had more to do with Maurice 's dislike of the veteran and militarily successful Arab ruler . This was further compounded by the Byzantines ' habitual distrust of the " barbarian " and supposedly innately traitorous Arabs , as well as by Mundhir 's staunchly Monophysite faith . 
 Tiberius ordered Mundhir 's arrest , and a trap was laid for the Ghassanid king : summoned to Constantinople to answer charges of treason , Mundhir chose his friend , the curator Magnus , as his advocate . Magnus was probably a Byzantine , hailing from <unk> ( <unk> ) . There he had built a church , and he now called on Mundhir to join him and the patriarch of Antioch Gregory in the dedication ceremony . Mundhir arrived with only a small escort and was arrested by Byzantine troops stationed in secret at the location . He was transported to Constantinople , joined along the way by his wife and three of his children . At the capital , he was treated well by Tiberius , who allowed him a comfortable residence and a subsidy , but denied him an audience . Irfan Shahîd believes that this generous treatment , as well as the fact that he was not brought to trial for his supposed treason , indicate that Tiberius too did not believe the charges , but ordered the arrest chiefly to placate the strong anti @-@ Monophysite faction in the imperial capital . 
 In the meantime , Mundhir 's arrest provoked a revolt led by his four sons , especially the eldest , Nu 'man , a man described by John of Ephesus as even more capable and warlike than his father . For two years , the Ghassanid army launched raids into the Byzantine provinces from their bases in the desert , even defeating and killing the Byzantine dux of Arabia in a battle at Bostra . Tiberius reacted by raising a Chalcedonian brother of Mundhir to the Ghassanid kingship . A large army with Magnus at its head was dispatched east to counter Nu 'man and install his uncle as king . The latter was swiftly done , but the new king died after only twenty days . Magnus also had some success in subduing or subverting the allegiance of some minor Arab tribes away from the Ghassanids . Magnus died shortly before Tiberius 's own death in August 582 , and with Maurice 's accession to the throne , Nu 'man journeyed to Constantinople to achieve a reconciliation with Byzantium . Instead , he too was arrested , tried , and sentenced to death , quickly commuted to house arrest . 
 Mundhir remained in Constantinople until the death of Tiberius and the accession of Maurice , when he was exiled to Sicily . It is likely that he is the man Pope Gregory the Great mentioned as " <unk> " in 600 , indicating that he was still alive at the time . A 13th @-@ century Syriac chronicle further records that after Maurice 's overthrow and murder in 602 , Mundhir was allowed to return home . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Mundhir in many ways continued in the footsteps of his father . He was a militarily successful ally of the Byzantines , especially against his fellow Arabs , the Lakhmid tribesmen , and secured Byzantium 's southern flank and its political and commercial interests in Arabia proper . Despite his fervent dedication to Monophysitism , he remained loyal to Byzantium as the Christian state par excellence ; as Irfan Shahîd comments , Mundhir 's self @-@ image may well have been that of a " sixth @-@ century <unk> fighting for the Christian Roman Empire , as his third @-@ century predecessor had done for the pagan empire " . Yet , in the end , his independent character and his role as the protector of the Monophysite Church led to his downfall and exile . In the overwhelmingly pro @-@ Chalcedonian atmosphere of Tiberius 's and Maurice 's reigns , unlike his father Harith , who was protected by Empress Theodora 's Monophysite leanings , Mundhir could not count on any influential support in Constantinople . Mundhir 's arrest was followed after 584 by the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation into a number of smaller chiefdoms . This was a momentous event in the history of Byzantine @-@ Arab relations : it destroyed Byzantium 's " protective shield " against incursions from the Arabian desert , an error for which the Byzantines would pay dearly with the onset of the Muslim conquests . It was paralleled a few years later by the destruction of the Lakhmid kingdom at the hands of the Persians , opening a power vacuum in northern Arabia which the nascent Muslim state would later fill . On the other hand , the Muslim conquests , and before them the destructive thirty @-@ year war with Persia , were still a long way off in 584 , and the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation may be seen simply , according to the historian Michael Whitby , as the elimination of an " over @-@ successful quasi @-@ client neighbour " , who threatened to become " too powerful for the good of its supposed patron " . 
 The Ghassanids left an important cultural legacy as well . Their patronage of the Monophysite Syrian Church was crucial for its survival and revival , and even its spread , through missionary activities , south into Arabia . According to the historian Warwick Ball , the Ghassanids ' promotion of a simpler and more rigidly monotheistic form of Christianity in a specifically Arab context can be said to have anticipated Islam . Ghassanid rule also brought a period of considerable prosperity for the Arabs on the eastern fringes of Syria , as evidenced by a spread of urbanization and the sponsorship of several churches , monasteries and other buildings . The surviving descriptions of the Ghassanid courts impart an image of luxury and an active cultural life , with patronage of the arts , music and especially Arab @-@ language poetry . In the words of Ball , " the Ghassanid courts were the most important centres for Arabic poetry before the rise of the Caliphal courts under Islam " , and their court culture , including their penchant for desert palaces like Qasr ibn Wardan , provided the model for the Umayyad caliphs and their court . Among the architectural remains from Mundhir 's own reign are the castle of Dumayr and the so @-@ called ecclesia extra <unk> ( nowadays identified as Mundhir 's own audience hall or praetorium ) in Sergiopolis , where an inscription in Greek , celebrating Mundhir , survives . Sergiopolis ( modern <unk> ) was a site of particular significance due to the popularity of the cult of Saint Sergius among the Arabs , and was also a focus of later Umayyad building activity . 
 = The Calculus Affair = 
 The Calculus Affair ( French : L 'Affaire Tournesol ) is the eighteenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The story was initially serialised weekly in Belgium 's Tintin magazine from December 1954 to February 1956 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1956 . The narrative follows the attempts of the young reporter Tintin , his dog Snowy , and his friend Captain Haddock to rescue Professor Calculus , a scientist who has developed a machine capable of destroying objects with sound waves , after the latter is the subject of kidnapping attempts from the competing European countries of Borduria and Syldavia . 
 Following on from the previous volume , Explorers on the Moon , The Calculus Affair was created with the aid of the Hergé 's team of artists at Studios Hergé . The story reflected the Cold War tensions that Europe was experiencing during the 1950s , and introduced three recurring characters into the series : Jolyon Wagg , Cutts the Butcher , and Colonel Sponz . Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Red Sea Sharks , and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . The Calculus Affair was critically well @-@ received , with various commentators having described it as one of the best Tintin adventures . The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana .

Tintin and Haddock use the opportunity to investigate Calculus ' laboratory , there discovering that his experiments were responsible for the glass @-@ shattering of the previous night . While exploring , they are attacked by a stranger , who then escapes ; fearing that Calculus is in danger , Tintin , Haddock , and Snowy head for Geneva . In Geneva , they learn that Calculus has gone to Nyon to meet Professor Topolino , an expert in ultrasonics . The group travel there in a taxi , but their car is attacked by two men in another car , who force the taxi into Lake Geneva . Surviving the attack , Tintin , Haddock and Snowy continue to Nyon , where they find Topolino bound and gagged in his cellar . As Tintin questions the professor , the house blows up , but they all survive . 
 Tintin and Haddock meet the detectives Thomson and Thompson , who reveal that the wounded man at Marlinspike was Syldavian . Tintin surmises that Calculus had invented an ultrasonic device capable of being used as a weapon of mass destruction , which both Syldavian and Bordurian intelligence agents are now seeking to obtain . Discovering that Bordurian spies have kidnapped Calculus and are holding him hostage in their Rolle embassy , Tintin and Haddock seek to rescue him , but during the attempt he is captured by Syldavian agents , who are able to escape by plane to their home country . The next morning , Tintin and Haddock learn that Bordurian fighters shot down the Syldavian plane and captured Calculus , who is now being held in Borduria . They travel to Borduria 's capital , <unk> , intent on rescuing him . 
 In the city , they are escorted to their hotel by agents of the Bordurian secret police , who have been ordered to monitor the duo by police chief Colonel Sponz . Aware that they are being monitored , Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house , where Bianca Castafiore is performing . When police come searching for them , they hide in Castafiore 's closet ; after Sponz comes to visit Castafiore in her dressing room , Tintin is able to steal papers that will secure Calculus ' release from the fortress of <unk> from his coat pocket . After disguising themselves as officials from the Red Cross , Tintin and Haddock are able to get Calculus released from prison and with him escape from Borduria aboard a tank . Back at Marlinspike Hall , Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva , and that he had left it at home all along ; he destroys the plans so that they could not be used to create a weapon .

 The Calculus Affair was produced at the height of the Cold War and reflected the conflict 's tensions , also being published at a time in which espionage thrillers were proving popular in France and Belgium . The Calculus Affair marked a return to the single volume format which was to persist for the rest of The Adventures of Tintin . The volume started its publication in Tintin magazine on December 1954 . Before working on the book , Hergé would draft his techniques in pencil ; after confirming his sketches , he would work over the drawings and text in ink . With the development of his own Studios Hergé , he selected the best sketch from a number of versions and traced it onto the page he was creating . 
 The Calculus Affair introduces three recurring characters into the series . The first is Jolyon Wagg , a Belgian insurance salesman who annoys Haddock when he invited himself to Marlinspike . According to Michael Farr , Wagg , was " the proverbial bore " . For the name of Jolyon Wagg ( <unk> <unk> in the original French version ) , Hergé initially chose Crampon , which was derived from the French expression " Quel Crampon ! " ( English : " What a leech ! " ) . Hergé , however , ultimately rejected Crampon as he found it too explicit and harsh @-@ sounding , settling on <unk> as an alternative . Hergé named Wagg 's insurance company Assurances <unk> , although for the English translation it became the Rock Bottom Insurance company . 
 The second new character to be introduced to the story was Cutts the butcher ; Hergé named the character <unk> , a pun on the French word sans @-@ os ( " without bones " ) , which referenced his profession . Another addition to The Calculus Affair was the Bordurian head of secret police Colonel Sponsz , whose name is derived from the Brussels dialect term for a sponge ( <unk> in French ) . Hergé used his brother , Paul Remi , as the model for Sponsz , although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 A key influence on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à main . In this article , it was reported that there had been a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists had reported their car windscreen spontaneously shattering ; the article 's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility . To develop this plot further , Hergé consulted Professor Armand <unk> , an astrophysicist at Liège . 
 Hergé 's depiction of Switzerland avoided repeating national clichés , instead seeking a high level of realism . Hergé requested that Jean Dupont , the editor of L 'Écho illustré – the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland – send him documentation on Swiss railways which he could draw from . He also requested that his Swiss friend Charly <unk> send him a bottle of Valais wine which he could again use as a model from which to draw . Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva which he could then incorporate into the story ; these included at Geneva <unk> International Airport , Genève @-@ <unk> railway station , and the <unk> Hotel , as well as the road through <unk> and Topolino 's house in Nyon . Despite this realism , a number of minor errors were made in Hergé 's depiction of Geneva . 
 Hergé 's depiction of Borduria was based on Eastern Bloc countries . Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB . Hergé named the political leader of Borduria <unk> @-@ <unk> , a pun on plexiglas , although the English translators renamed him <unk> @-@ Tasch ( " curvy <unk> " ) , a reference to the fact that the leader 's curved moustache , inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin , was a prominent symbol in Borduria . As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé 's depiction of an Eastern Bloc city , Farr highlighted that Borduria 's <unk> @-@ Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin 's Platz der Republik , which would only be completed in the 1970s . All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises . 
 The idea of a sonic weapon was one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German scientists under the control of Albert Speer during World War II . A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino 's house , German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon – a retired Major General in the US Army – really existed and was published in 1947 . In the strip , Hergé preserved the English language title of the book rather than translating it into French , although altered the book 's cover design to remove a prominent swastika . The inclusion of the book is one of the few instances that there is any reference to the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin . 
 Hergé 's decision to name a character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney , whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian . Hergé included a reference to his friend and colleague , the former opera singer Edgar P. Jacobs , in the story , adding a figure named <unk> to the billing on the opera performance alongside Castafiore . He also inserted a cameo of himself as a reporter into the final scene of the story . 
 = = = Publication = = = 
 The Calculus Affair began serialisation in Tintin magazine 's Christmas edition on 22 December 1954 , and continued to appear in the pages of that publication until 22 February 1956 . It would be the first of The Adventures of Tintin to be serialised without interruption since Red Rackham 's Treasure ( 1944 ) . It began serialisation in the French edition of Tintin in February 1955 . It was subsequently published in collected book form as L 'Affaire Tournesol by Casterman in 1956 . For this volume Hergé had designed a front cover ; initially , it simply showed Tintin and Haddock hiding Calculus from Bordurian soldiers , but he subsequently added shattered yellow glass around the edges of the image for dramatic effect . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Harry Thompson opined that while the story 's ending was somewhat unsatisfactory and rushed , it remained " probably the best of all the Tintin books " . Biographer Benoît Peeters agreed , describing it as " Hergé 's masterwork " , " a masterpiece of the classic strip cartoon " . Elsewhere , he referred to it as " one of his most brilliant books " , describing Wagg as " the last great figure of The Adventures of Tintin " . Peeters added that the story had " the atmosphere of a spy novel worthy of John Buchan or Eric Ambler " . Similarly , Farr described The Calculus Affair as " one of Hergé 's finest creations " . Biographer Pierre Assouline stated that the " illustrations and the scenario are vibrant and rich ; the story thread holds from beginning to end " . 
 Jean @-@ Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier stated that the introduction of Wagg and Cutts represented " yet another turning point in the series " , praising the characterisation of Wagg as " bitter and successful social satire " . They were critical of Syldavia 's inclusion as an antagonist in the story , stating that the Syldavian attempts to kidnap Calculus " strains believability " because they had appeared as allies of Calculus and Tintin in both the preceding two @-@ volume story arc , Destination Moon ( 1953 ) and Explorers on the Moon ( 1954 ) , and in the earlier King Ottokar 's Sceptre ( 1939 ) . Ultimately , they felt that " the plot seems somewhat shoe @-@ horned into the familiar universe " and " one feels that Hergé 's heart was not really much into the action part of the story " , ultimately awarding it three stars out of five . 
 In his psychoanalytical study of The Adventures of Tintin , the literary critic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès declared that The Calculus Affair marked the beginning of the third and final period of the series , which he believed could be characterised by Hergé 's depiction of a world run by " wheeling and dealing " and in which " detective work takes precedence over any mystical quest " . Apostolidès considered The Calculus Affair to be both Calculus ' " triumph and his defeat " . He felt that while Calculus had become " an impartial figure " in the preceding two @-@ volume story arc , Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon , here he had become " the Bad Mother " through his creation of an ultrasonic weapon and the threat that he poses both to the tranquility of Marlinspike and to world peace . He added that the scene at the end of the story in which Calculus burns the plans to his ultrasonic device represents " a symbolic castration " and allows the character to become " the Oedipal Father with whom the sons [ Tintin and Haddock ] can compete " , thus stabilising " the family hierarchy " of the series . 
 Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that The Calculus Affair aptly illustrated how Tintin was no longer political in the manner that he was in earlier works like Tintin in the Land of the Soviets ( 1930 ) and Tintin in the Congo ( 1931 ) ; instead , Tintin travels to Borduria to rescue Calculus , " not to fight or expose totalitarianism " . Moving on to Calculus , McCarthy stated that in this story he was " a genius compromised " , with his role being a " counter @-@ position to , or flip @-@ side of , the one he represented in the moon books " . He noted that when Tintin and Haddock arrive in Borduria , they are " treated as honoured guests but are in fact prisoners of the police state " , a reversal of the situation in The Blue Lotus in which Tintin believes himself a prisoner but is in fact a guest . He stated that as with The Crab with the Golden Claws ( 1941 ) , The Calculus Affair was " one long tobacco @-@ trail " with cigarettes representing clues throughout the story . Turning his attention to the opera house scene in which Tintin and Haddock spy upon Sponz and Castafiore , he compared it to the scene in David Lynch 's 1986 film Blue Velvet in which Jeffrey Beaumont spies on the sexual activities of Dorothy Vallens and Frank Booth . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 In 1957 , the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based upon Hergé 's original comics , adapting eight of the Adventures into a series of daily five @-@ minute episodes . The Calculus Affair was the eighth such story in the second series , being directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg , himself a well @-@ known cartoonist who in later years would become editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tintin magazine . 
 In 1991 , a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes , each 22 minutes long . The Calculus Affair was the sixteenth and seventeenth episodes of The Adventures of Tintin to be produced . Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi , the series has been praised for being " generally faithful " , with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book . 
 = Hurricane Hernan ( 2008 ) = 
 Hurricane Hernan was the ninth tropical depression , eighth named storm , fifth hurricane , and first major hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season . Hernan developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the east coast of Africa on July 24 . Over the next week , the wave traversed the Atlantic without development and entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2 . The wave became better organized over the next several days and was declared Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E on August 6 . The depression quickly became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day . Hernan steadily intensified over the next two days and was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of August 8 . 
 Hernan continued to intensify and became the first major hurricane — a storm with winds of 111 mph ( 178 km / h ) or higher — of the season on August 9 . After reaching major hurricane status , Hernan steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane . The weakening continued , and Hernan was further downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11 . As Hernan moved over cold waters , the convection associated with the storm dissipated , leaving only a swirl of clouds . By the morning of August 12 , almost all of the convection associated with Hernan had dissipated and the system was declared a remnant low @-@ pressure area . The remnants of the hurricane caused light rain to Hawaii . 
 = = Origins = = 
 On July 24 , a tropical wave emerged from the east coast of Africa , near the Cape Verde Islands . The wave was disorganized and failed to develop convection as it traversed the Atlantic Ocean | over the next several days . The wave eventually entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2 , and interacted with a broad area of cyclonic flow located a few hundred miles south of Mexico . The wave became better organized throughout the day , and an area of low pressure formed 660 mi ( 1060 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico on August 5 . Strong convection began to develop . That day , a banding feature formed On the morning of August 6 , a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued . Later in the day , the National Hurricane Center determined that the system had developed sufficient convection to be declared Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E while located 775 mi ( 1230 km ) to the south @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur . However , the storm was operationally believed to have become a depression several hours later . 
 Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E was influenced by a high pressure area located over Mexico , causing it to move 16 mph ( 26 km / h ) to the north @-@ west . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized . Although Hernan was located over warm waters , moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly , and the storm slowed . Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night , but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning ; as a result , most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane . 
 = = Intensification and peak strength = = 
 In the early afternoon , an eye feature began to form ; subsequently , Hernan was nearing hurricane status . However , by the nighttime hours , a microwave satellite found that the center of Hernan was located to the west @-@ southwest of the eye feature , and the intensification ceased for the rest of the day and into the morning of August 8 . Later in the morning , the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane , the fifth of the season , during the afternoon of August 8 . Throughout the day , the eye became better defined , indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish . Despite a cloud @-@ filled eye , meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a Category 2 hurricane overnight . 
 Early on August 9 , Hernan was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane , with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . Convection around the eye continued become more symmetrical , though the National Hurricane Center had stated that Hernan had most likely reached its peak intensity or was very close to doing so . However , the eye suddenly became better defined . Based on this , Hernan was upgraded to a major hurricane . The intensity of Hernan was uncertain , as there was some difference between intensity estimates . Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . Overnight , Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken . Although the eye remained well defined , outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor . 
 = = Weakening and dissipation = = 
 Hernan rapidly weakened overnight and was barely a Category 2 in the afternoon hours of August 10 as it moved over cooler waters . The erosion of the eyewall was later found to be caused by an eyewall replacement cycle that rapidly completed itself during the afternoon . Continuing to slowly weaken , Hernan was soon downgraded to a strong Category 1 . The newly formed eye began to shrink and deteriorate through the early afternoon , but Hernan briefly stopped weakening . Initially , Hernan 's strong circulation allowed it to maintain hurricane status over 24 ° C waters . 
 Early on August 11 , Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm . Deep convection diminished around the center of the storm and by August 12 , almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken . Over 23 ° C water , only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system . Later that night , Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low , and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center . The remnant low still retained tropical storm @-@ force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning . The low moved towards the west @-@ southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460 mi ( 740 km ) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16 . The remnant low @-@ pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii , causing cloud and shower activity . The associated rainfall was light and insignificant . 
 = Fort Dobbs ( North Carolina ) = 
 Fort Dobbs was an 18th @-@ century fort in the Yadkin – Pee Dee River Basin region of the Province of North Carolina , near what is now Statesville in Iredell County . Used for frontier defense during and after the French and Indian War , the fort was built to protect the British settlers of the western portion of what was then Rowan County , and served as a vital outpost for soldiers , traders , and colonial officials . Fort Dobbs ' primary structure was a blockhouse with log walls , surrounded by a palisade and moat . It was intended to provide protection against Cherokee , Catawba , Shawnee , Delaware and French raids into North Carolina . 
 The fort 's name honored Arthur Dobbs , the colonial Governor of North Carolina from 1754 to 1765 , who played a role in designing the fort and authorized its construction . When in use , it was the only fort on the frontier between South Carolina and Virginia . Between 1756 and 1760 , the blockhouse was garrisoned by a variable number of soldiers , many of whom were sent to fight in Pennsylvania and the Ohio River Valley during the French and Indian War . On February 27 , 1760 , the fort was the site of an engagement between Cherokee warriors and provincial soldiers that ended in a victory for the provincials . After this battle and other attacks by Cherokee warriors on British forts and settlements in the Anglo @-@ Cherokee War , the southern British colonies launched a devastating counterattack against the Cherokee in 1760 . 
 Fort Dobbs was abandoned after 1766 , and disappeared from the landscape . Archaeological work in the 20th century and historical research in 2005 and 2006 led to the discovery of the fort 's exact location and probable appearance . The site on which the fort sat is now operated by North Carolina 's Division of State Historic Sites and Properties as Fort Dobbs State Historic Site , and supporters of the site have developed plans for the fort 's reconstruction .

 = = = Settlement of the Carolina back @-@ country = = = 
 In 1747 , approximately 100 men of suitable age to serve in the colonial militia lived in North Carolina west of present @-@ day Hillsborough . Within three years , most of North Carolina 's population increase , driven mainly by the immigration of Scots @-@ Irish and German settlers traveling from Pennsylvania on the Great Wagon Road , was occurring in seven western counties created after 1740 . By 1754 , six western counties — Orange , Granville , Johnston , Cumberland , Anson , and Rowan — held around 22 @,@ 000 residents out of the colony 's total population of 65 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 In 1755 , Governor Arthur Dobbs ordered the construction of a fortified log structure for the protection of settlers in Rowan County from various Native American threats , including assaults from Cherokee , Catawba , Shawnee , and Delaware raiding parties . Dobbs stated in a letter on August 24 , 1755 , to the Board of Trade that the fort was needed " to assist the back settlers and be a retreat to them as it was beyond the well settled Country , only straggling settlements behind them , and if I had placed [ Waddell 's garrison ] beyond the Settlements without a fortification they might be exposed , and be no retreat for the Settlers , and the Indians might pass them and murder the Inhabitants , and retire before they durst go to give them notice " . The new frontier settlements required regular protection , as the settlers in the area attributed many crimes and forms of harassment to denizens of nearby Catawba and Cherokee towns . Furthermore , Governor Dobbs was concerned for his own investments , as he owned more than 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 81 @,@ 000 ha ; 310 sq mi ) of land on the Rocky River , approximately 15 miles ( 24 km ) south of the Fourth Creek Meeting House . 
 The North Carolina Legislature set aside a sum of £ 10 @,@ 000 for the construction of the fort in 1755 , as well as for the raising of several companies of provincial soldiers to defend the frontier . Provincial soldiers , known by the shortened name " provincials " , were soldiers raised , clothed , and paid by the individual British colonies , although they were at various times armed and supplied by the regular British Army . The total cost of the fort was only £ 1 @,@ 000 . By comparison , Fort Stanwix in New York , begun in 1758 in a then @-@ modern star fort style , cost £ 60 @,@ 000 to erect , while the construction of Fort Prince George in South Carolina cost that province 's House of Commons £ 3 @,@ 000 . 
 Dobbs likely had a role in designing the fort , as he had designed at least one other fort in North Carolina , as well as a number of structures in Ireland . Hugh Waddell , a Scotch @-@ Irish soldier who had close ties to Governor Dobbs and who was the commander of a company of provincial soldiers in 1755 , built the fort 's blockhouse and palisade using labor provided by his soldiers , and named it after the governor . The land on which the fort was to be located was a part of a 560 @-@ acre ( 230 ha ; 0 @.@ 88 sq mi ) tract owned first by one James Oliphant , then by a Fergus Sloan . Part of the same tract was used for the Fourth Creek Congregation Meeting House ( so named because the settlement was on the fourth creek one would pass traveling west on the South Yadkin River from Salisbury ) in 1755 , which was the principal structure around which the modern city of Statesville was founded . After construction was completed , Fort Dobbs was the only military installation on the colonial frontier between Virginia and South Carolina . 
 = = = Description and effectiveness = = = 
 By June 1756 , Waddell had substantially completed construction on the fort . Francis Brown and future governor Richard Caswell , commissioners appointed by Dobbs to inspect frontier defenses , wrote the following report to the North Carolina General Assembly on December 21 , 1756 : 
 [ Brown and Caswell ] had likewise viewed the State of Fort Dobbs and found it to be a good and Substantial Building of the <unk> [ sic ] following ( that is to say ) The Oblong Square fifty three feet by forty , the opposite Angles Twenty four feet and Twenty @-@ Two In height Twenty four and a half feet as by the Plan annexed Appears , The Thickness of the Walls which are made of Oak Logs regularly Diminished from sixteen Inches to Six , it contains three floors and there may be discharged from each floor at one and the same time about one hundred <unk> [ sic ] the same is beautifully <unk> [ sic ] in the fork of Fourth Creek a Branch of the Yadkin River . And that they also found under Command of Capt Hugh <unk> Forty six Effective men Officers and Soldiers as by the List to the said Report Annexed Appears the same being sworn to by the said Capt in their Presence the said Officers and Soldiers Appearing well and in good Spirits . 
 The commissioners generally found the defenses of the rest of the North Carolina frontier to be inadequate . In 1756 , the North Carolina General Assembly petitioned King George II for assistance , stating that the frontier remained in a relatively defenseless state . The address to the king further noted that after the fall of Fort Oswego to the French and their native allies in that year , the legislators did not believe that Fort Dobbs would provide a substantial defensive advantage . Settlers west of the Yadkin River were subjected to regular attacks so that between 1756 and 1759 , even after the construction of Fort Dobbs , the population of settlers in the area declined from approximately 1 @,@ 500 to 800 . Catawba raiding parties even struck as far as the largest western settlement , Salisbury , breaking into a session of court held by Peter Henley , Royal Chief Justice of the Province of North Carolina . 
 In 1759 , Waddell ordered six swivel guns for use by North Carolina 's military . Oral tradition in Iredell County holds that two such swivel guns were mounted at Fort Dobbs , but evidence of the exact quantity present at the fort has not been conclusively established . 
 = = Use and conflict = = 
 = = = Early uses = = = 
 Between 1756 and 1760 , Fort Dobbs was used as a base of operations for Waddell 's company of provincials . Dobbs also employed Waddell and the fort to conduct diplomacy with the province 's native neighbors . The governor gave specific instructions on July 18 , 1756 , in a letter sent from New Bern to Waddell , who had just finished supervising the construction of the fort , and two other men , stating : 
 I have given Orders to make you or any two of You a Commission as often as Necessary to go and make complaints to the Chief <unk> of the Cherokee and <unk> Nations when any Murders Robberies or <unk> are made by any of their People upon the English and to know whether it is done by their Orders or Allowance and if not to give up the Delinquents if Known or then when not Known that they should give Strict Orders to their <unk> [ sic ] and warriors not to rob Kill or abuse the English Planters their <unk> and Destroy their Horses cows Swine or Corn and if they should afterwards do it that the English their <unk> would be Obliged to <unk> force with force and in Case they dont own to what Nation they belong that they will be treated as other Indian Nations in alliance with our Enemies the French who are now <unk> them up to make war against us . 
 In addition to warning nearby natives against attacking settlers in the Carolinas , Dobbs also charged Waddell with attempting to keep peace with the Catawba . In one instance , Dobbs instructed Waddell to turn over a settler who had killed a Catawba hunter in order to placate the hunter 's tribesmen , in the event assurances that the settler would be brought to justice under the province 's laws did not persuade the Catawba to remain friendly with North Carolina . 
 In 1756 , Dobbs also approved the construction of another fort , this time in lands claimed by the Catawba , as well as both Carolinas , near modern @-@ day Fort Mill , South Carolina . Workmen under Waddell 's command began construction in 1756 , but in 1757 , Catawba leaders , influenced by South Carolina Governor William Lyttelton , informed North Carolina 's government that they no longer wished for this second fort to be built , and construction of the second fort was permanently halted . 
 At the commencement of the French and Indian War , settlers in the nearby Fourth Creek Congregation settlement sought protection by remaining in close proximity to the fort . During the early stages of that war , and well into 1759 , the fort housed only two soldiers ; the remaining members of the frontier company had returned to their homes or , like Waddell , had gone to fight in Pennsylvania . In Waddell 's absence , the fort was under the command of Captain Andrew Bailey . 
 = = = Decline and fall of Anglo @-@ Cherokee relations = = = 
 During the Anglo @-@ Cherokee War , which occurred during the later years of the French and Indian War , the fort served as the base for a company of North Carolina provincials tasked with repelling Cherokee raids in the western portion of the province when hostilities broke out between that tribe and the British provinces in 1758 . The Anglo @-@ Cherokee War began in 1758 after the capture of Fort Duquesne by the British and their native allies , including the Cherokee . After that fort was taken , the focus of combat in the French and Indian War moved northward , further away from the Cherokee homelands , and a number of Cherokee warriors felt that their contributions to the war effort were unappreciated . Several colonies , including Virginia and South Carolina , promised the Cherokee that they would build forts near their lands to protect them from hostile attack in exchange for warriors that had been supplied for the war effort . In Virginia 's case , such promises were never fulfilled , and in South Carolina , the promised military presence eventually caused more concern in the Cherokee leadership than it alleviated . Long @-@ term trends in English settlement , which encroached past the border between the Cherokee and South Carolina that had been set by treaty at Long Cane Creek ( west of modern @-@ day Greenwood , South Carolina ) , elevated Cherokee concern that vital hunting grounds would be permanently lost . 
 Several pro @-@ French and pro @-@ Creek leaders among the Cherokee pushed for violent actions against British settlers , despite the opposition of pro @-@ British Cherokee leaders . Eventually tensions between the Cherokee and the colonists reached a head when Cherokee warriors were attacked by settlers in Virginia , including an unknown number who were ambushed by frontier militia groups who alleged that the Cherokee had slaughtered cattle and stolen horses that belonged to Virginian settlers . The Virginians attempted to sell the massacred Cherokee warriors ' scalps to the government of Virginia as the scalps of Shawnee warriors ( for which the British had set a bounty ) , an act that insulted the Cherokee . After this and similar occurrences , younger , pro @-@ French leaders among the Cherokee instigated attacks against settlers throughout the frontier . The colonial military of the South Carolina , which considered the Cherokee towns to be within its sphere of influence , responded by assaulting Cherokees , taking more scalps from the Cherokee and selling them to British authorities , and the colonial government refused to engage in negotiations with even the most sympathetic Cherokee leaders . 
 = = = War comes to Fourth Creek = = = 
 Throughout 1759 and 1760 , small Cherokee bands attacked homesteads and communities on the frontier , oftentimes taking scalps from the British settlers . In raids on April 25 and 26 , 1759 , several parties of Cherokee led by Moytoy of Citico struck at settlements on the Yadkin and Catawba Rivers against the wishes of Cherokee leaders such as Attakullakulla , killing around 19 men , women and children , and taking more than 10 scalps from those killed , including eight scalps from settlers living on Fourth Creek . This violence damaged peace talks between Attakullakulla and South Carolina governor William Lyttelton , who considered the territory west of the Yadkin River in North Carolina to be within South Carolina 's sphere of influence . The violence committed by the Cherokee against British settlers continued , which in turn caused the colonial authorities to seek better relations with the Creek and Catawba nations . The Catawba , who were allied to the provinces of North and South Carolina , were only able to provide minimal assistance to the English in the defense of their frontiers , as that tribe 's settlements had been decimated by smallpox in 1759 and early 1760 . During this period of violence , members of Daniel Boone 's family , who had settled in the area , took refuge in the fort , although Boone himself went to Culpeper County , Virginia with his wife and children . Several scholars have speculated that Boone himself served under Waddell as a member of the frontier provincial company . 
 All remaining goodwill was lost between Lyttelton 's government in Charleston , the North Carolina government , and the pro @-@ peace Cherokee when Lyttelton ordered the detention of several peace delegations led by headmen Oconostota , <unk> , and " Round O " , despite having previously guaranteed them safe passage . Lyttelton had the delegations put under armed guard , and secured them at Fort Prince George . A peace arrangement was agreed upon in December , 1759 , although the Cherokee agreed under duress , and the pro @-@ war faction of the Cherokee did not obey its terms . Several of the signatories for the Cherokee intended to disavow their promises as soon as they were able , in order to seek retribution for the capture of their peace delegations . 
 Full @-@ blown war broke out across the Carolina frontier by January , 1760 . Between January and February , 1760 , more than 77 settlers on the Carolina frontier were killed by Cherokee war parties , and the British settlement boundaries had been effectively pushed back by more than 100 miles . Many of the Cherokee captives held at Fort Prince George were massacred in mid @-@ February , 1760 after an attempt was made to rescue them , in which Ensign Richard <unk> , the commanding officer of that fort who was much maligned by the Cherokee , was killed . Lyttelton , who was soon appointed Governor of Jamaica , requested assistance from Dobbs , but North Carolina 's militia could not be convinced to serve outside of its home province due to long @-@ standing custom . 
 = = = Battle = = = 
 Waddell and his provincials returned to Fort Dobbs after the fall of Fort Duquesne . The fort 's sole engagement occurred when a band of Cherokee warriors attacked on the night of February 27 , 1760 . During that battle , approximately 10 to 13 warriors died , and one or two provincial soldiers were wounded , while one young boy was killed . Future American Revolutionary War officer and North Carolina politician Griffith Rutherford , at the time a Captain , may have fought as during the battle under Waddell 's command . The Cherokee made off with several horses belonging to Waddell 's company , but were ultimately repulsed . Waddell described the action in an official report to the Governor on February 29 , 1760 : 
 For several days I observed that a small party of Indians were constantly about the fort , I sent out several small parties after them to no purpose , the evening before last between 8 and 9 o 'clock I found by the dogs making an uncommon noise there must be a party nigh a spring which we sometimes use . As my garrison is but small , and I was apprehensive it might be a scheme to draw out the garrison , I took out Captain Bailie who with myself and party made up ten ; we had not marched 300 yards from the fort when we were attacked by at least 60 or 70 Indians . I had given my party orders not to fire until I gave the word , which they punctually observed : we received the Indians [ sic ] fire : when I perceived they had almost all fired , I ordered my party to fire which we did not further than 12 steps each loaded with a bullet and seven buck shot , they had nothing to cover them as they were advancing either to tomahawk or make us prisoners : they found the fire very hot from so small a number which a good deal confused them ; I then ordered my party to retreat , as I found the instant our skirmish began another party had attacked the fort , upon our reinforcing the garrison the Indians were soon repulsed with I am sure a considerable loss , from what I myself saw as well as those I can confide in they could not have had less than 10 or 12 killed or wounded , and I believe they have taken six of my horses to carry off their wounded ... On my side I had 2 men wounded one of whom I am afraid will die as he is scalped , the other is in a way of recovery and one boy killed near the fort whom they durst not advance to scalp . I expected they would have paid me another visit last night , as they attack all fortifications by night , but they did not like their reception . 
 At around the same time as this attack occurred , Cherokee war parties attacked Fort Loudoun , Fort Prince George , and Ninety @-@ Six , South Carolina . After this wave , Cherokee war parties continued to threaten <unk> in the Wachovia Tract , Salisbury , and other settlements in the Yadkin , Catawba , and Broad river basins . The engagement at Fort Dobbs and settlements in the North Carolina Piedmont led the government of North Carolina to join South Carolina and Virginia in their campaign against the Cherokee in their own settlements in North and South Carolina , known as the " Middle " and " Lower Towns " . Initially , though , Governor Dobbs notified Governor Lyttelton of South Carolina that the North Carolina militia would be unable to assist because it could not be compelled to leave the province . The following year , in 1761 , various delays hampered the movement of North Carolina troops . In the meantime , approximately 15 Cherokee towns of between 350 and 600 inhabitants were destroyed . The campaign against the Cherokees displaced approximately 5 @,@ 000 tribe members , and permanently pushed that tribe 's zone of control west , across the Appalachian Mountains .

 At the conclusion of the conflict between the French and the British , and after hostilities between the provincials and Cherokee ended with the rolling back of Cherokee boundaries in western North Carolina , the fort quickly became obsolete . On March 7 , 1764 , the North Carolina General Assembly 's Committee on Public Claims recommended to Governor Dobbs that stores and supplies be removed from the fort to spare the government further expense in upkeep . By 1766 , the fort was formally abandoned . 
 = = Site preservation and archaeology = = 
 Archaeological exploration of the site first occurred in 1847 , when a group of local residents attempted to locate a rumored original cannon on the site . Evidence of this dig was discovered in the 21st century in a later archaeological study . In 1909 , local residents established the Fort Dobbs Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution . That same year , the owners of the parcel of land on which the Fort Dobbs site was located donated 1 @,@ 000 square feet ( 93 m2 ) containing the fort 's remains to the Fort Dobbs Chapter . By 1910 , the Chapter erected a stone marker at the site , and in 1915 , it purchased the 10 acres of land surrounding the original donated parcel . In 1969 , the North Carolina General Assembly appropriated $ 15 @,@ 000 to purchase the property , to be matched by funds raised locally by the Iredell County Historical Society ; these purchases were made in 1971 and 1973 . By 1976 , the land was opened as a historic site . 
 By 2006 , archaeologists and historical researchers had determined the exact location of Fort Dobbs , and had located the post @-@ hole foundations of the former log structure . Excavation began in 1967 , and by 1968 , the site of the fort was confirmed . In 1967 , Stanley South , an archaeologist and proponent of processual archaeology , discovered that by overlaying a transparency depicting a survey of the Fort Dobbs site done in the mid @-@ 18th @-@ century on a modern aerial photograph , evidence of the surveyed lines could still be discerned in the modern terrain . Additionally , excavations revealed a moat that surrounded the <unk> , as well as trash in the moat contemporary with the fort . Early archaeological work concentrated specifically on the moat and a depression called the " cellar " , which South believed served as a storage space in the middle of the fort grounds , and which later researchers believe was directly underneath the blockhouse . Archaeological work has unearthed evidence of a palisade surrounding the blockhouse , in a similar fashion to other French and Indian War @-@ era forts such as Fort Shirley near Heath , Massachusetts , and Fort Prince George . 
 In 2006 , a researcher affiliated with East Carolina University , Lawrence Babits , presented a study and a reconstruction plan that has been accepted by the Friends of Fort Dobbs , the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization that supports the site , and the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources . In his plan , Babits postulated that Dobbs most likely played a role in designing the fort , basing the design on forts with which Dobbs had first @-@ hand experience as an administrator in Scotland , such as Bernera Barracks near Glenelg and Ruthven Barracks near Kingussie . From these comparisons , the contemporary description of the fort , and the soil record , Babits concluded that the " opposite angles " described by Francis Brown in 1756 actually referred to " flankers " , or square wooden structures attached to the corner of the fort that would have allowed defending soldiers to shoot into the flank of any attacking forces surrounding the building . 
 = = Historic site = = 
 The State of North Carolina maintains and operates the area as Fort Dobbs State Historic Site . The visitor center , located in a log cabin constructed from parts of local , 19th @-@ century log structures , features displays about both the colonial fort and the French and Indian War period . Outdoor trails lead visitors through the excavated ruins of the fort . Events , including many living history demonstrations , are held throughout the year at the fort . The Fort Dobbs site remains the only historic site in the state related to the French and Indian War . 
 Yearly attendance at the site is about 27 @,@ 000 people . As of 2013 , a campaign to renovate the site and restore much of Fort Dobbs is underway with the goal of raising $ 2 @.@ 6 million for the project . A grant of $ 150 @,@ 000 was given by the Institute of Museum and Library Services for the design of the project . In 2010 , the Friends of Fort Dobbs pledged $ 500 @,@ 000 to the North Carolina Historic Sites program for the reconstruction of the fort . On January 5 , 2013 , Governor Bev Perdue signed a lease on behalf of the State to the Friends organization , allowing the nonprofit group to hire a private contractor for the fort 's reconstruction . 
 = Documentaly = 
 Documentaly ( stylized as <unk> , Japanese pronunciation : [ <unk> : ] ) is the fifth studio album by Japanese band Sakanaction , released on September 28 , 2011 . Written around a documentary theme , the band were inspired by personal and world events in 2011 to create material for the album . 
 The band decided to release three singles prior to the album , as a way to alleviate the pressure that the band felt to release new music after the success of their previous album Kikuuiki ( 2010 ) , and as a way to show the album 's development process . The first single " Identity " , a song originally written during that album 's recording sessions , was released three months after Kikuuiki . The band intended to release " Endless " as the album 's second single , however as they were not fully satisfied with the song , released " Rookie " in its place in March 2011 . Just prior to the single 's physical release , Japan experienced the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11 , 2011 , which made Yamaguchi re @-@ evaluate the reasons why the band made music . Originally , the album 's documentary concept focused on themselves as a band , but the disaster prompted Yamaguchi to take inspiration from world events such as the earthquake . " Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu " , released as the album 's third single in July , was written as therapy for Yamaguchi during this time . 
 The album was primarily created in the first half of 2011 . The band began work on the song " Endless " , and continued to develop it over the course of eight months , however due to Yamaguchi 's dissatisfaction with the piece . Most of the album 's remaining songs were recorded in breaks between the work on " Endless " . Yamaguchi spent much of this time writing lyrics that would express 2011 as a concept , and entrusted the album 's arrangement to the other band members . The album 's other tracks were ordered to complement " Endless " , and are generally ordered chronologically in the order each song was written . The song " Endless " was used as the main promotional track for the album , which was sent to radio stations and given a music video . The band toured the album from October to November with their Sakanaquarium 2011 tour , performing 15 dates at 13 venues in Japan . 
 The album was well received by critics in Japan , who praised the album 's blend of dance , rock and electronic genres , and felt that the documentary theme expressed the preciousness of music . The album was one of the 13 prize @-@ winning entries for the 2012 CD Shop Awards , and iTunes Japan 's iTunes Rewind 2011 awards named it the best album of the year . Commercially , the album was a success , reaching number two on Oricon 's albums chart , and being certified gold for 100 @,@ 000 physical copies shipped to stored by the Recording Industry Association of Japan .

 In March 2010 , Sakanaction released their fourth studio album , Kikuuiki . It was the band 's most commercially successful album up until that point , but Yamaguchi felt disappointed by the sales , expecting the album to sell over 100 @,@ 000 copies . Yamaguchi felt that the band 's sound on Kikuuiki was inaccessible to some pop listeners , leading to the album not selling well , but also felt the pressure from their new @-@ found audience to release more music . In order for the band to sell more and become more well known , Yamaguchi felt that Sakanaction should utilize new techniques to promote themselves , such as appearing more in media and on television . One of these techniques was to release three singles before the album ; something that he believed would show a story @-@ like development of Sakanaction 's album creation process , as well as alleviate the increased pressure he felt to release more Sakanaction music . At the Sakanaquarium 2010 Kikuuiki tour final on May 28 at Zepp Tokyo , the band performed a song entitled " Identity " for the first time during the concert 's encore , a song that had first been written early in the Kikuuiki recording sessions in 2009 , and recorded just after the band finished recording music for the album . On the same day , the song was announced as the band 's next single , released in August . 
 On October 8 , 2010 , the band performed their first concert at the Nippon Budokan , Sakanaquarium 21 @.@ 1 ( B ) , performing material from their first four albums , along with " Identity " . " Rookie " was written by Ichiro Yamaguchi after the band 's concert at the Nippon Budokan . Though the concert was an important milestone for the band , the actual concert felt like more of a ritual than a genuine milestone to Yamaguchi . This left Yamaguchi wondering what direction the band should take next , what Sakanaction 's place in the music scene was , and how the band was seen by others . Yamaguchi wanted to create a song that expressed the reasons that Sakanaction make music . The pre @-@ production process for recording " Rookie " began in January 2011 . Originally the band planned to release " Endless " as the second single from Documentaly , however Yamaguchi was not fully satisfied with the song and continued to work on it until August 2011 ; releasing " Rookie " in its place . The documentary theme for the album was fully conceptualized in January , during the " Rookie " and early " Endless " recording sessions , developed from Yamaguchi 's feelings of wanting to express himself more . On February 22 , 2011 , Sakanaction released a set of DVDs entitled Sakanaquarium 2010 . Coming in three different packages , Sakanaquarium 2010 ( B ) covered the band 's Nippon Budokan concert , while Sakanaquarium 2010 ( C ) was a recording of the final concert of the band 's Sakanaquarium 2010 Kikuuiki tour , recorded at Shinkiba Studio Coast on May 15 . The third package compiled both concerts and added a third DVD , Sakanaquarium 2010 ( D ) , featuring tour documentary and interview footage . The band found that the public 's response to Sakanaquarium 2010 ( D ) was so positive , that it strengthened their documentary @-@ themed album concept . Instead of merely adopting it as a theme , Sakanaction decided to record an actual documentary of the album 's creation process , on an additional visual media disc . 
 Just prior to " Rookie " ' s physical single release , Japan experienced the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11 , 2011 . Sakanaction cancelled or rescheduled many of their planned radio appearances , deciding not to directly promote the single at the remaining appearances . During these , the band preferred to focus on sending messages of hope for the victims of the disaster . In April , Yamaguchi visited <unk> and <unk> in Miyagi Prefecture to help with the emergency relief , without a media presence . Yamaguchi made the decision to go to Miyagi after watching television segments on celebrities visiting the disaster zone , and feeling that the segments were too focused on celebrity camera opportunities , and did not show the genuine realities of those affected by the earthquake . 
 The earthquake made Yamaguchi rethink his reasons why Sakanaction make music . The meaning of a documentary @-@ themed album changed after the earthquake , as the band felt as if they did not have a heavy album that reflected these events , then it could not truly be a documentary . Yamaguchi wrote the songs " Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu " and " Years " directly after the earthquake , as therapy for himself . Realizing that rock bands were no longer a staple of Japanese charts in the early 2010s , Yamaguchi wanted to create a Sakanaction @-@ style pop song that would resonate with a general pop audience , one that listened to idol groups such as Girls ' Generation , TVXQ and AKB48 . As rock music was no longer so prominent in Japan , Yamaguchi felt that the reasons for people listening to music had changed over time , and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment @-@ focused music in order to give people music that they look for .

 = = = Creation = = = 
 Though the early concept for the album was to show the band 's reality and development in a chronological order , the earthquake made the band re @-@ evaluate what they wanted to express with their documentary theme . Instead , the band decided to express what living in 2011 was like . Yamaguchi felt inspired to create music that when listened to strongly expressed the sentiments of a certain era , which he saw in the music of John Lennon , Bob Dylan and in Japanese singer <unk> Inoue 's song " Kasa ga Nai " ( 1972 ) ; as a way for people in the future to be able to experience how people felt during the post @-@ earthquake era . In addition to the earthquake , Yamaguchi expressed other events that happened to him in 2011 through the albums 's lyrics , including the death of electronic musician Rei <unk> in July 2011 which affected him deeply , as well as a turbulent event in his love life . 
 When writing the album 's lyrics , Yamaguchi tried to express both the feelings that he had , and those that he saw were common in society in the early 2010s . He focused on questioning what the role of a musician was during this period ; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011 , making certain types of music . He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake . The band also tried to express 2011 sonically , through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs . 
 The Documentaly album concept was created in January , after the song " Rookie " was written . " Endless " was first recorded after " Rookie " , however was left uncompleted because Yamaguchi was not satisfied with the song . Yamaguchi spent eight months writing the song , recording the other compositions for the album in between working on " Endless " . " Endless " became the most central song on the album for the band , with other songs arranged around " Endless " to complement it . The long writing process for " Endless " was frustrating for Yamaguchi , making him worried about if the documentary theme expressed itself well , and considered giving up on the theme . 
 As Yamaguchi spent much of his time focused on " Endless " , he entrusted most of the album 's arrangements to the other band members . This made Yamaguchi feel as if he was the director of the project , with drummer Keiichi Ejima leading the band as its captain during his absences as he focused on lyric writing . As Yamaguchi 's workload was lessened , he noticed that Sakanaction were working together more like a genuine band on Documentaly . In addition to the band members , Yamaguchi felt that Sakanaction had gained a solid core of peripheral staff that helped with the recording process , compared to their previous albums . 
 Documentaly was officially announced for release on August 1 , before the album had been entirely recorded . The band finished recording " Endless " on August 5 , on the morning before the band 's performance at the Rock in Japan Festival . Due to the song 's protracted creation process , finally being able to finish the composition gave the band a sense of the album finally being complete . After recording the final song " Monochrome Tokyo " , the album had finally finished being recorded in late August . 
 The band ordered the songs in a general chronological order for when each song was written , put into an order so that the listeners would understand Sakanaction as a band by the end of the album . When completed , Yamaguchi felt that Documentaly expressed what the band had come to understand while living in Tokyo . In contrast to Kikuuiki , which left him emotionally drained , he felt optimistic after completing Documentaly , feeling that he had a future in music . The Documentaly sessions led Yamaguchi to decide to live as a musician for a full @-@ time career . 
 = = = Song writing = = = 
 Reflective of the documentary theme , Yamaguchi saw the album expressing the ups and downs of regular days , more so than previous albums . Despite the inspiration taken from the heavy events of the earthquake , Yamaguchi felt that because the album featured three singles that were tailored to be heard by a wide audience , which pushed the album into a brighter sound . 
 The first song written for the album , " Identity " , was first written during the early demo sessions for Kikuuiki in 2009 , in the same period when the band were experimenting on the song " Aruku Around " to develop a signature song with a recognizable Sakanaction sound . It was recorded directly after the band finished work on Kikuuiki , and had lyrics inspired by the band 's song " Me ga Aku Aiiro " , as well as how people create identities for themselves in society . " Holy Dance " was recorded in June 2010 , inspired by Yamaguchi 's frustrations of unable to go fishing . 
 The songs " Monochrome Tokyo " and " Kamen no Machi " were written about Yamaguchi 's experiences of the chaos of living in Tokyo . " Monochrome Tokyo " was written in late 2010 , around the same time that they were writing " Rookie " . The song 's demo originally began with the lyric Okazaki no ie no <unk> wa <unk> ( <unk> , " The curtains in Okazaki 's house are old @-@ fashioned " ) as a joke , referencing the band 's video chat discussions . 
 " Ryūsen " was composed by Yamaguchi on the guitar , as a challenge to create a melody that would emphasize a song 's instrumental . Yamaguchi stressed dynamism during the writing process , choosing a non @-@ standard pop song structure for the piece . The song was recorded in a single live take . The audio from the take was then recorded onto a cassette tape and afterwards reconverted to digital sound , as a convention to add a deteriorated sound effect . " Ryūsen " and the instrumental track " Documentary " were arranged to complement " Endless " , the song present between the two . Seeing releasing music as an act of self @-@ expression , " Endless " was a song written by Yamaguchi to express his inner feelings as directly as possible . For this , Yamaguchi felt that he needed to develop new lyrical techniques to fully express his inner feelings , as these would not be expressed truly if he relied on techniques he had already developed . Eventually , he rewrote the song 74 times , creating a total of 78 different versions of the song lyrics . The instrumental piece " Documentary " , which Yamaguchi felt linked to " Endless " due to its synth elements , was primarily created by Ejima , who had been creating instrumental songs for the band 's albums as a way for him to learn about dance music . Yamaguchi saw the piece as more minimal than previous Sakanaction songs , and saw the song as a documentary of Ejima 's increased skills as a music arranger . 
 " Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu " and " Years " were written together directly after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami , as therapy for him after the earthquake . He wrote the songs as having a common theme spread across two works , hence featuring them on Documentaly in the same order as they had appeared on the " Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu " single . " Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu " is a song written focusing on everyday occurrences , while " Years " was focused on messages reacting to the " great anxiety " in society during the post @-@ earthquake time in Japan . The final track on the album , " Document " , was a song created to document the band 's song creation process . The entire song was written and arranged in a single day , and fully recorded the following day . The lyrics were ad @-@ libbed , a technique which Yamaguchi felt expressed a very personal side to himself , however made the lyrics more sarcastic and cynical than <unk> 's other songs . The song features the first ever instance in a Sakanaction song where Yamaguchi used the word ai ( 愛 , " love " ) in his lyrics , something he sees as a natural response to seeing love as an everyday thing now . 
 = = = Title = = = 
 The album 's title was officially confirmed on August 21 . Originally the band planned on self @-@ titling the album Sakanaction , as a reflection of the original theme of a documentary depicting themselves . The album was re @-@ titled after the events of the earthquake , when the band felt that the event forced them to refocus the documentary theme around all of the events of 2011 , instead of just themselves . The new title for the album , <unk> [ sic ] , is a pun on the words documentary and mental , with the letter ' l ' capitalized . Yamaguchi , the creator of the title , felt that the title expressed the idea of bands living and making music in 2011 , and saw the letters " r " and " l " as two letters that join together the word " real " . The title is a recurring motif in the song titles of the album , including the instrumental track " <unk> " ( sic . ) , and the begging instrumental track " RL " , which features both of the capitalised letters .

It was commercially successful , becoming certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for digital downloads , and reaching number four on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart . The song 's music video , featuring a distinctive dance where Yamaguchi was laterally attached to four mannequins was well received in Japan , later winning the Best Video of the Year award at the 2012 Space Shower Music Video Awards . The band were featured in the September edition of Musica magazine , released on August 12 , in a featured piece detailing the album 's recording process .

The collection featured a new music video for the Documentaly track " Document " , which the band were inspired to make due to the documentary footage included on Documentaly 's visual media disc , showcasing the recording of " Document " . The video , depicting a female stalker in Yamaguchi 's home played by singer @-@ songwriter Kanae <unk> , was recorded in Yamaguchi 's own home on November 6 , after the band finished their concert at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba .

 The album was well received by music critics in Japan . Yuya Shimizu of Rolling Stone Japan gave the album four out of five stars , praising how the album blended DFA Records @-@ style dance rock and minimal techno with their Japanese pop sensibilities , and also noting Yamaguchi 's oddness and lyrical sense . Kenta <unk> of Vibe felt that Sakanaction expressed a strong sense of crisis happening in the contemporary Japanese music business on the album . By creating an album themed around documentaries , and giving the listener a chance to understand the entire creation process , <unk> felt that Documentaly expressed the preciousness of music more so than other musical works . Looking at the album 's central track " Endless " , Shimizu felt that the song was an ambitious " compilation @-@ like work " , likening it to electronic musician Rei <unk> . CDJournal reviewers praised the " calm piano intro " that transitioned from the album 's previous song " Ryūsen " , and how the song progressed into " a Sakanaction @-@ like electro and rock fusion sound " . They praised Yamaguchi 's lyrics , feeling they were " symbolic " and " like two recursive mirrors " . 
 <unk> Matsunaga of Excite felt that the album showed " the unfolding of a peculiarly intelligent and pop world " , noting the album 's " profound " band sound that adopted danceable electronic elements , as well as the " catchy and thrilling " sound progression . CDJournal called the album a " must listen disc " , praising the increased skill of the " literary world " of Yamaguchi 's lyrics , and the album 's " fantasy @-@ like nostalgia " . They described " Monochrome Tokyo " as an " impressive rock number created by synthesizer and bass guitar riffs " , praising the band 's skill at removing musical elements as well as Yamaguchi 's " emotionally sung " and " sexy " vocals . For " Antares to Hari " , the reviewers felt that a " stylish jazz funk aroma " was created by a " relaxed " bass line and guitar cutting , and praised the light atmosphere created by the deep synths , while " Ryūsen " ' s " comfortable " acoustic guitar " paints a dramatic and grand scene . " They felt that the song managed to develop and increase in " temperature " without becoming noisy , and pointed to this as well as the " abstract " lyric " ryūsen , <unk> ni ryūsen " ( <unk> <unk> , " streamline , a new streamline " ) as creating a " mysterious atmosphere " . The reviewers likened " Kamen to Machi " to Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra , and felt a sense of tension created by Yamaguchi 's fast @-@ tempo vocals and the changing background instrumental . They believed that the album 's closing song " Document " was a condensation of the album 's taste , and that the final lyric " ai no uta <unk> mo ii kana <unk> <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> , " I 'm starting to think that it 's okay to sing love songs " ) set to a " relaxed and hopeful sound " had a powerfully lingering impression . 
 Reviewing the first single " Identity " , CDJournal reviewers gave the single their star of approval , calling it the " highest [ level of ] pop music " and a future anthem for Sakanaction . They praised the " radical but considered electro sound " and the " danceable " four on the floor beat . They praised Yamaguchi 's " unique " lyrical sense , as well as Yamaguchi 's vocals at the start of the chorus as he sung the word <unk> , feeling it was " intense " . Sumire <unk> of Skream ! felt that that the song blended a Latin rhythm with the " spirits of a Japanese festival " . For the song 's B @-@ side , featured as a bonus track on the album , reviewer Yuichi Hirayama described the song as " an electro tune demanding an escape from anguish " , feeling that it had all of the " power " of " Identity " and the other band 's singles . Reviewing the " Like a Live " remix found as the bonus track on Documentaly , CDJournal reviewers praised the song 's " rhyme @-@ like wordplay and exhilarating sound " . 
 Critics praised the second single " Rookie " for its new style , not seen in previous Sakanaction works . The third single , " Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu " , was praised for its " ecstatic beat " and " elegant piano " , and " smart dance music " sense .

 = 1935 Jérémie hurricane = 
 The 1935 Jérémie hurricane was a highly destructive tropical cyclone that impacted the Greater Antilles and Honduras in October 1935 , killing well over 2 @,@ 000 people . Developing on October 18 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea , the storm proceeded to strike eastern Jamaica and southeastern Cuba while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a deluge of rain . The hurricane — a Category 1 at its peak — completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23 , heading southwestward toward Central America . Weakened by its interaction with Cuba , the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios in Honduras on October 25 . The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later . 
 Flooding and landslides in Jamaica took their toll on property , agricultural interests , and infrastructure ; fruit growers on the island sustained about $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 1935 USD ) in losses . Just off the coast , an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions . Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba , notably in and around Santiago de Cuba . There , the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris . Only four people died in the country , thanks to the extensive pre @-@ storm preparations . The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti , where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2 @,@ 000 individuals , razed hundreds of native houses , and destroyed crops and livestock . The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie ; one early report estimated that 1 @,@ 500 had been killed at the latter . Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days , delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts . 
 The hurricane later created devastating floods in Central America , chiefly in Honduras . Reported at the time to be the worst flood in the nation 's history , the disaster decimated banana plantations and population centers after rivers flowed up to 50 ft ( 15 m ) above normal . Torrents of floodwaters trapped hundreds of citizens in trees , on rooftops , and on remote high ground , requiring emergency rescue . The storm left thousands homeless and around 150 dead in the country , while monetary losses totaled $ 12 million . Flooding and strong winds reached into northeastern Nicaragua , though damage was much less widespread than in neighboring Honduras . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The hurricane originated over the southwestern Caribbean Sea , where , on October 17 , a broad and immature low pressure system was noted . The hurricane forecast center in Jacksonville , Florida issued its first advisory on the storm late on October 20 , following ship reports of winds approaching and exceeding gale @-@ force . Contemporary reanalyses of the storm have determined that it organized into a tropical depression on October 18 , then drifted toward the east , turning north @-@ northeastward as it strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day . Due to low environmental air pressures and the large size of the cyclone , intensification was gradual as the storm approached Jamaica , eventually making landfall on the eastern side of the island , just west of the Morant Point Lighthouse , at 13 : 00 UTC on October 21 . The system came ashore with a central pressure of 995 hPa ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) , suggesting maximum winds of 60 mph ( 100 km / h ) . After emerging into the waters between Jamaica and Cuba , the storm slowed in forward speed , continued to intensify , and curved northwestward toward southeastern Cuba . The storm attained the equivalent of Category 1 hurricane status on the current @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale early on October 22 , while meandering just off the coast of Cuba . 
 At around 18 : 00 UTC on October 22 , the hurricane made landfall near Santiago de Cuba at its initial peak intensity , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . It started weakening early the next day after encountering the Sierra Maestra mountain range and moving southwestward , away from the coast . Steered by persistent high @-@ pressure ridging over the eastern United States and western Atlantic , the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual path for the remainder of its duration in open waters . It brushed Cuba 's Cape Cruz and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica . On the morning of October 24 , the barometer aboard a ship in the storm 's eye fell to 988 hPa ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) , its lowest recorded pressure . The ship measured winds outside of the lull only up to 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) , but the storm was reintensifying , and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day . It matched its previous peak intensity at 12 : 00 UTC on October 25 as it approached Cabo Gracias a Dios on the border of Honduras and Nicaragua . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane crossed the Honduran coast for its final landfall . The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm , which curved westward and steadily lost force , though observation of its decay was minimal . The cyclone likely dissipated on October 27 over Guatemala .

 The hurricane affected several nations along its unusual path , killing an estimated 2 @,@ 150 people . 
 = = = Jamaica = = = 
 Parts of eastern Jamaica began to experience strong northeasterly winds early on October 20 , and the parishes of Saint Thomas , Portland , and Saint Mary ultimately bore the brunt of the storm . Heavy rainfall swelled rivers and triggered landslides ; the ensuing floods destroyed bridges , inundated many homes , and necessitated the rescue of trapped individuals . With telegraph communications cut to the hardest @-@ hit areas and roads left impassable , the degree of destruction was initially uncertain , though it was described as " extensive " . The storm took a heavy toll on agriculture ( already compromised from the effects of another hurricane less than a month earlier ) , with banana plantations in particular sustaining heavy damage . Losses to fruit crops in the nation totaled an estimated $ 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 The storm reportedly killed three people on the island . An unidentified schooner capsized off Port Antonio with all hands lost , in spite of efforts to rescue the imperiled crew . One modern source recounts that the crew numbered 31 , but this figure was not widely reported . The USS Houston , underway with President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt , averted its course after encountering adverse conditions . 
 = = = Cuba and Haiti = = = 
 In advance of the hurricane 's landfall in Cuba , businesses were closed . Railways worked to secure non @-@ essential trains , and residents of vulnerable coastal towns , including Caimanera , fled their homes in search of safer ground . The hurricane subjected eastern parts of the island to intense gales , measured at over 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) at Santiago de Cuba before the anemometer failed . The northern coast of the island around Nipe Bay also endured strong winds as high as 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) . Winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) were recorded at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , though the effects there were generally light . Closer to the hurricane 's center , in Santiago de Cuba , about 100 homes sustained complete structural failures . The prolonged nature of the storm hampered search and rescue efforts amid the rubble . Winds strew debris around the city , blocking its streets . A hospital and a power plant both suffered roof failure . Electricity in Santiago de Cuba was preemptively turned off as conditions worsened , contributing to regional power outages . 
 Significant flooding occurred after the <unk> River overflowed it banks , making driving impossible . The storm severed communications between towns in eastern Cuba after bringing down telephone and telegraph wires . Apart from seven structures ruined in the Guantánamo area , there was less destruction in many locations than initially feared . There were reports of three fatalities in Caimanera , and one person died in Santiago de Cuba . At least 29 individuals were treated for storm @-@ related injuries . Damage assessments in the immediate aftermath of the storm placed monetary damages in Cuba at $ 500 @,@ 000 . In the aftermath , a public curfew was issued for Santiago de Cuba , forcing residents to remain indoors after 8 pm . To prevent looting , troops patrolled streets and vulnerable locations , such as banks . Supplies of bread and milk ran short following the hurricane . 
 The greatest disaster occurred in southern Haiti , where as many as 2 @,@ 000 people died , possibly more . The towns of Jacmel and Jérémie — both on the Tiburon Peninsula — were devastated by catastrophic freshwater flooding after days of torrential rains . The entire peninsula , already remote in its own right , was isolated for a time , ensuring only scant detail of the disaster reached the outside world . Information was initially relayed to the capital city of Port @-@ au @-@ Prince by a single aircraft . 
 The hurricane crippled infrastructure , blocking roads throughout the area and destroying a hydroelectricity plant in Jacmel . The town was left without power and drinking water . In Jérémie , the flooding was so severe as to sweep away a large metal bridge . Hundreds of poorly constructed native houses were destroyed on the Tiburon Peninsula , leaving thousands of survivors without homes . Property damage in Haiti amounted to over $ 1 million . Meanwhile , thousands of livestock were killed and crops were completely destroyed , prompting fears of impending famine . 
 Several days after the storm , the bodies of drowning victims had been recovered by the hundreds , and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea . One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1 @,@ 500 , suggesting the worst of the tragedy occurred there . Indeed , some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie . The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers , at least partially by way of ship , to the flood @-@ stricken region . As little was known about the extent of losses , officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area .

 After clearing the Greater Antilles , the hurricane ravaged parts of Honduras . Banana plantations suffered extensively , causing the United Fruit Company about $ 6 million in losses . As in Haiti , the hardest hit areas of Honduras were cut off from the nation 's capital of Tegucigalpa . Severe river flooding wrought widespread destruction , especially around La Ceiba and throughout the Cortés Department . Many towns were inundated by up to 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) of water . According to one source , the Ulúa River " officially " rose some 50 ft ( 15 m ) from its normal height near Chamelecón , where the flood left 800 families homeless . Many hundreds of individuals were stranded by raging flood waters in the Cortés region , clutching to trees and rooftops as they awaited uncertain rescue . Even after rescue boats brought many residents of Chamelecón to safety , a third of the population remain trapped . 
 The rampant <unk> River reportedly obliterated an entire suburban community further east , near La Ceiba , while the Aguán River burst its banks at Trujillo and killed numerous plantation workers . By October 29 , the bodies of 70 flood victims had been recovered at <unk> in Colón . Torrential rains extended into Tegucigalpa , causing urban flooding . Just to the northeast , in San <unk> , a large landslide took the lives of at least three people . Overall , the hurricane inflicted about $ 12 million in damage across Honduras ( including the agricultural impacts ) , resulted in about 150 deaths , and destroyed the homes of thousands of residents . The floods were considered to be among the worst in the country 's history . Almost immediately after the passage of the storm , a wide area of Honduras experienced strong earthquake activity . 
 Damaging , but less expansive , floods also occurred in parts of extreme northeastern Nicaragua around the Mosquito Coast . The Coco River , which constitutes a large portion of the Honduras – Nicaragua border , swelled 40 ft ( 12 m ) as observed about 140 mi ( 230 km ) upstream of its mouth . Banana farms were heavily damaged around Cabo Gracias a Dios , occupied by both nations , and according to early reports in that area , all but a handful of dwellings were destroyed . In spite of the flooding and hurricane @-@ force winds , timely warnings prevented fatalities locally . 
 = Ununennium = 
 Ununennium , also known as eka @-@ francium or simply element 119 , is the hypothetical chemical element with atomic number 119 and symbol Uue . Ununennium and Uue are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol , until a permanent name is decided upon . In the periodic table of the elements , it is expected to be an s @-@ block element , an alkali metal , and the first element in the eighth period . 
 Ununennium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not yet been synthesized . Multiple attempts have been made by American , German , and Russian teams to synthesize this element : they have all been unsuccessful , as experimental evidence has shown that the synthesis of ununennium will likely be far more difficult than that of the previous elements , and may even be the penultimate element that can be synthesized with current technology . Its position as the seventh alkali metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners , lithium , sodium , potassium , rubidium , caesium , and francium ; however , relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends . For example , ununennium is expected to be less reactive than caesium and francium and to be closer in behavior to potassium or rubidium , and while it should show the characteristic + 1 oxidation state of the alkali metals , it is also predicted to show the + 3 oxidation state unknown in any other alkali metal . 
 = = History = = 
 Superheavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion . These fusion reactions can be divided into " hot " and " cold " fusion , depending on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus produced . In hot fusion reactions , very light , high @-@ energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets ( actinides ) , giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy ( ~ 40 – 50 MeV ) that may fission , or alternatively evaporate several ( 3 to 5 ) neutrons . In cold fusion reactions ( which use heavier projectiles , typically from the fourth period , and lighter targets , usually lead and bismuth ) , the fused nuclei produced have a relatively low excitation energy ( ~ 10 – 20 MeV ) , which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions . As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state , they require emission of only one or two neutrons . However , hot fusion reactions tend to produce more neutron @-@ rich products because the actinides have the highest neutron @-@ to @-@ proton ratios of any elements that can presently be made in macroscopic quantities . 
 Ununennium and <unk> ( elements 119 and 120 ) are the lightest elements that have not yet been synthesized , and attempts to synthesize them would push the limits of current technology , due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half @-@ lives , expected to be on the order of microseconds . Heavier elements would likely be too short @-@ lived to be detected with current technology : they would decay within a microsecond , before reaching the detectors . Previously , important help ( characterized as " silver bullets " ) in the synthesis of superheavy elements came from the deformed nuclear shells around hassium @-@ 270 which increased the stability of surrounding nuclei , and the existence of the quasi @-@ stable neutron @-@ rich isotope calcium @-@ 48 which could be used as a projectile to produce more neutron @-@ rich isotopes of superheavy elements . The more neutron @-@ rich a superheavy nuclide is , the closer it is expected to be to the sought @-@ after island of stability . Even so , the synthesized isotopes still have fewer neutrons than those expected to be in the island of stability . Furthermore , using calcium @-@ 48 to synthesize ununennium would require a target of einsteinium @-@ 253 or -254 , which is very difficult to produce in sufficiently large quantities . More practical production of further superheavy elements would require projectiles heavier than 48Ca . 
 = = = Synthesis attempts = = = 
 The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium @-@ 254 with calcium @-@ 48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley , California : 
 254 
 <unk> + 48 
 20Ca → 302 
 119Uue * → no atoms 
 No atoms were identified , leading to a limiting cross section of 300 nb . Later calculations suggest that the cross section of the 3n reaction ( which would result in <unk> and three neutrons as products ) would actually be six hundred thousand times lower than this upper bound , at 0 @.@ 5 pb . 
 As ununennium is the lightest undiscovered element , it has been the target of synthesis experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years . The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011 , and no results were released , strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified . From April to September 2012 , an attempt to synthesize the isotopes <unk> and <unk> was made by bombarding a target of berkelium @-@ 249 with titanium @-@ 50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt , Germany . Based on the theoretically predicted cross @-@ section , it was expected that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment .

 The experiment was originally planned to continue to November 2012 , but was stopped early to make use of the 249Bk target to confirm the synthesis of ununseptium ( thus changing the projectiles to 48Ca ) . This reaction between 249Bk and 50Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for formation of ununennium , as it is rather asymmetrical , though also somewhat cold . ( The reaction between 254Es and 48Ca would be superior , but preparing milligram quantities of 254Es for a target is difficult . ) Nevertheless , the necessary change from the " silver bullet " 48Ca to 50Ti divides the expected yield of ununennium by about twenty , as the yield is strongly dependent on the asymmetry of the fusion reaction . 
 Due to the predicted short half @-@ lives , the GSI team used new " fast " electronics capable of registering decay events within microseconds . No ununennium atoms were identified , implying a limiting cross @-@ section of 70 fb . The predicted actual cross @-@ section is around 40 fb , which is at the limits of current technology . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , ununennium should be known as eka @-@ francium . Using the 1979 IUPAC recommendations , the element should be temporarily called ununennium ( symbol Uue ) until it is discovered , the discovery is confirmed , and a permanent name chosen . Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels , from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks , the recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists who work theoretically or experimentally on superheavy elements , who call it " element 119 " , with the symbol ( 119 ) or 119 .

 = = = Nuclear stability and isotopes = = = 
 The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after curium , element 96 , whose half @-@ life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any currently known higher @-@ numbered element . All isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half @-@ lives of less than 30 hours . No elements with atomic numbers above 82 ( after lead ) have stable isotopes . Nevertheless , because of reasons not yet well understood , there is a slight increase of nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110 – 114 , which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the " island of stability " . This concept , proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg , explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted . 
 The alpha @-@ decay half @-@ lives predicted for 291 – <unk> are on the order of microseconds . The longest alpha @-@ decay half @-@ life predicted is ~ 485 microseconds for the isotope <unk> . When factoring in all decay modes , the predicted half @-@ lives drop further to only tens of microseconds . This has consequences for the synthesis of ununennium , as isotopes with half @-@ lives below one microsecond would decay before reaching the detector . Nevertheless , new theoretical models show that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals <unk> / 2 ( filled at element 114 ) and 2f5 / 2 ( filled at element 120 ) is smaller than expected , so that element 114 no longer appears to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell , and this energy gap may increase the stability of elements 119 and 120 . The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around the spherical 306Ubb ( element 122 ) , but the expected low half @-@ life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging . 
 = = = Atomic and physical = = = 
 Being the first period 8 element , ununennium is predicted to be an alkali metal , below lithium , sodium , potassium , rubidium , caesium , and francium . Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s @-@ orbital ( valence electron configuration ns1 ) , which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the + 1 oxidation state : thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements . Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of <unk> . It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners ; however , it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties . 
 The main reason for the predicted differences between ununennium and the other alkali metals is the spin – orbit ( SO ) interaction — the mutual interaction between the electrons ' motion and spin . The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster — at velocities comparable to the speed of light — than those in lighter atoms . In ununennium atoms , it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels , stabilizing the corresponding electrons , but two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four . The effect is called subshell splitting , as it splits the 7p subshell into more @-@ stabilized and the less @-@ stabilized parts . Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second ( azimuthal ) quantum number l from 1 to 1 / 2 and 3 / 2 for the more @-@ stabilized and less @-@ stabilized parts of the 7p subshell , respectively . Thus , the outer 8s electron of ununennium is stabilized and becomes harder to remove than expected , while the 7p3 / 2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized , perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions . This stabilization of the outermost s @-@ orbital ( already significant in francium ) is the key factor affecting ununennium 's chemistry , and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkali metals to reverse direction after caesium . 
 Due to the stabilization of its outer 8s electron , ununennium 's first ionization energy — the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom — is predicted to be 4 @.@ 53 eV , higher than those of the known alkali metals from potassium onward . This effect is so large that unbiunium ( element 121 ) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4 @.@ 45 eV , so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest ionization energy in the period , as is true for all previous periods . Ununennium 's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium ; indeed , ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it . Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium , to 169 @.@ 7 <unk> Indeed , the static dipole <unk> ( <unk> ) of ununennium , a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element 's atomic number , has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium . 
 The electron of the hydrogen @-@ like ununennium atom — oxidized so it has only one electron , <unk> + — is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1 @.@ 99 times that of a non @-@ moving electron , a feature coming from the relativistic effects . For comparison , the figure for hydrogen @-@ like francium is 1 @.@ 29 and the figure for hydrogen @-@ like caesium is 1 @.@ 091 . According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws , that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 240 pm , very close to that of rubidium ( 247 pm ) ; the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260 pm . The ionic radius of Uue + is expected to be 180 pm . 
 Ununennium is predicted to have a melting point between 0 ° C and 30 ° C : thus it may be a liquid at room temperature . It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group , as francium 's melting point is known so poorly , having been variously been stated to be around 23 ° C or 27 ° C , with both values very close to the caesium value ( 28 @.@ 5 ° C ) , possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium 's radioactive decay . The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630 ° C , which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group , following the downward periodic trend . The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4 g · cm − 3 , continuing the trend of increasing density down the group , using the predicted value for francium between 2 @.@ 8 and 3 @.@ 0 g · cm − 3 . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 The chemistry of ununennium is predicted to be similar to that of the alkali metals , but it would probably behave more like potassium or rubidium than caesium or francium . This is unusual as periodic trends , ignoring relativistic effects , would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium . This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of ununennium 's valence electron , increasing ununennium 's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii ; this effect is already seen for <unk> the chemistry of ununennium in the + 1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium . On the other hand , the ionic radius of the Uue + ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb + , because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p @-@ orbitals of the lower shells . Ununennium may also show the + 3 oxidation state , which is not seen in any other alkali metal , in addition to the + 1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals : this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3 / 2 spinor , causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected . Many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character , due to the involvement of the 7p3 / 2 electrons in the bonding : this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in francium , which shows some <unk> / 2 contribution to the bonding in francium superoxide ( FrO2 ) . Thus , instead of ununennium being the most electropositive element , as a simple extrapolation would seem to indicate , caesium instead retains this position , with ununennium 's electronegativity most likely being close to sodium 's ( 0 @.@ 93 on the Pauling scale ) . 
 In the gas phase , and at very low temperatures in the condensed phase , the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules . The metal – metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from <unk> to <unk> , but then decrease after that to <unk> , due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital . The opposite trend is shown for the metal – metal bond @-@ dissociation energies . The Uue – Uue bond should be slightly stronger than the K – K bond . From these M2 dissociation energies , the enthalpy of sublimation ( <unk> ) of ununennium is predicted to be 94 kJ · mol − 1 ( the value for francium should be around 77 kJ · mol − 1 ) . 
 The Uue – Au bond should be the weakest of all bonds between gold and an alkali metal , but should still be stable . This gives extrapolated medium @-@ sized adsorption enthalpies ( − <unk> ) of 106 kJ · mol − 1 on gold ( the francium value should be 136 kJ · mol − 1 ) , 76 kJ · mol − 1 on platinum , and 63 kJ · mol − 1 on silver , the smallest of all the alkali metals , that demonstrate that it would be feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals . The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a Teflon surface is predicted to be 17 @.@ 6 kJ · mol − 1 , which would be the lowest among the alkali metals : this information would be very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium . The <unk> and − <unk> values are not proportionally related for the alkali metals , as they change in opposite directions as atomic number increases . 
 = Brushstrokes series = 
 Brushstrokes series is the name for a series of paintings produced in 1965 – 66 by Roy Lichtenstein . It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s . In the series , the theme is art as a subject , but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962 , Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself . The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock , but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance . The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics . After 1966 , Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early 1960s , Lichtenstein reproduced masterpieces by Cézanne , Mondrian and Picasso before embarking on the Brushstroke series in 1965 . The Brushstrokes were contemporaneous with abstract painting that no longer emphasized the gestural aspect , with non @-@ demonstrative modes carrying the day . Lichtenstein was identified with some such modes by critics and found himself linked to both Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland . Brushstrokes was the first element of the Brushstrokes series . 
 Prior to producing his first Brushstroke work , Lichtenstein spun his upcoming work as a satire of Abstract Expressionism . He stated that he intended to draw drips of paint and depictions of brush strokes . Years after the series was completed , Lichtenstein claimed the source for the series was Renaissance artist Frans Hals , a painterly artist whose brushstrokes descended from hallowed examples of European art as an inspiration to abstract expressionism . 
 According to the Lichtenstein Foundation 's website , he began creating Brushstroke painting in the autumn of 1965 and presented the Brushstroke series at Castelli 's gallery from November 20 through December 11 . A 1967 painting entitles Brushstrokes was produced for the Pasadena Art Museum 's 1967 Lichtenstein exhibition . Later he produced an eight @-@ print Brushstroke Figures series using collage elements . The series is described as an " ... instance of Abstract Expressionism recycled through conventions taken from the mass media ... " He began making sculptural renditions of his Brushstrokes paintings in the early 1980s in a wide variety of shapes and sizes . Many of these were painted bronzes . 
 The inspiration for the series was Charlton Comics ' Strange Suspense Stories 72 ( October 1964 ) by Dick Giordano which depicted an artist who was worn out emotionally after completing a painting . However , only the original directly references the comic strip . Although the Brushstrokes series had a brief timespan , the motif served as a theme in Lichtenstein 's works for the final 32 years of his career . 
 In the 1960 Lichtenstein characterized his inspiration as follows : " Although I had played with this idea before , it started with a comic book image of a mad artist crossing out , with a large brushstroke ' X , ' the face of a friend that was haunting him . ... Then I went on to do paintings of brushstroke alone . I was very interested in characterizing or caricaturing a brushstroke ... " He has also described this series as follows : " [ I ] t 's taking something that originally was suppose to mean immediacy and I 'm tediously drawing something that looks like a brushstroke ... I want it to look as though it were painstaking . " In the 1990s , he described his inspiration in more artistic terms 
 It [ the Brushstroke ] was the way of portraying this romantic and bravura symbol in its opposite style , classicism . The Brushstroke plays a big part in the history of art . Brushstroke almost means painting or art . I did isolated Brushstrokes in 1965 and used cartoon brushstrokes to depict subject matters in the 1980s . I also did Brushstroke sculptures in bronze and wood to make them more palpable . ... the Brushstroke , it is just an idea to start with , and painting it makes it more concrete , but when you do it in bronze sculpture , it becomes real and has weight and is absurd , contradictory and funny . 
 Lichtenstein has also described the effect of depicting a single artificial brushstroke <unk> with hundreds of small brushstrokes : " My recent sculpture of a Brushstroke is an attempt to give strong form to something that is a momentary occurrence , to solidify something ephemeral , to make it concrete . " 
 In 1981 , Lichtenstein return to the brushstroke and introduced complexity to the simple element of the painter 's brushstroke and added free hand strokes to his " decoy ones " . 
 = = Details = = 
 Works in the Brushstrokes series depict brushstrokes as their subject . However , rather than present the use of the delicate artist paint brush , Lichtenstein created the strokes of the broad house @-@ painter 's brush . His works both turned a mundane household task into a planned artistic operation and made a time @-@ consuming task appear as if it were produced mechanically in an instant . The Brushstroke series paintings " ... contain the clear outline , process colors , and <unk> @-@ dot screen of the comic strip , but like the landscapes , they <unk> narrative in favor of reducing a subject ( in this case , painting ) to its most basic symbol ( the brushstroke ) . " The satirical element of the Brushstroke is obvious to many because it is a calculated presentation of the spontaneous gestural works of its day . 
 Although both the Cubists and the Futurists conveyed movement and speed within the two dimensions of a painting , it was Pollock who brought dynamic movement to the canvas in the 1950s with his form of abstract expressionism known as gestural painting in works such as Autumn Rhythm , 1950 . In Little Big Painting and subsequently even more so in Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes , for example , dynamic activity was a prominent feature of the series . Lichtenstein 's loops and depiction of sweeping gestures all resemble Pollock 's gestural painting . As a result of this series , Lichtenstein was able to present works to the viewing audience that resembled what they had become accustomed to seeing , however , his result is completely flat without any trace of the brushstroke or the artist 's hand . Meanwhile , the work references mechanical printing with the Ben @-@ Day dots background , which enables Lichtenstein to parody his predecessors and make a " powerful abstract composition " . The effort to make the painting appear mechanically produced by flattening the brushstroke also gives the illusion that the brushstroke is floating freely . 
 The works in the series are considered ironic mechanical representations of gestural techniques . They depict the brushstroke directionality beginning with the full beginning , gradual fraying and ragged ending laid out over a field of Ben @-@ Day dots . Additionally , the series is an expression of the dealings of commercial art with its remote interaction . The significance of Lichtenstein 's choice of the brushstroke as a subject is expressed by analogy : " ... the Ben @-@ Day dots are to the painting of Lichtenstein what the brushstroke is to Abstract Expressionism : an image of process . " The brushstroke remained a part of his works for the remainder of his career . He produced painted bronze sculptural versions of his brushstrokes throughout his career . 
 In 2001 a large show of his work from his estate entitled " Brushstrokes : Four Decades " was held in New York City at the Mitchell @-@ Innes and Nash gallery . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 According to Diane Waldman of ARTnews , the works " ... spoofed the bravura brushstroke , replete with drips , of the Abstract Expressionists . Issues of vital importance to them , such as gesture and the involvement of the whole body in the act of painting , were reduced to a single brushstroke . " She interprets this as a criticism of the corruption of Abstract Expressionism by uncreative painters . Though not described as abstract art , the brushstrokes forms are considered to be invented . The series was part of Lichtenstein 's 1960s slant towards reductive , economical work . 
 The works in this series are regarded as having " dense abstract complexity " to blur the clarity of his earlier references while emphasizing " ... the bravura of the brushstroke ... " rather than the subject that it is used to depict . The use of the artist 's paintbrush to create enormous renditions of house @-@ painter brushstrokes in the quasi @-@ mechanical Lichtenstein style is a commentary on his own painting actions . The series was a response to the Pop Art critics of the day , who were mostly abstract expressionist . He expropriated the most basic element of expressionism in his own style both in painting and in sculpture . The series of Brushstroke canvases is regarded as a group of works that parody gestural painting by commenting on the normal individual relationship between the artist and his tools . 
 = Forbidden City = 
 The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty — the years 1420 to 1912 . It is located in the centre of Beijing , China , and now houses the Palace Museum . It served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government for almost 500 years . 
 Constructed from 1406 to 1420 , the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha ( 180 acres ) . The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture , and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere . The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 , and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world . 
 Since 1925 , the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum , whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties . Part of the museum 's former collection is now located in the National Palace Museum in Taipei . Both museums descend from the same institution , but were split after the Chinese Civil War . With over 14 million annual visitors , the Palace Museum is the most visited Museum in the world . 
 = = Name = = 
 The common English name , " the Forbidden City " , is a translation of the Chinese name Zijin Cheng ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; literally : " Forbidden City " ) . The name Zijin Cheng first formally appeared in 1576 . Another English name of similar origin is " Forbidden Palace " . 
 The name " Zijin Cheng " is a name with significance on many levels . Zi , or " Purple " , refers to the North Star , which in ancient China was called the <unk> Star , and in traditional Chinese astrology was the heavenly abode of the Celestial Emperor . The surrounding celestial region , the <unk> Enclosure ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , was the realm of the Celestial Emperor and his family . The Forbidden City , as the residence of the terrestrial emperor , was its earthly counterpart . Jin , or " Forbidden " , referred to the fact that no one could enter or leave the palace without the emperor 's permission . Cheng means a city . 
 Today , the site is most commonly known in Chinese as <unk> ( <unk> ) , which means the " Former Palace " . The museum which is based in these buildings is known as the " Palace Museum " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = History = = 
 When Hongwu Emperor 's son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor , he moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing , and construction began in 1406 on what would become the Forbidden City . 
 Construction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers . Material used include whole logs of precious Phoebe <unk> wood ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) found in the jungles of south @-@ western China , and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing . The floors of major halls were paved with " golden bricks " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , specially baked paving bricks from Suzhou . 
 From 1420 to 1644 , the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming dynasty . In April 1644 , it was captured by rebel forces led by Li Zicheng , who proclaimed himself emperor of the Shun dynasty . He soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general Wu Sangui and Manchu forces , setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process . 
 By October , the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China , and a ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the young Shunzhi Emperor as ruler of all China under the Qing dynasty . The Qing rulers changed the names on some of the principal buildings , to emphasise " Harmony " rather than " Supremacy " , made the name plates bilingual ( Chinese and Manchu ) , and introduced Shamanist elements to the palace . 
 In 1860 , during the Second Opium War , Anglo @-@ French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war . In 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi fled from the Forbidden City during the Boxer Rebellion , leaving it to be occupied by forces of the treaty powers until the following year . 
 After being the home of 24 emperors – 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty – the Forbidden City ceased being the political centre of China in 1912 with the abdication of Puyi , the last Emperor of China . Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government , Puyi remained in the Inner Court , while the Outer Court was given over to public use , until he was evicted after a coup in 1924 . The Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City in 1925 . In 1933 , the Japanese invasion of China forced the evacuation of the national treasures in the Forbidden City . Part of the collection was returned at the end of World War II , but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders by Chiang Kai @-@ shek , whose Kuomintang was losing the Chinese Civil War . This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965 , when it again became public , as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei . 
 After the establishment of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , some damage was done to the Forbidden City as the country was swept up in revolutionary zeal . During the Cultural Revolution , however , further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai sent an army battalion to guard the city . 
 The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO as the " Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties " , due to its significant place in the development of Chinese architecture and culture . It is currently administered by the Palace Museum , which is carrying out a sixteen @-@ year restoration project to repair and restore all buildings in the Forbidden City to their pre @-@ 1912 state . 
 In recent years , the presence of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial . A Starbucks store that opened in 2000 sparked objections and eventually closed on 13 July 2007 . Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit Chinese citizens in order to price @-@ gouge foreign customers in 2006 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Forbidden City is a rectangle , with 961 metres ( 3 @,@ 153 ft ) from north to south and 753 metres ( 2 @,@ 470 ft ) from east to west . It consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8 @,@ 886 bays of rooms . A common myth states that there are 9 @,@ 999 rooms including <unk> , based on oral tradition , and it is not supported by survey evidence . The Forbidden City was designed to be the centre of the ancient , walled city of Beijing . It is enclosed in a larger , walled area called the Imperial City . The Imperial City is , in turn , enclosed by the Inner City ; to its south lies the Outer City . 
 The Forbidden City remains important in the civic scheme of Beijing . The central north – south axis remains the central axis of Beijing . This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square , the ceremonial centre of the People 's Republic of China , and on to Yongdingmen . To the north , it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers . This axis is not exactly aligned north – south , but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees . Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu , the other capital of their empire . 
 = = = Walls and gates = = = 
 The Forbidden City is surrounded by a 7 @.@ 9 metres ( 26 ft ) high city wall and a 6 metres ( 20 ft ) deep by 52 metres ( 171 ft ) wide moat . The walls are 8 @.@ 62 metres ( 28 @.@ 3 ft ) wide at the base , tapering to 6 @.@ 66 metres ( 21 @.@ 9 ft ) at the top . These walls served as both defensive walls and retaining walls for the palace . They were constructed with a rammed earth core , and surfaced with three layers of specially baked bricks on both sides , with the interstices filled with mortar . 
 At the four corners of the wall sit towers ( E ) with intricate roofs boasting 72 ridges , reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings . These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls , and much folklore is attached to them . According to one legend , artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty , and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter @-@ immortal Lu Ban . 
 The wall is pierced by a gate on each side . At the southern end is the main Meridian Gate ( A ) . To the north is the Gate of Divine Might ( B ) , which faces Jingshan Park . The east and west gates are called the " East Glorious Gate " ( D ) and " West Glorious Gate " ( C ) . All gates in the Forbidden City are decorated with a nine @-@ by @-@ nine array of golden door nails , except for the East Glorious Gate , which has only eight rows . 
 The Meridian Gate has two protruding wings forming three sides of a square ( <unk> , or Meridian Gate , Square ) before it . The gate has five gateways . The central gateway is part of the Imperial Way , a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself , and leads all the way from the Gate of China in the south to Jingshan in the north . Only the Emperor may walk or ride on the Imperial Way , except for the Empress on the occasion of her wedding , and successful students after the Imperial Examination . 
 = = = Outer Court or the Southern Section = = = 
 Traditionally , the Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The Outer Court ( <unk> ) or Front Court ( <unk> ) includes the southern sections , and was used for ceremonial purposes . The Inner Court ( <unk> ) or Back Palace ( <unk> ) includes the northern sections , and was the residence of the Emperor and his family , and was used for day @-@ to @-@ day affairs of state . ( The approximate dividing line shown as red dash in the plan above . ) Generally , the Forbidden City has three vertical axes . The most important buildings are situated on the central north – south axis . 
 Entering from the Meridian Gate , one encounters a large square , pierced by the meandering Inner Golden Water River , which is crossed by five bridges . Beyond the square stands the Gate of Supreme Harmony ( F ) . Behind that is the Hall of Supreme Harmony Square . A three @-@ tiered white marble terrace rises from this square . Three halls stand on top of this terrace , the focus of the palace complex . From the south , these are the Hall of Supreme Harmony ( <unk> ) , the Hall of Central Harmony ( <unk> ) , and the Hall of Preserving Harmony ( <unk> ) . 
 The Hall of Supreme Harmony ( G ) is the largest , and rises some 30 metres ( 98 ft ) above the level of the surrounding square . It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power , and the largest surviving wooden structure in China . It is nine bays wide and five bays deep , the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor . Set into the ceiling at the centre of the hall is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon , from the mouth of which issues a chandelier @-@ like set of metal balls , called the " <unk> Mirror " . In the Ming dynasty , the Emperor held court here to discuss affairs of state . During the Qing dynasty , as Emperors held court far more frequently , a less ceremonious location was used instead , and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes , such as coronations , investitures , and imperial weddings . 
 The Hall of Central Harmony is a smaller , square hall , used by the Emperor to prepare and rest before and during ceremonies . Behind it , the Hall of Preserving Harmony , was used for rehearsing ceremonies , and was also the site of the final stage of the Imperial examination . All three halls feature imperial thrones , the largest and most elaborate one being that in the Hall of Supreme Harmony . 
 At the centre of the ramps leading up to the terraces from the northern and southern sides are ceremonial ramps , part of the Imperial Way , featuring elaborate and symbolic bas @-@ relief carvings . The northern ramp , behind the Hall of Preserving Harmony , is carved from a single piece of stone 16 @.@ 57 metres ( 54 @.@ 4 ft ) long , 3 @.@ 07 metres ( 10 @.@ 1 ft ) wide , and 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) thick . It weighs some 200 tonnes and is the largest such carving in China . The southern ramp , in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony , is even longer , but is made from two stone slabs joined together – the joint was ingeniously hidden using overlapping bas @-@ relief carvings , and was only discovered when weathering widened the gap in the 20th century . 
 In the south west and south east of the Outer Court are the halls of Military Eminence ( H ) and Literary Glory ( J ) . The former was used at various times for the Emperor to receive ministers and hold court , and later housed the Palace 's own printing house . The latter was used for ceremonial lectures by highly regarded Confucian scholars , and later became the office of the Grand Secretariat . A copy of the Siku <unk> was stored there . To the north @-@ east are the Southern Three Places ( <unk> ) ( K ) , which was the residence of the Crown Prince . 
 = = = Inner Court or the Northern Section = = = 
 The Inner Court is separated from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying orthogonal to the City 's main axis . It was the home of the Emperor and his family . In the Qing dynasty , the Emperor lived and worked almost exclusively in the Inner Court , with the Outer Court used only for ceremonial purposes . 
 At the centre of the Inner Court is another set of three halls ( L ) . From the south , these are the Palace of Heavenly Purity ( <unk> ) , Hall of Union , and the Palace of Earthly Tranquility . Smaller than the Outer Court halls , the three halls of the Inner Court were the official residences of the Emperor and the Empress . The Emperor , representing Yang and the Heavens , would occupy the Palace of Heavenly Purity . The Empress , representing Yin and the Earth , would occupy the Palace of Earthly Tranquility . In between them was the Hall of Union , where the Yin and Yang mixed to produce harmony . 
 The Palace of Heavenly Purity is a double @-@ eaved building , and set on a single @-@ level white marble platform . It is connected to the Gate of Heavenly Purity to its south by a raised walkway . In the Ming dynasty , it was the residence of the Emperor . However , beginning from the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty , the Emperor lived instead at the smaller Hall of Mental Cultivation ( N ) to the west , out of respect to the memory of the Kangxi Emperor . The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor 's audience hall . A caisson is set into the roof , featuring a coiled dragon . Above the throne hangs a tablet reading " Justice and Honour " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) . 
 The Palace of Earthly Tranquility ( <unk> ) is a double @-@ eaved building , 9 bays wide and 3 bays deep . In the Ming dynasty , it was the residence of the Empress . In the Qing dynasty , large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers . From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor , the Empress moved out of the Palace . However , two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor 's wedding night . 
 Between these two palaces is the Hall of Union , which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof . Stored here are the 25 Imperial Seals of the Qing dynasty , as well as other ceremonial items . 
 Behind these three halls lies the Imperial Garden ( M ) . Relatively small , and compact in design , the garden nevertheless contains several elaborate landscaping features . To the north of the garden is the Gate of Divine Might . 
 Directly to the west is the Hall of Mental Cultivation ( N ) . Originally a minor palace , this became the de facto residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng . In the last decades of the Qing dynasty , empresses dowager , including Cixi , held court from the eastern partition of the hall . Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are the offices of the Grand Council and other key government bodies . 
 The north @-@ eastern section of the Inner Court is taken up by the Palace of Tranquil Longevity ( <unk> ) ( O ) , a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement . It mirrors the set @-@ up of the Forbidden City proper and features an " outer court " , an " inner court " , and gardens and temples . The entrance to the Palace of Tranquil Longevity is marked by a glazed @-@ tile Nine Dragons Screen . This section of the Forbidden City is being restored in a partnership between the Palace Museum and the World Monuments Fund , a long @-@ term project expected to finish in 2017 . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Religion was an important part of life for the imperial court . In the Qing dynasty , the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony . At the same time , the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties . There were two Taoist shrines , one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court . 
 Another prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism . A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court , including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism . Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings . Of these , the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important . It housed a large number of Buddhist statues , icons , and mandalas , placed in ritualistic arrangements . 
 = = = Surroundings = = = 
 The Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens . To the north is Jingshan Park , also known as Prospect Hill , an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes . 
 To the west lies Zhongnanhai , a former royal garden centred on two connected lakes , which now serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People 's Republic of China . To the north @-@ west lies Beihai Park , also centred on a lake connected to the southern two , and a popular royal park . 
 To the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines – the Imperial Shrine of Family or the Imperial Ancestral Temple ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) and the Imperial Shrine of State ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation , respectively . Today , these are the Beijing Labouring People 's Cultural Hall and Zhongshan Park ( commemorating Sun Yat @-@ sen ) respectively . 
 To the south , two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis . They are the Upright Gate ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) and the more famous Tiananmen Gate , which is decorated with a portrait of Mao Zedong in the centre and two placards to the left and right : " Long Live the People 's Republic of China " and " Long live the Great Unity of the World 's Peoples " . The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern , symbolic centre of the Chinese state , Tiananmen Square . 
 While development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City , throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City . Since 2000 , the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings , and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall . In 2004 , an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City . In 2005 , the Imperial City and Beihai ( as an extension item to the Summer Palace ) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing . 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 The design of the Forbidden City , from its overall layout to the smallest detail , was meticulously planned to reflect philosophical and religious principles , and above all to symbolise the majesty of Imperial power . Some noted examples of symbolic designs include : 
 Yellow is the color of the Emperor . Thus almost all roofs in the Forbidden City bear yellow glazed tiles . There are only two exceptions . The library at the Pavilion of Literary <unk> ( <unk> ) had black tiles because black was associated with water , and thus fire @-@ prevention . Similarly , the Crown Prince 's residences have green tiles because green was associated with wood , and thus growth . 
 The main halls of the Outer and Inner courts are all arranged in groups of three – the shape of the Qian <unk> , representing Heaven . The residences of the Inner Court on the other hand are arranged in groups of six – the shape of the Kun <unk> , representing the Earth . 
 The sloping ridges of building roofs are decorated with a line of statuettes led by a man riding a phoenix and followed by an imperial dragon . The number of statuettes represents the status of the building – a minor building might have 3 or 5 . The Hall of Supreme Harmony has 10 , the only building in the country to be permitted this in Imperial times . As a result , its 10th statuette , called a " <unk> " , or " ranked tenth " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , is also unique in the Forbidden City . 
 The layout of buildings follows ancient customs laid down in the Classic of Rites . Thus , ancestral temples are in front of the palace . Storage areas are placed in the front part of the palace complex , and residences in the back . 
 = = Collections = = 
 The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection . According to the results of a 1925 audit , some 1 @.@ 17 million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City . In addition , the imperial libraries housed a large collection of rare books and historical documents , including government documents of the Ming and Qing dynasties . 
 From 1933 , the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum 's collection . After the end of World War II , this collection was returned to Nanjing . However , with the Communists ' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War , the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan . Of the 13 @,@ 491 boxes of evacuated artifacts , 2 @,@ 972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei . More than 8 @,@ 000 boxes were returned to Beijing , but 2 @,@ 221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum . 
 After 1949 , the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City , uncovering a number of important items . In addition , the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum 's collection . It also purchased and received donations from the public . 
 Today , there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum , including paintings , ceramics , seals , steles , sculptures , inscribed wares , bronze wares , enamel objects , etc . According to an inventory of the Museum 's collection conducted between 2004 and 2010 , the Palace Museum holds a total of 1 @,@ 807 @,@ 558 artifacts and includes 1 @,@ 684 @,@ 490 items designated as nationally protected " valuable cultural relics . " 
 Ceramics 
 The Palace Museum holds 340 @,@ 000 pieces of ceramics and porcelain . These include imperial collections from the Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty , as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace , and , sometimes , by the Emperor personally . The Palace Museum holds about 320 @,@ 000 pieces of porcelain from the imperial collection . The rest are almost all held in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum . 
 Painting 
 The Palace Museum holds close to 50 @,@ 000 paintings . Of these , more than 400 date from before the Yuan dynasty ( 1271 – 1368 ) . This is the largest such collection in China . The collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties . The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history . However , a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years . After his abdication , Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace , and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed . In 1948 , many of the works were moved to Taiwan . The collection has subsequently been replenished , through donations , purchases , and transfers from other museums . 
 <unk> 
 The Palace Museum 's bronze collection dates from the early Shang dynasty . Of the almost 10 @,@ 000 pieces held , about 1 @,@ 600 are inscribed items from the pre @-@ Qin period ( to 221 BC ) . A significant part of the collection is ceremonial <unk> from the imperial court . 
 <unk> 
 The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world , with more than 1 @,@ 000 pieces . The collection contains both <unk> and foreign @-@ made pieces . Chinese pieces came from the palace 's own workshops , Guangzhou ( Canton ) and Suzhou ( <unk> ) . Foreign pieces came from countries including Britain , France , Switzerland , the United States and Japan . Of these , the largest portion come from Britain . 
 Jade 
 Jade has a unique place in Chinese culture . The Museum 's collection , mostly derived from the imperial collection , includes some 30 @,@ 000 pieces . The pre @-@ Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history , as well as artifacts from more recent archaeological discoveries . The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period . Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty pieces , on the other hand , include both items for palace use , as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond . 
 Palace artifacts 
 In addition to works of art , a large proportion of the Museum 's collection consists of the artefacts of the imperial court . This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life , as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration . This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era .

 The Forbidden City , the culmination of the two @-@ thousand @-@ year development of classical Chinese and East Asian architecture , has been influential in the subsequent development of Chinese architecture , as well as providing inspiration for many artistic works . Some specific examples include : 
 Depiction in art , film , literature and popular culture 
 The Forbidden City has served as the scene to many works of fiction . In recent years , it has been depicted in films and television series . Some notable examples include : 
 The Forbidden City ( 1918 ) , a fiction film about a Chinese emperor and an American . 
 The Last Emperor ( 1987 ) , a biographical film about Puyi , was the first feature film ever authorised by the government of the People 's Republic of China to be filmed in the Forbidden City . 
 Marco Polo a joint NBC and RAI TV miniseries broadcast in the early 1980s , was filmed inside the Forbidden City . Note , however , that the present Forbidden City did not exist in the Yuan dynasty , when Marco Polo met Kublai Khan . 
 = = Live Performance concert venue = = 
 The Forbidden City has also served as a performance venue . However , its use for this purpose is strictly limited , due to the heavy impact of equipment and performance on the ancient structures . Almost all performances said to be " in the Forbidden City " are held outside the palace walls . 
 Giacomo Puccini 's opera , Turandot , the story of a Chinese princess , was performed at the Imperial Shrine just outside the Forbidden City for the first time in 1998 . 
 In 1997 , Greek @-@ born composer and keyboardist Yanni performed a live concert in front of the Forbidden City . The concert was recorded and later released as part of the Tribute album . 
 In 2001 , the Three Tenors , Plácido Domingo and José Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti sang in front of Forbidden City main gate as one of their performances . 
 In 2004 , the French musician Jean Michel Jarre performed a live concert in front of the Forbidden City , accompanied by 260 musicians , as part of the " Year of France in China " festivities .

The second tropical cyclone of the 2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season , it formed as a depression on May 16 in the central Bay of Bengal . With low wind shear and a surge in the monsoon trough , the storm intensified while meandering over open waters . The storm eventually began a steady northeastward motion due to a ridge to the north over India . While approaching land , an eye developed in the center of the storm , indicative of a strong cyclone . On May 19 , the cyclone made landfall along northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe , with maximum sustained winds estimated at 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) by the India Meteorological Department . The storm rapidly weakened over land , although its remnants spread rainfall into northern Thailand and Yunnan province in China . 
 Winds from the cyclone reached 157 km / h ( 98 mph ) in Myanmar , occurring in conjunction with heavy rainfall and a high storm surge . Despite the storm 's ferocity , the government did not report about the cyclone for ten days , as they usually under @-@ report on landfalling storms . The cyclone caused heavy damage throughout Rakhine State , destroying or heavily damaging 4 @,@ 035 homes and leaving 25 @,@ 000 people homeless . There was widespread crop damage , resulting in food shortages , and damaged roads disrupted subsequent relief efforts . Damage in Myanmar totaled over <unk> million kyat ( $ 99 @.@ 2 million USD ) , making it the worst storm in the country since 1968 , and there were 236 deaths , with an unofficial death toll as high as 1 @,@ 000 . Although damage was heaviest in Myanmar , the cyclone 's effects also spread into neighboring Bangladesh , where strong winds knocked over trees and capsized two ships .

 Late on May 14 , an area of convection , or thunderstorms , developed in the central Bay of Bengal about 880 kilometres ( 545 miles ) south @-@ southeast of Kolkata , India , associated with the monsoon trough . On May 15 , the system developed into a low pressure area off the west coast of Myanmar ( Burma ) . Initially , the convection was associated with a low @-@ level circulation center , developing good outflow despite the presence of wind shear . As the shear decreased , the thunderstorms increased and organized , with the eastward @-@ moving circulation partially exposed . At 09 : 00 UTC on May 16 , the India Meteorological Department classified the system as a depression , and nine hours later the agency upgraded it to a deep depression as the system turned northwestward . 
 The nascent system quickly organized , aided by the decreasing wind shear , as well as a surge in the monsoon . The IMD upgraded the depression to a cyclonic storm at 03 : 00 UTC on May 17 . At 12 : 00 UTC that day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began issuing warnings on the system with its own designation Tropical Cyclone 02B . With weak steering currents , the storm meandered over the central Bay of Bengal , executing a small cyclonic loop over 30 hours . The cloud pattern organized into a central dense overcast that was initially irregular in nature . However , the storm quickly intensified on May 18 , strengthening into a severe cyclonic storm and later very severe cyclonic storm . During this time , the cyclone turned eastward under the influence of a ridge over India to the north . 
 A buoy near the storm 's center recorded a pressure of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) on May 18 , the lowest recorded pressure in association with the storm . Convection increased around the center and organized into a distinct eye . The JTWC upgraded the cyclone to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane at 00 : 00 UTC on May 19 , estimating peak 1 minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The IMD assessed a much higher intensity , estimating peak 3 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) at 03 : 00 UTC that day . About an hour later , the cyclone made landfall at peak intensity with an estimated pressure of 952 mbar ( 28 @.@ 1 inHg ) in northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe , near the country 's border with Bangladesh . It weakened gradually over land , dissipating over Myanmar late on May 19 .

 While stalling in the Bay of Bengal , the cyclone 's outskirts dropped light to moderate rainfall along the eastern coast of India . In Odisha , two locations reported daily rainfall totals of 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) . Upon making landfall , the cyclone 's effects spread into southeastern Bangladesh , where heavy rainfall and high winds forced about 50 @,@ 000 people to evacuate to shelters . The winds also knocked down trees and power lines . Two boats sank off Cox 's Bazar , leaving five fishermen missing . Later , the remnants of the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall in northern Thailand , reaching 112 @.@ 4 mm ( 4 @.@ 43 in ) in 24 hours at the Bhumibol Dam . In the nearby Yunnan province in China , precipitation reached 75 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 97 in ) in <unk> .

 Damage was heaviest in Myanmar where the storm moved ashore , and winds of 157 km / h ( 98 mph ) were reported . Widespread areas reported winds of 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) . The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated that up to 500 mm ( 20 in ) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh . There were reports of waves 15 m ( 50 ft ) in height along the coast . A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in Rakhine State , causing damage to water systems . Flooding was visible on satellite imagery in the days following the cyclone . Eight townships in the state were affected , five of them severely . 
 For 10 days , Myanmar 's government did not report about the cyclone , which usually under @-@ reports on storms that affect the country . There was also little to no advanced warning of the storm . The storm destroyed over 2 @,@ 650 homes and severely damaged another 1 @,@ 385 , leaving around 25 @,@ 000 people homeless , mostly in Pauktaw . Four hospitals in the region were heavily damaged , including the one in Sittwe that was unable to continue normal operations . About 300 schools were damaged or destroyed , including 44 in Sittwe . The storm also damaged or destroyed 133 religious buildings and 176 government buildings . Across the region , high winds knocked down telephone lines and disrupted power supply . About 2 @,@ 000 cattle were killed , and many rice mills were knocked down , causing a 70 % increase of food prices . Transportation was disrupted after roads were washed away , which contributed to food shortages , while damaged wells caused water shortages . During the storm , 84 ships were lost at sea , in addition to a lost ocean liner , while the main harbor at Sittwe was damaged , along with several fishing piers . 
 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs considered the cyclone as the worst to hit Myanmar since 1968 . Damage totaled over <unk> million kyat ( $ 99 @.@ 2 million USD ) . Officially , there were 236 deaths in the country , although there were unconfirmed reports of a death toll as high as 1 @,@ 000 . In the city of Myebon alone , there were 139 deaths . Most of the deaths were fishermen from Rakhine State caught at sea . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On May 27 , the Myanmar government issued a rare appeal for aid to the international community in response to damage from the storm . The request included $ 220 @,@ 000 ( USD ) worth of rice , tarpaulin sheets for temporary shelter , medicine , and clothing , to assist 14 @,@ 000 people . In early June , the government issued an updated appeal to request $ 337 @,@ 000 ( USD ) to help 25 @,@ 000 people , after the scope of the disaster became better known . The Red Cross operation responding to the cyclone ended in December 2004 , which marked the first time the agency had a major response to a disaster . It worked in conjunction with the World Food Programme , Bridge Asia Japan , and the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association , utilizing some private donations . Red Cross volunteers helped clear roads and clean ponds to return areas to normalcy . Typically , the government handles relief measures . 
 In the days following the storm , Myanmar 's Ministry of Social Welfare , Relief and Resettlement assessed damage in the affected areas to determine needs , and also coordinated relief efforts . The local Red Cross chapter went to the worst affected villages with water , water purification tablets , blankets , and mosquito nets . Many of the affected families were unable to afford rebuilding their homes . Myanmar 's National Disaster Relief Committee distributed 500 tons of concrete and 50 @,@ 000 roofing sheets to help rebuild homes . By June 8 , all displaced residents were either staying with relatives or returned to their homes , with the reconstruction or resettlement process expected to take up to nine months . Myanmar 's then @-@ Prime Minister Khin Nyunt surveyed the damaged areas and held a ceremony on June 7 in Sittwe , where domestic donations were transferred to the government in " the spirit of national consolidation " . The Prime Minister stated that the country rarely experiences devastating cyclones due to their strong religious beliefs . A group of 35 Rohingya people from Yangon took a tour of Rakhine State after the storm , despite they are usually banned from the region . The group donated about $ 267 @,@ 000 ( USD ) , although due to their minority status in the country , the aid did not help other <unk> in the state , who also did not receive assistance from the government . 
 In response to the aid request , various United Nations agencies sent $ 175 @,@ 000 ( USD ) worth of financial or material assistance to the country . The World Food Programme provided 50 kg ( 110 lb ) of rice to 3 @,@ 700 families for three months , and UNICEF provided medicines , corrugated sheeting , and latrine slabs . The government of Japan donated about ¥ 10 million worth of supplies , including blankets and water . The Chinese Red Cross donated about $ 20 @,@ 000 ( USD ) worth of relief . Eight other governments and Red Cross chapters donated <unk> francs worth of aid or supplies . 
 = Eduardo Duhalde = 
 Eduardo Alberto Duhalde ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; born October 5 , 1941 ) is an Argentine politician who served as President of Argentina from 2002 to 2003 . Born in Lomas de Zamora , he was elected for the local legislature and appointed mayor in 1973 . He was deposed during the 1976 Argentine coup d 'état , and elected again when democracy was restored in 1983 . He was elected vice @-@ president of Argentina in 1989 , under President Carlos Menem . 
 Duhalde resigned as vice president and was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991 , and re @-@ elected in 1995 . He ran for president in 1999 , being defeated by Fernando de la Rúa . De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots , and Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president . When Rodríguez Saá also resigned , Congress appointed Duhalde . During Duhalde 's term in office , a huge currency devaluation and an increase of the exchange rate led to a gradual recovery . He successfully supported the obscure candidate Néstor Kirchner against Menem , who sought a new presidential term . Duhalde had political disputes with Kirchner in later years , and is largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 presidential elections . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Eduardo Alberto Duhalde was born in Lomas de Zamora , in the Greater Buenos Aires . He graduated as a lawyer in 1970 . He was elected to the city legislature the next year , and presided over it . He joined the Justicialist Party ( PJ ) , and soon became leader of its local branch . He was elected to the local legislature of Lomas de Zamora , and appointed its president . The legislature impeached the mayor Ricardo Ortiz , as well as Pedro Turner , who was appointed mayor afterwards . This was part of a political reorganization promoted by President Juan Perón . Duhalde was appointed mayor in 1973 as a result . Many members of the Peronist Youth were killed in Lomas de Zamora during the Pasco massacre , which Duhalde blamed on the Argentine <unk> Alliance . He was ousted from office during the 1976 Argentine coup d 'état . He worked as a real estate broker during the following years . 
 Democratic rule was restored in 1983 , and Duhalde ran for mayor of Lomas de Zamora . Being a centrist , the PJ appointed him candidate as a compromise between the internal opposing factions . The elections ended in a technical tie with the candidate of the Radical Civic Union ( UCR ) , Horacio Devoy ; Duhalde won by just 700 votes . There was a tie in the elections for the local legislature as well , as both the PJ and UCR got eleven legislators . Duhalde reported that a colonel sought his support for a possible coup against the newly elected president Raúl Alfonsín . Duhalde refused and reported directly to Alfonsín himself . He was elected national deputy in 1987 , and became vice president of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies . He established a commission to fight drug addiction during his term of office . 
 = = Vice presidency and governorship = = 
 The PJ held primary elections for the 1989 presidential elections between Carlos Menem , governor of La Rioja , and Antonio Cafiero , governor of the Buenos Aires Province . Menem won these elections , with Duhalde as candidate for the vice presidency under his ticket , and then won the general elections . Duhalde did not like the legislative work , and preferred to work with the actual administration of a district . Menem suggested that he run for governor of the populous Buenos Aires Province , which Duhalde accepted on the condition of a great budget aid to the province . This proposal was supported in Congress by Alfonsín , which led to a steady alliance between both politicians . Duhalde was elected governor , ending the political influence of Cafiero . 
 Duhalde intended to run for the presidency in 1995 , after Menem 's term in office . Menem promoted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution , which allowed him to run for a second presidential term . Unable to defeat Menem in the primary elections , Duhalde promoted an amendment of the provincial constitution , to allow reelection as well . The PJ could not secure the majority of the constituent chamber , and the three opposing parties ( the UCR , the Broad Front and the <unk> ) joined forces in a " triple alliance " to prevent the sanction of the re @-@ election . Eventually , the <unk> changed sides and supported the re @-@ election , on the condition that a provincial referendum approved it . The referendum allowed the re @-@ election of Duhalde , who won the main elections as well . Menem was also re @-@ elected in the 1995 general elections . Duhalde increased his criticism of Menem , stating that he should leave the neoliberal policies and head a government closer to the Peronist doctrines . 
 As the new constitution allowed re @-@ election a single time , the PJ started an internal discussion over the leadership of the party after the presidency of Menem . Duhalde announced his intentions to run for president in 1999 shortly after the 1995 elections , leading to a fierce dispute with Menem . The president promoted an advertisement campaign " Menem ' 99 " , despite of the term limit , to avoid being considered a lame duck . He also encouraged the governor of Tucumán , <unk> Ortega , to run for the presidency as well . The political image of Duhalde was tarnished by a number of scandals that took place , and issues revealed by investigative journalists . Some of the scandals were related to the national government , such as the scandal over Argentine arms sales to Ecuador and Croatia , and harmed the reputation of the entire PJ . Other scandals involved Duhalde more directly , such as the corruption cases in the Buenos Aires provincial police and the murder of the news photographer José Luis Cabezas . The PJ lost the 1997 midterm elections , and Menem renewed the " Menem ' 99 " campaign . Eventually , the Supreme Court ruled that his attempt to run for another presidential term was unconstitutional . Ortega run for vice president under Duhalde 's ticket , but Duhalde was defeated by the radical Fernando de la Rúa . 
 De la Rúa 's government would face an economic crisis and the 2001 riots , resigning two years later . De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d 'état against him Rodolfo Terragno , De la Rúa 's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers , thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso @-@ dollar parity despite the costs generated by it . Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by <unk> <unk> for the book Doce <unk> said that the party had no interest in removing De la Rúa from power , because he was so unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem . 
 = = Presidency = = 
 = = = Appointment = = = 
 De la Rúa headed the country during an economic crisis , and resigned during the December 2001 riots . As his vice president had already resigned months before , Congress was convened to appoint a new president . Eleven provinces with low populations and Peronist governors had formed a bloc , the " Federal Front " , and received the required votes to appoint the governor of San Luis Province , Adolfo Rodríguez Saá . The first administrative actions of Rodríguez Saá caused renewed protests , and the PJ did not fully support him . He called for a meeting with governors in <unk> , but only six governors out of twenty @-@ three attended . He resigned a few days later , and accused Duhalde of plotting against him , along with the governor of Córdoba , José Manuel de la Sota . 
 The Congress was convened again to appoint a new president . The " Federal Front " was weakened by the failure of Rodríguez Saá , and the provinces with higher populations increased their influence . The likely candidates were Duhalde , De la Sota , and Carlos Ruckauf , the governor of the Buenos Aires province at the time . Menem , who still had legislators loyal to him , wanted to prevent Duhalde from becoming president , and proposed to appoint the governor of Misiones Ramón Puerta instead . Puerta had been the acting president while Congress deliberated the first time , but he refused to be appointed president or even to serve as acting president a second time ( Eduardo Camaño became the acting president as a result ) . Puerta talked with Duhalde , and opined that without De la Rúa and Álvarez he was the politician with the highest legitimacy to be appointed president , as he had placed second in the 1999 elections and won the 2001 legislative elections in the Buenos Aires province , the district of Argentina with the largest population . Alfonsín gave Duhalde decisive support , instructing the radical legislators to vote for him , and giving him two ministers , the radicals Horacio <unk> and Jorge <unk> . The legislators loyal to Menem eventually voted for Duhalde as well . The radicals ' support allowed Duhalde to govern for the remainder of De la Rúa 's term of office , instead of governing for 90 days and calling for new elections , as was the case of Rodríguez Saá . Duhalde was appointed president on January 2 , 2002 . 
 = = = Economic policy = = = 
 Duhalde , Alfonsín , their parties , the unions and the Church all agreed to promote policies to increase the industrial growth of the country . For this purpose , Duhalde created the ministry of production , with functions that used to belong to the ministries of economy and foreign relations . The new minister was José Ignacio de <unk> , head of the Argentine Industrial Union . Alfonsín negotiated with him , on Duhalde 's behalf , while Congress was still voting for the new president . Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan , considered the main cause of the economic crisis . Although Menem proposed a full <unk> of the Argentine economy , Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation . Although it was initially expected to make a 40 % devaluation , the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar , a 200 % devaluation . The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports , increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates , but at the cost of a higher cost of living . 
 The financial operations made in dollars were subject to a strong currency substitution to pesos , the " <unk> " . There were disputes over the exchange rate of such substitution , as the current price of the dollar in the open market would force most firms and individual debtor to bankruptcy . The initial policy was to make 1 to 1 substitutions to the operations below 100 @,@ 000 dollars . Another conflict was the <unk> , imposed by De la Rúa , which attempted to stop the bank run by forbidding the withdrawal of money from bank accounts . Duhalde promised in his oath of office speech that " The one who deposited dollars will receive dollars " . The minister of economy Jorge Remes Lenicov pointed out that that would be impossible , as the amount of dollars required was higher than even the foreign @-@ exchange reserves of the Central Bank . Duhalde acknowledged two weeks later that he was mistaken . The bank accounts in dollars would be " <unk> " at a 1 @.@ 4 exchange rate , and the state financed the banks for the different rates with other operations . The taxes of public services were " <unk> " and fixed at their current values . Most industries benefited from the " <unk> " and the devaluation , as they could now export at higher prices , and the economy started to improve . The jump in the international price of soybean in July 2002 also proved highly beneficial . The devaluation also increased the price of imported products , which allowed import substitution industrialization . As the local prices became cheap in dollars , international tourism to the country was increased . The national state absorbed the debts of the provinces and the bonds used as alternative currency , on the condition that they transferred the power to issue bonds . 
 Jorge Remes Lenicov resigned in April , alongside ministers De <unk> and <unk> . Peronist governors , legislators , and union leaders met at the Quinta de Olivos , amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint the populist Daniel <unk> as minister of economy . They gave their full support to the president and the economic policies instrumented so far . As a result , Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna . Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union , and switched offices with Remes Lenicov . He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín . He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies , and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation . The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy . 
 = = = Domestic policy = = = 
 On the political level , Duhalde 's presidency was strongly influenced by his feud with Menem . Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election , and Duhalde wanted to prevent it . To this purpose , he sought other candidates that may have defeated him . Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann , José Manuel de la Sota , Mauricio Macri , Adolfo Rodríguez Saá , Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna , but none of those negotiations bore fruit . The scandal over the death of the piqueteros Maximiliano <unk> and Manuel <unk> in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months . As a result , he chose Néstor Kirchner , governor of Santa Cruz Province , despite his reservations . Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls , and was mostly unknown by the public . Duhalde speculated that , although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with , he was also very unpopular . Thus , Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage , most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him . 
 To harm Menem 's chances even further , the 2003 election used a variant of the Ley de <unk> for a single time . This way , the Peronists Menem , Kirchner and Rodríguez Saá did not run for primary elections , but faced each other directly in the open election . None of the three candidates ran on the Justicialist Party ticket , but for special parties created for the occasion : Menem for the " Front for Loyalty " , Kirchner for the " Front for Victory " and Rodríguez Saá ( who run for president anyway , but as a critic of Duhalde ) for the " Front of the National and Popular Movement " . It was also announced that Lavagna would stay as minister of Economy during a presidency of Kirchner , to capitalize the support for the ongoing economic policies . Menem defeated Kirchner in the elections , benefited by the lack of popular candidates , but gave up running for a ballotage , fearing that he would lose this special election . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 Duhalde was appointed president in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks , when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror . Initially , the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US . One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade , as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis . The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations . Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options , and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina . 
 Argentina voted in the United Nations condemning the human rights violations in Cuba , but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq . Still , Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops , and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism . Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during the final years of his government , and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention . Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections . Menem , who was running for a third term as president , supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States . 
 The devaluation caused a diplomatic conflict with Spain , as Duhalde did not allow the Spanish service providers to raise taxes . So far , they received their income according to the dollar exchange rate , and intended to raise taxes to compensate their losses . The Argentine government considered that the effects of the crisis were already grave enough for the people , and further price increases would only worsen the situation . José María Aznar , prime minister of Spain , talked with Duhalde on behalf of the Spanish firms . The taxes were not raised , but Aznar stayed on good terms with Duhalde , and ratified the good relations with the country regardless of the victor of the 2003 elections . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Duhalde was succeeded by Néstor Kirchner on May 25 , 2003 . Kirchner soon distanced himself from Duhalde , and removed all the people close to Duhalde from the government to reduce his political influence . Kirchner also sought supporters from all the social and political spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party . However , both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections , held in October . The dispute continued in the 2005 midterm elections . Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province , both leaders had their respective wives run for the office : Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ , and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory , which was kept by the Kirchners . Cristina Kirchner won those elections . 
 On December 23 , 2009 , Duhalde announced his intention to run for the presidency in the 2011 presidential elections . Néstor Kirchner had been succeeded by Cristina Kirchner in the presidency , staying as a highly influential figure , and it was still unclear which of the Kirchners would run in 2011 . Many mayors of the Buenos Aires province were unsure whether to support Duhalde or the Kirchners . Duhalde organized the Federal Peronism faction , with members of the PJ opposing the Kirchners . Néstor Kirchner died in October 2010 ; the subsequent state funeral halted the campaign for a few months . 
 The Federal Peronism organized primary elections for the 2011 presidential elections between Duhalde and governor Alberto Rodríguez Saá , which would be held before the mandatory primary elections . Governors Felipe Solá and Mario Das Neves withdrew their candidacies . Duhalde withdrew his candidacy near the end of the primary elections . As the sole candidate , Rodríguez Saá ran for Federal Peronism , which allied with other provincial parties into the Federal Commitment coalition . Duhalde ran for president as well , on the Unión Popular ticket . He received nearly 6 % of the vote in the main elections , a large difference from the number of votes cast for the main candidates , and Hilda Duhalde was not reelected as senator . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Duhalde worked as a pool lifeguard before embarking on his political career . He met Hilda González at the pool in 1970 and they married the following year . They have five sons and seven grandsons . They live in a country house in San Vicente , Buenos Aires , named " Don Tomás " after Duhalde 's father . The house had been donated for the creation of a foster care center which was never built , and was reclaimed by Duhalde . The rebuilt site includes a large grove , a pool , a tennis field , and an artificial lake . 
 Duhalde has largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 elections . He sought to make amends with Menem for their past political rivalry , and met him during the 2013 Papal inauguration of Pope Francis . They had a private meeting at Menem 's house , and Menem reported that they were on peaceful terms . They had previously met in similar circumstances in 2005 , during the funeral of Pope John Paul II . 
 = Lysurus periphragmoides = 
 Lysurus periphragmoides , commonly known as the stalked lattice stinkhorn or chambered stinkhorn , is a species of fungus in the stinkhorn family . It was originally described as Simblum periphragmoides in 1831 , and has been known as many different names before being transferred to Lysurus in 1980 . The saprobic fungus has a pantropical distribution , and has been found in Africa , Asia , Australasia , and the Americas , where it grows on fertile ground and on mulch . The fruit body , which can extend up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) tall , consists of a reddish latticed head ( a receptaculum ) placed on top of a long stalk . A dark olive @-@ green spore mass , the gleba , fills the interior of the lattice and extends outwards between the arms . Like other members of the Phallaceae family , the gleba has a fetid odor that attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores . The immature " egg " form of the fungus is considered edible . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The basionym for this species is Simblum periphragmoides , first described by German mycologist Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1831 , based on specimens collected in Bois <unk> in Mauritius . Klotzsch designated it as the type species of Simblum , a genus differentiated from the similar genus Lysurus by having the fruit body ending in a spherical , chambered head , with gleba developing within the depressions of the chambers . Lysurus periphragmoides is a morphologically variable species ; as a result , it has acquired an extensive number of synonyms , as various authors have decided that the different forms warranted being designated as new species . Donald Malcolm Dring 's 1980 monograph on the <unk> ( a family that has since been subsumed into the Phallaceae ) transferred the taxon to Lysurus , explaining " a distinction between " Simblum " and Lysurus in the original restricted sense cannot be easily maintained because there are examples of intermediates states " , and he lumped 18 synonyms under L. periphragmoides . 
 In one noted example of an author being too eager to assign a new name , in 1902 George Francis Atkinson described a specimen he found in Texas , otherwise similar to Simblum but with a loose net drooping from the head ; he initiated the new genus <unk> to include his " new " species D. texense . The species was , according to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd , merely a decomposing or insect @-@ damaged specimen of L. periphragmoides that had been preserved in alcohol . Lloyd criticized Atkinson 's poor judgment in his self @-@ published journal Mycological Notes , and later , humiliated him under the pen name N.J. McGinty . William H. Long later ( 1907 ) transferred Atkinson 's taxon to the genus Simblum , claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from L. periphragmoides ( then known as Simblum sphaerocephalum ) ; however , according to Dring , D. texense should also be considered a synonym of L. periphragmoides . Despite Dring 's renaming , and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus Simblum into Lysurus , the species is still occasionally referred to Simblum sphaerocephalum . 
 The specific epithet periphragmoides means " fenced in all around " , and refers to the latticed structure of the cap . The fungus is commonly known as the " stalked lattice stinkhorn " or " chambered stinkhorn " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Immature fruiting bodies of L. periphragmoides start as round or oval " eggs " that may be up to 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter . On the underside of the egg are whitish rhizomorphs that anchor it to the substrate . The peridium is white to buff @-@ colored on the external surface , and has a gelatinous layer inside . An egg cut in half lengthwise reveals internal layers , including a tough white outer peridium , and a thick layer of firm , translucent , gelatinous matter <unk> by strands ( trabeculae ) of denser white tissue . The strands are anastomosing partitions , connecting with the peridium externally and with the bars of the receptaculum within . The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers . 
 The egg eventually ruptures as the stalk expands and breaks through , creating a volva at the base of the stipe . In maturity , the fruit bodies , are up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) tall , with a latticed spherical cap ( the receptaculum ) atop a long yellow or reddish stipe . In general , Old World specimens tend to be yellow , while New World specimens are reddish , although exceptions have been noted in the literature . The receptaculum is typically 1 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter and forms a red or orange lattice , or mesh . There are typically between 20 and 100 small pentagonal to hexagonal meshes in the receptaculum ; the arms of the mesh have sharp ridges on the outer surface , corrugations on the sides , and are flat to weakly ridged on the inner surface . The internal surfaces of the receptaculum are covered with an olive @-@ green spore @-@ bearing gleba , which sometimes seeps through the mesh holes . Like most stinkhorn species , the gleba has a foul odor , comparable to rotten meat , but it is " less @-@ offensive " than most . The smell of fresh , newly exposed gleba has been reported to be sweet , similar to amyl acetate ; the foul odor forming only after it has been exposed to air for some time . The stipe is 5 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) by 0 @.@ 8 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , and is hollow and spongy . The walls of the stipe are made of an inner layer of large tubes and two or three outer layers of small tubes . Specimens may occasionally be found with fused heads on two separate stipes arising from a single volva . 
 A variety with a white fruit body is known , Lysurus periphragmoides var. albidum ( originally described as Simblum texense var. albidum by Long ) . It was reported growing from sandy alkaline soil in semi @-@ arid regions of New Mexico , but has not been reported again since Long 's collections in 1941 . 
 Spores are elliptical or oblong in shape , smooth , inamyloid , and have dimensions of 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 by 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 µm . The use of scanning electron microscopy has revealed that L. periphragmoides ( in addition to several other Phallales species ) has a hilar scar — a small indentation in the surface of the spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma . 
 Like many of the stinkhorns , L. periphragmoides is generally considered only edible when in its immature " egg " form . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Lysurus periphragmoides is morphologically distinct , and unlikely to be confused with any other species . Within the genus Lysurus , L. mokusin has an angular stipe and a receptacle of four to five clasped arms , contoured like the stipe with alternating ribs and furrows . L. cruciatus has a rounder stipe with receptacle arms that are not clasped together at maturity . The receptacle of L. gardneri , found in south @-@ east Asia , India , and Africa , is made of five to seven reddish @-@ brown fingers that are initially pressed together before separating . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 This species is typically found growing solitary or in groups on lawns , mulch , pastures , and open woods . A North American field guide notes an association with apple orchards and cornfields . 
 Lysurus periphragmoides has a pantropical distribution . The fungus has been reported from Africa ( Mauritius , Tanzania ) , Asia ( Jilin Province , China , Sri Lanka , India , Pakistan , Thailand , Indonesia ) , Australasia ( New Guinea ) , North America ( Bahamas , Dominica , Mexico ) and South America ( Argentina , Brazil , and Venezuela ) . The distribution extends north to the Ryukyu Islands in Asia . It is fairly common in South America , but is usually restricts its appearance to periods of wet weather in southern North America . 
 = <unk> shark = 
 The hardnose shark ( Carcharhinus macloti ) is a species of requiem shark , in the family Carcharhinidae , so named because of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout . A small bronze @-@ coloured shark reaching a length of 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) , it has a slender body and a long , pointed snout . Its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated rear tips . The hardnose shark is widely distributed in the western Indo @-@ Pacific , from Kenya to southern China and northern Australia . It inhabits warm , shallow waters close to shore . 
 Common and gregarious , the hardnose shark is a predator of bony fishes , cephalopods , and crustaceans . This species is viviparous , with the growing embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother . Females have a biennial reproductive cycle and bear litters of one or two pups after a twelve @-@ month gestation period . The hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and , given its low reproductive rate , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it as Near Threatened . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The hardnose shark was described by German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen . They named it Carcharias ( Hypoprion ) macloti in honour of Heinrich Christian <unk> , who collected the type specimen from New Guinea . In 1862 , American ichthyologist Theodore Gill elevated Hypoprion to the rank of full genus , with C. macloti as the type species . In 1985 , Jack Garrick synonymised Hypoprion with Carcharhinus . This species may also be called <unk> 's shark . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 The evolutionary relationships of the hardnose shark have not been fully resolved . In a 1988 study based on morphology , Leonard Compagno tentatively grouped the hardnose shark with the Borneo shark ( C. borneensis ) , whitecheek shark ( C. dussumieri ) , Pondicherry shark ( C. hemiodon ) , creek whaler ( C. fitzroyensis ) , smalltail shark ( C. porosus ) , blackspot shark ( C. sealei ) , and spottail shark ( C. sorrah ) . Results from molecular phylogenetic analyses have been inconsistent , with some supporting parts of Compagno 's hypothesis : a 1992 study could not resolve the hardnose shark 's position in detail , a 2011 study reported that it was close to the clade formed by the whitecheek and blackspot sharks , and a 2012 study concluded that it was the sister species of the Borneo shark . 
 Teeth apparently belonging to the hardnose shark have been recovered from the Pungo River and Yorktown Formations in the United States , and from the <unk> Formation in Brazil . The earliest of these fossils date to the Lower Miocene ( 23 – 16 Ma ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The hardnose shark is a slim @-@ bodied species with a long , narrow , and pointed snout . Unlike in other Carcharhinus species , its rostral ( snout ) cartilages are highly calcified , hence the name " hardnose " . The circular eyes are rather large and equipped with protective nictitating membranes . There is a narrow lobe of skin on the anterior rim of each nostril . The arched mouth bears inconspicuous furrows at the corners ; some sources report that the hyomandibular pores ( a series of pores above the corners of the mouth ) are enlarged , while others report that they are not . The upper teeth number 29 – 32 rows and have a narrow , smooth @-@ edged central cusp with very coarse serrations at the base on either side . The lower teeth number 26 – 29 rows and are narrow and smooth @-@ edged . There are five pairs of fairly short gill slits . 
 The pectoral fins are fairly short and pointed , with a falcate ( sickle @-@ like ) shape . The first dorsal fin is medium @-@ sized and triangular , and originates roughly over the pectoral fin free rear tips . The second dorsal fin is small and low , and originates over the middle of the anal fin base . Both dorsal fins have very long free rear tips , and there is a subtle midline ridge between them . A prominent notch is present on the caudal peduncle at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin . The caudal fin has a well @-@ developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip . The skin is covered by overlapping , oval @-@ shaped dermal denticles ; each denticle has three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . This species is bronze above and white below , with a barely noticeable pale band on the flanks . The pectoral , pelvic , and anal fins sometimes have lighter margins , while the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe may have darker margins . The hardnose shark reaches 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) in length . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The hardnose shark is common and widely distributed in the tropical western Indo @-@ Pacific . It is found from Kenya to Myanmar in the Indian Ocean , including Sri Lanka and the Andaman Islands . In the Pacific Ocean , it is found from Vietnam to Taiwan and southern Japan , in Indonesia , and off New Guinea and northern Australia . It is usually found in shallow , inshore waters , but has been reported to a depth of 170 m ( 560 ft ) . Tagging data has shown that this shark tends not to make long @-@ distance movements , with 30 % of re @-@ caught individuals having moved less than 50 km ( 30 mi ) from their initial tagging location . The longest known distance travelled by an individual is 711 km ( 442 mi ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The hardnose shark forms large groups , often associating with spottail sharks and Australian blacktip sharks ( C. tilstoni ) . Males and females generally roam separately from each other . Bony fishes form the main part of this shark 's diet , with cephalopods and crustaceans making up the remainder . Parasites of this species include the nematode <unk> rotundatus and the tapeworm Otobothrium <unk> . The hardnose shark is viviparous ; like in other requiem sharks , once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply , the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother provides nutrition . Females give birth once every other year to one or two pups , following a gestation period of twelve months . Newborns measure 45 – 55 cm ( 18 – 22 in ) long , and sexual maturity is attained at 70 – 75 cm ( 28 – 30 in ) long . The maximum lifespan is at least 15 – 20 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Harmless to humans , the hardnose shark is caught with gillnets and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries across much of its range . It is used for meat , which is sold fresh or dried and salted , though its small size limits its economic importance . Its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing , and given existing levels of exploitation , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed it as Near Threatened . Off northern Australia , the hardnose shark makes up 13 @.@ 6 % of the gillnet catch and 4 @.@ 0 % of the longline catch . Since these losses do not appear to have diminished its population there , the IUCN has given it a regional assessment of Least Concern . 
 = Simon & Garfunkel = 
 Simon & Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo consisting of singer @-@ songwriters Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel . They were one of the most popular recording artists of the 1960s and became counterculture icons of the decade 's social revolution , alongside artists such as the Beatles , the Beach Boys , and Bob Dylan . Their biggest hits — including " The Sound of Silence " ( 1964 ) , " Mrs. Robinson " ( 1968 ) , " Bridge over Troubled Water " ( 1969 ) , and " The Boxer " ( 1969 ) — reached number one on singles charts worldwide . Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements , which resulted in their breakup in 1970 . Their final studio record , Bridge over Troubled Water ( released in January of that year ) , was their most successful , becoming one of the world 's best @-@ selling albums . Since their split in 1970 they have reunited several times , most famously in 1981 for the " The Concert in Central Park " , which attracted more than 500 @,@ 000 people , the seventh @-@ largest concert attendance in history . 
 The duo met as children in Queens , New York in 1953 , where they learned to harmonize together and began writing original material . By 1957 , under the name Tom & Jerry , the teenagers had their first minor success with " Hey Schoolgirl " , a song imitating their idols The Everly Brothers . Afterwards , the duo went their separate ways , with Simon making unsuccessful solo records . In 1963 , aware of a growing public interest in folk music , they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon & Garfunkel . Their début , Wednesday Morning , 3 A.M. , sold poorly , and they once again disbanded ; Simon returned to a solo career , this time in England . In June 1965 , their song " The Sound of Silence " was overdubbed , adding electric guitar and a drumkit to the original 1964 recording . This later version became a major U.S. AM radio hit in 1965 , reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 . Simon & Garfunkel reunited , releasing their second studio album Sounds of Silence and touring colleges nationwide . On their third release , Parsley , Sage , Rosemary and Thyme ( 1966 ) , the duo assumed more creative control . Their music was featured in the 1967 film The Graduate , giving them further exposure . Bookends ( 1968 ) , their next album , topped the Billboard 200 chart and included the number @-@ one single " Mrs. Robinson " from the film . After their 1970 breakup following the release of Bridge over Troubled Water , they both continued recording , Simon releasing a number of highly acclaimed albums , including 1986 's Graceland . Garfunkel also briefly pursued an acting career , with leading roles in two Mike Nichols films , Catch @-@ 22 and Carnal Knowledge , and in Nicolas Roeg 's 1980 Bad Timing , as well as releasing some solo hits such as " All I Know " . 
 Simon & Garfunkel were described by critic Richie Unterberger as " the most successful folk @-@ rock duo of the 1960s " and one of the most popular artists from the decade in general . They won 10 Grammy Awards and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 . Their Bridge over Troubled Water album was nominated at the 1977 Brit Awards for Best International Album and is ranked at number 51 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .

 Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel grew up in the 1940s and 1950s in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hills in Queens , New York , just three blocks away from one another , and attended the same schools , Public School 164 in Flushing , Parsons Junior High School , and Forest Hills High School . Individually , when still young , they developed a fascination with music ; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged , particularly the Everly Brothers . When Simon first noticed Garfunkel , he was singing in a fourth grade talent show , and Simon thought that was a good way to attract girls ; he hoped for a friendship which eventually started in 1953 when they were in the sixth grade and appeared on stage together in a school play adaptation of Alice in Wonderland . That first stage appearance was followed by the duo forming a street @-@ corner doo @-@ wop group , the <unk> , with three other friends , and learning to harmonize together . They began performing for the first time as a duo at school dances . 
 They moved to Forest Hills High School in 1955 , where , in 1956 , they wrote their first song , " The Girl for Me " ; Simon 's father sent a handwritten copy to the Library of Congress to register a copyright . While trying to remember the lyrics to the Everly 's song " Hey Doll Baby " , they created their own song , " Hey Schoolgirl " , which they recorded themselves for $ 25 at Sanders Recording Studio in Manhattan . While recording they were overheard by a promoter , Sid Prosen , who – after speaking to their parents – signed them to his independent label Big Records . 
 = = = From Tom & Jerry to Simon & Garfunkel ( 1957 – 64 ) = = = 
 While still aged 15 , Simon & Garfunkel now had a recording contract with Sid Prosen 's independent label Big Records . Using the name Tom & Jerry ( Garfunkel naming himself Tom Graph , a reference to his interest in mathematics , and Simon naming himself Jerry Landis after the surname of Sue Landis , a girl he had dated ) , the single " Hey Schoolgirl " was released , with the B @-@ side " Dancin ' Wild " , in 1957 . Prosen , using the payola system , bribed Alan Freed $ 200 to get the single played on his radio show , where it became a nightly staple . " Hey Schoolgirl " attracted regular rotation on nationwide AM pop stations , leading it to sell over 100 @,@ 000 copies and to land on Billboard 's charts at number 49 . Prosen promoted the group heavily , getting them a spot on Dick Clark 's American Bandstand ( headlining alongside Jerry Lee Lewis ) . The duo shared approximately $ 4 @,@ 000 from the song – earning two percent each from royalties , the rest staying with Prosen . They released three more singles on Big Records : " Our Song " , " That 's My Story " , and " Don 't Say Goodbye " , none of them successful . 
 After graduating from Forest Hills High School in 1959 , they were still exploring the possibilities of a music career , though continued their education as a back up ; Simon studying English at Queens College , City University of New York , Garfunkel studying first architecture , then switching to art history at Columbia College , Columbia University . While still with Big Records as a duo , Simon released a solo single , " True or False " , under the name " True Taylor " . This recording upset Garfunkel , who regarded it as a betrayal ; the emotional tension from that incident occasionally surfacing throughout their relationship . Their last recording with Big Records was a cover of a Jan and Dean single , " Baby Talk " , but the company became bankrupt soon after release ; the track was reissued on Bell Records , but failed to sell , so Tom & Jerry was dissolved . Both , however , continued recording , albeit as solo artists : Garfunkel composing and recording " Private World " for Octavia Records , and - under the name Artie Garr - " Beat Love " for Warwick ; Simon recorded with The Mystics , and Tico & The Triumphs , and wrote and recorded under the names Jerry Landis and Paul Kane . Simon also wrote and performed demos for other artists , working for a while with Carole King and Gerry Goffin . 
 After graduating in 1963 , Simon joined Garfunkel , who was still at Columbia , to perform together again as a duo , this time with a shared interest in folk music . Simon enrolled part @-@ time in Brooklyn Law School , By late 1963 , billing themselves as " Kane & Garr " , they performed at Gerde 's Folk City , a Greenwich club that hosted Monday night open mic performances . The duo performed three new songs — " Sparrow " , " He Was My Brother " , and " The Sound of Silence " — and got the attention of Columbia producer Tom Wilson , who worked with Bob Dylan . As a " star producer " for the label , he wanted to record " He Was My Brother " with a new British act named the Pilgrims . Simon convinced Wilson to let him and his partner have a studio audition , and they performed " The Sound of Silence " . House engineer Roy Halee recorded the audition , and at Wilson 's urging , Columbia signed the duo . 
 Their debut studio album , Wednesday Morning , 3 A.M. , was recorded over three daytime sessions in March 1964 and released in October . The album contains four original Simon compositions , with the remainder consisting of three traditional folk songs and five folk @-@ influenced singer @-@ songwriter numbers . Simon was adamant that they would no longer use stage names , and they adopted the name Simon & Garfunkel . Columbia set up a promotional showcase at Folk City on March 31 , 1964 , the duo 's first public concert as Simon & Garfunkel . The showcase , as well as other scheduled performances , did not go well . 
 = = = Simon in England ( 1964 – 65 ) = = = 
 Wednesday Morning , 3 A.M. sold only 3 @,@ 000 copies upon its October release , and its poor sales led Simon to move to England where he had previously visited and played some gigs . He toured the small folk clubs , appearing on the same bill and befriending British folk artists such as Bert Jansch , Martin Carthy , Al Stewart , and Sandy Denny . He met Kathy Chitty , who became the object of his affection and is the Kathy in " Kathy 's Song " and " America " . 
 A small music publishing company , Lorna Music , licensed " Carlos Dominguez " , a single Simon had cut two years prior as " Paul Kane " , for a cover by Val <unk> that sold very well . Simon visited Lorna to thank them , and the meeting resulted in a publishing and recording contract . He signed to the Oriole label and released " He Was My Brother " as a single . Simon invited Garfunkel to stay for the summer of 1964 . Near the end of the season , Garfunkel returned to Columbia for class , and Simon surprised his friends by saying that he would be returning to the States as well . He would resume his studies at Brooklyn Law School for one semester , partially at his parents ' insistence . He returned to England in January 1965 , now certain that music was his calling . In the meantime , his landlord , Judith <unk> , had compiled a tape from his work at Lorna and sent it to the BBC in hopes they would play it . The demos aired on the Five to Ten morning show , and were instantly successful . Oriole had folded into CBS by that point , and hoped to record a new Paul Simon album . The Paul Simon Songbook was recorded in June 1965 and featured multiple future Simon & Garfunkel staples , among them " I Am a Rock " and " April Come She Will " . CBS flew Wilson over to produce the record , and he stayed at Simon 's flat . The album saw release in August , and although sales were poor , Simon felt content with his future in England . 
 Meanwhile , in the United States , a late @-@ night disc jockey at WBZ @-@ FM in Boston played " The Sound of Silence " , where it found a college demographic . It was picked up the next day along the East Coast of the United States , down to Cocoa Beach , Florida . Wilson , inspired by the folk rock sound of the Byrds ' cover of " Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! " and Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone " , created a rock remix of the song using studio musicians . The remix of " The Sound of Silence " was issued in September 1965 , where it reached the Billboard Hot 100 . Wilson had not informed the duo of his intention to remix the track ; as such , Simon was " horrified " when he first heard it . Garfunkel graduated in 1965 , returning to Columbia University to do a master 's degree in mathematics . 
 = = = Mainstream breakthrough and success ( 1965 – 66 ) = = = 
 By January 1966 , " The Sound of Silence " topped the Hot 100 , selling over one million copies . Simon reunited with Garfunkel that winter in New York , leaving Chitty and his friends in England behind . CBS demanded a new album from the duo , to be called Sounds of Silence to ride the wave of the hit . Recorded in three weeks , and mainly consisting of re @-@ recorded songs from The Paul Simon Songbook , plus four new tracks , Sounds of Silence was rush @-@ released onto the market in mid @-@ January 1966 , peaking at number 21 Billboard Top LPs chart . A week later , " Homeward Bound " was released as a single , entering the USA top ten , followed by " I Am a Rock " peaking at number three . The duo supported the recordings with a nationwide tour of America , while CBS continued their promotion by re @-@ releasing Wednesday Morning , 3 A.M. , which promptly charted at number 30 . Despite the commercial and popular success , the duo received critical derision , as many considered them a manufactured imitation of folk . 
 As they considered their previous effort a " rush job " to capitalize on their sudden success , the duo spent more time crafting the follow @-@ up . It was the first time Simon insisted on total control in aspects of recording . Work began in 1966 and took nine months . Garfunkel considered the recording of " Scarborough Fair " to be the point at which they stepped into the role of producer , as they were constantly beside engineer Roy Halee mixing the track . Parsley , Sage , Rosemary and Thyme was issued in October 1966 , following the release of several singles and receiving sold @-@ out college campus shows . The duo resumed their trek on the college circuit eleven days following the release , crafting an image that was described as " alienated " , " weird " , and " poetic " . Manager Mort Lewis also was responsible for this public perception , as he withheld them from television appearances ( unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist ) . Simon , then 26 , felt he had finally " made it " into an upper echelon of rock and roll , while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ( " making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to , say , Bobby Darin " , wrote biographer Marc Eliot ) . The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos , a mutual friend through their producer Tom Wilson . 
 During the sessions for Parsley , the duo cut " A Hazy Shade of Winter " ; it was released as a single , peaking at number 13 on the national charts . Similarly , they recorded " At the Zoo " for single release in early 1967 ( it charted lower , at number 16 ) . Simon began work for their next album around this time , noting to a writer at High Fidelity that " I 'm not interested in singles anymore " . He had hit a dry spell in his writing , which led to no Simon & Garfunkel album on the horizon for 1967 . Artists at the time were expected to release two , perhaps three albums each year and the lack of productivity from the duo worried executives at Columbia Records . Amid concerns for Simon 's idleness , Columbia Records chairman Clive Davis arranged for up @-@ and @-@ coming record producer John Simon to kick @-@ start the recording . Simon was distrustful of " suits " at the label ; on one occasion , he and Garfunkel brought a tape recorder into a meeting with Davis , who was giving a " fatherly talk " on speeding up production , in order to laugh at it later . The rare television appearances at this time saw the duo performing on such diverse network broadcasts as the Ed Sullivan , Mike Douglas and Andy Williams shows in 1966 and twice on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1967 . 
 Meanwhile , director Mike Nichols , then filming The Graduate , had become fascinated with the duo 's past two efforts , listening to them nonstop before and after filming . After two weeks of this obsession , he met with Clive Davis to ask for permission to license Simon & Garfunkel music for his film . Davis viewed it as a perfect fit and envisioned a best @-@ selling soundtrack album . Simon was not as immediately receptive , viewing movies akin to " selling out " , creating a damper on his artistic integrity . However , after meeting Nichols and becoming impressed by his wit and the script , he agreed to write at least one or two new songs for the film . Leonard <unk> , a powerful agent at William Morris , negotiated a deal that paid Simon $ 25 @,@ 000 to submit three songs to Nichols and producer Lawrence Turman . Several weeks later , Simon re @-@ emerged with two new tracks , " Punky 's Dilemma " and " Overs " , neither of which Nichols was particularly taken with . The duo offered another new song , which later became " Mrs. Robinson " , that was not as developed . Nichols loved it . 
 = = = Studio time and low profile ( 1967 – 68 ) = = = 
 The duo 's fourth studio album , Bookends , was recorded in fits and starts over various periods from late 1966 to early 1968 . The duo were signed under an older contract that specified the label pay for sessions , and Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence , hiring viola and brass players , as well as percussionists . The record 's brevity reflects its concise and perfectionist production . The team spent over 50 studio hours recording " Punky 's Dilemma " , for example , and re @-@ recorded vocal parts , sometimes note by note , until they were satisfied . Garfunkel 's songs and voice took a lead role on some of the songs , and the harmonies for which the duo was known gradually disappeared . For Simon , Bookends represented the end of the collaboration and became an early indicator of his intentions to go solo . Although the album had been planned long in advance , work did not begin in earnest until the late months of 1967 . 
 Prior to release , the band helped put together and performed at the Monterey Pop Festival , which signaled the beginning of the Summer of Love on the West Coast . " Fakin ' It " was issued as a single that summer and found only modest success on AM radio ; the duo were much more focused on the rising FM format , which played album cuts and treated their music with respect . In January 1968 , the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special , Three for Tonight , performing ten songs largely culled from their third album . Bookends was released by Columbia Records in April 1968 . In a historical context , this was just 24 hours before the assassination of Civil Rights Movement activist Martin Luther King , Jr . , which spurred nationwide outrage and riots . The album debuted on the Billboard Top LPs in the issue dated April 27 , 1968 , climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non @-@ consecutive weeks ; it remained on the chart as a whole for 66 weeks . Bookends received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies left the warehouse , a fact it touted in magazine ads . The record became the duo 's best @-@ selling album to date : it fed off the buzz created by the release of The Graduate soundtrack album ten weeks earlier , creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units . 
 Davis had predicted this fact , and suggested raising the list price of Bookends by one dollar to $ 5 @.@ 79 , above the then standard retail price , to compensate for including a large poster included in vinyl copies . Simon instead scoffed and viewed it as charging a premium on " what was sure to be that year 's best @-@ selling Columbia album " . According to biographer Marc Eliot , Davis was " offended by what he perceived as their lack of gratitude for what he believed was his role in turning them into superstars " . Rather than implement Davis ' price increase plan , Simon & Garfunkel signed a contract extension with Columbia that guaranteed them a higher royalty rate . Lead single " Mrs. Robinson " became , at the 1969 Grammy Awards the first rock and roll song to receive Record of the Year ; it was also awarded Best Contemporary Pop Performance by a Duo or Group . 
 = = = Growing apart and final years ( 1969 – 70 ) = = = 
 Bookends , alongside The Graduate soundtrack , propelled Simon & Garfunkel to become the biggest rock duo in the world . Simon was approached by producers to write music for films or license songs ; he turned down Franco Zeffirelli , who was preparing to film Brother Sun , Sister Moon , and John Schlesinger , who likewise was readying to shoot Midnight Cowboy . In addition to Hollywood proposals , producers from the Broadway show Jimmy Shine ( starring Simon 's friend Dustin Hoffman , also the lead in Midnight Cowboy ) asked for two original songs and Simon declined . He collaborated briefly with Leonard Bernstein on a sacred mass before withdrawing from the project due to " finding it perhaps too far afield from his comfort zone " . Garfunkel took the role of Captain <unk> in the Nichols film , Catch @-@ 22 , based on the Catch @-@ 22 novel . Initially Simon was to play the character of Dunbar , but screenwriter Buck Henry felt the film was already crowded with characters and subsequently wrote Simon 's part out . 
 The filming of Catch @-@ 22 began in January 1969 and lasted about eight months . The unexpectedly long film production endangered the relationship between the duo ; Simon had not completed any new songs at this point , and the duo planned to collaborate when the filming would be finished . Following the end of filming of Catch @-@ 22 in October , the first performance of what was , for a time , their last tour , took place in Ames , Iowa . The US leg of the tour ended in the sold @-@ out Carnegie Hall on November 27 . After breaking for Christmas , the duo continued working on the album in early 1970 and finished it in late January . Meanwhile , the duo , working with director Charles Grodin , produced an hourlong CBS special , Songs of America , which is a mixture of scenes featuring notable political events and leaders concerning the USA , such as the Vietnam War , Martin Luther King , John F. Kennedy 's funeral procession , Cesar Chavez and the Poor People 's March . It was broadcast only once , due to internal tension at the network regarding its content . 
 Bridge over Troubled Water , their final studio album , was released in January 1970 and charted in over 11 countries , topping the charts in 10 , including the Billboard Top LP 's chart in the US and the UK Albums Chart . It was the best @-@ selling album in 1970 , 1971 and 1972 and was at that time the best @-@ selling album of all time . It was also CBS Records ' best @-@ selling album before the release of Michael Jackson 's Thriller in 1982 . The album topped the Billboard charts for 10 weeks and stayed in the charts for 85 weeks . In the United Kingdom , the album topped the charts for 35 weeks , and spent 285 weeks in the top 100 , from 1970 to 1975 . It has since sold over 25 million copies worldwide . " Bridge over Troubled Water " , the album 's lead single , hit number one in five countries and became their biggest seller . The song has been covered by over 50 artists since then , including Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash . " Cecilia " , the follow @-@ up , hit number four in the US , and " El Condor Pasa " hit number 18 . 
 The recording process was tough for both musicians , and their breakup was almost certain considering the deterioration of their relationship . " At that point , I just wanted out , " Simon later said . Their breakup was not intended to be semi @-@ permanent : Garfunkel hoped for a two @-@ year break from Simon & Garfunkel and did not intend to pursue a film @-@ career . Likewise , Simon did not intend to begin a solo career . A brief British tour followed the album release , and the duo 's last concert as Simon & Garfunkel occurred at Forest Hills Stadium . In 1971 , the album took home six awards at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards , including Album of the Year . Simon 's wife , Peggy Harper , pushed for him to make the split official , and he placed a call to Davis to confirm the duo 's breakup : " I want you to know I ’ ve decided to split with Artie . I don ’ t think we ’ ll be recording together again . " For the next several years , the duo would only speak " two or three " times a year .

 In the 1970s , the duo reunited several times . Their first reunion was a benefit concert for presidential candidate George McGovern at New York 's Madison Square Garden in June 1972 . In 1975 , they reconciled once more when they visited a recording session with John Lennon and Harry Nilsson . For the rest of the year , they attempted to make the reunion work , but their collaboration only yielded one song , " My Little Town , " that was featured on Simon 's Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel 's Breakaway . It peaked at number nine on the Hot 100 . In 1975 , Garfunkel joined Simon for a medley of three songs on the television series Saturday Night Live which Simon was guest hosting . In 1977 , Garfunkel joined Simon for a brief performance of their old songs on Simon 's television special The Paul Simon Special , and later that year they recorded a cover of Sam Cooke 's " ( What a ) Wonderful World " along with James Taylor . Old tensions finally appeared to dissipate upon Garfunkel 's return to New York in 1978 , when the duo began interacting more often . On May 1 , 1978 , Simon joined Garfunkel for a concert held at Carnegie Hall to benefit the hearing disabled . 
 By 1980 , the duo 's respective solo efforts were not doing well . To help alleviate New York 's economic decline , concert promoter Ron Delsener came up with the idea to throw a free concert in Central Park . Delsener contacted Simon with the idea of a Simon & Garfunkel reunion , and once Garfunkel agreed , plans were made . The Concert in Central Park , performed September 19 , 1981 , attracted more than 500 @,@ 000 people , at that time the largest @-@ ever concert attendance . Warner Bros. Records released a live album of the show that went double platinum in the US . A 90 @-@ minute recording of the concert was sold to Home Box Office ( HBO ) for over $ 1 million . The concert created a renewed interest in the duo 's work . They had several " heart @-@ to @-@ heart talks , " attempting to put past issues behind them . The duo planned a world tour , kicking off in May 1982 , but their relationship grew contentious : for the majority of the tour , they did not speak to one another . Warner Bros. pushed for them to extend the tour and release an all @-@ new Simon & Garfunkel studio album . 
 After recording several vocal tracks for a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album , Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album . Garfunkel had refused to learn the songs in the studio , and would not give up cannabis and cigarettes , despite Simon 's requests . An official spokesperson remarked , " Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life that it had to be his own record . Art was hoping to be on the album , but I 'm sure there will be other projects that they will work on together . They are still friends . " The material was later released on Simon 's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones . Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon 's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album . In 1990 , the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Garfunkel thanked his partner , calling him " the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me , " to which Simon responded , " Arthur and I agree about almost nothing . But it 's true , I have enriched his life quite a bit . " After three songs , the duo left without speaking . 
 By 1993 , their relationship had thawed again , and Simon invited Garfunkel on an international tour with him . Following a 21 @-@ date , sold @-@ out run at the Paramount Theater in New York and an appearance at that year 's Bridge School Benefit in California , the duo toured the Far East . The duo had a falling out over the course of the rest of the decade , the details of which have never been disclosed . Simon thanked Garfunkel at his 2001 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist : " I regret the ending of our friendship . I hope that some day before we die we will make peace with each other , " resuming after a pause , " No rush . " They were awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003 , for which the promoters convinced them to reconcile and open the show with a performance of " The Sound of Silence . " The performance was satisfying for both musicians , and they planned out a full @-@ scale reunion tour over the summer . The Old Friends tour began in October 2003 and played to sold @-@ out audiences across the United States for 30 dates until mid @-@ December . The tour earned an estimated $ 123 million . Following a twelve @-@ city run in Europe in 2004 , they ended their nine @-@ month tour with a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome . It attracted 600 @,@ 000 fans , more than their The Concert in Central Park . 
 = = = Recent years ( 2009 – present ) = = = 
 In 2009 , the duo reunited again for three songs during Simon 's two @-@ night engagement at New York 's Beacon Theatre . This led to a reunion tour of Asia and Australia in June 2009 . Their headlining set at the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival was very difficult for Garfunkel , who was experiencing serious vocal problems . " I was terrible , and crazy nervous . I leaned on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd , " he told Rolling Stone several years later . Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord paresis , and the remaining tour dates were postponed indefinitely . His manager , John Scher , informed Simon 's camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year , which did not happen , leading to poor relations between the two . He regained his vocal strength over the course of the next four years , performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences . 
 Despite this , the duo have not staged a full @-@ scale tour or performed shows since 2010 . Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 that he believes they will tour in the future , although Simon had been too " busy " in recent years . " I know that audiences all over the world like Simon and Garfunkel . I 'm with them . But I don 't think Paul Simon 's with them , " he remarked . In a 2016 interview with NPR 's David Greene , when asked about the possibility of reuniting , Simon stated ; " Well , I don 't think most people do [ constantly want Simon to relive the olden days ] . The fact is , is , like , we did do two big reunions , and we 're done . There 's nothing really much to say . You know , the music essentially stopped in 1970 . And , you know , I mean , quite honestly , we don 't get along . So it 's not like it 's fun . If it was fun , I 'd say , OK , sometimes we 'll go out and sing old songs in harmony . That 's cool . But when it 's not fun , you know , and you 're going to be in a tense situation , well , then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in . So that 'll never happen again . That 's that . " 
 = = Musical style and legacy = = 
 Over the course of their career , Simon & Garfunkel 's music gradually moved from a very basic , folk rock sound to incorporate more experimental elements for the time , including Latin and gospel music . Many adolescents of the 1960s found their music relevant , while adults regarded them as intelligent . Their music , according to Rolling Stone , struck a chord among lonely , alienated young adults near the end of the decade . 
 Despite its popularity , the group was also criticized sharply , especially in its heyday . Rolling Stone critic Arthur Schmidt , for example , described the duo 's music as " questionable ... it exudes a sense of process , and it is slick , and nothing too much happens . " New York Times critic Robert Shelton said that the group had " a kind of Mickey Mouse , timid , contrived " approach to music . 
 Their clean sound and muted lyricism " cost them some hipness points during the psychedelic era " according to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic , who also notes that the duo " inhabited the more polished end of the folk @-@ rock spectrum and was sometimes criticized for a certain collegiate sterility . " Unterberger further observes that some critics would later regard Simon 's lyricism in his work with Simon & Garfunkel to pale in comparison to his later solo material . But Unterberger himself believed that " the best of S & G 's work could stand among Simon 's best material , and the duo did progress musically over the course of their five albums , moving from basic folk @-@ rock productions into Latin rhythms and gospel @-@ influenced arrangements that foreshadowed Simon 's eclecticism on his solo albums . " Their rocky personal relationship led to their " breaking up and making up about every dozen years . "
