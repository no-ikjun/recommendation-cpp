 As Lucan 's bankruptcy proceeded , in August 1975 his creditors were informed that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £ 45 @,@ 000 and preferential liabilities for £ 1 @,@ 326 . His assets were estimated at £ 22 @,@ 632 . The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £ 30 @,@ 000 . His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust in the years immediately following his disappearance . His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999 , although no death certificate was issued , and his heir , George Bingham , Lord Bingham , was refused permission to take his father 's title and seat in the House of Lords . Following the passage of the <unk> of Death Act 2013 , Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead , which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016 . He therefore inherited his father 's title , becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan . 
 = = Ultimate fate and reported sightings = = 
 The last confirmed sighting of Lucan was at about 1 : 15 am on 8 November 1974 as he exited the driveway of the Maxwell @-@ Scott property , in his friend 's Ford Corsair . Since then , his whereabouts and ultimate fate remain a mystery . Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson initially claimed that Lucan had " done the honourable thing " and " fallen on his own sword " , a view publicly repeated by many of Lucan 's friends , including John Aspinall , who shortly before his death in 2000 said he believed the earl was guilty of Rivett 's murder , and that his body lay " 250 feet under the Channel " . Veronica Lucan believes her husband killed himself " like the nobleman he was " . 
 Ranson later changed his view , explaining that he considered it more likely that suicide was far from Lucan 's thoughts , that a rumoured drowning at sea was implausible and that the earl had moved to southern Africa . Thirty years after the murder , the detective leading a new investigation into Lucan 's disappearance told the Telegraph that " the evidence points towards the fact that Lord Lucan left the country and lived abroad for a number of years . " Speaking to author John Pearson before she died , Susan Maxwell @-@ Scott suggested that Lucan might have been helped out of the country by shadowy underground financiers , before being judged too great a risk and killed and buried in Switzerland . A similar theory was proposed by advertising executive Jeremy Scott , who was familiar with some of the Clermont Set . 
 Lucan 's disappearance has captivated the public 's imagination for decades , with thousands of sightings reported across the world . One of the earliest , shortly after the murder , turned out to be a British ex @-@ politician , John Stonehouse , who had attempted to fake his own death . The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead , to no avail . A sighting in Colombia turned out to be an American businessman . John Miller , a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs , claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl , but was later exposed by the News of the World as a hoaxer . In 2003 a former Scotland Yard detective thought he had tracked the earl to Goa , India , although the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin , a folk singer from St Helens . In 2007 , reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl . 
 More recently , responding to claims that the two eldest Lucan children were sent to Gabon in the early 1980s so that their father might secretly watch them " from a distance " , George Bingham denied ever visiting the country . His mother dismissed the newspaper claims of sightings as " nonsense " , reiterating that in her opinion " he was not the sort of Englishman to cope abroad " . 
 = Emmett Watson = 
 Emmett Watson ( November 22 , 1918 – May 11 , 2001 ) was an American newspaper columnist in Seattle , Washington , whose columns ran in a number of Seattle newspapers over a span of more than fifty years . Initially a sportswriter , he is primarily known for authoring a social commentary column for the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer ( P @-@ I ) from 1956 until 1982 , when he moved to The Seattle Times and continued there as a columnist until shortly before his death in 2001 . 
 Watson , who grew up in Seattle in the 1920s and 1930s , was a tireless advocate , through his column as well as through a fictional organization he created called Lesser Seattle , for limiting the seemingly unbridled growth and urban renewal that dramatically altered the Seattle landscape during the second half of the twentieth century .

 Born in Seattle , Watson and twin brother Clement were the sons of Garfield and Lena <unk> . Emmett 's mother and twin brother died of Spanish Influenza the following year ; his father , an itinerant laborer unable to care for his 14 @-@ month @-@ old son , arranged for Emmett 's adoption by long @-@ time friends John and Elizabeth Watson of West Seattle .

 Watson suffered an ear infection as a child that permanently damaged his hearing . He attended West Seattle High School before transferring to Franklin . A catcher on the Quakers baseball team , he played with future major league pitcher Fred <unk> and graduated in 1937 . 
 Watson enrolled at the University of Washington and played baseball for the Huskies under head coach Tubby Graves . He played very briefly with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League , amassing one hit in a total of two at @-@ bats . He often blamed his lack of success in professional baseball on his inability to hit a curveball . He graduated from the university in 1942 with a bachelor 's degree in communications . After leaving baseball , Watson worked in the Seattle @-@ Tacoma Shipyard during World War II . 
 = = = Early writing career = = = 
 During the war , Watson and some friends produced a newsletter to send to baseball players serving in the military . The newsletter brought him to the attention of an editor at the Seattle Star ( a now defunct daily newspaper ) where Watson was hired to cover the Rainiers in 1944 . It was while working at the Star that Watson contracted polio . 
 In 1946 , The Seattle Times lured Watson away from the Star , where he continued to cover sports until 1950 , when he received an offer from the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer that The Seattle Times chose not to match . He initially wrote a sports column at the P @-@ I. In 1956 the P @-@ I was pitched the idea of an " Around the Town " column by a group of restaurant owners who offered to partially underwrite the costs of producing the column in exchange for an occasional plug . The new column , " This , Our Town , " was assigned to Watson .

 Watson 's new column quickly broadened its scope to cover all aspects of life in Seattle . In 1959 it was rechristened " This , Our City . " By 1962 , the column , primarily a " three dot " compilation of short items , was running five days a week . When a particular issue caught his attention , Watson would produce a longer , essay @-@ style column . It was these essay @-@ style columns that provided most of the fodder for his 1993 book , My Life in Print . 
 In his column , as in his life , Watson was an early champion of civil rights , social reform , and the anti @-@ war movement . He denounced urban renewal plans aimed at flattening Pioneer Square and radically altering Seattle 's Pike Place Public Market . He was the founder and leader of " Lesser Seattle , " a parody of Greater Seattle , Inc . , which advocated several schemes for Seattle 's civic improvement and development that Watson considered ill @-@ advised . Feeling that the influx of outsiders , primarily from California , was ruining the city , Watson often published tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek columns suggesting ways to make visitors to Seattle feel unwelcome . He also invented a fictional organization called Keep the Bastards Out ( KBO ) that fought against the influx of newcomers to the Puget Sound area from out of state .

Watson remembered , " I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn 't in there . The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week . I said maybe we should make it zero columns a week . " On October 30 , 1983 , after a hiatus of more than three decades , Watson 's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times .

 At The Seattle Times Watson continued to write his column in the style that had made him a well @-@ known fixture of Seattle journalism . As was his custom , he continued to skewer the rich and powerful in his columns , always fighting against the kind of development and modernization that he felt was destroying the city he knew and loved . Over the years the tone in his columns softened somewhat and they often consisted of his reminisces of " Old Seattle . " In November 2000 , when his union , The Newspaper Guild , went on strike against The Seattle Times , Watson , then in his eighties , made regular , daily appearances on the picket lines . During the strike he wrote for the Seattle Union Record , the strike paper of the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild .

 = Dornier Do 17 = 
 The Dornier Do 17 , sometimes referred to as the <unk> <unk> ( " flying pencil " ) , was a World War II German light bomber produced by Claudius Dornier 's company , Dornier Flugzeugwerke . It was designed as a <unk> ( " fast bomber " ) , a light bomber which , in theory , would be so fast that it could outrun defending fighter aircraft . 
 The Dornier was designed with two engines mounted on a " shoulder wing " structure and possessed a twin tail fin configuration . The type was popular among its crews due to its handling , especially at low altitude , which made the Do 17 harder to hit than other German bombers . 
 Designed in the early 1930s , it was one of the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in the first three years of the war . The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War , operating in the Condor Legion in various roles . Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939 – 1940 . The Dornier was used throughout the early war , and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941 , when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited . 
 Production of the Dornier ended in mid @-@ 1940 , in favour of the newer and more powerful Junkers Ju 88 . The successor of the Do 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217 , which started to appear in strength in 1942 . Even so , the Do 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles until the end of the war , as a glider tug , research and trainer aircraft . A considerable number of surviving examples were sent to other Axis nations as well as countries like Finland . Few Dornier Do 17s survived the war and the last was scrapped in Finland in 1952 . 
 On 3 September 2010 , the Royal Air Force Museum London announced the discovery of a Henschel @-@ built Dornier Do 17Z buried in the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent , England . On 10 June 2013 , the salvage team raised the airframe from the seabed . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1932 , the Ordnance Department ( <unk> ) issued a specification for the construction of a " freight aircraft for German State Railways " , and a " high speed mail plane for Lufthansa " . The factory at <unk> began work on the design on 1 August 1932 . 
 When the Nazis took power in 1933 , Hermann Göring became National Commissar for aviation with former Deutsche Luft Hansa employee Erhard Milch as his deputy , soon forming the Ministry of Aviation . The Ministry of Aviation designated the new aircraft Do 17 , and on 17 March 1933 , just three months after taking office , Milch gave the go ahead for the building of prototypes . At the end of 1933 , the Ministry of Aviation issued an order for a " high speed aircraft with double tail , " and for a " freight aircraft with special equipment , " in other words , a bomber . The original design ( the Do 17 V1 ) configuration in 1932 had sported a single vertical stabilizer , and Dornier continued developing that model . The Do 17 was first demonstrated in mock @-@ up form in April 1933 . The " special equipment " was to be fitted later , to disguise its offensive role . 
 In April 1934 , the Dornier works at <unk> began project " definition . " During this month , the defensive armament was designed and the bomb release mechanism details ironed out . Production of these prototypes began on 20 May 1934 and , on 23 November 1934 , the Do 17 V1 , with a single fin and powered by two BMW VI 7 @.@ 3 motors , took off on its first flight . Testing was delayed by a series of accidents , with V1 being damaged in landing accidents in February and April 1935 . The twin @-@ tailed V2 ( powered by low @-@ compression BMW VI 6 @.@ 3 engines ) first flew on 18 May 1935 and was evaluated together with the V1 by the Ministry of Aviation at Rechlin in June . During the tests , the single fin proved to be only marginally stable , resulting in the V1 being modified with a twin tail . The aircraft was destroyed in a crash after an engine failure on 21 December 1935 . The V3 , also fitted with a twin tail , was originally planned to be powered by Hispano @-@ Suiza <unk> engines , but as these were unavailable , it was fitted with BMW VI 7 @.@ 3 engines like the V1 and flew on 19 September 1935 . The V1 prototype remained the only built machine with the single stabilizer . 
 It is claimed that , unlike the Heinkel He 111 series , whose military use was planned from the start , the Do 17 V1 was contracted as a fast six @-@ passenger mail plane to compete with the smaller Heinkel He 70 monoplane It has been suggested that it was rejected by Luft Hansa , as the cramped cabin was too uncomfortable for passenger use and the operating costs were too high for a mail plane . According to the story , the three prototypes remained unused in the Dornier factory in <unk> for almost six months , until Flight Captain <unk> of Luft Hansa came across them . After receiving permission to fly one of the machines , he proceeded to put it through an almost stunt flying routine . After landing , he said that " the machine is as nimble as a fighter , give it more lateral stability and we 'll have a high speed bomber ! " <unk> 's comments prompted Dornier to redesign the tail unit and revived interest in the type . 
 Dornier was then ordered to produce the V4 prototype . Some sources state this differed from the V3 in that the passenger portholes were removed and the single fin was replaced with two smaller ones . Photographic evidence demonstrates the V3 had twin stabilizers from the start of its construction . The tests of the " twin @-@ tailed " V4 , V6 and V7 prototypes were positive and more prototypes like the V8 emerged as the forerunner of the long @-@ range reconnaissance version , while the V9 was tested as a high @-@ speed airliner . The V9 machine was still flying in 1944 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The cockpit and forward fuselage had a conventional stepped cockpit , and its nose was fully glazed . Early variants had been labelled the " flying pencil " owing to its sleek and continuous " stick @-@ like " lines . As a result of the lessons learned in the Spanish Civil War , the cockpit roof was raised and the lower , or bottom half , of the crew compartment was a typical under @-@ nose " <unk> " , abbreviated Bola , inverted @-@ casemate design ventral defensive armament position , a common feature of most German medium bombers . The Bola was extended back to the leading edge of the wings where the lower @-@ rear gunners position and upper @-@ rear gunner position were level with each other . As with contemporary German bombers , the crew were concentrated in a single compartment . The cockpit layout consisted of the pilot seat and front gunner in the forward part of the cockpit . The pilot sat on the left side , close up to the Plexiglas windshield . One of the gunners sat on the right seat , which was set further back to provide room for the 7 @.@ 92 mm ( 0 @.@ 312 in ) MG 15 machine gun to be traversed in use . The Do 17 usually carried a crew of four : the pilot , a bombardier and two gunners . The bomb @-@ aimer also manned the MG 15 in the nose glazing and Bola @-@ housed rear lower position . The two gunners operated the forward @-@ firing MG 15 installed in the front windshield , the two MGs located in the side windows ( one each side ) and the rearward firing weapon . The cockpit offered a bright and panoramic view at high altitude . The standard ammunition load was 3 @,@ 300 rounds of 7 @,@ 92 mm ammunition in 44 double @-@ drum magazines . 
 The wings were of a broad 55 m ² ( 590 ft ² ) area and had a span of 18 m ( 59 ft 0 ⅝ in ) with a straight leading edge which curved in a near @-@ perfect semicircle into the trailing edge . The positions of the wing roots were offset . The leading edge wing root merged with the top of the fuselage and cockpit . As the wing extended backwards , by roughly two thirds , it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway down the side of the fuselage increasing the angle of incidence . This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs , namely the Dornier Do 217 . The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape . The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps . The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed . 
 The fuselage was 15 @.@ 80 m ( 51 ft 9 ⅝ in ) long . It was thin and narrow , which presented an enemy with a difficult target to hit . The fuselage had twin vertical stabilizers to increase lateral stability . The power plant of the Z @-@ 1 was to have been the Daimler @-@ Benz DB 601 but , owing to shortages from priority allocation for Bf 109E and Bf 110 fighter production , it was allocated Bramo 323 A @-@ 1 power plants . The <unk> could only reach 352 km / h ( 220 mph ) at 1 @,@ 070 m ( 3 @,@ 500 ft ) . The limited performance of the Bramo 323s ensured the Do 17 could not reach 416 km / h ( 260 mph ) at 3 @,@ 960 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) in level flight when fully loaded . The range of the Do 17Z @-@ 1 at ground level was 635 nmi ( 1 @,@ 176 km ) ; this increased to 1 @,@ 370 km ( 850 nm ) at 4 @,@ 700 m ( 15 @,@ 500 ft ) . This gave an average attack range of 400 nmi ( 740 km ) . The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased the Z @-@ 2 performance slightly in all areas . 
 The Dornier had self @-@ sealing fuel tanks to protect fuel stored in the wings and fuselage . This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action , and often enabled the aircraft to return . Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above 3 @,@ 660 m ( 12 @,@ 000 ft ) . 
 Communications usually consisted of FuG X , the later FuG 10 ( Funkgerät ) , navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder ( PeilG - <unk> ) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind @-@ landing devices . The crew communicated by EiV intercom . A primitive autopilot device , the Siemens <unk> , was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder 's control surfaces . 
 The bomb bay accommodated four bomb racks , the No. 5 for SC50 bombs and two ETC 500 racks to carry heavier loads of up to 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) each . A Lotfe A , or B bombsight was issued together with the <unk> @-@ 2 aperture ( a modernised optical lens system ) . The aircraft 's bomb bay allowed two options . The first was to carry four 250 kg ( 550 lb ) bombs for a load of 1000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) , which reduced aircraft range . With half the maximum load , ten 50 kg ( 110 lb ) bombs , additional fuel tanks could be placed into the forward part of the bomb bay to increase range . The bomb aimer would deploy the bomb load via the Lotfe ( A , B or C 7 / A , depending on the variant ) bomb sight which was in the left side of the nose compartment directly under and forward of the pilot . When fully loaded , the Z @-@ 1 weighed 7 @,@ 740 kg ( 17 @,@ 200 lb ) .

 The initial production variants were the Do 17E @-@ 1 bomber , which was tested with two Daimler @-@ Benz DB 600 , and Do 17F @-@ 1 reconnaissance aircraft , powered like the early prototypes with BMW VI engines , which entered production in late 1936 . The first Luftwaffe units converted to the Do 17 in early 1937 . 
 The Do 17E @-@ 1 was equipped with two BMW VI <unk> inline engines of 750 PS each . The crew numbered three . The radio operator manned the two 7 @.@ 92 mm MG 15 machine guns within a B @-@ Stand pod in the rear cockpit . They had 750 rounds of ammunition . The bomb bay was divided into two compartments . Each had five bomb racks with individual capacity of 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . A single ETC 500 / IX bomb rack could be mounted externally underneath the aircraft to carry a 500 kg bomb . A Do 17 E @-@ 1 with the designation D @-@ <unk> was tested with an unusual configuration , two SC 500 bombs mounted side by side under the fuselage . It showed a notable performance reduction due to the increase in weight and drag , this configuration was not used operationally . The E @-@ 1 continued to carry low bomb loads into the Second World War . The performance of the E @-@ 1 enabled it to reach a speed of 330 km / h ( 205 mph ) at 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 842 ft ) . Conducting a shallow dive the light frame of the Do 17 could reach 500 km / h ( 310 mph ) . Its maximum ceiling was 5 @,@ 500 m ( 18 @,@ 044 ft ) . 
 Several E @-@ 1s were rebuilt as E @-@ 2 or E @-@ 3 , at least three E @-@ 2 and one E @-@ 3 were used by <unk> and Hansa @-@ Luftbild GmbH ( Hansa Aerial Photography Ltd ) in a secret military reconnaissance role prior to the war . 
 The Do 17F @-@ 1 was a long @-@ range reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es . The Do 17 prototype V8 was used to test the configuration of the F @-@ 1 and V11 for the F @-@ 2 . The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C @-@ Stand ( B @-@ Stand - an upper rear firing position , C @-@ Stand — lower gun emplacement ) . The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges . The F @-@ 1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938 . Only one F @-@ 2 was ever built , it was designated D @-@ <unk> and was used by Zeiss @-@ Jena Company as a factory aircraft . 
 Conversion of two E @-@ 2 series aircraft with two BMW <unk> radial engines led to the Do 17 J @-@ 1 and J @-@ 2 . These aircraft served as flight testing machines to evaluate the BMW 132 for usage in the Do 17 . The aircraft were the V18 ( Wrk Nr , or Werknummer meaning works / factory number , 2021 ) and <unk> ( Wrk Nr 2022 ) prototypes . Trials began in late 1937 . A similar conversion , but with Bramo 323 radial engines , led to the designation Do 17 L @-@ 1 and L @-@ 2 . Two Do 17 ( Wrk Nr 2031 and 2032 ) were renamed as V20 and <unk> prototypes and used to evaluate the Bramo 323 fur usage in the Do 17 . The test were satisfactory and all future production models would be equipped with this engine . 
 After seeing the Do 17M V1 at the Zürich air races in 1937 , the Yugoslav Royal Air Force bought license rights for production at the <unk> <unk> Aviona factory in 1938 . They equipped it with the more powerful Gnome @-@ Rhône 14N radial engine ( although the French exaggerated its performance ) Dornier designs were delivered to the <unk> Vazduhoplovstvo ( Naval Aviation - PV ) in 1926 , namely the Dornier Komet and Dornier Do Y heavy bombers . The Yugoslavs were familiar with Dornier designs , and on 19 November 1935 Yugoslav pilots test @-@ flew the Do 17 V @-@ 3 prototype , D @-@ <unk> , W.Nr. 258 . They decided to select the Do 17 for service , despite it being more expensive than any other aircraft , because of the German willingness to deliver them quickly without limitations on numbers . 
 The Do <unk> @-@ 0 and Do 17M @-@ 0 were developed in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs , the L being the reconnaissance version . Both were designed around the more powerful DB <unk> engines , delivering about 746 kW ( 1 @,@ 000 hp ) . Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes , both with another MG 15 in the nose . The first prototype of the revised version , the Do 17M V1 ( D @-@ <unk> ) was powered by two DB 600s , and demonstrated impressive performance , including a maximum speed of 425 km / h ( 264 mph ) . 
 At the International Military Aircraft Competition at Zürich , Switzerland in 1937 , the Dornier Do 17M V1 proved a leader in its class and was faster than the fastest foreign fighter , the French Dewoitine <unk> The Do 17 , along with the Messerschmitt Bf 109 , won many prizes , demonstrating the prowess of German aviation design . 
 = = = The radial variants = = = 
 Despite its success , owing to shortages in the supply of the Daimler @-@ Benz engine , the production Do 17M was fitted with the Bramo 323 engine , with the corresponding reconnaissance aircraft , the Do 17P , being powered by BMW <unk> to give better range . 
 The supply of the DB 600 remained extremely limited as production was soon switched over to the fuel @-@ injected DB 601 , which was reserved for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters . Therefore , production versions of the basic Do 17M model airframe were fitted with the new Bramo <unk> @-@ 1 Fafnir engines of 670 kW ( 900 hp ) , which gave reasonable performance and raised the bomb load to 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) . The resulting Do 17M @-@ 1 was produced in small numbers and operated until 1941 . 
 The prototypes for the M @-@ 1 series were Do 17M V1 ( Wrk Nr 691 ) and Do 17M V2 ( Wrk Nr 692 ) which were tested with bomb loads of a medium bomber . The third prototype , Do 17M V3 was evaluated as a fast bomber . The <unk> was fitted with two Daimler Benz DB 601 inline engines while the <unk> and MV3 had the Bramo 323 A and D respectively . The Ministry of Aviation favoured the widespread use of the DB 601 , but demand for the DB <unk> in fighter aircraft and the lack of production forced the use of the Bramo . 
 The Do 17M @-@ 1 started its service as a medium bomber and was able to carry 2 @,@ 200 lb ( 1 @,@ 000 kg ) of bombs . It was equipped with two air @-@ cooled Bramo 323 A @-@ 1 or A @-@ 2 . The defensive armament consisted of two , and later three , MG 15 machine guns . The first was operated in an A @-@ Stand pod operated by the navigator through the windshield . The position was allocated 370 rounds of ammunition . The rearward firing B @-@ Stand was operated by the radio operator and allocated 750 rounds . The rear position in the lower fuselage was allocated 375 rounds in a C @-@ Stand pod . The Do 17M could carry a bomb load of either 20 SC50 50 kg ( 110 lb ) or two <unk> 250 kg ( 550 lb ) bombs or 10 SC50 and a single <unk> bomb . The speed of the M was superior to that of the E variant . The Do 17M could reach 420 km / h ( 250 mph ) at altitudes of 3 @,@ 500 m ( 11 @,@ 500 ft ) and could achieve a maximum service ceiling of 5 @,@ 790 m ( 19 @,@ 000 ft ) and a range of 850 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 570 km ) . 
 Reconnaissance aircraft based on the M @-@ 1 , the under @-@ surfaces of the wing were covered with duralumin and it had a wider engine axis and longer engine nacelles . The demand for a reconnaissance aircraft based on the M @-@ 1 led to the development of the P @-@ 1 variant . 
 The L version would not be able to enter production with the DB 600 owing to its use in the Bf 109 , and the Bramo engine was rather thirsty on fuel and left the M models with too short a range for reconnaissance use . BMW <unk> radials of 865 PS were selected instead , which had lower fuel consumption for better range . Another two prototypes with DB 600 engines were produced as the Do 17R @-@ 0 , but did not enter production . During reconnaissance missions the P @-@ 1 was armed with four MG 15s in the A , B and C — Stands . One machine gun was located in the rear of the cockpit , another in the lower rear Bola mount , one facing forward through the windscreen and the other in the nose glazing . In earlier variants the B @-@ Stand ( the gun position in the upper rear cockpit ) was open to the elements , but the P @-@ 1 now provided an enclosed bulb @-@ shaped mount protecting the radio operator from the weather . 
 The P variant had similar features to the Do 17M @-@ 1 , with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work . The Do 17P @-@ 1 was powered by two Bramo 132 N radial engines with a maximum performance of 865 PS ( 853 hp , 636 kW ) each . The machine was fitted with several radio variations . The FuG <unk> radio ( Funkgerät ) , the PeilG V direction finder ( PeilG - <unk> ) and the FuBI 1 radio blind @-@ landing device ( FuBI - <unk> ) . The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom ( EiV <unk> ) . The P @-@ 1 was equipped with either Rb 20 / 30 and Rb 50 / 30 or Rb 20 / 18 and Rb 50 / 18 cameras . The P @-@ 1 / trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras . The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit . 
 Due to a shortage of night fighters , at least one Do 17P @-@ 1 was assigned to this role . A smooth metal sheet was installed in place of its glass nose and it was armed with three 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) MG 151 / 20 cannons . The machine operated under Luftflotte 1 . 
 The Do 17P @-@ 2 was identical to the P @-@ 1 , with the additional installation of an ETC 500 bomb rack under the fuselage . These aircraft were designed for night reconnaissance . It is assumed that Dornier converted most , if not all , P @-@ 2 models from existing P @-@ 1 production aircraft . 
 Unlike the P @-@ 2 , the Do 17R @-@ 1 did not see series production . The experiences of the Spanish Civil War proved that unarmed aircraft were easy prey for fighter aircraft . The R @-@ 1 was to be a fast long @-@ range reconnaissance aircraft with two additional fuel cells inside the fuselage aft of the bomb bay . Two variants were suggested , the first ( variant I ) had a single Rb 50 / 30 and two Rb 20 / 30 cameras , while variant II had a third fuel cell to replace the rear Rb 20 / 30 . The aircraft had a gross weight of 7 @,@ 250 kg ( 15 @,@ 980 lb ) but could be overloaded to 7 @,@ 500 kg ( 16 @,@ 500 lb ) in emergencies . The crew usually numbered three , but a fourth was added depending on the missions to be flown . To achieve a high performance at increased altitudes two DB 600 Gs were to be used . The power plants were tested in the Do <unk> prototype registered D @-@ <unk> . The second , the <unk> , registered D @-@ <unk> , received the even more powerful DB 601 Aa engines . The power plant of the R @-@ 1s that did exist are not known . 
 The lessons from the Spanish Civil War had led Dornier 's designers to incorporate more defensive machine guns . Battles with Soviet @-@ built fighter aircraft had demonstrated that the Dornier was not as fast and invulnerable as was first thought . To cope with this , a completely new pod @-@ like cockpit was designed to give the crew more room and better visibility . The roof was extended upward over the line of the fuselage , sloping down to meet it just in front of the wing . The dorsal gun was moved to the rear of the pod where it had a considerably better field of fire . Likewise , the floor was dropped under the fuselage as a Bola casemate @-@ style defensive armament emplacement , and the ventral gun moved to the back of the Bola , allowing it to fire directly to the rear . The changes in the roof and floor made the whole front of the aircraft much larger . The rest of the airframe remained the same . The new cockpit design was nicknamed <unk> ( German : " Battle head " ) . 
 Three S variant prototypes with the DB 600 G inline engines were tested . The S @-@ 01 ( designation D @-@ <unk> ) , 03 and 04 were flown . The inverted V @-@ 12 engines were constructed as the Do 17 S @-@ 0 reconnaissance version , but it did not go into production . An additional 15 Do 17 U @-@ 1 pathfinder models were built , similar to the S @-@ 0 but adding another crewman ( taking the total to five ) to operate the extra radio equipment . The U models were to fly ahead of other bombers on night missions , using the radio equipment to locate the target and drop flares on it . They were personally requested by KG 100 as experimental models for this role . The U @-@ 1 had a maximum speed of 265 mph ( 424 km / h ) and a combat ceiling of 4 @,@ 500 m ( 15 @,@ 000 ft ) . The U @-@ 1 had a cruising speed of 384 km / h ( 240 mph ) and a maximum reachable height of 5 @,@ 700 m ( 19 @,@ 000 ft ) , owing to the " rather low performance of the Bramo 323 A @-@ 1 engines " . The three prototypes ( U @-@ 01 - U @-@ 03 ) and twelve production aircraft were built by 1938 . 
 = = = Dornier Do 17Z : The main variant = = = 
 The Dornier Do 17Z series was the most recognised and mass @-@ produced variant , and saw more combat service than the E @-@ U types . The type was modified as a result of combat experience during the Spanish Civil War . The forward fuselage was redesigned , with the cockpit area being " dropped " , or extended further to enable a rear firing gunner position to be installed , and the canopy extended aft , until it was nearly parallel with the leading edge and wing root . 
 To test the design , the Do 17S and Do <unk> were produced , both to be powered by the DB 600 power plants . However , a call for all DB 600 series engines to be reserved for fighters led to the variants being fitted with Bramo Fafnir 323 A radial engines . The bomb load was increased to 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) and a fourth crew member was added . It proved to be underpowered , so Bramo 323 P engines were then fitted . Only three Do 17S and 15 Do <unk> were built . With the updates , the Dornier , with a full bomb load , had a combat radius of 322 km ( 200 mi ) . Later variants , in the Do 17 Z @-@ 3 , Z @-@ 4 and Z @-@ 5 , which were fitted with cameras , dual trainer controls and flotation aids ( for maritime operations ) respectively , still could not solve the problems with range and bomb load . 
 At first , a batch of Z @-@ 0s were built with the Fafnir for testing , the DB 600 again proving to be too hard to obtain . These were quickly replaced with the Z @-@ 1 model , which added another gun for the bombardier , but the additional weight of the nose and guns meant the bomb load was reduced to 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) . The Luftwaffe , not being satisfied with the test outcome of the Z series , immediately ordered performance and design studies to increase the overall performance of the bomber . These resulted in very optimistic speeds and altitudes for all future Z variants , especially for the Z @-@ 5 aircraft . Planned performance altitudes of up to 7 @,@ 620 m ( 25 @,@ 000 ft ) at a maximum speed of 418 km / h ( 260 mph ) with an aircraft weight of 8 @,@ 100 kg ( 17 @,@ 800 lb ) were planned . Unfortunately , production aircraft never reached these optimistic performances during the service career of the Do 17Z . At 7 @,@ 740 kg ( 17 @,@ 200 lb ) , the heavy Do 17Z @-@ 1 used two Bramo 323 A @-@ 1 engines with self @-@ sealing fuel cells in the fuselage and wings . The crew of four consumed approximately 20 bottles of oxygen during long flights above 3 @,@ 700 m ( 12 @,@ 100 ft ) . The Do 17Z @-@ 1 had a speed of 352 km / h ( 220 mph ) at 1 @,@ 100 m ( 3 @,@ 500 ft ) . However , the performance of the Bramo 323s did not permit the Do 17 to reach 416 km / h ( 260 mph ) at 3 @,@ 900 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) and level flight when fully loaded . Range of the Z @-@ 1 at ground level was 635 nmi ( 1 @,@ 176 km ) while at 4 @,@ 700 m ( 15 @,@ 500 ft ) this increased to 850 nmi ( 1 @,@ 570 km ) . This gave an average range of 400 nmi ( 740 km ) . The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased subsequent performance in the following sub variants . 
 This was addressed in the major production model , the Do 17 Z @-@ 2 . The Z @-@ 2 mounted the new 323P @-@ 1 version of the Fafnir with 746 kW ( 1 @,@ 000 hp ) , which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low @-@ level performance . The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 102 lb ) to 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) . However the combat range with a full 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) bomb load was a very short 330 km ( 200 mi ) . The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of the sides of the upper part of the pod , but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner , only one of them could be fired at a time . From May 1940 , 422 Do 17 Z @-@ 2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2 , Kampfgeschwader 3 , Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77 . The upgrades of the Z @-@ 2 had its overall weight increased from 17 @,@ 600 lbs to 17 @,@ 920 lbs ( 7 @,@ 983 to <unk> kg ) . After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151 / 15 . Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers . The standard MG 15 machine guns were retained . These features were present in the next variant the Z @-@ 3 . 
 The Z @-@ 3 formed part of the bomber versions of the Z series , it was , however , also used as a reconnaissance aircraft by the staff flight of the particular unit . The engines and the general equipment were identical to the Z @-@ 2 standard ; however two cameras — the Rb 50 / 30 and Rb 20 / 30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch . A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions . <unk> equipment was added later . The Z @-@ 2 and Z @-@ 3 were identical visually , and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z @-@ 3 . Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment , the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines . The power plant of the Z @-@ 3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P @-@ 2 . The Bramo P @-@ 2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants . 
 The Z @-@ 4 was designed as trainer . Although nearly identical to the Z @-@ 2 and Z @-@ 3 , it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training . The four @-@ seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering , which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right . Rudder pedals were in front of both seats . The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced , or in most cases omitted to reduce weight . 
 The Z @-@ 5 was similar to the Z @-@ 3 with a weight of 19 @,@ 000 lb ( 8 @,@ 600 kg ) . Designed as an anti @-@ shipping aircraft , the Z @-@ 5 , was fitted with flotation cells in the fuselage and engine nacelles in case it was forced down on water . Usually the flotation devices took the form of inflatable bags stored in the rear of the engine nacelles and in bulges on either side of the nose , just behind the front glazing . 
 Later variants of the Z model were developed . The Z @-@ 6 was to be a reconnaissance aircraft , although it was only built as a prototype . During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants . The type was selected for weather check flights . It was identical to the Z @-@ 1 / Z @-@ 2 variants , but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted . This increased the fuel load to 2 @,@ 890 l ( 578 Imperial Gallons ) . As flights required higher altitude , the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles . For long @-@ range flights over water , the larger dinghy of the Z @-@ 5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations . The Z @-@ 6s were also used for night fighter operations . Some of the few converted Z @-@ 6s had the Ju 88C @-@ 6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons . The nose proved to be unsatisfactory , and it was redesigned . In the tip of the new nose was an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z @-@ 6 . 
 The Z @-@ 8 Geier was not produced . It was intended as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti @-@ aircraft artillery . An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire . 
 The Z @-@ 9 , which was fitted with special bomb release equipment , and delayed release gear for low @-@ level attack missions . Its purpose was to suppress enemy air defences . Therefore , it was designed to fly over anti @-@ aircraft positions and drop Butterfly Bombs , an early form of cluster bomb munitions . This could only be done with air superiority , as the Z @-@ 9 was unarmoured . The airframe and equipment was identical to the Z @-@ 1 / Z @-@ 2 version . Only the bomb bay was altered to accommodate 16 bomb @-@ dispenser systems . The maximum weight of the Z @-@ 9 was 7 @,@ 800 kg ( 17 @,@ 200 lb ) . The design did not reach serial production . 
 After bomber production ended in 1940 , the Z model was modified with a " solid " nose from the Ju 88C , fitted with one 20 mm MG FF cannon and three 7 @.@ 92 mm ( .312 in ) MG 17 machine guns , to be used as night fighters . Three prototypes were converted from existing Z @-@ series airframes to the Do 17 Z @-@ 7 Kauz I ( " screech @-@ owl " ) configuration . The standard Z @-@ 7 was fitted with Bramo 323P @-@ 1 radial engines and had a crew of three airmen . In comparison to the standard bomber version , the fuel load arrangement was altered by subdividing into cells . Two cells were in the wings , with a capacity of 770 litres ( 154 imperial gallons ) each . A third cell was placed in the bomb bay within the main fuselage , having a capacity of 895 litres ( 179 imperial gallons ) . The oxygen supply for the three man crew was reduced to nine bottles , as intercepts at high altitudes were not anticipated . Add @-@ on armour in the form of heavy steel plates was bolted to the nose bulkhead to protect the crew against frontal fire . Originally , it was planned to completely armour the crew compartment . This idea , was given up again as the increased weight would have reduced flight performance of an already slow aircraft . The ammunition loads for the three 7 @.@ 92 mm MG 17 amounted to 3 @,@ 000 rounds and 400 rounds of ammunition for the 20 mm MG 151 cannon ( although some Do 17Z bombers carried a single 20 mm for ground attack missions ) . 
 Later , the design was further modified to the Do 17 Z @-@ 10 Kauz II , the solid nose now containing an infra @-@ red searchlight for the Spanner <unk> infrared detection system . The infrared lamp in the nose was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target . The Z @-@ 10 was armed with four 7 @.@ 92 mm ( .312 in ) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20 mm MG FF in the lower nose . The crew could reload the 20 mm cannons ' drum magazines internally . The Z @-@ 10 contained an IR searchlight ( Spanner @-@ <unk> ) for the Spanner infrared detection system . A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar . 
 Only 10 of these Kauz II designs were converted from existing Z @-@ series airframes . The Spanner system proved to be essentially useless and many Z @-@ 10 were left without any detection system . At least one Z @-@ 10 , coded CD + PV , was used as a flying test bed to help developing the early low @-@ UHF band B / C version of the Lichtenstein radar system in late 1941 – 1942 . When the Z @-@ 10 was stripped of all non @-@ night fighter equipment , it had a maximum weight of 7 @,@ 300 kg ( 16 @,@ 100 lb ) . Armament fit was similar to that of the Z @-@ 7 , with an added MG 17 and an additional 1 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition in the nose section . Defensive gun positions included the B and C stand , each equipped with a single MG 15 .

 Official figures state 2 @,@ 139 Do 17s were built on German assembly lines . At the Dornier factory at Oberpfaffenhofen , 328 Do 17Es were built along with a further 77 Do <unk> and 200 Do 17M variants . Do 17Z production figures for Oberpfaffenhofen stand at 420 . At <unk> , 84 Do 17Ks were built , some of which were sold to the Yugoslav Royal Air Force . Do 17P production was spread out over different factory lines . At Siebel / Halle , eight were built . At the Henschel factory at Berlin @-@ Schönefeld 73 were constructed . At the <unk> plant in Hamburg 149 were built . Henschel also produced some 320 Do 17Zs , <unk> contributed to construction of 74 at its Hamburg plant , and another 73 were built at Siebel . Some 105 examples of the Dornier Do <unk> was later built at Oberpfaffenhofen . 
 By 19 September 1938 , the Luftwaffe had received 579 Dornier Do 17s . These were mostly Do 17E , F , M and P variants . During 1939 – 1940 , some 475 Dornier Do 17Z bombers , 16 reconnaissance aircraft and nine night fighters were built . Another 100 Dornier Do <unk> , an updated variant of the Do 17 , were built during this period also . 
 = = = Yugoslav = = = 
 Other governments were interested in the Do 17 . In June 1936 , the Yugoslav government ordered 36 Do 17E variants from Germany . The negotiations for a licence were completed on 27 June 1938 for 36 Do 17Ka 's at the cost of 1 @,@ 829 @,@ 825 Reichsmark ( RM ) . On 18 March 1938 , Yugoslavia ordered 16 complete Do 17 Ka @-@ 2 's and Ka @-@ 3 's at a cost of 3 @,@ 316 @,@ 788 RM . They received the last on 21 April 1939 . The machines were from 72 @-@ 96 % complete . 
 The Dorniers were devoid of German equipment , including engines . The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer to supply the powerplants instead . Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen , and the Gnome @-@ Rhône Mistral Major engine was to be used in the Dornier . The French had inflated the performance data of the engine , claiming it to have 649 kW ( 870 hp ) and a speed of 420 km / h ( 261 mph ) at 3 @,@ 850 m ( 12 @,@ 320 ft ) . The constant @-@ speed propellers were also poor , and delivered late . This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and <unk> propellers . Only one of the Do 17s delivered was fitted out complete with German equipment . The rest of the Dorniers were equipped with Belgian FN 7 @.@ 9 mm ( <unk> in ) machine guns , Czech camera equipment and eventually Telefunken radio sets . Altogether , 70 Do 17s were produced by Yugoslav factories .

 On 3 September 2010 , the RAF Museum announced that a Do 17 had been discovered in 50 ft ( 15 m ) of water off the coast of England . The aircraft had been discovered in September 2008 on the Goodwin Sands , a large sandbank 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) off the coast of Kent , but the discovery was kept a closely guarded secret . The Dornier Do 17Z @-@ 2 , Werknummer 1160 , built under license by Henschel with the full <unk> ( combat wing aircraft ID code ) of 5K + AR , was operated by 7 Staffel , III Gruppe , Kampfgeschwader 3 ( KG 3 ) . 
 On 26 August 1940 , 5K + AR was taking part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3 , targeting the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch . While flying over clouds , the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings ; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF . One of the Dornier 's engines was disabled and the other damaged , so the wounded pilot , Feldwebel ( Flight Sergeant ) Willi <unk> , elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands . He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner . The other two crew were killed ; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands . The identity of the Defiant that shot down the Dornier is not certain – it may have been one of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3 . 
 In June 2010 diving operations were carried out and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete , although 5K + AR lay inverted on the seabed , indicating that it ground @-@ looped on landing . The port rudder , starboard stabiliser , forward nose glazing , undercarriage doors and engine cowling were missing , but the discovery of a small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site . Some items , including two of the Dornier 's six MG 15 machine guns , are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft 's discovery . 
 It was then taken to the Michael Beetham Restoration Centre at the Royal Air Force Museum 's Cosford site , where metallurgists from Imperial College London have a significant role in the post @-@ recovery conservation of the aircraft .

 = Lightning Bolt ( band ) = 
 Lightning Bolt is an American noise rock duo from Providence , Rhode Island , United States , composed of Brian Chippendale on drums and vocals and Brian Gibson on bass guitar . The band met and formed in 1994 , when the members of the then @-@ trio attended the Rhode Island School of Design . The band signed to Load Records in 1997 , and released their self @-@ titled debut two years later . In total , Lightning Bolt has released seven full @-@ length albums , numerous vinyl singles , and appeared on several compilations . Lightning Bolt were listed 8th in Metacritic 's Artists of the Decade 2000 @-@ 09 . 
 Lightning Bolt are known for their guerrilla @-@ style live performances , where they typically play on the ground rather than a stage , with the crowd gathered around them . The band 's sound is typically loud and aggressive , though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as compositional influences . 
 Their song St. Jaques has been used as the main theme for the Fox ADHD block . 
 = = History = = 
 The band formed while Chippendale and Gibson attended the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence , Rhode Island , and Chippendale had heard about " a new kid who was a whiz on the bass guitar . " The two formed Lightning Bolt , with Brian Chippendale on drums , Brian Gibson on bass guitar , and with Hisham Bharoocha on guitar and vocals joining the group after their first show . Bharoocha left the group in 1996 to continue with another RISD band that would eventually become Black Dice , and Chippendale took over vocal duties . The only officially released music with Bharoocha was a track on the <unk> Program compilation . For the first few years , Lightning Bolt was primarily an improvisational band , touring the United States for months at a time and " just playing " . The concept of writing songs and recording an album didn 't occur to the band until 1997 , when Ben <unk> , founder of Load Records , approached the duo . 
 During these formative years , Chippendale and his freshman @-@ year college roommate Matt Brinkman began to set up Fort Thunder , a disused warehouse space in the Olneyville district of Providence . The space eventually came to house a number of local avant @-@ garde artists and musicians , including Brian Ralph as well as Lightning Bolt . 
 In 2006 , Lightning Bolt was deported from Japan days after they arrived to continue their tour from the UK . Band members were detained on arrival on the grounds that they did not have work permits . Their official appeal was rejected after 48 hours , and they were deported back to the United States .

 Lightning Bolt have released a total of seven full @-@ length albums , a number of 7 inch singles and splits , and have appeared on numerous compilations . The band 's first full @-@ length album was a self @-@ titled vinyl record on the Load Records label . The album was initially released in a limited edition pressing of 750 copies , and a 50 @-@ minute companion cassette titled " Zone " was released later . In 1999 the album was re @-@ released on CD , including " Zone " as bonus tracks and alternative cover art . Lightning Bolt 's second full @-@ length album was Ride the Skies , released in 2001 , followed by Wonderful Rainbow in 2003 . In 2005 , Lightning Bolt released Hypermagic Mountain , their most critically acclaimed album to date . In 2009 , their album Earthly Delights was released on Load Records . 
 The band starred in the 2003 tour @-@ DVD The Power of Salad directed by Peter Glantz and Nick Noe . Lightning Bolt have also performed in DVD compilations such as Pick a Winner ( 2004 ) and Sleep When You are Dead by performance artists Mighty Robot ( 2007 ) . 
 Rumors have persisted concerning the release of an improvisational album entitled Frenzy . A post on Lightning Bolt 's official website in early 2004 read " The next Lightning Bolt album , Frenzy , is currently in the works over at Load Records . It is expected to be available at the end of the summer . " No further word was given , and the next Lightning Bolt album released was in fact Hypermagic Mountain in 2005 . In an early 2007 interview , Chippendale said " When it comes to weird improv stuff , sometimes we 're just at a weird stalemate . " No official word has since been released . 
 On October 13 , 2009 , Lightning Bolt released the album Earthly Delights on the label Load . It has been the band 's first release in almost four years since Hypermagic Mountain . 
 On March 9 , 2015 , the group 's full length " Fantasy Empire " became available to stream via NPR 's First Listen . The accompanying writeup praised the increased clarity and fidelity of the recording , as compared to their earlier work , citing as a parallel example " ... the scene in The Wizard Of Oz where a sepia tone gives way to Technicolor ; it opens up new vistas to the sound , while giving the band an opportunity to exhibit more involved musicianship . " It was released on the Thrill Jockey label on March 25 , 2015 . 
 = = Musical and lyrical style = = 
 The band 's music takes cues from Japanese noise rock bands such as Boredoms and Ruins , although composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra are acknowledged influences . The band 's sound consists of Chippendale 's frenetic drumming , his usually incomprehensible vocals , and Gibson 's rhythmic bass guitar – an example of which is the song " 13 Monsters " , where Chippendale sings a playground style counting chant through heavy distortion over the instrumentals of his drums and Gibson 's bass guitar . As for the band 's genre , Brian Gibson is quoted as saying , " I hate , hate , hate the category " noise @-@ punk " I really don 't like being labeled with two words that have so much baggage . It ’ s gross . " 
 As the group 's vocalist , Chippendale eschews a conventional microphone , instead using the type of microphone built into a household telephone receiver , held in his mouth or attached to a mask , which is then run through an effects processor to further alter the sound . Chippendale has also used a <unk> 8021 Drum Exciter , a simple drum @-@ synth module , triggered by the bass drum . 
 Gibson plays his bass guitar tuned to cello standard tuning , in intervals of fifths ( C G D A ) , using a banjo string for the high A. He used this four @-@ string setup for several years , but has recently been seen using a five @-@ string setup , tuned to C G D A E , with banjo strings for the A and E. Gibson also uses several effects pedals , including overdrive pedals , an <unk> , a delay pedal , and a whammy pedal ( pitch shifter ) . 
 Like many noise rock bands , Lightning Bolt mostly plays extremely loud , aggressive music . In the film The Power of Salad , Gibson attributes much of their success to volume : 
 We used to get more negative reactions when [ we ] didn 't have as loud of stuff . It 's just , be super loud and you 're all set . ( laughs ) The rock and roll has been revealed . I do feel that that 's the message - if there 's any message , that 's what it is . This is kinda what we do to keep ourselves excited these days . In these days - everyone knows what I 'm talking about . ( laughs ) 
 The band have reportedly never been fans of the studio recording process . When they recorded five tracks for their eponymous debut album released in 1999 , they discarded four of them and replaced them with lo @-@ fidelity tracks recorded at various live shows from 1997 and 1998 . However , their following two albums , Ride the Skies and Wonderful Rainbow , were recorded more traditionally in a studio . For Hypermagic Mountain , half the tracks were recorded in studio , while the rest were performed and recorded in a house direct to a 2 @-@ track DAT master tape , where the audio engineer was unable to tell exactly how the final result would sound . 
 Since the band has only two members and two instruments , their sound has a somewhat limited range , though this is often noted as a positive thing . In one interview , Gibson states that his experiences in Lightning Bolt " has showed [ him ] the power of an extremely limited palette . " 
 Lightning Bolt 's lyrics , when decipherable , are generally tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek , covering such topics as fairy tales , heavy metal clichés , terrorism , anarchy , and superheroes . They delve occasionally into more political subjects , such as the anti @-@ Bush " Dead Cowboy " from Hypermagic Mountain . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Lightning Bolt are known for their so @-@ called " guerrilla gigs " , preferring to play on the floor of the venue rather than the stage , creating a tight circle of spectators around the band . They have also been known to start playing only a few seconds after the opening band finishes , often taking the audience by surprise . In 2004 , Lightning Bolt played on the doorstep of radio DJ John Peel 's chalet at noon during the All Tomorrow 's Parties festival , about which neighbor Steve Albini of Shellac and Big Black commented " Best alarm clock I 've ever had . " They have also staged concerts in kitchens , on sidewalks , and in parking lots .

 = Lily van Java = 
 Lilly van Java ( Lily of Java ) , also known as <unk> van Java ( Jasmine of Java ) , is a 1928 film from the Dutch East Indies directed by Nelson Wong . Initially meant to be produced by South Sea Film and shot by an American director , the film – which follows a woman told to marry a man she does not love – was ultimately completed by Wong 's Halimoen Film . Details on its cast and performance are contradictory , although the film is recognised as the first of a long series of ethnic Chinese @-@ produced films in the country . It is likely a lost film . 
 = = Premise = = 
 The young daughter of a rich man , already in a loving relationship , is forced to marry someone she does not love . 
 = = Production = = 
 The first two films produced in the Dutch East Indies , Loetoeng Kasaroeng ( 1926 ) and Eulis Atjih ( 1927 ) , were made by the Dutch filmmakers L. Heuveldorp and G. Kruger , respectively . Ethnic Chinese businessmen , capitalising on the success of films produced in Shanghai , China , established two production houses , one in Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) and the other in Surabaya . South Sea Film , the production house in Batavia established by Liem Goan Lian and Tjan Tjoen Lian , was advertised as the first Chinese filmmaking cooperative in the country . Its first script was for Lily van Java ; which the company had to pass through the Film Commissie ( national censorship bureau ) for fear of violating traditional values . 
 According to JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) , an American named Len Ross was initially booked to direct the film ; Ross was reportedly in the country to film a work entitled Java for Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer and shot several scenes in mid @-@ 1928 . The cast was ethnic Chinese , and the female stars – Lie Lian Hwa and Lie Bo Tan – were reportedly daughters of the <unk> gangster Lie <unk> <unk> and trained in silat ; other cast members included Kwee Tiang An and Yah Kwee Pang . However , after Ross withdrew the script was put on hold . 
 Nelson Wong , who had formerly been booked with his brothers Joshua and Othniel to record a film for Tio Tek <unk> , approached David Wong ( no relation ) , a high @-@ ranking General Motors employee in Batavia , for funding . With this the Wong Brother 's Halimoen Film was able to finish the film . Some sources indicate that the same cast was used , while others suggest that the leading role was taken by a student from Shanghai named Lily Oey . 
 The silent film was shot in black and white ; its intertitles were bilingual , written in both Malay and Chinese . The American film historian Richard Abel writes that the film 's technical quality , like all other local productions of the time , was poor and unable to compete with imported works , and the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran writes that the shots were considered blurry even at the time . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Lily van Java was released in 1928 . Its success is disputed . The reporter Leopold Gan wrote that the film was highly successful , to the point that after several years copies were worn through from overplaying . However , Joshua Wong later recalled in an interview that the film had been a failure ; David Wong is reported to have avowed to no longer fund any films after Lily van Java . Lacking a backer , the Wong Brothers went on hiatus . 
 Lily van Java continues to be recorded as the first Chinese @-@ produced film of the area . Although the Wongs went on hiatus , other ethnic Chinese became involved in film . Several Chinese owned start @-@ ups are recorded from 1929 on , including <unk> Film with <unk> <unk> ( 1928 ) and Tan 's Film with Njai Dasima ( 1929 ) . By the early 1930s Chinese @-@ owned businesses were the dominating force in the country 's film industry . 
 The film is likely a lost film . The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service . 
 = 1951 National League tie @-@ breaker series = 
 The 1951 National League tie @-@ breaker series was a best @-@ of @-@ three playoff series at the conclusion of Major League Baseball 's ( MLB ) 1951 regular season to decide the winner of the National League ( NL ) pennant . The games were played on October 1 , 2 , and 3 , 1951 , between the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers . It was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win – loss records of 96 – 58 . It is most famous for the walk @-@ off home run hit by Bobby Thomson of the Giants in the deciding game , which has come to be known as baseball 's " Shot Heard ' Round the World " . 
 This was the second three @-@ game playoff in NL history . After no tiebreakers had been needed since the American League ( AL ) became a major league in 1901 , this was the third such tie in the previous six seasons . The Dodgers had been involved in the previous one as well , losing to the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1946 season in two straight games . In addition to the 1946 series , the AL had a one @-@ game playoff in 1948 . 
 The Giants won game one , while the Dodgers came back to win game two . After trailing for most of game three , the Giants rallied to win the game and the series . Consequently , they advanced to the 1951 World Series , in which they were defeated by the New York Yankees . In baseball statistics , the tie @-@ breaker series counted as the 155th , 156th , and 157th regular season games by both teams ; all events in the games were added to regular season statistics . 
 = = Background = = 
 Sportswriters projected that the Giants , Dodgers , and Philadelphia Phillies would face off during the 1951 Major League Baseball season . The previous season , the Phillies won the NL pennant with a 91 – 63 record , while the Dodgers and Giants finished in second and third place , two and five games behind the Phillies , respectively . In the annual Associated Press poll , Brooklyn was projected as the favorite to win the pennant with 1 @,@ 413 points , New York was second with 1 @,@ 281 , and Philadelphia was third with 1 @,@ 176 . The United Press , however , had New York winning the pennant ; they had 81 votes compared to 55 for Brooklyn and 18 for Philadelphia . 
 Throughout the first half of the season , the Dodgers stayed in first place by a large margin . By August 10 , they were 12 1 ⁄ 2 games ahead of the Giants and 14 1 ⁄ 2 games ahead of the Phillies , and as a result they were already looking ahead to facing the New York Yankees in the 1951 World Series ; the Associated Press commented on their dominance , saying that " unless they completely fold in their last 50 games , they 're in . " While the Phillies fell out of contention , the Giants won 16 consecutive games from August 12 to August 27 , cutting their deficit from 12 1 ⁄ 2 games to six . 
 By September 20 , the Dodgers had ten games left to play while the Giants had seven , and the Dodgers had a 4 1 ⁄ 2 game advantage , making a pennant win appear imminent . However , the Giants won their last seven games , and the Dodgers needed to defeat the Phillies in the final game of the season to force a playoff ; they did so by winning 9 – 8 in 14 innings , leaving both teams with a record of 96 – 58 . 
 The National League used a three @-@ game playoff ( prior to 1969 ) to break a tie for the pennant , the winner of which would face the American League champion Yankees in the 1951 World Series . The Dodgers won the coin toss for home field advantage , but opted to host game one at Ebbets Field on October 1 , while the Giants would as a result get to host games two and three at the Polo Grounds on October 2 and 3 . The Dodgers chose Ralph Branca , who also started the first game of the 1946 tiebreaker , to start game one because he had beaten the Giants twice in the regular season , while the Giants chose Jim Hearn , who had beaten the Dodgers twice that year . 
 = = Game 1 summary = = 
 Branca began the game by retiring the first three batters ; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller grounded out . In the bottom of the first , Carl Furillo grounded out , and Pee Wee Reese hit a single . After Duke Snider flied out , Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning . In the second inning , Branca retired all three hitters ; when the Dodgers came up to bat , Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella grounded out . Andy Pafko scored the game 's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1 – 0 . After the third out , Willie Mays walked to start the third inning , and after the first out Stanky got the Giants ' first hit , a single . After a fly out by Dark , the Giants remained without a run ; Hearn retired all three batters in the bottom of the third to end the inning .

Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth , but was caught stealing second base ; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth . The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman , and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2 – 1 . 
 There were no hits in the seventh inning , as both pitchers retired the first three batters they faced . In the top of the eighth inning , Irvin hit the third home run of the game , his 24th of the year , to make the score 3 – 1 . Lockman then reached first base on an error and was able to advance to third base , but Mays and Hearn both struck out to keep the score intact . No Dodgers managed a hit in the bottom of the eighth , though the Dodgers brought in Jim Russell to use as a pinch hitter for Branca . In the ninth inning , Alvin Dark doubled for the Giants , but he was the only player on either team to earn a hit ; Hearn retired all three Dodgers hitters to end the game with the 3 – 1 victory , earning a complete game win after allowing five hits to the Dodgers . Those in attendance included Bill Dickey , a coach for the Yankees who attended the game to scout both teams . 
 = = Game 2 summary = = 
 The series moved to the Polo Grounds for game two . Sheldon Jones took the mound for the Giants despite a 6 – 10 record going into the game , allowing the Giants to save Sal Maglie for the series ' game three or the first game of the World Series . The Dodgers used Clem Labine , a rookie who had started just six games for the Dodgers in his career , because they lacked pitchers who were ready for the game . The Yankees were among those in attendance as spectators . 
 Pee Wee Reese singled and Jackie Robinson homered , scoring two runs for the Dodgers in the first inning ; the Giants had one player reach base on an error , making the score 2 – 0 after one inning . In the second inning , Gil Hodges singled and reached third base on an error , allowing the Dodgers to potentially score again . After Rube Walker 's hit the Giants threw Hodges out at home plate , and two further outs ended their turn at bat . The Giants had two consecutive hits in their half , a double hit by Thomson and a single hit by Mays , but they failed to score as well after two groundouts , leaving the score 2 – 0 . After one out , Duke Snider walked and Robinson singled to start the third inning , and Jones was removed from pitching duties , replaced by George Spencer . 
 Spencer ended the inning by throwing Snider out at home to keep the score 2 – 0 . Eddie Stanky reached base after a Dodgers error , marking the second error for both teams ; after another hit , the inning ended with a strikeout by Thomson . In the fourth inning , three players hit singles but did not score . Snider doubled in the fifth inning with one out , and a Jackie Robinson single made the score 3 – 0 for the Dodgers . The inning ended for the Dodgers on a double play , and Don Mueller hit a single in the bottom of the fifth before the Giants recorded three straight outs . The Dodgers opened up the game in the sixth inning , as Hodges led off with a home run . Billy Cox then reached base on an error and scored on a second error to make the game 5 – 0 . After Labine walked to get on base , there was a rain delay , and play did not resume until that night . 
 After the game resumed , Labine scored on back @-@ to @-@ back singles by Reese and Snider . The Giants then came up to bat , failing to earn a hit as the score became 6 – 0 after six innings . To start the seventh inning , Al Corwin replaced Bill Rigney for the Giants , who had pinch hit for Spencer . Andy Pafko hit a home run to start the inning , and Hodges walked ; he later scored on the fifth and final error made by the Giants to make the score 8 – 0 . The bottom of the seventh and the eighth inning passed without a hit . In the ninth inning , Walker hit a home run , the fourth of the game , to make the score 10 – 0 . The Giants failed to get a hit in the bottom of the ninth , ending the game . Labine pitched a six @-@ hit shutout , not allowing a hit in the final four innings as the series went to a deciding third game .

 Game three was also held at the Polo Grounds . With each team having won one game , it was time for a matchup between the two teams ' ace pitchers . Sal Maglie was on the mound for New York , while Brooklyn called on Don Newcombe ; both pitchers had winning records against the opposing team heading into the matchup . After Maglie walked two batters in the top of the first inning , Jackie Robinson singled , scoring the game 's first run when Pee Wee Reese crossed home plate . No further hits were allowed until the bottom of the second , when Whitey Lockman and Bobby Thomson singled ; neither scored , and it remained 1 – 0 through two innings . 
 The game then became a pitcher 's duel ; Maglie and Newcombe did not allow a hit in the third or fourth innings . In the fifth , Billy Cox singled on a bunt , and Thomson hit a double , but the score remained 1 – 0 through five innings . Duke Snider singled in the sixth inning , but was caught stealing second . Neither team got another hit until the seven inning . Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers , and Monte Irvin led off the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants . He reached third base after a bunt , and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson , tying the score at one run each . 
 In the top of the eighth , the Dodgers scored three runs off Maglie . Reese and Snider hit back @-@ to @-@ back singles , and Maglie threw a wild pitch , allowing Reese to score . After Robinson was walked , Andy Pafko hit a single to score Snider . Cox added another single to score Robinson before the inning ended , making made the score 4 – 1 in favor of the Dodgers . Newcombe got the Giants out in order in the bottom of the eighth , and Larry Jansen did the same in relief of Maglie in the top of the ninth . 
 Alvin Dark led off with a single in the bottom of the ninth , and Don Mueller followed with another . After Monte Irvin popped out to first base , Whitey Lockman hit a double to left @-@ center field , scoring Dark and putting Mueller on third . Upon sliding into third , Mueller sprained his ankle and had to leave the game . As Mueller went to the locker room , Dodger manager Chuck Dressen summoned game 1 starter Ralph Branca in to relieve Newcombe on only one day 's rest . Bobby Thomson came up to bat , and on Branca 's second pitch , Thomson drove a pitch to deep left field for a walk @-@ off home run to clinch the pennant for the Giants . This home run came to be known as the " Shot Heard ' Round the World " as the Giants won the National League pennant , advancing to the World Series . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The following day , sportswriter Red Smith opened his recap of the game for the New York Herald Tribune with the following lead : " Now it is done . Now the story ends . And there is no way to tell it . The art of fiction is dead . Reality has strangled invention . Only the utterly impossible , the inexpressibly fantastic , can ever be plausible again . " After winning the pennant , the Giants lost to the Yankees in the World Series four games to two . The Brooklyn Dodgers rebounded to win the National League pennant in 1952 , but lost the 1952 World Series to the Yankees four games to three . 
 The three games counted statistically as regular season games . As a result , Hodges and Furillo led the league with 158 games played , which could not have been equaled by anyone but a Brooklyn or New York player . Monte Irvin increased his runs batted in total to 121 , leading the NL that year . Larry Jansen 's win in the final game gave him 23 wins on the year , tying him for the MLB lead with Maglie ; had he finished the game he would have led all of baseball with 24 . Newcombe 's two strikeouts in game three totalled 164 on the season for him , tying him for the NL lead with Warren Spahn and the MLB lead with Spahn and Vic Raschi . Campanella finished the season with a .325 batting average , 33 doubles , 33 home runs , and 108 runs batted in , and won the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award at the end of the season . Mays finished the season with a .274 batting average , 22 doubles , and 20 home runs in 121 games , and won the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award . 
 In 2001 , Journalist Joshua Prager published that the Giants secretly learned opponents ' finger signals , when several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20 , 1951 , the team used a telescope and buzzer wire to steal the finger signals of opposing catchers careless enough to leave their signs unprotected . Giants catcher Sal <unk> told Prager that he relayed to Thomson the stolen sign for Branca 's fastball . Thomson always insisted that he had no foreknowledge of Branca 's pitch . Branca had been aware of the rumors and was skeptical of Thomson 's denial , but later told The New York Times in 2001 , " I didn 't want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball . And even if Bobby knew what was coming , he had to hit it .... Knowing the pitch doesn 't always help . "

 = 6th Airborne Division in Palestine = 
 The 6th Airborne Division in Palestine was initially posted to the region as the Imperial Strategic Reserve . It was envisioned as a mobile peace keeping force , positioned to be able to respond quickly to any area of the British Empire . In fact the division became involved in an internal security role between 1945 and 1948 . 
 Palestine had been a British Mandate since the end of World War I. Under the terms of the mandate , Great Britain was responsible for the government and security of the country . It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250 @,@ 000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country . However , Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration . The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement , which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities . 
 When the British 6th Airborne Division arrived in response to increasing terrorist activity , it became involved in internal security , being responsible for cordons and search operations , guarding convoys and key installations . As the situation worsened , the men of the division had to patrol the towns and cities , enforce curfews and deal with rioting by the civilian population . They also protected Jewish and Arab settlements from sectarian violence . This was not without loss to the division and several members were killed and wounded during this time . 
 The end of the British mandate coincided with the post war reduction of the British Army back to peace time levels , and the division 's numbers were gradually reduced . By the end of their tenure in Palestine , the division 's strength was reduced in real terms , to less than brigade size . In 1948 it was disbanded soon after its withdrawal from Palestine . 
 = = Background = = 
 In July 1922 , the British Mandate of Palestine was created . Under the terms of the mandate , Great Britain was responsible for the government and defence of the country and for the establishment of a Jewish homeland . Then in September 1922 , the League of Nations and Great Britain decided that any Jewish homeland would not be formed in the land to the east of the River Jordan . This instead became a separate country known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan . 
 Encouraged by the British , 265 @,@ 000 Jewish immigrants , mainly from Europe , came to settle in Palestine between 1919 and 1939 . Arab resistance and violence to this influx of immigrants came to a head in 1937 , and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed , one Arab and one Jewish , which would divide the country between them . Then in May 1939 , the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75 @,@ 000 in the White Paper of 1939 . 
 By the end of 1945 , Jewish immigration had almost reached the 75 @,@ 000 White Paper limit . Arab concerns led to the British putting further restrictions on immigration . Even when the scale of the Holocaust became known , the British stance remained the same . This led to an inevitable confrontation between the British authorities , illegal Jewish immigrants , and militant Zionist groups . It became a widespread belief within the Jewish community that the British were practising antisemitism and were no different from Nazi Germany . However , between 1945 and 1948 a further 85 @,@ 000 Jewish immigrants , mostly survivors of the Holocaust , entered the country illegally . 
 = = = Jewish resistance movements = = = 
 During this time the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed , comprising several pre @-@ existing Jewish groups . In 1921 , the part @-@ time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army . Most Jewish males and some females were required to join . After the Second World War , it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members . The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe . It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated . 
 When Axis forces posed a threat to the Middle East in the Second World War , the Haganah organized a full @-@ time , elite force , the Palmach . By 1947 , this organization numbered around 2 @,@ 200 members . Palmach members were subject to military discipline ; many of them had served in the British forces during the war . 
 In 1937 , a splinter group was formed by those not happy with the Haganah methods . This group was called the National Military Organization in the Land of Israel or Irgun in short . It launched a campaign of violence against the government in 1944 , carrying out several terrorist attacks . By 1945 , Irgun had an estimated membership of 1 @,@ 500 . A third group was the Lehi , the Hebrew acronym of " Fighters for the Freedom of Israel " , known in the British press as the Stern Gang . Lehi membership consisted of only around fifty men . It was the only Jewish group that contemplated working with the Italians and Germans during the war , and afterwards assassinated members of the British authorities . By 1946 , both the Irgun and Lehi had declared war on Great Britain . 
 = = = British 6th Airborne Division = = = 
 Despite its name , the 6th Airborne Division was one of only two airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War . Before being deployed to Palestine , the division had served only in Europe . It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later the Battle of the Bulge in December . After the Rhine crossing in March 1945 , it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea . 
 At the end of the war in Europe , it had been planned to send the division to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division . However , the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and the Japanese surrender , ended the war and changed British plans . The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve . Together with a Royal Air Force troop @-@ carrier formation , they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire . Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft , 620 and 644 , available to provide troop transport . 
 By September 1945 , the division was en route to the region for airborne training . However , conditions in Palestine were deteriorating . By the time the division arrived , instead of training , it was deployed on internal security . 
 During the Second World War , the division comprised the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade , both consisting of parachute infantry , and the 6th Airlanding Brigade , composed of glider infantry . However the 5th Parachute Brigade had been sent to ] India ahead of the rest of the division . So when the division was dispatched to the Middle East , the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength . In May 1946 , after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded , the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division , replacing the 6th Airlanding Brigade . In August 1946 , the 5th Parachute Brigade returned from the Far East , and joined the division , but was disbanded soon afterwards . The next major manpower development came in 1947 , when the 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2nd Parachute Brigade , while remaining part of the division , was withdrawn to England , then sent to Germany .

 Still commanded by its last wartime commander , Major General Eric Bols , the division began deployment to Palestine in 1945 . The advance party arrived on 15 September , followed by the Tactical Headquarters on 24 September , then the 3rd Parachute Brigade on 3 October , the 6th Airlanding Brigade on 10 October and the 2nd Parachute Brigade on 22 October . After arriving by sea at Haifa , the newly arrived troops were sent to camps in the Gaza <unk> to acclimatize to the conditions , and to regain their fitness after the long sea journey from England . By the end of the month divisional headquarters was established at Bir Salim . The 2nd Parachute Brigade at remained at Gaza , the 3rd Parachute Brigade moved to the Tel Aviv and Jaffa region , while the 6th Airlanding Brigade moved to Samaria . 
 It was not long before the division became involved in operations , enforcing a night time curfew at the end of October after the railway in the divisional area was sabotaged . On 13 November the British Government confirmed they would examine the conditions of Jews in Europe and consult the Arabs to ensure Jewish immigration , at the time around 1 @,@ 500 persons a month , was not hindered . 
 Unhappy that the announcement did not go far enough , the Jewish National Council arranged a twelve @-@ hour strike for the next day . Rioting started in Tel Aviv and the Jewish part of Jerusalem , which resulted in the 3rd Parachute Brigade being deployed to patrol the streets for the following five days . 
 The first operation involving the 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over the night of 24 / 25 November . Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of <unk> and <unk> Ali . In the following cordon and search operation , the police were stoned by the inhabitants , and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages . The next day , 26 November , the police were involved in hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew , calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order . Leaving some men behind on the cordon to hold back the estimated 3 @,@ 000 crowd , the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements . Here they carried out several baton charges and for the first time used tear gas to disperse the crowds . In the cleanup operation , 900 persons were later arrested . 
 Near the end of the year , over the night of 26 / 27 December , several attacks were carried out by the Irgun on police stations , Palestine Railways installations and one British Army armoury . The 3rd Parachute Brigade again enforced a night time curfew on Tel Aviv . Then on 29 December , it took part in Operation Pintail , the search of Ramat Gan , for Irgun members involved in the attacks . The brigade questioned the 1 @,@ 500 inhabitants , arresting eighty @-@ nine . 
 = = = 1946 = = = 
 The first mission of 1946 was Operation Hebron on 8 January . This time the objective was the cordon and search of the town of Rishon LeZion by the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the police , during which fifty @-@ five suspects were taken into custody . For the rest of the month , the brigade was involved in several smaller operations . In Operation Pigeon on 30 January , they searched the Shapira district of Tel Aviv . 
 On 5 March Major General James Cassels took over command of the division . The next action involving the division was over the night of 2 / 3 April , when units of the Irgun attacked railway installations in the divisional area . While one attack on the Yibna railway station and police post was in progress , a mobile patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion arrived , detonating a mine while crossing a bridge . Three of the patrol were wounded , but the others took off after the saboteurs . Reinforcements arrived from the 5th and 6th Parachute Battalions . In the morning , tracks of around thirty men were discovered leading away from the area . A spotter plane later located the men and directed a section of the 8th Parachute Battalion to intercept them . After a small battle , fourteen of the saboteurs were wounded and twenty @-@ six prisoners taken . 
 In March the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division . The 6th Airlanding Brigade left the division on 13 April , but remained in Palestine as the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade . This reduced the division 's manpower by around twenty @-@ five per cent as the strength of the airlanding brigade had been almost equal to that of two parachute brigades combined . 
 At 20 : 45 on 25 April , the Lehi carried out an attack on a divisional car park in Tel Aviv . On that night , the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion . The attackers , around thirty men , established a fire base in a house overlooking the car park . The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent . Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area , then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park . Once inside the compound , they entered the guard tents , killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons . Another two off @-@ duty soldiers , responding to the attack , were killed approaching the car park . In total , seven men from the division were killed . 
 This was the first deliberate attack by any group targeting the British Army , which had not established defences against any form of assault . During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up , but no evidence of their involvement could be found . In response to the attack , the British imposed a road curfew from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 each night and all cafes , restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20 : 00 and 05 : 00 . However this was not enough for some members of the division , who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be 'er Tuvia , injuring some of the occupants . Those involved were later punished by the British Army . 
 Attacks on the security services had increased to a level that on 19 June all ranks were ordered to be armed at all times on or off duty , and to travel in pairs during the day and in threes at night . Near the end of June the division received orders for Operation Agatha , the arrest of Jewish leaders " suspected of condoning " or being involved in sabotage or murder of civil and military personnel . Agatha was a nationwide operation involving not only the 6th Airborne Division but the Palestinian Police Force and all other army units in the country . Secondary objectives were to gather intelligence and arrest any members of the Palmach that could be found . 
 Operation Agatha started at 04 : 15 on 29 June . The 2nd Parachute Brigade was responsible for Tel Aviv , the 1st Parachute Brigade for Jewish settlements around Ma <unk> and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for those around Givat Brenner . The operation ended on 1 July after 2 @,@ 718 suspects had been arrested . Many had no connection to the resistance movements and were instead arrested for harassing the searchers or for refusing to give their names when asked . The 6th Airborne Division alone arrested 636 persons , 135 of them for being suspected Palmach members and ten were Jewish leaders . 
 The next major incident was on 22 July , when the British administrative and military headquarters located in the King David Hotel were bombed . No members of the division were directly involved , but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in to take charge of the search for survivors and secure the part of the building left standing . Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety @-@ one victims . To assist in the search for those responsible , the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23 July . 
 The British response to the bombing came on 30 July , when the division carried out Operation Shark . Believing that the bombers were being sheltered in Tel Aviv , every dwelling and building was searched for members of the Lehi and Irgun , and the population questioned . During the operation , a cordon surrounded the city and a curfew was imposed on its inhabitants . To allow the population to buy food and other essentials , the curfew was lifted for two hours every second day , until the end of the operation . The division 's three parachute brigades were each given one quarter of the city to cordon and search while the fourth quarter was the responsibility of the 2nd Infantry Brigade , attached to the division for the operation . Over four days each brigade questioned around 100 @,@ 000 people , and 787 were detained for further questioning . During the searches , five arms dumps were found , containing four machine guns , twenty @-@ three mortars , 176 rifles and pistols , and 127 @,@ 000 round of ammunition . Also found were £ 50 @,@ 000 of forged bearer bonds , forging equipment and a large amount of explosives . 
 The division 's next operations were Bream and Eel , searching for arms in Dorot and Ruhama , by the 3rd and 8th Parachute Battalions , and the 9th Airborne Squadron Royal Engineers . The two villages were cordoned at dawn on 28 August . Over the next six days the settlements were searched , during which a large quantity of assorted weapons , including heavy machine guns and mortars , were found . 
 Over the remaining months of the year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks , which were being mined . Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them , until orders were issued to blow the mines up rather than disarm them . Then on 2 December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit ( Airborne ) . 
 A change in command occurred on 13 December when Major General Cassels left the division and was replaced by Eric Bols , now commanding the division for the second time . 
 = = = 1947 = = = 
 Between 29 December 1946 and 3 January the division 's brigades carried out seven search operations in Tel Aviv , arresting 191 people . On 2 January several attacks were made on roads in the division 's area . One attack wounded eight men of the 4th and 5th Parachute Battalions . Another attack on the same day was carried out by the Lehi against the 1st Parachute Battalion headquarters in Tel Aviv , killing a Jewish policeman and wounding two soldiers and another police officer . Then on 18 January the 6th Airborne and 1st Infantry Division swapped locations , the airborne division now assuming responsibility for the north of the country . Although it remained part of the division , the 2nd Parachute Brigade was withdrawn to England on 24 January . 
 Upon their arrival in the north , the 1st Parachute Brigade assumed responsibility for the District of Galilee , and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for the District of Haifa , with division headquarters located in the Stella Maris Monastery . The 1st Parachute Brigade also took under its command the Transjordan Frontier Force and a battalion of the Arab Legion to cover their large area . In the north the division was mainly responsible for the security of the port of Haifa , the largest in the country , where they protected oil installations , the Mosul @-@ Haifa oil pipeline and prevented illegal immigrants from landing on the coastline . On 31 January it was announced that all non @-@ essential British civilians were to be evacuated , due to the worsening situation . The evacuation took place from Haifa between 5 and 8 February , under the control of the 8th Parachute Battalion and the Royal Navy . 
 On 4 May a group of around forty men carried out the Acre Prison break , releasing forty @-@ one Jews and 214 Arabs . At the same time a mortar attack was carried out on the 2nd Parachute Battalion 's camp , as a diversion . The first unit to reach the prison was a platoon from the 1st Parachute Battalion , 35 minutes later . Other men from the battalion and some divisional units were bathing in the sea a short distance from the prison . A truck load of escaping prisoners opened fire on one unit 's armoured car . The escaping truck then reached an improvised road block set up by some bathers and crashed under fire . The division 's bathing party killed four attackers , four Jewish and one Arab escapee , and recaptured thirteen Jews . The bathers had eight men wounded during the short battle . While this was going on , the 1st Parachute Brigade was establishing a cordon around Acre and the surrounding area but no further escapees were caught . 
 The next attack was on officers from the 9th Parachute Battalion on 28 June . The officers were dining at a restaurant when two men of the Irgun approached and fired machine guns through the windows . One officer was killed outright while several others were wounded . The officers returned fire and the car the gunmen were escaping in crashed ; later examination revealed at least one of them had been wounded . On 19 July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were shot in the back and killed . The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew , which was not lifted until 30 July . 
 Leadership of the division changed again on 19 August , when Major General Hugh Stockwell was given command . In October the British War Office announced the division would be reduced by one brigade . The 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded , leaving the 1st Parachute Brigade in Palestine and the 2nd Parachute Brigade in England . The 1st Parachute Brigade assumed responsibility for Haifa and to cover all its commitments the 2nd Battalion Middlesex Regiment was attached to the brigade . 
 At a meeting on 29 November , the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1 August 1948 . Palestine would be partitioned into separate Arab and Jewish states , with Jerusalem becoming an international city . The Jewish state would have fifty @-@ six per cent of the land with a population of 490 @,@ 000 Jews and 325 @,@ 000 Arabs , while the Arab state would have 807 @,@ 000 Arabs , but only 10 @,@ 000 Jews . The population of Jerusalem would be around 105 @,@ 000 Arabs to 100 @,@ 000 Jews . 
 On 13 December trouble came from another quarter , in the town of Safed , opposite the Golan Heights . Fighting had started between the Arab and Jewish inhabitants . The police requested help from the army and a company from the 8th Parachute Battalion was assigned the task . Arabs fired at the British unit on 21 December without causing any injuries . 
 = = = 1948 = = = 
 Tension in the Golan Heights area remained high and on 9 January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar <unk> were attacked by Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army , who crossed the border from Syria . The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th / 21st Lancers to each village . By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in . The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing ; their casualties are not known . Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs , the British troops uninjured . 
 To assist in controlling the region , an ad @-@ hoc formation called <unk> was established . Under the command of the division 's commander , Royal Artillery Brigadier C. H. Colquhoun , were the division 's artillery , the 17th / 21st Lancers , the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Battalion Irish Guards . <unk> became involved with breaking up attacks between Arab and Jewish forces . The Arabs did not directly attack the British , but did engage them when British attempted to intervene in an attack on Jewish settlements . 
 In February the Arab Liberation Army , under the command of Fawzi al @-@ Qawuqji , was estimated to be around 10 @,@ 000 strong . It was believed around 1 @,@ 000 volunteers from neighbouring Arab states joined each month . 
 On 18 February it was announced that the 6th Airborne Division would be disbanded when they left Palestine . The 1st Parachute Brigade handed over Haifa to the 1st Guards Brigade on 6 April . Gradually the division 's units left the country . The division 's last units , comprising part of divisional headquarters , the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Airborne Squadron Royal Engineers , departed on 18 May . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Since the end of the Second World War , the campaign in the British Mandate of Palestine had cost the British 338 dead . The numbers for the 6th Airborne Division between October 1945 and April 1948 were fifty @-@ eight men dead and 236 wounded due to enemy action , a further ninety @-@ nine men died , from causes not associated with a hostile act . During their searches of Jewish and Arab settlements , men from the division had located 99 mortars , 34 machine guns , 174 sub machine guns , 375 rifles , 391 pistols , 97 land mines , 2 @,@ 582 hand grenades and 302 @,@ 530 rounds of ammunition . 
 In February 1948 the 2nd Parachute Brigade moved from England to Germany , becoming part of the British Army of the Rhine . The 6th Airborne Division was disbanded in April 1948 , shortly after their return to England , leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only brigade @-@ sized airborne formation in the British Army . 
 On 14 May , the day before the end of the British mandate , David Ben @-@ Gurion , chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine , announced the establishment of the state of Israel in parts of what was known as the British Mandate of Palestine . The announcement was the catalyst for the start of the 1948 Arab – Israeli War . 
 = Royal Standard of Scotland = 
 The Royal Banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland , also known as the Royal Banner of Scotland , or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland , and historically as the Royal Standard of Scotland , ( Scottish Gaelic : Bratach <unk> na h @-@ Alba , Scots : <unk> banner o Scotland ) or Banner of the King of Scots , is the Royal Banner of Scotland , and historically , the Royal Standard of the Kingdom of Scotland . Used historically by the King of Scots , the banner differs from Scotland 's national flag , the Saltire , in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland . It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present . 
 The earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222 ; with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III ( 1249 – 1286 ) . This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which , together with a royal banner displaying the same , was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603 , when James VI acceded to the thrones of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland . Since 1603 , the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland ; as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom . Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Sovereign and at royal residences , the Royal Banner continues to be one of Scotland 's most recognisable symbols . 
 = = Design = = 
 Displaying a red lion rampant , with blue tongue and claws , within a red double border on a yellow background , the design of the Royal Banner of Scotland is formally specified in heraldry as : Or , a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter @-@ flory of the second , meaning : A gold ( Or ) background , whose principal symbol is a red ( Gules ) upright lion ( lion rampant ) with blue ( Azure ) claws and tongue ( armed and langued ) , surrounded by a two @-@ lined border ( tressure ) decorated with opposing pairs of floral symbols ( flory counter @-@ flory ) of the second colour specified in the blazon ( Gules ) . Used as a house flag , its proportions are 5 : 4 ; however , flag manufacturers themselves may also adopt alternative ratios , including 1 : 2 or 2 : 3 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Lion rampant was legally used by King William I of Scotland as the great grandson of King Malcolm III Canmore . The Lion Rampant has been used as a heraldic symbol by Royal descendants of Malcolm III beginning with King David I of Scotland The Great Seal was also used by his 2nd great @-@ grandson , Alexander II ( 1214 – 1249 ) . Its use in Scotland originated during the reign of Malcolm III ( 1058 – 1093 ) , The Lion rampant motif is also used as a badge by those Irish clans who has lineage in common with Malcolm III . They are linked to the legendary Milesian genealogies . An earlier recorded Scottish royal standard featured a dragon , which was used at the Battle of the Standard in 1138 by David I ( 1124 – 1153 ) . 
 Following the Union of the Crowns of England , Ireland and Scotland in 1603 , the Royal Standard of Scotland was incorporated into the royal standards of successive Scottish then , following the Acts of Union in 1707 , British monarchs ; with all such royal standards being quartered to include the banner of the arms of each individual realm . Since 1603 , the Royal Banner of Scotland has appeared in both the first and fourth quarters of the quartered royal standard used in Scotland , while appearing only in the second quarter of that version used elsewhere .

 The Royal Banner of Scotland is used officially at the Scottish royal residences of the Palace of Holyroodhouse , Edinburgh , and Balmoral Castle , Aberdeenshire , when the Queen is not in residence . The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland is flown when the Sovereign is present . 
 = = = Use by representatives of the Sovereign = = = 
 In the tradition of Scottish heraldry , use of the Royal Standard of Scotland is not restricted to the Sovereign . Several Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland are permitted to use the Royal Banner of Scotland , including ; the First Minister of Scotland ( as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland ) , Lord Lieutenants within their respective <unk> , the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland , the Lord Lyon King of Arms and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by the Sovereign . 
 = = = Use by the Heir Apparent = = = 
 A variation of the Royal Standard of Scotland is used by the heir apparent to the King of Scots , the Duke of Rothesay , whose standard is the Royal Standard of Scotland defaced with an Azure coloured plain label of three points . The personal banner of the current Duke , Prince Charles , also features the same , displayed upon an inner shield . 
 = = = Legal status = = = 
 As the personal banner of the Sovereign , use of the Royal Banner of Scotland is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap . 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap . 17 , and any unauthorised use of such is an offence under the Act . In 1978 a St Albans linen merchant , Denis <unk> , was fined £ 100 daily for usurpation of the banner on decorative bedspreads until he desisted , and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non @-@ authorised use of the banner . Despite such action , the flag continues to feature on a variety of merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland 's economically important tourism industry . 
 In 1934 , George V issued a Royal Warrant authorising use of the Royal Banner of Scotland during the Silver Jubilee celebrations , due to take place the following year . However , such use was restricted to hand @-@ held flags for " decorative <unk> " as a mark of loyalty to the Sovereign ; the banner was not to be flown from flagpoles or public buildings . The use of hand @-@ held flags at state occasions , such as the opening of the Scottish Parliament , and at sporting events , continues to be authorised by this Royal Warrant , although according to former Lord Lyon Robin Blair , in an interview given to the Sunday Post in November 2007 , such use at sporting events " was not envisaged in 1935 " . 
 = = Appearance in other Royal Standards = = 
 As well as forming the basis of the standard of the Duke of Rothesay , the Royal Standard of Scotland has since 1603 been a component of what is now styled the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom ; both that version used exclusively in Scotland and that used elsewhere . It similarly appears in the Royal Standard of Canada , with the arms of Canada reflecting the royal symbols of England , Scotland , Ireland and France .

 The Flag of Scotland , also known as the Saint Andrew 's Cross or more commonly The Saltire , is the national flag of Scotland .

 " Petarded " is the sixth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Family Guy . It originally aired on Fox in the United States on June 19 , 2005 . It was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and directed by Seth Kearsley . The episode sees Peter taking the MacArthur Fellows Program to see if he is a genius . However , he performs so poorly that he is declared technically mentally retarded . Attempting to take advantage of the situation , he accidentally <unk> Lois while attempting to steal from a restaurant and loses custody of Meg , Chris , and Stewie . The episode 's title is a portmanteau between " Peter " and " Retarded " ; this title practice would later be used on a couple more episodes , namely " Peterotica " and " <unk> " . 
 " Timer " , a character from 1970s Saturday morning public service announcements , made an appearance in the episode . Series producers tried to get Lennie Weinrib , the actor who had voiced him in the original cartoon segments , to make a guest appearance in the episode . However , Weinrib declined reprising the role as he could not accurately recall the character . " Petarded " gained a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 4 , making it the week 's 42nd most @-@ watched program . Critics and news sources responded with high praise and many highly regard this episode as one of Family Guy 's best . Various scenes in the episode were removed by broadcast censors , including one musical number ( " Peter is Slow " ) . It features the guest performances of LeVar Burton , Gary Cole , Barclay DeVeau , Indigo , Phil LaMarr , Cloris Leachman , Len Maxwell , Natasha Melnick , Nicole Sullivan , and Lisa Wilhoit , as well as several recurring voice actors for the series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Griffins invite their neighbors over for game night . While playing Trivial Pursuit , Lois uses questions from the preschool edition for Peter in order to let him win . When Peter wins , he brags to everyone , believing himself to be smarter than everyone else . Irritated at Peter 's arrogance , Brian challenges Peter to take the MacArthur Fellows Program test to prove he is a genius . The results of the test show that Peter is not a genius ; in fact , the results show that , technically speaking , Peter is " mentally retarded . " Peter sinks into depression after being publicly labeled as retarded . While driving home with Lois , Peter accidentally knocks down Tom Tucker . Tucker , recognizing Peter as " the retarded fellow , " does not press charges , and Peter realizes his condition means he can get away with anything . 
 While testing the limits of what he can get away with , such as interrupting church attendants by having a Bible fight , kicking open the stall doors in a girls ' bathroom , and saying " testicles " through a microphone at a fast food restaurant , Peter goes behind the counter and sees a " <unk> " and wants to take it home . However , he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil . While she is recovering , Child Protection Services take away Peter 's custody of Meg , Chris , and Stewie on the grounds that Peter is mentally unfit to look after them . The three are placed in the care of Cleveland . When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent , Peter thinks that the best way to do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is , so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland ’ s house . This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out . In a last attempt , he appeals to the court for custody of the children , but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist . 
 After returning home and accepting that the Griffins may never be together again , Lois walks in , revealing she has completely recovered and <unk> custody of the children . Peter is overjoyed that everything is back to normal , as well as the fact that Lois will smell like French fries for the next six months . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Petarded " was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and directed by former The Goode Family director Seth Kearsley before the conclusion of the fourth production season . Despite Sulkin and Wild writing the episode , the idea for " Petarded " came from series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane . The episode featured an appearance by " Timer " , a character from 1970s Time for Timer Saturday morning cartoon public service announcements . Seth MacFarlane attempted to hire Lennie Weinrib , the actor who provided his voice for the character to appear in " Petarded " but , as MacFarlane describes in the DVD commentary , " he was a little old [ ... ] and he didn 't remember doing it " . Weinrib died one year after the debut of " Petarded " . 
 In the original draft of the episode , Peter being asked easy questions during Trivial Pursuit was meant to be by chance , but executive producer David A. Goodman proposed the storyline of easy questions being given to Peter by Lois . Prior to the episode broadcast , several sequences were shown after Peter discovers he can get away with anything on the basis that he is mentally challenged including a " how loud can I yell " experiment , as well as tackling down an opponent going for a touchdown while attending a New England Patriots game , but they were not deemed funny enough and scrapped . 
 Various scenes in the episode were changed or removed because of broadcast censors . Originally , just after Peter hands Brian his test results from the MacArthur Program , Peter was to ask " Would a retarded person have <unk> in their pants ? " , then urinate in his trousers . However , because broadcasting standards prohibited this , it was changed to " Well , would a mentally retarded guy have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house in celebration of his fantastic test results ? " . Brian stating to Peter " In your fucking face , <unk> " after Peter performs poorly on the test was censored from television broadcasting and on the censored track on the DVD , but can be heard uncensored on the uncensored audio track . This marks the first time that the word " fuck " has been heard uncensored in a Family Guy episode . The Family Guy orchestra sung and recorded a song for a sequence which showed several Quahog citizens learning and talking about Peter being declared as retarded . However , this was removed from the episode because broadcasting standards believed it used the word " retarded " too many times . After Peter loses custody of the kids , Chris was originally to stay with Mort Goldman , Stewie with Cleveland and Meg with Quagmire . During this original sequence , Mort was to tell Chris that he has two anuses , causing Quagmire to force Meg to lock him in a safe room as he could not trust himself around Meg 's friends , but the series was prohibited from broadcasting it by an unknown authority , presumably broadcasting standards . 
 In the episode 's DVD commentary , MacFarlane addressed what viewers perceived to be a rather abrupt ending to the episode . As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back , Lois walks through the front door , returning from the hospital , and has brought the kids home with her . MacFarlane stated , " Some of the fans actually noticed , commented on the fact that this was a very abrupt resolution , but , to that I would say , you 're not watching CSI [ ... ] wouldn 't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time , and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute ? " . 
 In addition to the regular cast , actor LeVar Burton , voice actor Gary Cole , actress Barclay DeVeau , actress Indigo , voice actor Phil LaMarr , actress Cloris Leachman , actor Len Maxwell , actress Natasha Melnick , voice actress Nicole Sullivan , and actress Lisa Wilhoit guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actors Johnny Brennan , Ralph Garman , writer Mike Henry , writer Danny Smith , writer Alec Sulkin , and writer John Viener made minor appearances . Recurring guest cast member Patrick Warburton reprised his role of Joe Swanson in the episode . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode is based on the 1985 movie Mask , a film about Roy L. Dennis who suffered from a rare bone disorder . 
 Lois is seen having developed a tumor due to constantly repressing negative thoughts about having married a mentally retarded man . The tumor sings an altered version of the 1985 Falco song " Rock Me Amadeus " . 
 Peter is shown taking the MacArthur Fellows Program ( also known as the " MacArthur Genius Grant " ) in his attempt to prove to Brian that he is a genius . When Peter takes the test , he uses a See ' n ' Say instead of a calculator . 
 The Time for Timer character shown singing and dancing is a reference to public service announcements broadcast in the 1970s on ABC on Saturday mornings ( referencing in particular the well @-@ known " I <unk> for a Hunk of Cheese " episode ) . When Peter thought what he would do with all his money from the MacArthur Genius Grant , he thought of legally buying Cloris Leachman , forcing her to juggle . Also on the Season 4 DVD commentary , Seth MacFarlane explained he wanted to hire Lennie Weinrib to reprise Timer for the gag , but Weinrib was suffering from failing health when " Petarded " was being produced and as MacFarlane explained , he " didn 't remember doing it . " Indeed , Lennie Weinrib died about a year after " Petarded " first aired . 
 A deleted scene showing Quahog residents singing about Peter being retarded was a reference to music from Bye Bye Birdie . 
 When Peter is talking about how it was more out of place than when Stewie was in an iPod commercial , the song performed is " The Warrior " by Scandal .

 = Kepler @-@ 11b = 
 Kepler @-@ 11b is an exoplanet discovered around the star Kepler @-@ 11 by the Kepler spacecraft , a NASA @-@ led mission to discover Earth @-@ like planets . Kepler @-@ 11b is less than about three times as massive and twice as large as Earth , but it has a lower density ( ≤ 3 g / cm3 ) , and is thus most likely not of Earth @-@ like composition . Kepler @-@ 11b is the hottest of the six planets in the Kepler @-@ 11 system , and orbits more closely to Kepler @-@ 11 than the other planets in the system . Kepler @-@ 11b , along with its five counterparts , form the first discovered planetary system with more than three transiting planets — the most densely packed known planetary system . The system is also the flattest known planetary system . The discovery of this planet and its five sister planets was announced on February 2 , 2011 , after follow @-@ up investigations . 
 = = Naming and discovery = = 
 Kepler @-@ 11b is named in two parts . The first part of its name is derived from the fact that it orbits the star Kepler @-@ 11 . As the discovery of Kepler @-@ 11b was announced simultaneously with those of other planets , Kepler @-@ 11b was given the designation b because it was the innermost of the six announced planets . The host star , Kepler @-@ 11 , was named for the Kepler Mission that flagged it as host to several potential transit events under the name KOI @-@ 157 . The Kepler satellite is a NASA @-@ run space telescope that is tasked with the discovery of terrestrial planets that transit , or cross in front of , their host stars as seen from Earth . These transits cause fluctuations in the host star 's brightness ; these changes may suggest the presence of a planet , which can then be verified by follow @-@ up observations . 
 Ground @-@ based telescopes in California , Hawaii , the Canary Islands , Arizona , and Texas , as well as the Spitzer Space Telescope , were used to conduct these follow @-@ up observations and verify Kepler @-@ 11b 's existence . In particular , the detection of an orbital resonance effect between Kepler @-@ 11b and Kepler @-@ 11c confirmed the find . Kepler @-@ 11b 's discovery was announced to the public on February 2 , 2011 . It is part of the first system discovered with more than three transiting planets , and is also part of the most compact and flat system yet discovered . Kepler @-@ 11 's planetary system is the second known system to have multiple transiting planets , surpassing the three confirmed planets ( two transiting ) orbiting the star Kepler @-@ 9 . 
 = = Host star = = 
 Kepler @-@ 11 is a sunlike star in the constellation Cygnus that has a mass of 0 @.@ 95 ( ± 0 @.@ 1 ) Msun and a radius of 1 @.@ 1 ( ± 0 @.@ 1 ) Rsun . In other words , Kepler @-@ 11 is approximately 5 % less massive and 10 % wider than the Sun . The star 's metallicity is 0 ( ± 0 @.@ 1 ) , meaning that the level of iron ( and , presumably , other elements ) in the star is almost the same as that of the Sun . Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems , and stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets detected around them . This may be because the higher metallicity provides more material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star , making the planet easier to detect . The star has five other known planets in orbit : Kepler @-@ 11c , Kepler @-@ 11d , Kepler @-@ 11e , Kepler @-@ 11f , and Kepler @-@ 11g . The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury , while Kepler @-@ 11g orbits further out . 
 Kepler @-@ 11 has an apparent magnitude of 14 @.@ 2 . It is too dim to see from Earth with the naked eye . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Kepler @-@ 11b is estimated to be ≤ 3 @.@ 3 Earth masses and 1 @.@ 8 Earth radii , making it around three times ( or less ) as massive and nearly twice as large as Earth . While the radius of Kepler @-@ 11b is fairly well known ( with a range of likely radii between 1 @.@ 75 and 1 @.@ 83 Earth radii ) , the mass is not as well constrained , with a range between 0 @.@ 9 and 3 @.@ 3 Earth masses . The mass is determined using transit timing variations of Kepler @-@ 11c , and is limited by the quality of the data . Kepler @-@ 11b is the closest planet to its host star in the Kepler @-@ 11 planetary system . With an estimated density of 1 @.@ 7 g / cm3 , comparable to Neptune 's , Kepler @-@ 11b is denser than the solar system 's gas giants but significantly less dense than the terrestrial planets . The estimated density range suggests that it is not of Earth @-@ like composition , yet it is nonetheless composed mostly of elements heavier than helium . The planet 's effective temperature is 900 K , and is thus the hottest of the planets discovered in the Kepler @-@ 11 system . Kepler @-@ 11b orbits its host star every 10 @.@ <unk> days at a distance of <unk> AU . Planet Mercury , in comparison , orbits the Sun every 87 @.@ 97 days from a distance of .387 AU . Kepler @-@ 11b 's inclination of 88 @.@ 5 ° means that it deviates slightly from the orbital plane , but it does so more than the other five planets with which Kepler @-@ 11b was discovered . Its close proximity to the star implies a strong insolation , which caused the planet to lose all of light @-@ element envelope acquired during formation . The observed low density does require the presence of a gaseous envelope though , which was most likely produced via outgassing of hydrogen or evaporation of H2O from the condensed core . 
 Kepler @-@ 11b and Kepler @-@ 11c orbit Kepler @-@ 11 with a strong orbital resonance , which gravitationally tugs the planets into stable orbits at a set ratio . The ratio of the resonance between Kepler @-@ 11b and c is 5 : 4 . 
 = The Cat and the Canary ( 1927 film ) = 
 The Cat and the Canary is a 1927 American silent horror film adaptation of John Willard 's 1922 black comedy play of the same name . Directed by German Expressionist filmmaker Paul Leni , the film stars Laura La Plante as Annabelle West , Forrest Stanley as Charles " Charlie " Wilder , and Creighton Hale as Paul Jones . The plot revolves around the death of Cyrus West , who is Annabelle , Charlie , and Paul 's uncle , and the reading of his will 20 years later . Annabelle inherits her uncle 's fortune , but when she and her family spend the night in his haunted mansion they are stalked by a mysterious figure . Meanwhile , a lunatic known as " the Cat " escapes from an asylum and hides in the mansion . 
 The film is part of a genre of comedy horror films inspired by 1920s Broadway stage plays . Paul Leni 's adaptation of Willard 's play blended expressionism with humor , a style Leni was notable for and critics recognized as unique . Leni 's style of directing made The Cat and the Canary influential in the " old dark house " genre of films popular from the 1930s through the 1950s . The film was one of Universal 's early horror productions and is considered " the cornerstone of Universal 's school of horror . " The play has been filmed five other times , with the most notable in 1939 starring comedic actor Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In a decaying mansion overlooking the Hudson River , millionaire Cyrus West approaches death . His greedy family descends upon him like " cats around a canary " , causing him to become insane . West orders that his last will and testament remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death . As the appointed time arrives , West 's lawyer , Roger Crosby ( Tully Marshall ) , discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe . The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled . The caretaker of the West mansion , Mammy Pleasant ( Martha Mattox ) , blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West , a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects . 
 As midnight approaches , West 's relatives arrive at the mansion : nephews Harry Blythe ( Arthur Edmund Carewe ) , Charles " Charlie " Wilder , Paul Jones , his sister Susan <unk> ( Flora Finch ) and her niece Cecily Young ( Gertrude Astor ) , and niece Annabelle West . Cyrus West 's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name West : Annabelle . The will , however , stipulates that to inherit the fortune , she must be judged sane by a doctor , Ira Lazar ( Lucien Littlefield ) . If she is deemed insane , the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will . The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago . Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle , " in a cage surrounded by cats . " 
 While the family prepares for dinner , a guard ( George Siegmann ) barges in and announces that an escaped lunatic called the Cat is either in the house or on the grounds . The guard tells Cecily , " He 's a maniac who thinks he 's a cat , and tears his victims like they were canaries ! " Meanwhile , Crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm Annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor . Before he speaks the person 's name , a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in , terrifying Annabelle . When she explains what happened to Crosby , the family immediately concludes that she is insane . 
 Alone in her assigned room , Annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels , fashioned into an elaborate necklace . She follows the note 's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place , in a secret panel above the fireplace . She retires for the night , wearing the diamond @-@ encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn . 
 While Annabelle sleeps , the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck . Once again , her sanity is questioned , but as Harry and Annabelle search the room , they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby . Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police , while Harry searches for the guard ; Susan runs away in hysterics and hitches a ride with a milkman ( Joe Murphy ) . Paul and Annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope , and discover that Crosby 's body is missing . Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him . Wandering in the hidden passages , Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead . He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle . The police arrive and arrest the Cat , who is Charlie Wilder in disguise ; the guard is his accomplice . Wilder is the person named in the second will ; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance .

 The Cat and the Canary is the product of early 20th century German expressionism . According to art historian Joan Weinstein , expressionism is a loosely defined term that includes the art styles of Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter , cubism , futurism , and abstraction . The key element that connects these styles is the concern for the expression of inner feelings over verisimilitude to nature . Film historian Richard Peterson notes that " German cinema became famous for stories of psychological horror and for uncanny moods generated through lighting , set design and camera angles . " Such filmmaking techniques drew on expressionist themes . Influential examples of German expressionist film include Robert Wiene 's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ( 1920 ) about a deranged doctor and Paul Leni 's Waxworks ( 1925 ) about a wax figure display at a fair . 
 Waxworks impressed Carl Laemmle , the German @-@ born president of Universal Pictures . Laemmle was struck by Leni 's departure from expressionism by the inclusion of humor and playfulness during grotesque scenes . Meanwhile , in the United States , D. W. Griffith 's One Exciting Night ( 1922 ) began a Gothic horror film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on ; subsequent films in the genre like Alfred E. Green 's now lost The Ghost Breaker ( 1922 ) , Frank Tuttle 's Puritan Passions ( 1923 ) , Roland West 's The Monster ( 1925 ) and The Bat ( 1926 ) , and Alfred Santell 's The Gorilla ( 1927 ) — all comedy horror film adaptations of Broadway stage plays — proved successful . 
 Laemmle turned to John Willard 's popular play The Cat and the Canary , which centered on an heiress whose family tries to drive her insane to steal her inheritance . Willard hesitated in permitting Laemmle to film his play because , as historian Douglas Brode explains , " that would have exposed to virtually everyone the trick ending , ... destroying the play 's potential as an ongoing moneymaker . " Nevertheless , Willard was convinced and the play was adapted into a screenplay by Alfred A. Cohn and Robert F. Hill .

 The Cat and the Canary features veteran silent film stars Laura La Plante , Creighton Hale , and Forrest Stanley . La Plante played roles in more than 50 films before starring in The Cat and the Canary . According to film historian Gary Don Rhodes , her part in The Cat and the Canary was typical for women in horror and mystery films : " The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted , the quarry . She has little to do , and so the question becomes ' What will be done with her ? ' " Rhodes adds , " The heroines are young and beautiful , but represent more a prize to be possessed — whether ' stolen ' by a villain or ' owned ' by a young hero at the film 's conclusion . " Following The Cat and the Canary , La Plante maintained a career with Universal , but she is described as a " victim of talkies . " She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before her death in 1996 from Alzheimer 's disease . 
 Universal chose Irish actor Creighton Hale to play hero Paul Jones , Annabelle 's cousin . Hale had appeared in 64 silent films before The Cat and the Canary , notably the 1914 serial The Exploits of Elaine and D. W. Griffith 's Way Down East ( 1920 ) and Orphans of the Storm ( 1921 ) . Hale 's role in The Cat and the Canary was to provide comedic relief . According to critic John Howard Reid , " He is forever backing into furniture or finding himself in a risqué position under a bed or wrestling with stray objects like falling books or enormous bed @-@ springs . " Hale had trouble finding a solid career in sound film . Many of his parts were minor and uncredited . 
 The villain Charles Wilder was played by Forrest Stanley , an actor who had been cast in films such as <unk> ( 1923 ) , Through the Dark ( 1924 ) and Shadow of the Law ( 1926 ) . After his performance in The Cat and the Canary , Stanley played lesser roles in films such as Show Boat ( 1936 ) and Curse of the Undead ( 1959 ) and the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents , Studio 57 , and Gunsmoke . 
 The film contained a supporting cast referred to by one film historian as " second @-@ rate " and " excellent " by another . Tully Marshall played the suspicious lawyer Roger Crosby , Martha Mattox was cast as the sinister and superstitious housekeeper Mammy Pleasant , and Gertrude Astor and Flora Finch played greedy relatives Cecily Young and Aunt Susan <unk> , respectively . Lucien Littlefield was cast as deranged psychiatrist Dr. Ira Lazar who bore an eerie resemblance to Werner Krauss 's title character in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari .

 As Universal anticipated , director Paul Leni turned Willard 's play into an expressionist film suited to an American audience . Historian Bernard F. Dick observes that " Leni reduced German expressionism , with its weird chiaroscuro , asymmetric sets , and excessive stylization , to a format compatible with American film practice . " Jenn <unk> argues that " many stage play movie adaptations [ of the 1920s ] fall into the trap of looking like ' a stage play taped for the big screen ' with minimal emphasis on the environment and plenty of stage play overacting . " This , however , was not the case for Leni 's film . Richard Scheib notes that " Leni 's style is something that lifts The Cat and the Canary up and away from being merely a filmed stage play and gives it an amazing visual dynamism . " 
 Leni used similar camera effects found in German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari to set the atmosphere of The Cat and the Canary . The film opens with a hand wiping cobwebs away to reveal the title credits . Other effects include " dramatic shadows , portentous superimpositions and moody sequences in which the camera glides through corridors with billowing curtains . " Film historian Jan @-@ Christopher Horak explains that a " matched dissolve from an image of the mansion and its oddly shaped towers to the oversized bottles of medicine that the dearly departed has been forced to consume functions as a double image of a prison , dwarfing the old man who sits alive with his will in a corner of the frame . " Leni worked with the cast to add to the mood created by lighting and camera angles . Cinematographer Gilbert Warrenton recalled that Leni used a gong to startle the actors . Warrenton mused , " He beat that thing worse than the Salvation Army beat a drum . " 
 While the film contains elements of horror , according to film historian Dennis L. White it " is structured with an end other than horror in mind . Some scenes may achieve horror , and some characters dramatically experience horror , but for these films conventional clues and a logical explanation , at least an explanation plausible in hindsight , are usually crucial , and are of necessity their makers ' first concern . " 
 Besides directing , Leni was a painter and set designer . The sets of the film were designed by Leni and fabricated by Charles D. Hall , who later designed the sets of Dracula ( 1931 ) and Frankenstein ( 1931 ) . Leni hoped to eschew realism for visual designs that reflected the emotions of characters . He wrote , " It is not extreme reality that the camera perceives , but the reality of the inner event , which is more profound , effective and moving than what we see through everyday eyes .... " Leni went on to direct the Charlie Chan film The Chinese Parrot ( 1927 ) , The Man Who Laughs ( 1928 ) , and The Last Warning ( 1929 ) before his death in 1929 from blood poisoning . 
 = = Reception and influence = = 
 The Cat and the Canary debuted in New York City 's Colony Theatre on September 9 , 1927 , and was a " box office success " . Variety opined , " What distinguishes Universal 's film version of the ... play is Paul Leni 's intelligent handling of a weird theme , introducing some of his novel settings and ideas with which he became identified .... The film runs a bit overlong .... Otherwise it 's a more than average satisfying feature .... " A New York Times review expounded , " This is a film which ought to be exhibited before many other directors to show them how a story should be told , for in all that he does Mr. Leni does not seem to strain at a point . He does it as naturally as a man twisting the ends of his mustache in thought . " Nonetheless , as film historian Bernard F. Dick points out , " [ e ] <unk> of <unk> , expressionism in the extreme ... naturally thought Leni had vulgarized the conventions [ of expressionism ] " . Dick , however , notes that Leni had only " lighten [ ed ] [ expressionist themes ] so they could enter American cinema without the baggage of a movement that had spiraled out of control . " 
 Modern critics address the film 's impact and influence . Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice remarks , " [ Leni 's ] adroitly atmospheric film is virtually an ideogram of narrative suspension and impact " ; Chris Dashiell states that " [ e ] verything is so exaggerated , so lacking in subtlety , that we soon stop caring what happens , despite a few mildly scary effects " , although he admits that the film " had a great effect on the horror genre , and even Hitchcock cited it as an influence . " Tony Rayns has called the film " the definitive ' haunted house ' movie .... Leni wisely plays it mainly for laughs , but his prowling , Murnau @-@ like camera work generates a frisson or two along the way . It is , in fact , hugely entertaining .... " John Calhoun feels that what makes the film both " important and influential " was " Leni 's uncanny ability to bring out the period 's slapstick elements in the story 's hackneyed conventions : the sliding panels and disappearing acts are so fast paced and expertly timed that the picture looks like a first @-@ rate door @-@ slamming farce .... At the same time , Leni didn 't short @-@ circuit the horrific aspects .... " 
 Although not the first film set in a supposed haunted house , The Cat and the Canary started the pattern for the " old dark house " genre . The term is derived from English director James Whale 's The Old Dark House ( 1932 ) , which was heavily influenced by Leni 's film , and refers to " films in which murders are committed by masked killers in old mansions . " Supernatural events in the film are all explained at the film 's conclusion as the work of a criminal . Other films in this genre influenced by The Cat and the Canary include The Last Warning , House on Haunted Hill ( 1959 ) , and the monster films of Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy .

 The Cat and the Canary has been filmed five other times . Rupert Julian 's The Cat Creeps ( 1930 ) and the Spanish language La <unk> del muerto ( The Will of the Dead Man ) directed by George Melford and Enrique Tovar <unk> were the first talkie versions of the play ; they were produced and distributed by Universal Pictures in 1930 . Although the first sound films produced by Universal , neither was as influential on the genre as the first film and The Cat Creeps is lost . 
 The plot had become too familiar , as film historian Douglas Brode notes , and it " seemed likely the play would be put away in a drawer [ indefinitely ] . " Yet Elliott Nugent 's film , The Cat and the Canary ( 1939 ) , proved successful . Nugent " had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs . " The film was produced by Paramount and starred comedic actor Bob Hope . Hope played Wally Campbell , a character based on Creighton Hale 's performance as Paul Jones . One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging . In later years , Universal themselves acquired the rights to the 1939 version . 
 Other film adaptations include Katten och <unk> ( The Cat and the Canary ) , a 1961 Swedish television film directed by Jan <unk> and The Cat and the Canary ( 1979 ) , a British film directed by Radley Metzger .

Nothing is known of him until 1323 , when he was pardoned by Andronikos II and sent again against the Turks , relieving a siege of Philadelphia , allegedly by his mere appearance . He was then named briefly governor of Lesbos in 1328 , and again in 1336 , when he recovered the island 's capital from Latin occupation . He ruled the island thereafter , probably until his death in the 1340s .

 Alexios was born circa 1270 as the second son of <unk> and megas domestikos Michael Tarchaneiotes . His mother , Maria , belonged to the noble family of the <unk> , which rose to prominence in the latter half of the 13th century . She was the daughter of prōtostratōr and megas doux Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos , after whom Alexios was named . On his father 's side , Alexios was also closely related to the imperial family of the Palaiologoi , through his grandmother , Martha Palaiologina , a sister of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos ( r . 1259 – 1261 ) . Alexios married Theodora <unk> , daughter of Constantine Akropolites and granddaughter of the historian George Akropolites . They had one child , Michael Philanthropenos , who also became a general . 
 = = = First command in Asia and uprising = = = 
 Alexios 's uncle , Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos ( r . 1282 – 1328 ) , took an active interest in the defence of the Anatolian possessions of the Byzantine Empire against the encroaching Turkic emirates in the early 1290s : hoping to re @-@ establish the <unk> , he settled refugees from Venetian @-@ held Crete in military colonies along the border and appointed Alexios as doux of the Thracesian theme , awarding him the high court title of <unk> . 
 Alexios commanded all of the Byzantine possessions in Asia , except for the Ionian coast , but his main area of responsibility was the interior of the old Thracesian Theme , which comprised the southeastern parts of Byzantine Anatolia . A certain Libadarios deputized for him in the northern provinces ( <unk> ) . During the next two years , Alexios achieved several victories : he defeated the Turks of Mysia at <unk> and forced them to recognize Byzantine rule , and then moved south . Based at <unk> , he scoured the valley of the Maeander river , managing to stop the Turkish raids and advance into the Emirate of <unk> , recapturing the fortress of Melanoudion , the town of <unk> , and rid Miletus of the payment of tribute to the Turks . Many Turks , fleeing from Mongol pressure , joined his army , and so many prisoners were made during his campaigns , that the monk and scholar Maximus <unk> , a friend of Alexios , wrote that " a sheep was more expensive to buy than a Muslim prisoner " . His successes made him popular with the locals , who reportedly began suggesting that he should make himself emperor . Philanthropenos at first refused to heed them and even asked Andronikos to transfer him away from Anatolia , but in vain . In mid @-@ 1294 , Philanthropenos was ordered by the emperor to transfer the region of Lydia to Libadarios 's control . In summer 1295 , while Philanthropenos was at <unk> , a Turkish general named Karman used the opportunity to launch an attack on Priene , but was beaten back with heavy losses , and Philanthropenos 's troops recovered <unk> . 
 At this point , in the autumn of 1295 , Alexios rose up against Andronikos . The exact circumstances and reasons for this move remain obscure , but the revolt was fuelled by the discontent of the Asian provinces over high taxation and what many perceived as the neglect of the defence of Asia by the Palaiologoi . His rebellion certainly had the support of the people : as George Pachymeres recounts , " in the monasteries [ .. ] , the name of the Emperor was no longer commemorated , but only that of Philanthropenos . " At Ephesus Alexios seized Theodore Palaiologos , the Emperor 's brother , but failed to gain the support of all provincial governors ; Libadarios , most notably , who was also Theodore 's father @-@ in @-@ law , remained loyal to Andronikos . Negotiations began , with Andronikos offering Alexios the title of Caesar to lull him into a false sense of security , while he prepared to get rid of him . Around Christmas , Libadarios persuaded some Cretan soldiers to seize Alexios and had him blinded , the punishment usually meted out to rebels .

 Alexios was replaced as commander by John Tarchaneiotes , first cousin of Andronikos II , and disappeared from the scene for 30 years . His successors proved greatly inferior , and by 1323 , Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced . At that point , Patriarch <unk> urged Andronikos to recall the aged general . A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324 . Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia , which had been long under siege and was ready to fall . He was given no army , but , according to the Byzantine chroniclers , the mere news of Alexios 's approach , and the respect in which the Turks held him , was enough for the siege to be lifted . Alexios was appointed governor of the city , a position he retained until 1327 .

 Philanthropenos remained at Philadelphia until 1326 , possibly also 1327 , but it appears that he was then appointed as governor of the strategically important Byzantine island of Lesbos , since he was dismissed from the same post in 1328 by Andronikos III Palaiologos . 
 In 1335 , Lesbos was seized by a Latin army under the Genoese Lord of Phocaea , Domenico Cattaneo , and Andronikos III raised a fleet of 83 ships to recover the island , which arrived in June 1336 . The fleet disembarked an army , led by Alexios Philanthropenos , which swiftly secured the entire island except for the capital , Mytilene . Philanthropenos countered the strong garrison of 500 Latin mercenaries by inducing them , group by group , to come over to him . The siege lasted until November , when Domenico capitulated , returning Lesbos and Phocaea to the Empire . In the next year , Philanthropenos was able to thwart a Turkish attack on the island by bribing the Turks . <unk> praised by contemporaries like Nikephoros Gregoras as the " Belisarius of the Palaiologan era " , Alexios Philanthropenos was left by Andronikos III as governor of the island , where he lived until his death , which occurred probably in the 1340s .

The team , which became known as the Yankees in 1913 , rarely contended for the AL championship before the acquisition of outfielder Babe Ruth after the 1919 season . With Ruth in the lineup , the Yankees won their first AL title in 1921 , followed by their first World Series championship in 1923 . Ruth and first baseman Lou Gehrig were part of New York 's Murderers ' Row lineup , which led the Yankees to a then @-@ AL record 110 wins and a Series championship in 1927 under Miller Huggins . They repeated as World Series winners in 1928 , and their next title came under manager Joe McCarthy in 1932 . 
 The Yankees won the World Series every year from 1936 to 1939 with a team that featured Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio , who recorded a record hitting streak during New York 's 1941 championship season . New York set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953 , and appeared in the World Series nine times during the next 11 years . Mickey Mantle , Yogi Berra , and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era . After the 1964 season , a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline on the field , and the team became a money @-@ loser for owners CBS while playing in an aging stadium . 
 George Steinbrenner bought the club in 1973 and regularly invested in new talent , using free agency to acquire top players . Yankee Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976 as the home of a more competitive Yankees team . Despite clubhouse disputes , the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978 . New York continued to pursue their strategy of signing free agents into the 1980s , but with less success , and the team eventually sank into mediocrity after 1981 . In the early 1990s , the team began to improve as their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system , including Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera . After earning a playoff berth in 1995 , the Yankees won four of the next five World Series , and the 1998 – 2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles . 
 As the 2000s progressed , the Yankees ' rivalry with the Boston Red Sox increased in intensity as the sides met multiple times in the American League Championship Series ( ALCS ) , trading victories in 2003 and 2004 . New York regularly reached the postseason , but were often defeated in the first two rounds . In 2009 , the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history . The furthest the Yankees have gone in the postseason since then is the ALCS , in 2010 and 2012 .

 At the end of the 1900 baseball season , the Western League was positioned by its president , Ban Johnson , as a new major league that would compete with the established National League ( NL ) . The league was reorganized and renamed the American League ( AL ) , and eight cities fielded teams in the 1901 season . A Baltimore team had played in the NL through the 1899 season , after which the club was shut down by the league . Baltimore was one of three former NL cities where the AL placed teams in an effort to reach underserved fans . The new Orioles ' first manager was John McGraw , who had held the same position for the previous Baltimore team in 1899 ; McGraw also held an ownership stake . 
 In 1901 , their first season , the Orioles had a 68 – 65 win – loss record and finished in fifth place in the AL . During the season , there were numerous disputes between Johnson and McGraw over disciplinary issues , which continued into the following year . Rumors began to spread that Johnson was interested in relocating the team to New York City , in an attempt to compete directly with the NL . McGraw left the Orioles and joined the New York Giants as their manager ; he transferred his interest in the Baltimore team to the Giants as part of the deal . Several Orioles — including Roger Bresnahan and Joe McGinnity — joined the Giants after McGraw 's departure , and the Giants gained a majority of the Orioles ' stock . The league managed to take back control of the team from the Giants ; after the Orioles forfeited a game because they lacked enough active players , Johnson ordered that the team be " restocked with players essentially given away by the other teams in order to play out the schedule " , according to author Marty Appel . The Orioles finished last in the league both in the standings and in attendance . 
 The AL and NL signed an agreement after the 1902 season that ended the leagues ' battles for players , which had led to increasing salaries . Johnson sought the right to locate an AL team in New York City , which was granted as part of the leagues ' peace agreement . His intention was for the team to play in Manhattan , but the idea was opposed by Giants owner John T. Brush and former owner Andrew Freedman , who were connected to the city 's Tammany Hall political organization . They blocked several potential stadium locations , before a pair of Tammany Hall politicians , Frank J. Farrell and William Stephen Devery , purchased the New York franchise in the AL . The pair paid US $ 18 @,@ 000 for the team . It is not clear whether Farrell and Devery purchased the remains of the Orioles and moved them to New York , or if they received an expansion franchise . It was the last change in the lineup of MLB teams for half a century . 
 = = = 1903 – 12 : Early years = = = 
 The ballpark for the New York team was constructed between 165th and 168th Streets , on Broadway in Manhattan . Formally known as American League Park , it was nicknamed Hilltop Park because of its relatively high elevation . The team did not have an official nickname ; it was often called the New York Americans in reference to the AL . Another common nickname for the club was the Highlanders , a play on the last name of the team 's president , Joe Gordon , and the British military unit , the Gordon Highlanders . The team acquired players such as outfielder Willie Keeler and pitcher Jack Chesbro . The player @-@ manager was Clark Griffith , obtained from the Chicago White Sox . On April 22 , 1903 , the Highlanders began their season with a 3 – 1 loss to the Washington Senators ; eight days later , they won their first game in Hilltop Park , defeating the Senators 6 – 2 . New York fell out of contention for the AL pennant in May , falling to seventh place after playing games away from Hilltop Park for a 24 @-@ day period while construction on the stadium concluded . With a final record of 72 – 62 after wins in 19 of 29 games played in September , New York finished in fourth . 
 Chesbro won 41 games in New York 's 1904 season , still an AL record . New York contended for the AL pennant with the Boston Americans ( later nicknamed the Red Sox ) ; Johnson aided New York by helping the team acquire multiple players in trades , including Boston 's Patsy Dougherty . Boston and New York faced each other in a season @-@ ending five @-@ game series that decided the pennant winner , and was played from October 7 – 10 . Boston won two of the first three games , which meant that New York needed to win the two contests scheduled on October 10 to win the AL title . With the score of the first game tied 2 – 2 in the ninth inning , Chesbro threw a wild pitch that allowed a runner on third base to score , giving Boston a 3 – 2 victory that clinched the AL pennant ; New York won the now @-@ meaningless second game . 
 New York 's performance declined in 1905 , as numerous pitchers dealt with arm injuries and conditioning issues . After losing 18 of 25 games in May , the Highlanders ended the season in sixth . In its 1906 season , New York again contended for the AL championship . With 13 games left , the team held a one @-@ game lead over the White Sox , but finished in second place three games behind Chicago . According to Appel , " What would follow would be a string of mediocre to bad seasons and not a very good attraction for baseball @-@ crazed New York fans . " New York recorded a fifth @-@ place finish in 1907 , with 70 wins , 22 fewer than the league champion Detroit Tigers . The 1908 and 1909 teams finished last and fifth , respectively , and there were multiple managerial changes in the period . 
 New York had a second @-@ place finish in 1910 , but did not seriously contend for the pennant . Manager George Stallings and first baseman Hal Chase , the team captain , clashed towards the end of the season ; facing opposition from Ban Johnson , who wanted him to resign as manager , Stallings left the position . Chase managed New York 's last 14 games . The following season , New York had a sixth @-@ place finish . Early in the season , New York allowed the Giants to play in Hilltop Park after the Giants ' stadium , the Polo Grounds , burned down ; the arrangement lasted until June 28 , when the rebuilt Polo Grounds opened . Chase resigned as manager before New York 's 1912 season ; Harry Wolverton accepted the position . That year , New York had a last @-@ place finish with a record of 50 – 102 , the winning percentage of .329 the lowest @-@ ever for the club . 
 After their first couple of seasons in New York City , team ownership infrequently invested in new players . The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent their money on personal pursuits such as gambling , leaving them with little to put into the team . New York 's star player , Chase , consorted frequently with gamblers . Author Jim Reisler dubbed him " the most crooked player to ever play the game " because of reports that he took part in game fixing . The club also had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park . Appel wrote that " maybe the best thing you could say about the ballpark was that it never burned down . " By the end of the 1912 season , Farrell was searching for a site to build a new stadium on . 
 = = = 1913 – 20 : New ownership and acquisition of Babe Ruth = = = 
 New York started playing home games at the Polo Grounds in 1913 as tenants of the Giants . Before the 1913 season , the team gained an official nickname for the first time . Either " Yankees " or " Yanks " had been used frequently since 1904 in newspapers such as the New York Evening Journal , since " Highlanders " was hard to fit in headlines . Such unofficial nicknames were common during that era , but thereafter the official name took hold — the New York Yankees . 
 A third major league , the Federal League ( FL ) , began play in 1914 and lasted for two years . While the Yankees did not have to contend with direct competition for fans , as the FL chose to place its New York City franchise in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan , the team nearly lost leading pitcher Ray Caldwell to the rival league after the 1914 season . With the Yankees finishing seventh in 1913 and sixth in 1914 , Farrell and Devery sold the team to brewery magnate Jacob Ruppert and former United States Army engineer Tillinghast L 'Hommedieu Huston . The Yankees had rarely been profitable over the previous 10 years , and carried debts of $ 20 @,@ 000 . The sale was completed on January 11 , 1915 , as the pair paid a combined $ 460 @,@ 000 . Ruppert called the team " an orphan ball club , without a home of its own , without players of outstanding ability , without prestige . " The new owners intended to spend freely to improve the club 's talent level and made a major purchase in 1915 , buying pitcher Bob Shawkey from the Philadelphia Athletics . In spite of this , the Yankees ' 69 wins were only enough for fifth in the league . After wearing different designs during the Highlanders years , in 1915 the Yankees introduced white uniforms with pinstripes and an interlocking " NY " logo during games at the Polo Grounds ; this remains their home uniform design today . For road games , the team began to wear gray uniforms with " New York " across the chest from 1913 ; the Yankees still wear similar garb . 
 Following the acquisition of third baseman Frank " Home Run " Baker from the Athletics , the 1916 Yankees had 80 wins and contended for the AL pennant for most of the season , before suffering a run of injuries to key players , including Baker . In the Yankees ' 1917 season , New York finished in sixth ; Bill Donovan , the club 's manager since 1915 , was fired in the offseason . Ruppert replaced him with Miller Huggins , completing the hire while Huston was overseas fighting in World War I. The Yankees contended for first place in the war @-@ shortened 1918 campaign along with the Red Sox and Cleveland Indians , but lost numerous players to military service and were fourth at 60 – 63 . After the season , the Yankees acquired three players — including outfielder Duffy Lewis and pitcher Ernie Shore — in a trade with the Red Sox , the winners of the 1918 World Series . In 1919 , the club made another trade with Boston , acquiring pitcher Carl Mays for two players and $ 40 @,@ 000 . The midseason deal provoked a dispute between the teams and Ban Johnson , who unsuccessfully attempted to block it . Mays had a 9 – 3 pitching record as a Yankee , and the team improved to 80 – 59 for the season ; the mark was good for third in the AL . 
 The 1919 season was the first in which the Yankees played games at the Polo Grounds on Sundays ; until then , blue laws had banned Sunday baseball in New York state . The Yankees ' attendance more than doubled in 1919 , rising to about 619 @,@ 000 . The Giants soon moved to force the Yankees out of the Polo Grounds , in an effort to secure more Sunday home games . On December 26 , 1919 , the Yankees made an agreement with the Red Sox to purchase outfielder Babe Ruth for $ 25 @,@ 000 cash and $ 75 @,@ 000 in promissory notes . The deal , which was announced on January 5 , 1920 , was called " the most famous transaction in sports " by author Glenn Stout . After tying for the MLB home run lead in 1918 with the Athletics ' Tilly Walker ( with 11 ) , Ruth broke the single @-@ season record with 29 in 1919 . At the same time , he sought a new contract that would double his $ 10 @,@ 000 yearly salary . After the trade , Boston did not win another World Series championship until 2004 ; an alleged jinx against the Red Sox , which was known as the Curse of the Bambino ( after a nickname for Ruth ) , was first brought up when they lost the 1986 World Series and became widely discussed after Dan Shaughnessy authored a book with the title . The deal became a symbol of " how things [ would ] always go wrong for the Red Sox and right for the Yankees " , according to Stout . 
 With Ruth in the lineup , the Yankees ' fortunes were transformed . Playing on four World Series champion teams , Ruth hit 659 home runs and scored 1 @,@ 959 runs ; both marks are team records as of 2016 . He is second in club history with 1 @,@ 978 runs batted in and accumulated 2 @,@ 518 hits as a Yankee , third on the team 's all @-@ time list . As well as prowess on the field , Ruth had a larger @-@ than @-@ life personality , bringing him and his team a huge amount of press and public attention . The addition of Ruth helped the Yankees increase their attendance to 1 @,@ 289 @,@ 422 for the 1920 season ; it was the first time that any MLB team drew more than one million fans in a year . His skills and charm appealed to large segments of the New York City population ; Stout wrote that " He belonged to everyone . " New York was the AL attendance leader for 13 of Ruth 's 15 seasons with the team ; the Yankees became solidly profitable as well , making over $ 370 @,@ 000 in 1920 and remaining in the black for the rest of the decade . 
 In 1920 , Ruth hit 54 home runs for a new record ; his total was higher than that of all other MLB teams but the Philadelphia Phillies . New York had 95 wins , the most in team history to that point , but fell three wins short of the AL championship and finished third . In an August 16 game against the Indians , a pitch from Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head , leading to his death ; the Yankees slumped after the incident as Cleveland captured the pennant . After the season , the Yankees hired general manager Ed Barrow from the Red Sox . Barrow made numerous trades with his former club , including one immediately after his departure that brought catcher Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt to New York . The Yankees also became involved in another dispute with Ban Johnson , this time over the replacement of baseball 's existing governing body , the National Commission , after reports came out that the 1919 World Series had been fixed . The Yankees and 10 other franchises — including the entire NL — supported the idea of a three @-@ man committee drawn from outside baseball running MLB , and for a time a move by the Yankees to the NL was rumored ; ultimately , Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was named MLB 's first commissioner . 
 = = = 1921 – 28 : First World Series win and Murderers ' Row = = = 
 The 1921 season began a 44 @-@ year period in which the Yankees were , according to author Richard Worth , " The greatest sustained winning ' empire ' in sports " . Ruth surpassed his own record by hitting 59 home runs . He also led MLB in on @-@ base percentage with a .512 mark for the season . The Yankees won the AL pennant for the first time , winning 98 games in the regular season ; the total gave them the league championship by a margin of 4 1 ⁄ 2 games over Cleveland . In the best @-@ of @-@ nine 1921 World Series , they faced the Giants and won the first two games , but their opponents claimed the Series title when they won four of the next five games . Ruth suffered an arm infection , which limited his playing time in the later part of the Series . He and Bob Meusel participated in exhibition games during the offseason , in violation of MLB rules forbidding players on pennant @-@ winning teams from barnstorming after the World Series . Season @-@ long suspensions were considered a possibility , but Landis decided to suspend the pair for six weeks . Despite the setback , New York had 94 wins and repeated as AL champions . The St. Louis Browns were the closest pursuers , finishing one game behind New York . In the World Series , the Yankees again faced the Giants in an all @-@ New York matchup ; the Series changed to a best @-@ of @-@ seven format that year . The Giants defeated the Yankees in five games , including one that ended in a tie when it was suspended because of darkness . 
 By 1923 , the teams no longer shared the Polo Grounds , as Giants owner Charles Stoneham had attempted to evict the Yankees in 1920 . Although the attempt was unsuccessful , and Stoneham and the Yankees ' owners agreed to a two @-@ year lease renewal , the Giants indicated that the Yankees would not receive an extension after 1922 . The treatment pushed the Yankees into seeking their own stadium . In 1921 , the team bought a plot of land in the Bronx , and the construction crew finished the new ballpark before the 1923 season . Yankee Stadium , a triple @-@ deck facility , was originally designed to hold more than 55 @,@ 000 spectators ; it was later able to hold over 70 @,@ 000 . Writer Peter <unk> called the stadium " a larger and more impressive facility than anything yet built to house a baseball team . " At Yankee Stadium 's inaugural game on April 18 , 1923 , Ruth hit the first home run in the stadium , which sportswriter Fred Lieb named " the House That Ruth Built " as the Yankees would not have needed such a large stadium without the Ruth @-@ driven attendance . Ruth himself had a resurgence after receiving vocal criticism for his 1922 World Series performance . He shared the MLB lead with Cy Williams by hitting 41 home runs in the 1923 season , and had a career @-@ best .393 batting average ; his performance earned him the AL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award . The Yankees finished first for the third consecutive year , and faced the Giants again in the 1923 World Series . Giants outfielder Casey Stengel hit game @-@ winning home runs in two of the first three games of the World Series , but Ruth 's three home runs helped the Yankees win in six games for their first MLB title . Off the field , Ruppert purchased Huston 's share of the Yankees for $ 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 , assuming full ownership of the club . 
 The Yankees did not return to the World Series in either of the following two seasons . By 1925 , New York had fallen to seventh place . That year marked the team 's last losing season until 1965 ; the 39 @-@ year streak of winning seasons is an MLB record . First basemen Lou Gehrig debuted in 1925 , earning a spot in the lineup he would not relinquish for almost 15 years , a then @-@ record consecutive games played streak . The Yankees made more talent upgrades before their 1926 season , which included the signing of infielder Tony Lazzeri , who spent over a decade with the club . New York 's performance on the field surpassed preseason expectations , and a 16 @-@ game winning streak in May gave the team a substantial lead . With a three @-@ game final margin over the Indians , the Yankees won the pennant and a spot in the 1926 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals . After the Yankees took a 3 – 2 series lead , the Cardinals won the final two games in Yankee Stadium to claim the Series title . Ruth hit three home runs in the fourth game , but made the final out of the Series on a failed stolen base attempt . 
 The Yankees ' lineup in the 1927 season , which featured Ruth , Gehrig , Lazzeri , Meusel , Mark Koenig , and Earle Combs , was known as Murderers ' Row for its power hitting . The team led in the standings throughout . The Yankees took first place in early May , and by the end of June had posted a 49 – 20 record , giving them a large lead in the AL standings ; by mid @-@ September , they had clinched the pennant . The 1927 Yankees had a 110 – 44 record in the regular season , and broke the AL record for wins in a year . Ruth 's total of 60 home runs set a single @-@ season home run record that stood for 34 years . Gehrig added 47 home runs and his 175 RBI topped the AL ; he won the first of his two AL MVP Awards . The Yankees completed the season by sweeping the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series . The 1927 Yankees squad is included among the great teams in baseball history . 
 To begin the 1928 season , the Yankees went on a 34 – 8 run and took a sizable lead . The Athletics chased them for the AL pennant towards the end of the season , but New York won the title again and faced the Cardinals in the 1928 World Series , sweeping them in four games . Coming off a 54 @-@ home run regular season , Ruth had three more and a .625 batting average in the Series , while Gehrig batted .545 with four home runs . With the Yankees ' run of three straight league pennants and two World Series titles came criticism from fans of other teams , who decried the team 's dominance . Calls to " Break up the Yankees ! " were made , and critics hoped that the team would sell Gehrig to separate him from Ruth ; Ruppert declined to do so . 
 = = = 1929 – 35 : Hiring of Joe McCarthy and Ruth 's called shot = = = 
 The Yankees ' run of pennants was broken up by a rising Philadelphia Athletics team , which denied the Yankees a fourth straight AL championship in 1929 . The team 's manager , Huggins , died on September 25 . After Art Fletcher managed for the rest of the year , Shawkey took the position for the 1930 season , in which the Yankees had a third @-@ place finish . The Yankees fired Fletcher and hired Joe McCarthy ; in his first season as manager , the team won 94 games but finished second behind the Athletics . McCarthy 's team was undergoing a transition from Murderers ' Row ; new contributors included Bill Dickey , who had first played for the Yankees in 1928 , and pitchers Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez . Ruffing , who had a 39 – 96 record with the Red Sox before being traded to New York , ended up 231 – 124 in his Yankees career . 
 In 1932 , McCarthy 's Yankees returned to the top of the AL with 107 wins , enough for a 13 @-@ game margin over the Athletics . The Yankees met the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series and swept them four games to none . Gehrig had three home runs , eight RBI , and a .529 batting average for the Series , while Ruth contributed a pair of home runs in the third game at Chicago 's Wrigley Field . The second of Ruth 's home runs was his " called shot " ; after pointing towards the center field stands , according to some post @-@ game press reports , Ruth homered to break a 4 – 4 tie in the fifth inning . Although accounts of the incident vary greatly , author Eric Enders called the home run " the most talked @-@ about hit in baseball history " . 
 The Yankees began cutting their payroll in 1933 , as their finances were strained by the Great Depression . Regardless , the makeup of the team was minimally impacted in comparison to the Athletics , who were forced to sell key players to lower their expenses . From 1933 to 1935 , the Yankees posted three consecutive second @-@ place finishes . Ruth 's performance declined from previous seasons in 1933 and 1934 , his final years with the team . The Yankees released Ruth from his contract before the 1935 season , and Gehrig took a leadership role for the club ; he was named New York 's captain . New York was beginning to see results from an initiative to buy minor league teams in an effort to reduce the cost of obtaining players ; after buying their first minor league club in 1929 , the Yankees had a 15 @-@ team system by 1937 . Players developed in the farm system entered the Yankee lineup beginning in the mid @-@ 1930s , and into the early 1960s this remained the team 's primary player acquisition method . McCarthy worked to regulate player behavior in areas such as mental focus and off @-@ field attire ; the Yankees acquired a " corporate image " that they retained for many years . 
 = = = 1936 – 41 : Renewed domination = = = 
 New York 's 1936 season was Joe DiMaggio 's first with the club . The young center fielder was signed in 1934 from the Pacific Coast League 's San Francisco Seals , and made his debut with the Yankees in 1936 , gaining an extra year 's experience with the Seals . DiMaggio had a .323 batting average , 29 home runs , and 125 RBI in his rookie season . Gehrig won the AL MVP Award for his season , in which he hit a career @-@ high 49 home runs , with a .354 batting average and 152 RBI . Behind these performances , the Yankees had a 102 @-@ win season and won the AL pennant , before defeating the Giants in the 1936 World Series , four games to two . After a second consecutive 102 @-@ win regular season and AL championship in the 1937 season , the Yankees again defeated the Giants in the Series — this time winning 4 – 1 . The 1938 Yankees had 48 victories in 61 games during one stretch , and won the team 's third straight AL championship despite a drop in batting performance by Gehrig . In the 1938 World Series , the Yankees swept the Chicago Cubs in four games . Ruppert died early in 1939 ; before his death , he sold his ownership interest to Barrow , who took over as the Yankees ' president . Financially , the club 's position had improved from earlier in the decade ; after posting a net loss of around $ 170 @,@ 000 from 1931 to 1935 , the team made over $ 1 million during the next four years . 
 The 1939 Yankees lost the services of Gehrig early in the season . After starting the year poorly , he ended his streak of 2 @,@ 130 consecutive games played ; he was later diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , which forced him to retire . Despite the loss of Gehrig , New York fielded a team that posted 106 victories in 1939 , 17 more than the second @-@ place team . DiMaggio was named MVP of the league ; he led the AL in batting average ( .381 ) and was second in RBI ( 126 ) . Ruffing led the Yankees ' pitchers with 20 wins . In the 1939 World Series , the Yankees swept the Cincinnati Reds in four games for the club 's fourth consecutive Series championship . Writers have given the 1936 – 39 Yankees acclaim for their success in regular season and World Series play ; Stout wrote that the 1939 squad was " magnificent " , and that their campaign was " wholly without drama " besides Gehrig 's departure from the lineup . In response to the Yankees ' dominance , after the 1939 season the AL temporarily barred most transactions between the last pennant winner and other league teams in an attempt to prevent New York from improving its roster . The Yankees ' run of championships ended in 1940 ; the team had 18 more losses than in the previous season and finished second , two games behind the Tigers . 
 DiMaggio recorded base hits in 56 consecutive games for the Yankees during the 1941 season , breaking the MLB record of 44 games that had been set by Willie Keeler in 1897 . His hitting streak lasted from May 15 to July 17 , when DiMaggio failed to record a hit during a game against the Indians at Cleveland Stadium . After winning the AL pennant , the Yankees met the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1941 World Series , prevailing in five games . In Game 4 , the Yankees trailed 4 – 3 in the ninth inning and were on the verge of defeat when Tommy Henrich struck out ; Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen was unable to field the pitch , allowing Henrich to reach base . That began a four @-@ run game @-@ winning rally , and New York won the championship in Game 5 the following day .

 The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred during the offseason , and some baseball players immediately joined the Armed Forces . Most of the Yankees ' roster remained with the team in 1942 , and the club repeated as AL champions despite Gomez 's departure . In the 1942 World Series , the Cardinals gave the Yankees their first Series loss since 1926 , after winning in eight consecutive appearances . DiMaggio and other Yankees entered the military before the 1943 season , but the club won the AL championship for the 14th time and 7th since 1936 . The Cardinals met the Yankees in a World Series rematch , and New York won four games to one . 
 After 1943 , more of the team 's players were drafted into military , and the Yankees ended 1944 in third place , one position higher than they finished the following season . A group consisting of Larry MacPhail , Dan Topping , and Del Webb bought the Yankees , their stadium , and the franchise 's minor league teams for $ 2 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 in 1945 . Under the new ownership , Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights . With the war over and the return of players from overseas , the Yankees set an MLB single @-@ season home attendance record by attracting 2 @,@ 265 @,@ 512 fans in 1946 . McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season . The Yankees used two other managers during the year ( Bill Dickey and Johnny <unk> ) , and ended 1946 in third place . Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year ; in his 18 @-@ season career , Berra won the AL MVP Award three times . Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager , and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven @-@ game World Series . After the end of the Series , MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $ 2 million .

 Despite contending late into the season , the 1948 Yankees finished in third place . Harris was released and the Yankees brought in Casey Stengel to manage . At the time , Stengel had " a reputation as a bit of a clown " , according to Appel , and had been unsuccessful in two previous MLB managing stints . As the Yankees ' manager , he optimized matchups by using a platoon system , playing more left @-@ handed batters against right @-@ handed pitchers . Numerous injuries affected the team during the 1949 season but it battled with the Red Sox for the AL pennant ; before a season @-@ ending two @-@ game series at Yankee Stadium , New York trailed Boston by one game and needed a pair of wins . By scores of 5 – 4 and 5 – 3 , the Yankees won the two games and the league championship . New York won a World Series rematch with the Dodgers in five games . Stengel was named AL Manager of the Year in his first season . The Yankees faced another competitive pennant race in 1950 , as the Tigers joined New York and Boston at the top of the AL . Late in the season , the Yankees broke a tie with the Tigers for first place and went on to win the pennant . In the 1950 World Series , the Yankees swept the Phillies ; the second game was decided by a DiMaggio home run in the tenth inning . Following the season , Yankee Phil Rizzuto was named AL MVP after recording 200 base hits during the regular season . 
 Fan interest in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late @-@ 1940s , and the Yankees faced a drop @-@ off in their crowds after 1947 , when they sold about 2 @.@ 2 million tickets . By 1957 , season attendance was down by over 700 @,@ 000 . New York baseball fans had the option of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s . The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts . This was a departure from the team 's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced . Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939 , as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios . 
 DiMaggio played his final MLB season in 1951 , while highly touted outfielder Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York . Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw two no @-@ hitters during 1951 , as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant for the third straight year . They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants , four games to two . When their 1952 team took the AL pennant , the Yankees had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939 . In another Yankees – Dodgers matchup , New York fell behind three games to two , but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title . New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the 1953 World Series , and a Billy Martin base hit that decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row . As of 2016 , the 1949 – 1953 Yankees are the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series ; no team since has won more than three in a row . 
 The Yankees won 103 games in 1954 , the most yet for a Stengel @-@ managed team , but the Indians took the pennant with a then @-@ AL record 111 wins . One year later , the 1955 Yankees faced the Dodgers in the World Series . After the teams split the first six games of the Series , the Yankees lost the seventh and final game 2 – 0 , giving the Dodgers their first Series win . Elston Howard , the first African American player in Yankees history , made his debut in 1955 . His arrival came eight years after MLB 's color line had been broken , as the Yankees ' management had sought to avoid integrating the club 's roster . As teams such as the Dodgers added black players , the Yankees turned down numerous opportunities to acquire Negro league talent . Management feared alienating white fans and harbored stereotypes of African American players . Author Robert Cohen called these views " symbolic of the overall arrogance of Yankee ownership and management , as well as their prevailing racial attitudes . " 
 In 1956 , Mantle won the MVP award for a season in which he led the AL and MLB in batting average ( .353 ) , home runs ( 52 ) , and RBIs ( 130 ) , becoming the second Yankee ( after Gehrig in 1934 ) to win a Triple Crown . The 1956 Yankees won the franchise 's seventh AL championship under Stengel and advanced to a World Series rematch with the Dodgers . In Game 5 , with the Series even at 2 – 2 , Yankees pitcher Don Larsen threw a perfect game . In seven games , the Yankees won the Series . 
 = = = 1957 – 64 : Continued success = = = 
 By 1957 , the Yankees had won 15 of the last 21 AL pennants . The team 's minor @-@ league system had been reduced to 10 teams from a peak of 22 , and its scouting system was acclaimed by Sports Illustrated 's Roy Terrell as " the best in all baseball . " Instead of signing many players for their organization , the Yankees concentrated on acquiring a smaller number of highly skilled players , according to head scout Paul Krichell . The club recruited players by selling them on the " fame , fortune and fat shares of a World Series pot " that came with making New York 's roster . 
 The 1957 Yankees reached that year 's World Series , but lost in seven games to the Milwaukee Braves . Following the Series , the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California , leaving the Yankees as New York 's only MLB team . Despite their status as the sole New York City @-@ based franchise , the Yankees ' 1958 attendance decreased from previous seasons as the team could not attract bereft Giants and Dodgers fans . In the 1958 World Series , the Yankees had an opportunity to avenge their defeat to the Braves . The Yankees fell behind by losing three of the first four games , but won the final three games of the Series to claim another championship . The Yankees were unable to defend their AL and World Series championships in 1959 , as they ended up with a 79 – 75 record , their worst record since 1925 , good for third place . 
 When Arnold Johnson ( a friend of Topping and Yankees general manager George Weiss ) became the owner of the Kansas City Athletics in 1955 , his new team made many transactions with the Yankees . From 1956 to 1960 , the Athletics traded many young players to the Yankees for cash and aging veterans . The trades strengthened the Yankees ' roster , but brought criticism from rival clubs . Before their 1960 season , the Yankees made one such trade with the Athletics in which they acquired outfielder Roger Maris . In his first Yankees season , Maris led the league in slugging percentage , RBIs , and extra base hits , finished second with 39 home runs , and won the AL MVP Award . The 1960 Yankees won the AL pennant for the 10th time in 12 years under Stengel , and outscored the Pirates 55 – 27 in the seven World Series games . However , the team lost four of them , falling short of a Series championship after Bill Mazeroski hit a walk @-@ off home run in the final game , ending a contest that Appel called " one of the most memorable in baseball history . " The season turned out to be Stengel 's last as Yankees manager ; he indicated that his age played a role in the team 's decision , saying , " I 'll never make the mistake of being seventy again . " 
 Ralph Houk was chosen to replace Stengel . During the 1961 season , both Mantle and Maris chased Ruth 's single @-@ season home run record of 60 , and the pair attracted much press attention as the year progressed . Ultimately , an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow out of the race in mid @-@ September with 54 home runs . Maris continued , though , and on October 1 , the final day of the season , he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium , breaking the record with 61 . Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept , as the Yankees played a 154 @-@ game schedule in 1927 ( beginning in 1961 , AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league 's expansion to 10 teams ) . MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later , giving Maris sole possession of the single @-@ season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark McGwire . The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins , at the time the club 's second @-@ highest single @-@ season total , and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise 's 19th World Series . The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single @-@ season record . Maris won another AL MVP Award , while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award , having posted a 25 – 4 record . The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded , along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees . New York returned to the World Series in 1962 , facing the San Francisco Giants . After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series , the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1 – 0 to clinch the title . 
 The Yankees again reached the World Series in their 1963 campaign , but were swept in four games by the Los Angeles Dodgers . Houk left the manager 's position to become the team 's general manager and the newly retired Berra was named manager . After dealing with player injuries and internal dissension , the Yankees rallied from third place late in the 1964 season and won the AL pennant by one game over the White Sox . It was their fifth straight World Series appearance and fourteenth in the past sixteen years . The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals in a series that included a walk @-@ off home run by Mantle to end the third game . Despite Mantle 's game @-@ winning hit , the Yankees were defeated by the Cardinals in seven games , and Berra was fired . 
 = = = 1965 – 72 : New ownership and decline = = = 
 In 1964 , CBS announced that it was purchasing 80 percent of the Yankees for $ 11 @.@ 2 million . The television network bought the remaining 20 percent , originally retained by Topping and Webb , during the next two years . Topping left as team president after the sale ; CBS executive Mike Burke replaced him . From 1962 to the sale , Topping and Webb had sharply curtailed the Yankees ' investment in their minor league system , to show greater profits . As a result , the team lacked capable replacements for its aging players . Other factors affected the club 's fortunes as well . The team had been slow in signing African American players even after Howard , and lost the opportunity to sign future stars . As most American League clubs dragged their feet in integrating their rosters , the rapid decline of the Yankees ' white stars left them on the same footing as the rest of the league . Also , the 1965 introduction of the MLB draft , which allowed the clubs with the worst records to have the first selections , meant that the Yankees could not outbid other teams for young talent . Their trade pipeline with the A 's had dried up by 1960 , as new A 's owner Charlie Finley announced his intention to avoid trading with New York . Competition for the attention of local fans had been provided by the expansion New York Mets , founded in 1962 . By 1964 , the new club started a 12 @-@ year streak of outdrawing the Yankees ; the Mets also won the 1969 World Series . 
 The Yankees had a record of 77 – 85 in 1965 , and their sixth @-@ place finish was their lowest since 1925 . It was only their second finish in the second division since 1918 . Johnny Keane , who was hired to succeed Berra as manager , was fired after the Yankees lost 16 of 20 games to start their 1966 season ; Houk named himself as Keane 's replacement . A last @-@ place finish — their first since 1912 — followed at season 's end , and the Yankees ended up one position higher , ninth , the following season . Ford , Howard , Mantle , and Maris all retired or were traded to other clubs between 1966 and 1969 . Attendance at Yankee Stadium fell to between 1 and 1 @.@ 3 million fans per season from 1965 to 1971 , and dropped below 1 million in 1972 . One 1966 game had a crowd of 413 fans ; television announcer Red Barber was fired by the Yankees after discussing the low attendance during his telecast . 
 After fifth @-@ place finishes in 1968 and 1969 ( the latter in the newly created six @-@ team American League East division ) , the 1970 Yankees improved to second in the AL East with a 93 – 69 record , finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles . Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for the Yankees and won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970 . New York had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than they had in 1970 , but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth . Late in the season , the Yankees were in a four @-@ way tie for the most wins in the division , but a slump caused them to fall to fourth by the end of their campaign with a record of 79 – 76 . 
 = = = 1973 – 76 : Steinbrenner takes over = = = 
 Less than a decade into its ownership of the Yankees , CBS moved to sell the team in 1972 . In eight years , the team posted an $ 11 million loss under CBS ; losing money in all but two years . Along with the decrease in attendance , the Yankees ' television revenues fell by more than 80 percent from their peak , and in 1973 were more than $ 1 million below what the Mets earned from their broadcasting agreement . A group of investors , led by Cleveland @-@ based shipbuilder George Steinbrenner , purchased the club from CBS on January 3 , 1973 for $ 10 million . Despite an initial promise that he would " stick to building ships " and remain in the background , Steinbrenner proved to be a hands @-@ on owner , clashing with Burke and forcing him out of his leadership position . Describing the level of control displayed by the lead owner , investor John McMullen stated , " There is nothing in life quite so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner . " 
 The 1973 Yankees held the AL East lead entering August , but faded and ended the year fourth . The 1973 season was the team 's last in Yankee Stadium before the building was renovated . The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium 's surroundings . For a time , New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex , and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving . The city paid $ 24 million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land , and in 1972 agreed to renovations . Work on the stadium finished in 1976 , and the Yankees were required to play at the Mets ' home field , Shea Stadium , in 1974 and 1975 . During the first of those seasons , the team nearly won the AL East , finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games . The Yankees were helped by an early @-@ season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team , and improved to 89 wins from 1973 's 80 victories . 
 After the 1974 season , star pitcher Catfish Hunter was declared a free agent because of a skipped insurance payment . The Yankees signed him to a $ 3 @.@ 75 million , four @-@ year contract . It was the beginning of a long @-@ term franchise philosophy of using free agency to acquire talent ; Stout writes that they " were the first team to comprehend what free agency meant " , as it provided an advantage over lower @-@ spending rivals and generated fan and media interest . Hunter had 23 wins during the Yankees ' 1975 season , but the team did not contend for the playoffs after July . New York fired manager Bill Virdon in August and hired Billy Martin as his replacement . With Martin as the helm , the Yankees returned to the postseason in their first season in the renovated Yankee Stadium , winning the 1976 AL East title by a 10 1 / 2 @-@ game margin over the Orioles . Munson was named AL MVP , with a .302 batting average and a total of 105 RBIs that was second @-@ best in the AL . The 1976 American League Championship Series ( ALCS ) between the Yankees and Kansas City Royals went to a deciding fifth game , which was won by New York on a walk @-@ off home run by Chambliss . The Yankees did not win a game against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1976 World Series . 
 = = Free agency era = = 
 = = = 1977 – 81 : " The Bronx Zoo " = = = 
 Free agency was introduced more fully from the 1976 offseason ; outfielder Reggie Jackson , who had spent one season with the Orioles after being traded by the Athletics , was the most significant player available in that first offseason . Steinbrenner signed Jackson to a five @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 96 million contract , giving the Yankees a key player , but one who had difficulty fitting in with the rest of the team . Martin had opposed Jackson 's signing , and many players were angered by comments Jackson made that were critical of Munson . Jackson and Martin nearly came to blows in the Yankees ' dugout during one game against the Red Sox , in which Martin removed Jackson for being slow to field a ball . The incident sparked media reports of disputes between Martin and Steinbrenner , and further conflict between Martin and Jackson . The Yankees of the late @-@ 1970s , noted for clubhouse conflict and on @-@ field success , were later nicknamed " The Bronx Zoo " , after a book of the same name by pitcher Sparky Lyle , and at the time , New York and the baseball world were agog at their antics . The 1977 Yankees won the AL East and defeated the Royals in the 1977 ALCS . Trailing 3 – 2 in the top of the ninth inning of the decisive fifth game , the Yankees scored three times to gain a berth in the World Series . Against the Dodgers , the Yankees prevailed in six games for their first Series championship since 1962 . Jackson hit a record five home runs in the Series , including three in Game 6 on consecutive pitches , against three different Dodgers pitchers . Jackson gained his own candy bar and the nickname " Mr. October " . 
 Before their 1978 season , the Yankees added relief pitcher Goose Gossage , even though their closer was reigning Cy Young Award winner Lyle . By the middle of July , the team was 14 games behind the Red Sox and infighting had begun again . After making comments to reporters criticizing both Jackson and Steinbrenner , Martin resigned and Bob Lemon was hired as manager . The Yankees closed the gap that Boston had opened on them , and by the start of a four @-@ game series at Fenway Park on September 7 , the Red Sox ' lead was down to four games . Over the course of the series , nicknamed " The Boston Massacre " , the Yankees outscored the Red Sox 42 – 9 , winning each game . The teams finished the regular season with identical records , and an AL East tie @-@ breaker game was held on October 2 . Losing 2 – 0 in the seventh inning , the Yankees took the lead on a three @-@ run home run by shortstop Bucky Dent , and eventually won 5 – 4 . After beating the Kansas City Royals for the third consecutive year in the ALCS , the Yankees faced the Dodgers again in the 1978 World Series . They lost the first two games on the road , but then returned to Yankee Stadium and won three consecutive games before clinching a Series championship in Game 6 in Los Angeles . Pitcher Ron Guidry was the Cy Young Award winner in 1978 , having posted 25 wins against 3 losses with a 1 @.@ 74 ERA , and 248 strikeouts . Eighteen of his strikeouts came in his June 17 appearance against the California Angels , which broke the franchise record . 
 On August 2 , 1979 , Munson was killed in a plane crash . Martin , who had returned as manager after Steinbrenner fired Lemon in June , said that with his death , " The whole bottom fell out of the team . " The 1979 Yankees finished fourth with an 89 – 71 record . Steinbrenner fired Martin after the season and replaced him with Dick Howser , who led the Yankees to 103 wins and the AL East title in 1980 . Jackson led the AL with 41 home runs and posted a .300 batting average for the Yankees , who finished three games ahead of the Orioles . Their stay in the postseason was brief , as the Royals beat them in three straight games to win the ALCS . Before their 1981 campaign , the Yankees signed Dave Winfield to a 10 @-@ year contract worth $ 23 million , a record at the time . The season was shortened by a strike , and the Yankees qualified for the playoffs by virtue of leading the AL East when the work stoppage began . They defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in a divisional playoff round in five <unk> and won the AL pennant with three straight wins over the Athletics in the ALCS . The Yankees won the first two games of the 1981 World Series against Los Angeles , but the Dodgers won the next four games and the championship . 
 = = = 1982 – 95 : Struggles and return to postseason = = = 
 Following the team 's loss to the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series , the Yankees had a 15 @-@ year absence from the World Series , the longest since the time before their initial appearance in 1921 . As the 1980s progressed , the Yankees regularly spent heavily on free agents who were often aging and proved to be declining in performance . The atmosphere of turmoil around the club discouraged some players from signing contracts with New York ; they either ignored the Yankees ' offers or used them to get more money from other teams . Steinbrenner traded prospects for veterans ; sportswriter Buster Olney called this " a practice that ultimately inflicted serious damage on the organization , leaving the team without the needed influx of young and cheap talent . " With Steinbrenner at the helm , the team continued to change managers frequently ; there were 21 managerial changes in his first two decades of ownership ; Martin served five separate stints as New York 's manager . 
 The 1982 and 1983 Yankees were fifth and third , respectively . Henry Fetter wrote of the following year 's team , which had several aging players , " The 1984 Yanks had assembled an all @-@ star lineup — but it was that of 1979 . " In what became a trend in future seasons , the Yankees lacked effective pitching , undoing the efforts of a top @-@ tier offense that included players such as Winfield and first baseman Don Mattingly , one of the few star hitters produced by the farm system during the era . Mattingly led the AL in batting average in 1984 — beating out Winfield for the league lead . The Yankees ' 1985 season began with a batting lineup improved by an offseason trade for Rickey Henderson , the future MLB career stolen base and runs scored record holder . Mattingly was AL MVP in 1985 , with 145 RBI and a personal @-@ best 35 home runs , while Guidry won 22 games . The Yankees had 97 wins , two off the division leader Toronto Blue Jays . The 1986 side 's win total fell to 92 , but it was only enough for second place again behind Boston . Mattingly hit an MLB record six grand slam home runs in 1987 , but dealt with back pain that limited his effectiveness in his remaining years . The Yankees fell to fourth , beginning a six @-@ year streak of fourth or worse . The Yankees had the most wins of any MLB team during the 1980s , but missed the playoffs eight times during the decade and did not win a World Series . Many New York baseball fans chose to support an exciting Mets team . From 1984 to 1992 , a period that featured their 1986 World Series victory , the Mets ' attendance topped that of the Yankees every year . Despite falling attendance , the Yankees ' finances were not significantly harmed , as they had a 12 @-@ year television rights contract with the Madison Square Garden network that gave them a record $ 500 million and flexibility to increase their payroll if desired . 
 Winfield 's tenure with the team ended when he was traded in May 1990 . The 1990 team lost 95 games to finish at the bottom of the AL East , and its .414 winning percentage was the franchise 's worst since 1913 . The Yankees underwent a dramatic change in their front office that year , which Glenn Stout cites as a turning point for the club . Winfield had become a target of Steinbrenner in previous years . At one 1985 game , he criticized Winfield by calling him " Mr. May " , that is , a player who only performed well early in the season . Steinbrenner also resented Winfield 's salary as too high , and was critical of a charitable foundation run by him . A gambler was paid by Steinbrenner " for damaging information " about Winfield , an incident that resulted in an indefinite suspension from then @-@ commissioner Fay Vincent in 1990 . Under new general manager Gene Michael , the Yankees allowed their minor league talent more time to improve their skills and more of a chance to play for the Yankees if they were good enough . Michael focused on on @-@ base percentage in deciding which hitters to pursue , and emphasized left @-@ handed batters who might take advantage of Yankee Stadium 's short right @-@ field porch . The players developed by the team during its rebuilding years included outfielder Bernie Williams , a future AL batting average leader , and a group — Derek Jeter , Andy Pettitte , Jorge Posada , and Mariano Rivera — that became the centerpiece of the championship teams of the 1990s , and was later nicknamed the " Core Four " . 
 After a 71 @-@ win 1991 season , the Yankees replaced their incumbent manager , Stump Merrill , with Buck Showalter , who increased the playing time given to young players . While the 1992 Yankees were 20 games behind the AL East winner , offseason acquisitions — third baseman Wade Boggs , pitcher Jimmy Key , and outfielder Paul O 'Neill — helped the 1993 team to an 88 – 74 record and New York 's highest finish ( second ) in seven seasons . By 1994 , the Yankees had progressed to the point where they led the AL with a 70 – 43 record going into the homestretch of the regular season . Their campaign was cut short by a players ' strike , which resulted in the cancellation of the playoffs and 1994 World Series . Many media members believed that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for the strike . A year later , the team reached the playoffs and gave Mattingly his first career postseason appearance by winning the first AL wild card berth , but it was eliminated in a five @-@ game Division Series ( ALDS ) against the Seattle Mariners . 
 = = = 1996 – 2001 : Championship run = = = 
 Mattingly did not return to the Yankees for their 1996 season , and the club replaced Showalter with Joe Torre . Although the managerial change met with a mixed reception by the press , Torre received praise for his handling of players as his managerial career progressed ; Olney remarked that he was able to " defuse powder @-@ keg issues and serve as a buffer between Steinbrenner and the players . " Jeter won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in his first full season with the Yankees , and Pettitte with 21 wins was second in AL Cy Young Award voting and Rivera posted an 8 – 3 record and 2 @.@ 09 ERA as the club won a division title . New York reached the 1996 World Series , where they lost the first two games at home to the Atlanta Braves by a combined score of 16 – 1 . But New York won three straight contests in Atlanta , including a Game 4 in which they scored eight straight runs to rally from a 6 – 0 deficit . With a 3 – 2 win in Game 6 , the Yankees won the World Series for the first time in 18 years . For 1997 , the Yankees signed starting pitcher David Wells and allowed closer John Wetteland to leave in free agency , enabling Rivera to inherit the role . The 1997 Yankees earned a wild card playoff berth , but lost three games to two against the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS . 
 In preparation for their 1998 season , the Yankees replaced general manager Bob Watson with Brian Cashman . The club made many player acquisitions , gaining the services of third baseman Scott Brosius , second baseman Chuck Knoblauch , and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández . The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games — a stretch that concluded with a perfect game pitched by Wells — and by August were 76 – 27 . The 1998 Yankees are considered by some writers to be among the greatest teams in baseball history , having compiled a then @-@ AL record of 114 regular @-@ season wins against 48 losses . After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers and Indians , New York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive World Series games for their 24th Series title . 
 After the 1998 season , Wells was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens , who had just completed two consecutive Cy Young Award @-@ winning seasons . In a regular season that included another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher , this one by David Cone , New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS . This led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox . New York won the first two games en route to a 4 – 1 series win , and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series . The postseason results gave the 1998 – 99 Yankees a 22 – 3 playoff record , and the team held a 12 @-@ game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996 . Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87 – 74 regular season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers , the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship . New York 's pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross @-@ town Mets , the first Subway Series in 44 years . With a four games to one victory , the Yankees gained their third successive title . As of 2016 , the 2000 Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the Yankees of 1998 – 2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series . 
 Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina signed with the Yankees before their 2001 season began , and the club pulled away from the Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship , as Clemens won 20 games . The September 11 attacks interrupted the season , and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from the destruction of the Twin Towers . After falling behind 2 – 0 in the ALDS against the Athletics , the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS . They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners , who had tied a single @-@ season MLB record with 116 regular season wins , for the team 's fourth straight AL pennant . The Arizona Diamondbacks gained a two @-@ game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive <unk> ; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games , with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run . The Yankees ' championship streak ended , though , as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7 . 
 = = = 2002 – 08 : Final years in old Yankee Stadium = = = 
 After the 2001 season , several players from the late 1990s and early 2000s Yankees teams departed . New York won their fifth AL East title in a row in its 2002 campaign , but the Anaheim Angels defeated the Yankees in the ALDS . The Yankees ' major acquisition in the offseason was leading Japanese hitter Hideki Matsui of the Yomiuri Giants . Another signing , that of Cuban pitcher José Contreras , led to complaints from Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino , who dubbed his team 's rivals " the Evil Empire " . Tensions between the rivals increased in the coming seasons , and writers called the rivalry one of the most intense and well known in North American professional sports . By 2003 , New York 's overall payroll had reached almost $ 153 million , more than the Padres , Brewers , Royals , and Tampa Bay Devil Rays combined . Criticism of the Yankees ' spending such as Lucchino 's was frequently raised ; during a 15 @-@ year stretch from 1999 to 2013 , they had the biggest MLB player payroll every year . 
 Jeter became the Yankees ' captain in their 2003 season . The team faced the Red Sox in the ALCS . The series came down to a seventh game , and the Yankees fell behind before three eighth @-@ inning runs forced a 5 – 5 tie and extra innings . Aaron Boone , a third baseman acquired by New York in a mid @-@ season trade , hit a walk @-@ off home run in the eleventh inning to give New York the pennant . The Yankees were then defeated by the Florida Marlins in the World Series , four games to two . The Yankees added power hitting to their lineup in the offseason , signing free agent Gary Sheffield and trading for shortstop Alex Rodriguez , who became a third baseman with New York . Three of the starting pitchers from the previous season — Clemens , Pettitte , and Wells — left the team before the season . Despite the losses , the 2004 Yankees managed to top the AL East with 101 wins and defeat the Twins three games to one in the ALDS . The victory set up an ALCS rematch with the Red Sox . The Yankees took a 3 – 0 series lead before losing four consecutive games , becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a best @-@ of @-@ seven series after winning the first three games . 
 The 2005 season featured an AL MVP performance by Rodriguez , who hit a league @-@ leading 48 home runs with 130 RBIs and a .321 batting average . The Yankees beat the Red Sox for the division title because they won 10 of their 19 contests against Boston ; both teams had 95 – 67 records . The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated the Yankees in five games in the first round of the postseason . The 2006 Yankees kept at the same level , as they won the AL East for the ninth straight year but were eliminated in the ALDS by the Detroit Tigers three games to one . 
 Rodriguez again won the AL MVP award in 2007 , as his 54 home runs and 156 RBIs topped the AL ; he scored 143 runs , the highest single @-@ season number by a player since 1985 . After starting the year 21 – 29 , the Yankees rallied to win the AL 's wild card berth ; it was the first time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East . New York 's season ended in the first round of the playoffs ; the Indians won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games . Manager Torre did not re @-@ sign after the season , and Joe Girardi took his place . Rodriguez , who used an opt @-@ out clause in his contract to become a free agent , stayed with the Yankees by signing for $ 275 million over 10 seasons , an MLB record . The 2008 season was the Yankees ' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium . The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues , following the example set by other MLB teams . It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners ; though George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper , he yielded operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason . Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All @-@ Star Game , but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action . New York ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason .

 The new Yankee Stadium , which cost a record $ 1 @.@ 5 billion , was constructed near the old facility . As built , it had a capacity of approximately 52 @,@ 000 , with 52 luxury suites . Monument Park , which holds plaques and monuments honoring former Yankees personnel , was built beyond the center field fence ; its collection was transplanted from the old stadium . For the 2009 season , the team committed over $ 400 million in future salaries to three free agents : pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett , and first baseman Mark Teixeira . New York won 90 of its last 134 games , and broke the franchise single @-@ season record by hitting 244 home runs . Another club record was broken by Jeter , who passed Gehrig as the Yankees ' all @-@ time hits leader on September 11 . New York posted 103 wins in 2009 and beat out the Red Sox for the division title by eight games . In the AL playoffs , the Yankees defeated the Twins in the ALDS and the Angels in the ALCS , advancing to the 2009 World Series . There they faced the Philadelphia Phillies , the defending Series champions . Behind a six @-@ RBI effort by Matsui in the sixth and final game , the Yankees defeated the Phillies to win the franchise 's 27th Series championship . 
 George Steinbrenner died in July 2010 . The Yankees won the league 's wild card berth , but their title defense was ended by the Texas Rangers in the ALCS . Multiple Yankees players set individual marks in 2011 . Jeter joined the 3 @,@ 000 hit club on July 9 ; he was the first player to do so while playing for the club . Later in the season , Rivera posted the 602nd save of his career , breaking the all @-@ time record that had been held by Trevor Hoffman . The Yankees won the AL East , but lost in the ALDS to the Tigers . Rivera suffered a season @-@ ending injury to his right knee in May 2012 while catching fly balls before a game against the Royals . Even without their longtime closer , the 2012 Yankees gained a 10 @-@ game lead by mid @-@ July , and held off the Orioles to win the division title by a final margin of two games . After defeating the Orioles in a five @-@ game ALDS , the Yankees were swept by the Tigers in the ALCS . 
 During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS , Jeter broke his right ankle while attempting to field a ball . He was one of many Yankees to miss playing time during the club 's 2013 campaign ; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at least once . The team had an opportunity to win a wild @-@ card playoff spot , but faded late in the season . It was only the second time since 1995 that New York did not qualify for postseason play . In the offseason , second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners in free agency , but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka , who was coming off a 24 – 0 year with Japan 's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles , to a seven @-@ year contract . Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by MLB for using performance @-@ enhancing drugs . The 2014 Yankees , the last with Jeter in their lineup , fell four games short of a postseason berth with an 84 – 78 record . Despite signing several new hitters prior to the season , the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored . The offense improved in 2015 , ending the regular season with the second @-@ most runs in MLB . New York gained a wild card berth with a second @-@ place finish , but was defeated by the Houston Astros in a one @-@ game playoff . 
 As of 2016 , the Yankees ' 27 World Series championships are 16 more than the number won by the St. Louis Cardinals , who have the second @-@ most titles among MLB teams . New York 's championship total is the highest of any franchise in a major North American league ; the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens are second behind the Yankees with 24 Stanley Cup wins . The 40 AL titles won by the Yankees places them 17 in front of the Cardinals for the most pennants won by an MLB team . The Giants and Dodgers are the only other clubs with 20 or more pennants . The Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted over 40 players and managers who have worn Yankees pinstripes . Forbes magazine has labeled the Yankees the most valuable team in baseball every year since 1998 ; the franchise was worth an estimated $ 3 @.@ 4 billion in 2016 . 
 In Glenn Stout 's Yankees history book , the author wrote : 
 More often than not , they have shown just how the game of baseball is supposed to be played . Ruth , Gehrig , DiMaggio , Mantle , Mattingly , Jeter , and dozens of other players impossible to forget have worn their uniform . Yankee Stadium has been their stage . The very definition of a dynasty , they have created the collective memories that make friends of strangers , given their city a face , and displayed its heart and soul . 
 = Kalmashapada = 
 In Hindu mythology , Kalmashapada ( <unk> , कल ् <unk> ) , also known as Saudasa ( <unk> ) , Mitrasaha ( <unk> ् <unk> ) , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , was a king of the Ikshvaku dynasty ( the Solar dynasty ) , who was cursed to be a rakshasa ( demon ) by the sage Vashishtha . He is described as an ancestor of Rama , the avatar of the god Vishnu and the hero of the Hindu epic Ramayana . Many texts narrate how Kalmashapada was cursed to die if he had intercourse with his queen , so he obtained a son from Vashishtha by niyoga , an ancient tradition whereby a husband can nominate another man to impregnate his wife . Kalmashapada 's story is narrated in various works including the classic epic poems Mahabharata and Ramayana , and the Puranas . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Mahabharata and the Puranas agree that Kalmashapada was the son of the king <unk> ( <unk> ) ; however , the Ramayana names his father as Raghu , a king whom the other texts identify as a descendant of Kalmashapada . All texts agree that his ancestors include Sagara and Bhagiratha , though the generations between Bhagiratha and Kalmashapada may vary among the texts . 
 Some texts state that Kalmashapada 's birth name was Mitrasaha , but he was known by his patronymic Saudasa . A commentator on the Vishnu Purana says that Mitra @-@ saha ( literally , " one who forbears a friend " ) is an epithet the king acquires from the curse of the sage Vashishtha . The king restrains ( saha ) himself from retaliation against his friend ( mitra ) Vashishtha 's curse , though he possesses the power to do so . The Vayu Purana , the Agni Purana , the Brahma Purana , and the Harivamsa call him <unk> , " one who forbears ( saha ) a foe ( <unk> ) " ; here , Vashishtha is taken to be an enemy . 
 Kalmashapada was the king of Ayodhya ( Kosala ) and was married to Queen Madayanti . The Bhagavata Purana notes that she was also known as Damayanti .

 The Mahabharata narrates : Once , Kalmashapada was roaming the forest for hunting . He encounters the sage Vashishtha 's eldest son Shakti on a narrow path . As a kshatriya ( member of the ruler class ) , Kalmashapada does not make way for Shakti , a brahmin ( priestly class ) . Nevertheless , Shakti refuses to budge . Finally , an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip . In turn , the sage curses the king to wander the forest for 16 years . The sage Vishwamitra , the arch @-@ enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple , sends a rakshasa to possess the king 's body . Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy 's family with the help of the king . Under the influence of the rakshasa , the king serves human flesh to a Brahmin , who sets Shakti 's curse into effect . The king turns into a cannibalistic rakshasa . 
 = = = Vashishtha 's curse = = = 
 The Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana and the Shiva Purana narrate about Vashishtha cursing Kalmashapada with slight variation . The Uttara Ramayana tells that once , while hunting in the forest , Kalmashapada mistakenly kills a rakshasa disguised as a tiger cub . His fellow rakshasa – who was also disguised as a cub – assumes his true form and warns the king that he will take his revenge against the wrongful death at the proper time . The Shiva Purana and the Bhagavata Purana identify the other rakshasa as the brother of the slain one , and does not mention the tiger cub disguise . The Vishnu Purana also notes that the demons appeared in the form of tigers . 
 The king returns to his capital and invites his guru Vashishtha to the Ashwamedha sacrifice . The sage accepts . The vengeful rakshasa assumes the form of the sage and informs the king that he secretly desires to eat meat ( a taboo for sages ) , and that the king should come to his ashram and offer him meat . Deceived by the rakshasa 's disguise , Kalmashapada with his queen goes to Vashishtha 's ashram and presents him with meat . The sage feels insulted seeing the taboo offering , and curses the king to be a rakshasa . 
 In the Shiva Purana , the Bhagavata Purana , and the Vishnu Purana , the rakshasa disguises himself as a Brahmin cook and gains entry to the king 's kitchen . When Vashishtha arrives in Ayodhya on the king 's invitation for a Shraddha ceremony , or simply dinner , the demon cooks human flesh and offers that to the sage on behalf of the king . The enraged sage curses him to be transformed into a human @-@ eating rakshasa and wander the forests . The pious king is outraged by the unjust curse and quarrels with the sage . Vashishtha reduces the curse to 12 years when he hears of the rakshasa 's deception . But the king is not satisfied . He takes water in his hand to cast a curse on Vashishtha , but the queen dissuades him . However , the curse @-@ ridden water cannot be wasted . If thrown on the ground , it will destroy the crop . If thrown in the air , it will spoil the rains . Throwing in any direction would harm some living beings . Ultimately , the king throws the water on his own feet . Since the king 's feet become black and white in colour , he gains the epithets Kalmashapada and <unk> ( literally , " pied feet " ) . 
 = = Life as a rakshasa = = 
 The Mahabharata narrates that Kalmashapada cultivates an intense hatred for Vashishtha and his sons . He eats Shakti and his 99 brothers to seek his vengeance . The grief @-@ stricken Vashishtha leaves his ashram and starts roaming the forest . He even tries to kill himself , but fails every time . Texts such as the Mahabharata , the Linga Purana , and the <unk> blame Vishwamitra for provoking Kalmashapada to slay Vashishtha 's sons . An older scripture , <unk> , also mentions that multiple <unk> ( sons of <unk> ) slay the hundred sons of Vashishtha . 
 Various texts relate that in the forest , Kalmashapada encounters a young Brahmin couple engaged in coitus . Kalmashapada disturbs the act before climax and captures the Brahmin youth . His wife pleads that her husband has not impregnated her yet , and that it is improper to kill a Brahmin . However , Kalmashapada devours the youth . The chaste Brahmin widow wails and curses Kalmashapada that he will die if he touches any woman with amorous intent . The wife cremates her husband and commits sati by jumping into his funeral pyre . 
 The Shiva Purana adds an continuation : The sin of killing a Brahmin transforms into a monster called Brahmahatya , who starts following Kalmashapada . The latter tries to escape the monster , and finally reaches King Janaka 's court . There , the sage Gautama teaches Kalmashapada divine knowledge and directs him to the Shiva temple of Gokarna to free him of his sins . At Gokarna , Kalmashapada performs intense austerities and is liberated from Brahmahatya . 
 The Mahabharata also records an encounter between the sage Uttanka and Kalmashapada . After serving his guru Gautama for a hundred years , Uttanka is allowed to go , but must provide Gautama with <unk> , a traditional repayment for his teacher 's services . Gautama 's wife Ahalya suggests that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti , Kalmashapada 's wife , as repayment . Uttanka meets the cannibalistic Kalmashapada , who approaches Uttanka to eat him , but Uttanka stops him and explains that he is duty @-@ bound to get Madayanti 's earrings as gurudakshina and that he , Uttanka , will return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation . Kalmashapada agrees and directs him to his wife , who refuses to part with her earrings until Uttanka brings some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent . Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token , Madayanti gives him the earrings . 
 = = Liberation from the curse and children = = 
 The Mahabharata narrates that Vashishtha meets Kalmashapada at the end of the 12 @-@ year period and frees the king of the curse . The king returns to his original form and accepts the sage as his guru and <unk> ( priest ) . Both of them return to Ayodhya . However , Kalmashapada is still heirless and cannot unite with his wife in coitus due to the Brahmin widow 's curse . The king requests Vashishtha to inseminate Madayanti , following the practice of niyoga . The queen becomes pregnant by the sage but does not deliver for 12 years . Finally , the frustrated queen breaks her womb with a stone and her son is born . Since the son is born with the aid of a stone ( Ashman ) , he is named <unk> ( " the child born of a stone " ) . The Mahabharata adds that this act of " giving " his wife to a Brahmin helps Kalmashapada attain heaven . 
 A central character of the epic , King Pandu , who is cursed to die upon having sex with his wife , convinces his wife Kunti to have niyoga with the gods and mother children for him , citing the example of Kalmashapada . The scholar Meyer suggests that the tale of Pandu may be inspired by the much older narrative of Kalmashapada . 
 Other texts agree that Vashishtha ends Kalmashapada 's curse ; however , there is some variation . In the Bhagavata Purana , Vashishtha himself strikes the queen 's belly with a stone after seven years to free the child . The Vishnu Purana credits the queen for opening her own womb , but the period is seven years . 
 All texts agree that Kalmashapada is an ancestor of Dasharatha and his divine son Rama , the hero of the Ramayana . The names of Kalmashapada 's children and the number of generations between Kalmashapada and Dasharatha varies . The Vishnu Purana , the Vayu Purana , the Bhagavata Purana , the Kurma Purana , and the Linga Purana contain a few variations of the names . According to them , <unk> was the son of Kalmashapada , and nine generations lie between Kalmashapada and Dasharatha . The Matsya Purana , the Agni Purana , the Brahma Purana , and the Harivamsa call Kalmashapada 's son <unk> ( who is said to be the grandfather of Kalmashapada in the Vishnu Purana , et al . ) , but agree as to the number of generations with the Vishnu Purana , et al . The Ramayana identifies the son as <unk> and states that ten generations lie between Kalmashapada and Dasharatha . 
 = Archaeoindris = 
 Archaeoindris fontoynontii is an extinct giant lemur and the largest primate known to have evolved on Madagascar , comparable in size to a male gorilla . It belonged to a family of extinct lemurs known as " sloth lemurs " ( Palaeopropithecidae ) , and because of its extremely large size , it has been compared to the ground sloths that once roamed North and South America . It was most closely related to Palaeopropithecus , the second largest type of sloth lemur . Along with the other sloth lemurs , Archaeoindris was related to the living indri , sifakas , and woolly lemurs , as well as the recently extinct monkey lemurs ( Archaeolemuridae ) . The genus , Archaeoindris , translates to " ancient indri @-@ like lemur " , even though it probably became extinct recently , around 350 BC . 
 Archaeoindris was first described by Herbert F. Standing in 1909 based on subfossil fragmentary jaws , although Charles Lamberton later discovered a complete skull . Only six bones from the lower skeleton have been found , and excavations in the 1980s offered no leads for new finds . Its remains have been found at only one location : Ampasambazimba , a subfossil site in central Madagascar . Following its initial discovery , some subfossil remains of Megaladapis grandidieri ( a type of extinct koala lemur ) were mistakenly associated with Archaeoindris , while smaller leg bones from a juvenile and a massive adult leg bone were erroneously assumed to belong to two separate species . These errors were gradually corrected between the 1930s and 1980s . The skeleton of Archaeoindris was massive and robust , and shared many traits with that of Palaeopropithecus . The arms were longer than the legs , but no hand or foot bones have been found for comparison with the other sloth lemurs . 
 Size estimates based on the limited remains have varied widely , ranging as high as 244 @.@ 1 kilograms ( 538 pounds ) , but the most thorough statistical investigation using regression analyses predicts a mass of 160 kg ( 350 lb ) . <unk> and limited remains have resulted in varying opinions about the way Archaeoindris moved in its environment , ranging from tree @-@ dwelling to ground @-@ dwelling . Its skeleton suggests it was a deliberate climber that visited the ground to travel . The diet of Archaeoindris was mostly leaves , and its habitat — prior to human arrival — was a mix of woodlands , bushlands , and savanna , rich in lemur diversity . Today , the region is dominated by grasslands and lemur diversity is very low in the nearest protected area , Ambohitantely Special Reserve . Although it was a rare lemur , it was still extant when humans first arrived on Madagascar , and it would have been vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The generic name Archaeoindris , meaning " ancient indri @-@ like lemur " , is derived from the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> , or " ancient " ) and <unk> , a common variation of the generic name Indri . The species name , fontoynontii ( sometimes spelled fontoynonti ) , was selected in honor of Antoine Maurice <unk> , the president of the Académie Malgache ( Malagasy Academy ) at the time . <unk> was reported to have been supervising the excavation when it was discovered . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 Archaeoindris was a type of sloth lemur ( family Palaeopropithecidae ) , a recently extinct family of giant lemurs ( known as subfossil lemurs ) native to Madagascar . Its ancestors were likely arboreal ( tree @-@ dwelling ) , and this giant sloth lemur has been compared to the extinct giant ground sloths of North and South America . 
 Archaeoindris was most closely related to Palaeopropithecus , a genus containing the second largest of the sloth lemurs and specialized for suspensory behavior in its arboreal habitat . Traits of the <unk> ( skeleton below the skull ) indicate that Babakotia was the next most closely related sloth lemur to Archaeoindris and Palaeopropithecus , followed by Mesopropithecus , the smallest of the sloth lemurs . 
 All four genera of sloth lemurs are known to be a sister taxon ( close relatives ) of family Indriidae , which includes the indri ( Indri ) , sifakas ( Propithecus ) , and woolly lemurs ( Avahi ) . This relationship is supported by data from morphological , developmental , and molecular research . Another member of this clade ( related group ) is the family of monkey lemurs ( Archaeolemuridae ) . Dental features , such as the morphology of their molar teeth and the modified number of teeth in their toothcomb ( a specialized grooming structure found in lemuriforms ) , have long suggested a relationship . However , other anatomical and developmental traits suggested that monkey lemurs might be more closely related to family Lemuridae , which include five genera of lemur , including the ring @-@ tailed lemur ( Lemur catta ) . Molecular analysis has shown strong support for the former , placing the monkey lemurs in a clade with the sloth lemurs and indriids . 
 = = = Taxonomic classification = = = 
 The family Palaeopropithecidae contained a large number of species compared to most other subfossil lemur families . It included four genera and seven species , all of which are now extinct . Among these was the genus Archaeoindris , one of only a few monotypic lemur taxa . 
 Archaeoindris fontoynontii was first described by Herbert F. Standing in 1909 from two fragments of a maxilla ( upper jaw ) and a complete mandible ( lower jaw ) . These type specimens — AM @-@ <unk> ( maxillae ) and AM @-@ <unk> ( mandible ) — are stored in the collection at the University of Antananarivo . The mandible contains a complete set of upper teeth , the left maxillary fragment contains the last premolar ( P4 ) and all three molars ( M1 – M3 ) , and the right maxillary fragment bears both premolars ( P2 and P4 ) and the first molar ( M1 ) . At the time , Standing noted similarities with the dentition of Palaeopropithecus . Sixteen years after Standing 's discovery , Charles Lamberton discovered the first and only complete cranium ( skull ) and associated mandible for Archaeoindris , both of which were well preserved . He published this find in 1934 . 
 Only six postcranial specimens of Archaeoindris have been found . Two of these belonged to an adult and include a damaged humerus ( upper arm bone ) and an almost complete femur ( thigh bone ) . The other four come from an immature individual and include a damaged humerus , a damaged ulna ( lower arm bone ) , and two femurs , both lacking the <unk> ( rounded end of the bone ) on both ends . Archaeoindris is one of the least common of the subfossil lemurs , and the few known specimens were all found at Ampasambazimba in the Central Highlands . Excavations run by a multi @-@ disciplinary Malagasy @-@ American team at this fossil site between 1983 and 1984 yielded no new subfossil remains , and no other potential sites are known for this species . 
 Historically , some remains from other subfossil lemurs have been mistakenly attributed to Archaeoindris , resulting in incorrect interpretations of its anatomy and behavior . In 1934 , Lamberton missed earlier attribution errors and incorrectly labeled a tibia and two fibulae ( lower leg bones ) from a species of koala lemur ( Megaladapis grandidieri ) as belonging to Archaeoindris . Because of these misattributions and Lamberton 's use of the immature bones , his reconstruction was inaccurate . In 1936 , Alice Carleton corrected Lamberton by identifying the tibia and fibulae as belonging to a koala lemur . Carleton 's corrections were later confirmed and other misattributions were corrected in the 1960s and 1970s by Alan Walker and William L. Jungers . 
 In 1910 , twenty @-@ four years before Lamberton 's monograph on Archaeoindris , Standing identified a massive right femur from Ampasambazimba as a new species , Lemuridotherium <unk> . Although Standing recognized the strong similarities between Lemuridotherium and Archaeoindris , he placed them in separate genera due to what he perceived as a great size difference . Lamberton was also persuaded by the size difference , partly because he failed to recognize the smaller tibia and fibulae as belonging to the smaller Megaladapis grandidieri . Furthermore , Lamberton did not realize that the smaller femurs he assigned to Archaeoindris belonged to a juvenile . Although some later authors considered Lemuridotherium a synonym of Archaeoindris , it was not until 1988 that Martine <unk> @-@ <unk> provided a definitive proof . <unk> @-@ <unk> also established associations between the postcrania and crania of <unk> , summarized what is known about the postcranial skeleton , and documented the strong similarity with the genus Palaeopropithecus . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 Though similar to Palaeopropithecus , Archaeoindris was significantly larger and more robust . Archaeoindris was one of the largest primates to ever evolve , and was the largest @-@ known strepsirrhine primate , weighing an estimated 160 kg ( 350 lb ) . It was roughly the size of an adult male gorilla , which was first noted by Lamberton . 
 Since its discovery , size estimates have varied from " larger than a human " to " possibly the largest primate ever " . In a study by Jungers from 1990 , the area of its molar teeth predicted a mass of 230 @.@ 5 kg ( 508 lb ) , while the femoral head diameter predicted a mass of 244 @.@ 1 kg ( 538 lb ) . In 1995 , Laurie Godfrey estimated a mass of 197 @.@ 5 kg ( 435 lb ) using the midshaft circumferences of the humerus and femur . Based on multiple regressions of the cortical area of the femur in 2008 , Jungers and colleagues generated the current best estimate of 161 @.@ 2 kg ( 355 lb ) with a possible range of 150 – 187 @.@ 8 kg ( 331 – 414 lb ) . These estimates were considered to be more accurate since the harder cortical bone in the midshaft of the femur supported an animal 's weight , and its thickness better correlated with the animal 's mass than the midshaft diameter ( which includes both hard cortex and spongy bone ) . The only fossil primate that was probably larger than Archaeoindris was Gigantopithecus <unk> , a close relative of orangutans . 
 Like all three species of Palaeopropithecus , Archaeoindris exhibited derived traits not seen in the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur . These traits included deflated auditory bullae and paired protrusions of bone around the nasal opening consisting of part of the premaxilla and the nasal bones . Its skull was wider than that of Megaladapis , but shorter , measuring 269 millimeters ( 10 @.@ 6 inches ) . Its face was shorter than that of Palaeopropithecus , with its eyes directed further forward . The neurocranium ( braincase ) was small and elevated relative to the face , unlike Palaeopropithecus . <unk> constriction ( narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets ) is pronounced . The skull also bore a low , broad sagittal crest ( a ridge of bone on the top of the skull to which jaw muscles attach ) and robust but smaller nuchal crests ( ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach ) . Unlike Palaeopropithecus the rims of the orbits ( eye sockets ) were not as thick . The area of the orbit was 946 mm2 ( 1 @.@ 466 sq in ) , comparable to that of gorillas . Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its optic canal , Archaeoindris had low retinal summation , meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light ( like living diurnal lemurs ) . Yet the ratio was not as low as in comparably sized apes , suggesting Archaeoindris had low visual acuity and lacked trichromatic color vision . 
 The jaw exhibited a long , robust mandibular symphysis ( joining of the two halves of the lower jaw ) , which fused early during development . Its palate ( bones on the roof of the mouth ) was rectangular . Like other sloth lemurs , it likely experienced accelerated dental development , and had an adult dental formula of 2 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 @.@ 32 @.@ 0 @.@ 2 @.@ 3 . Its teeth were also similar to those of Palaeopropithecus , both in morphology and proportions . The four lower incisors that would have made up the toothcomb were modified , being shorter and more robust , possibly for feeding purposes . The canines were short and stout , but sharp . Also , there was a diastema ( gap ) between the lower premolars ( p2 and p4 ) . Other dental similarities with Palaeopropithecus included small third upper and lower molars ( M3 and m3 ) , the first and second molars were narrow and long , and the enamel of its cheek teeth was crenulated ( low and rounded ) , though not as wrinkled and slightly higher @-@ crowned . 
 Most bones of the postcranial skeleton , including the bones of the hands , feet , vertebral column , ribs , radius ( lower arm bone ) , tibia , and fibula , have not been found for Archaeoindris . As with many cranial features , the postcranial bones that have been discovered are similar to that of Palaeopropithecus , but significantly larger and more robust . The head of the femur was large and lacked a fovea capitis <unk> ( a small depression in the head of the femur ) . The femur was short and extremely robust , had a very high <unk> angle ( the angle of the neck and shaft of the bone ) , and the greater trochanter was small . In the adult , the humerus was significantly longer than the femur , while in the immature specimen , both the humerus and ulna were much longer than the femur , making the arms considerably longer than the legs , as also seen in Palaeopropithecus . The relative length of the arms to the legs was shorter in Archaeoindris , so although its intermembral index was over 100 , it was lower than that of Palaeopropithecus . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Archaeoindris is thought to have been a leaf @-@ eater ( folivorous ) , a view supported by wear patterns on its teeth . Its fused mandibular symphyses and the likelihood of accelerated dental development suggest that it began processing fibrous foods in the mouth with thorough chewing . Its diet may also have included some fruits and seeds . Like most of the other giant lemurs , Archaeoindris is thought to have been diurnal because of its relatively small orbits , which are comparable to those of gorillas . 
 Both Standing and Lamberton assumed Archaeoindris to be a slow @-@ moving tree @-@ dweller like Megaladapis , primarily due to the misattributed bones . Lamberton also speculated that it would have resembled a ground sloth — a view later supported by Jungers in 1980 after several misattributions had been corrected and having considered its gorilla @-@ like size . Jungers went on to propose that it would have spent most of its time on the ground ( terrestrial ) . However , the functional morphology of its hip joint indicates a degree of mobility typically seen in more arboreal animals . Other traits shared with Palaeopropithecus , particularly seen in the femur , suggest that Archaeoindris spent considerable time in the trees for feeding and possibly nesting , although it also would have visited the ground to feed and travel . It is described as a deliberate , scansorial ( climbing ) browser , and it is unknown whether it was like Palaeopropithecus in performing hang @-@ feeding since hand and foot bones are missing . Given its bulky size , this would be unexpected . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Archaeoindris is only known from one subfossil site , Ampasambazimba , in central Madagascar , and all remains date to the Late Quaternary . The area today is dominated by grasslands , particularly of the grass genus Aristida . Prior to human arrival , the area around Ampasambazimba was not completely forested , but more of an open habitat , consisting of a mix of woodlands , bushlands , and savanna . Animal remains at this subfossil site have yielded about 20 species of lemur living in sympatry ( sharing the same geographic area ) . In comparison , the nearby Ambohitantely Special Reserve today contains only 4 species , roughly 20 % of the area 's original lemur diversity . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 Despite being the most species @-@ rich family among the giant lemurs , all four genera of sloth lemur , including Archaeoindris , have gone extinct . Radiocarbon dating of the stratigraphic level of some of the Archaeoindris remains were dated to 8000 BP , while two other specimens were dated to 2362 – <unk> BP ( 412 – 199 BCE ) and 2711 – <unk> BP ( 761 – 388 BCE ) . From these dates , it is likely that Archaeoindris was still alive on the high plateau in 350 BCE when the first humans reached the west coast of Madagascar , despite being rare by that time . Consequently , it would have been especially vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss . 
 = 1942 Belize hurricane = 
 The 1942 Belize hurricane was the only known hurricane to strike Belize in the month of November . The thirteenth observed tropical cyclone , eleventh tropical storm , and fourth hurricane of the 1942 Atlantic hurricane season , this storm was detected in the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5 . Initially a tropical storm , it strengthened slowly while moving westward and then south @-@ southwestward across the Bahamas . On November 6 , the storm became a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Later that day , it made landfall in Cayo Romano , Camagüey Province , Cuba . Impact in Cuba and the Bahamas was limited to lower barometric pressure readings and strong winds . While crossing Cuba , the system weakened to a tropical storm early on November 7 , shortly before emerging into the Caribbean Sea . The storm re @-@ strengthened into a hurricane later that day and headed southwestward . 
 Late on November 8 , this system curved westward and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane . Six hours later , it peaked with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . Early on November 9 , the storm struck Caye Caulker and northern Belize District . Rapidly weakening , the system fell to tropical storm status within 12 hours of landfall . By early on November 10 , it emerged into the Bay of Campeche . The storm meandered erratically until striking the Yucatán Peninsula on November 11 and dissipating hours later . Strong winds were observed in Belize and Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula . Severe damage was reported in the former . About 90 % of structures in San Pedro Town were destroyed , while Newtown was completely obliterated , causing its residents to relocate and establish the village of Hopkins . Trees and crops such as coconuts also suffered heavy losses . Overall , nine deaths and approximately $ 4 million ( 1942 USD ) in damage were reported .

 A tropical wave moved through the West Indies between November 3 and November 4 . The wave reached the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5 , where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC . The storm moved north @-@ northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas . A ridge aloft blocked the storm 's westward progress and caused it to re @-@ curve west @-@ southwestward on November 6 . The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Around 1800 UTC on November 6 , the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on November 7 , shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea . Later that day , the storm re @-@ intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and continued on a southwestward path . 
 Around midday on November 8 , the storm curved westward while approaching Belize and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) ; this may be a conservative assessment , as it is possible the storm strengthened into a major hurricane , but there was no conclusive data . This storm was the only known hurricane to strike Belize in the month of November . At about 0000 UTC on November 9 , the storm struck Caye Caulker and then northern Belize District at the same intensity . An observatory in Belize City recorded a barometric pressure of 991 mbar ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) – the lowest in association with this storm . The storm rapidly weakened inland and fell to tropical storm intensity by 1200 UTC on November 9 . It then curved northwestward , reaching the Bay of Campeche early on November 10 . The storm drifted erratically to the west of the Yucatán Peninsula and eventually curved southeastward . Around 1200 UTC on November 11 , the system made another landfall near Campeche , Campeche with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Less than six hours later , the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In the Bahamas , a barometric pressure reading of 997 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) and force 9 sustained winds on the Beaufort scale were observed on at Georgetown on Exuma . No damage was reported in that country . Strong winds were reported in some areas of Cuba . Cayo <unk> Grande in Camagüey Province recorded sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , while the city of Camagüey observed wind gusts up to 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) . In Mexico , the storm struck the Gulf Coast of the Yucatan Peninsula near Campeche , Campeche , where wind gust of force 9 on the Beaufort scare were observed . In Quintana Roo , damaged vegetation fueled a large forest fire . 
 Although the storm 's intensity was equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane , sustained winds in Belize reached only 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) . Damage from the hurricane was mainly limited to an area along the coast about 100 miles ( 160 km ) north to south and 40 to 50 miles ( 64 to 80 km ) east to west . In San Pedro Town , about 90 % of structures were destroyed . Newtown was completely demolished , causing its resident to establish the city of Hopkins further south . At Ambergris Caye , many houses and coconut plantations were damage or destroyed . This forced many laborers and coconut plantation owners to seek new professions ; most of them entered the fishing industry . Nine deaths were reported , though the toll may have been higher , as numerous small fishing boats were beached or swept out to sea . Widespread damage to vegetation and trees occurred . An assessment of damage after the storm indicated that more than 75 % of the canopy species had been destroyed . Although the low bush was not badly damaged , about 25 % to 50 % of the pine trees were toppled . Damage on deep soils was largely from breakage while on shallow soils mostly from wind throw . Tides along the coast split Caye Caulker into three separate islands and swept away " everything in its path " . Overall , damage totaled approximately $ 4 million , with $ 1 million to private and public property , including buildings and dwellings . The remaining $ 3 million in damage was incurred to coconuts and other crops ; this total possibly includes damage to the mahogany and chicle industries . 
 = Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 = 
 Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen ( Weeping , lamenting , worrying , fearing ) , BWV 12 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Weimar for Jubilate , the third Sunday after Easter , and led the first performance on 22 April 1714 in the Schlosskirche , the court chapel of the Schloss in Weimar . 
 Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714 , a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month . He composed Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen as the second cantata in the series , on a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck . The work is structured in seven movements , an instrumental Sinfonia , a choral passacaglia , a recitative on a Bible quotation , three arias and , as the closing chorale , the last stanza from Samuel Rodigast 's hymn " Was Gott tut , das ist wohlgetan " ( 1674 ) . The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir , trumpet , oboe , bassoon , two violins , two violas , and basso continuo . 
 Bach performed the cantata again in his first year as Thomaskantor – director of church music – in Leipzig , on 30 April 1724 . He reworked the first section of the first chorus to form the Crucifixus movement of the Credo in his Mass in B minor . Franz Liszt based extended keyboard compositions on the same material . 
 = = History and words = = 
 On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co @-@ reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe @-@ Weimar . As concertmaster , he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works , specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche ( palace church ) , on a monthly schedule . Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen is the second cantata in this series , composed for the third Sunday after Easter , Jubilate , after Himmelskönig , sei willkommen , BWV 182 , for Palm Sunday and Annunciation , and before Erschallet , ihr Lieder , erklinget , ihr Saiten ! BWV 172 , for Pentecost . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter , " Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man " ( 1 Peter 2 : 11 – 20 ) , and from the Gospel of John , Jesus announcing his second coming in the so @-@ called Farewell Discourse , saying " your sorrow shall be turned into joy " ( John 16 : 16 – 23 ) . The text , depicting the affliction that Christians have to pass , is assumed to have been written by Salomon Franck , the Weimar court poet who wrote most texts for Bach cantatas of the Weimar period . It follows details of the Gospel and the idea from the epistle reading : " For this is <unk> , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suffering <unk> . " ( verse 19 ) . The text of the opening chorus corresponds to John 16 : 20 , the text of the first recitative is taken from Acts 14 : 22 , " we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God " . Franck contends that this is true not only for the disciples who were addressed directly , but for every Christian . Movement 4 sees the suffering of Jesus as a consolation for the afflicted Christian , movement 5 voices a decision to follow Jesus even in suffering , movement 6 offers the consolation that it will be only a short time until all sadness is overcome , alluding to ( as in movement 4 ) Revelation 2 : 10 . The cantata is closed by the sixth and final stanza of the hymn " Was Gott tut , das ist wohlgetan " ( 1674 ) by Samuel Rodigast . Theme of the first part of the text is a situation of God 's temporary absence . 
 Bach first performed the cantata in the Weimar court chapel on 22 April 1714 , then performed it in Leipzig in his first year as Thomaskantor on 30 April 1724 . In Leipzig , Jubilate was the beginning of the trade fair <unk> ( Easter fair ) which attracted visitors for three weeks . His predecessor , Johan Kuhnau , had already noted that " visitors and distinguished gentlemen certainly want to hear something fine in the principal churches . " 
 Bach reworked the first section of the first chorus to form the Crucifixus movement of the Credo in his Mass in B minor , the central movement of that work , three decades later . Franz Liszt based works for keyboard ( organ or piano ) on the first section of movement 2 , Prelude after a theme from Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen by J. S. Bach ( <unk> , 1854 ) and Variations on a theme from Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen by J. S. Bach ( <unk> , 1862 ) .

 The cantata in seven movements is scored for three vocal soloists ( alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir SATB , trumpet ( Tr ) , oboe ( Ob ) , bassoon ( Fg ) , two violins ( Vl ) , two violas ( Va ) and basso continuo ( Bc ) . The duration is given as c . 28 minutes . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) .

 The autograph score is titled " Concerto a 1 Oboe , 2 Violini , 2 Viole , Fagotto è 4 Voci <unk> ' Organo " . John Eliot Gardiner notes that the keys of the arias and the closing chorale move upwards like a ladder , ascending by thirds .

 The cantata is opened by a Sinfonia , marked adagio assai , which resembles the slow movement of an oboe concerto , with an expressive and plaintive solo . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The first choral movement , " Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen " ( Weeping , lamentation , worry , despair ) , is in da capo form . The first section is built on a basso ostinato as an old @-@ style passacaglia in 3 / 2 time . The lamento , a chromatic fourth ostinato , is repeated twelve times . Musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Henry Purcell arrived at a similar motif in Dido 's Lament in the opera Dido and Aeneas , which Bach probably did not know . The first four words are each sung by a different vocal part , each overlapping the next . Beginning with the highest voice , each part sings an extended sigh . The setting is intensified , until in the seventh repeat all voices continue the text simultaneously : " Angst und Not " ( " dread and need " or " anguish and trouble " ) . The ninth repeat is similar to the first , but in more extreme harmonies . The twelfth repeat is instrumental . The middle section of the line about the Christians " die das <unk> Jesu <unk> " ( that bear the marks of Jesus ) , first marked " un poco allegro " , is in a contrasting mood . Its last section is marked andante , the voices enter one after the other , beginning with the lowest and rising . Throughout the middle section , the instruments play colla parte with the voices . John Eliot Gardiner describes the first section as a " tombeau , one of the most impressive and deeply affecting cantata movements Bach can have composed to that point " .

 The only recitative , " Wir müssen durch viel Trübsal in das Reich Gottes <unk> " ( We must enter the Kingdom of God through much sorrow ) , is accompanied by the strings in a recitativo accompagnato . 
 In German , sorrow is mentioned first , then the final Kingdom of God . Bach repeats the beginning text four times , while the singular destination appears only once . The key word " Trübsal " is illustrated each time by a downward line , each time with more intensity . In the end , an ascending scale in the first violin illustrates the idea of entering the kingdom of God . The scale is in C major , while the movement is in C minor , a symbol of the Kingdom of God which is a seen but not yet present . The scale is related to the beginning of the tune of the closing chorale . 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 The first of three arias , " Kreuz und Krone sind <unk> " ( Cross and crown are bound together ) , reflects the conflicting motifs of " Kreuz und Krone " ( cross and crown ) and " Kampf und <unk> " ( conflict and jewel ) . The aria for alto voice and an oboe which almost always present , is in da capo form , ABA . A ritornello frames part A , but also accompanies the vocal entry . It is thus heard six times in different context , related to the repetitions of the passacaglia of movement 2 . The music illustrates the union of the four contrasting elements ( all beginning with K ) : Kampf is sung as a melisma with a trill in measure 15 , the preciousness of the jewel appears as a trill in the voice or the accompaniment . The text is also repeated in the middle section , as Bach was still experimenting with the da capo form . 
 = = = 5 = = = 
 In the second aria , " Ich <unk> Christo nach " ( I follow after Christ ) , the decision to follow Jesus is made . " Walking steps " in imitation symbolize the following . The first motif is an upward scale , illustrating the direction of Heaven , played by the first violin , imitated in fast succession by the second violin and then the continuo . The voice enters with the same motif . Towards the end , the steps are expanded to more than an octave , reaching Heaven . The bass singer and the continuo are in unison , interpreted as a mystical union of man and God . 
 = = = 6 = = = 
 During the last aria , " Sei <unk> , alle Pein " ( Be faithful , all pain ) , the trumpet plays the chorale tune " Jesu , meine Freude " as a cantus firmus ; Bach may have thought of the stanza " <unk> , ihr <unk> " ( Go away , mournful spirits ) . The form of the aria follows the bar form of the chorale instead of the usual da capo form .

 The closing chorale , " Was Gott tut , das ist wohlgetan " ( What God does , is well done ) , is set for four parts , illuminated by an instrumental obbligato part . Masaaki Suzuki and Gardiner use the trumpet that played the cantus firmus in the preceding aria .

 = Long War ( mod ) = 
 Long War is a fan @-@ made partial conversion mod for the turn @-@ based tactics video game XCOM : Enemy Unknown and its expansion , XCOM : Enemy Within . It was first released in early 2013 , and it exited beta at the end of 2015 . Almost every aspect of the original game is altered , creating a longer , more difficult campaign that presents players with more strategic choices and customization options . Long War adds a significant number of new soldier classes , abilities , weapons , armors , and usable items , and also introduces new features , including soldier fatigue and improvements to alien units over the course of the game . 
 The mod was developed by a team that came to include four core members , with assistance from 29 contributors , 20 voice actors , and three members of Firaxis Games , the developer of Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within . According to one of the mod 's core developers , Amineri , the mod started as a series of changes to the base game 's configuration file , and grew more expansive as the team 's capabilities grew . By the end of the mod 's development , the team was working directly with the Unreal Development Kit , and had created a Java @-@ based tool to help manage the changes that the mod was making . 
 Long War has received praise from both video game journalists and from the developers at Firaxis . It has been downloaded over 650 @,@ 000 times , by over 500 @,@ 000 different users . Firaxis announced that XCOM : Enemy Unknown 's sequel , XCOM 2 , would have built @-@ in support for modding . XCOM 2 's lead developer pointed to Long War as a reason for that decision . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 XCOM : Enemy Unknown is a turn @-@ based tactics video game developed by Firaxis Games and released in October 2012 . In XCOM : Enemy Unknown , the player assumes the role of the commander of a secret multinational military organization , XCOM , as it fights off an invasion by a numerically and technologically superior invading alien force . The player directs the organization 's research and development , manages its finances , and controls its soldiers in combat . XCOM : Enemy Within is an expansion of Enemy Unknown , and was released in November 2013 . Enemy Within added two additional ways for players to upgrade their soldiers - through genetic modification and through cybernetic combat suits called <unk> - as well as new alien units and a new enemy faction , a secret paramilitary organization called EXALT . 
 Long War is a partial conversion mod for XCOM : Enemy Unknown and XCOM : Enemy Within . It was first uploaded to NexusMods on 4 January 2013 , and exited beta with the release of version 1 @.@ 0 on 28 December 2015 . The developers announced in July 2015 with beta <unk> that they had finished adding new features , and that any future releases would only correct bugs or balance issues . At the time that it exited beta , the mod 's development was led by four core members , <unk> ( John J. Lumpkin ) , Amineri ( Rachel Norman ) , <unk> , and <unk> . They were joined by four senior contributors , 20 voice actors , and 29 contributors assisting with programming , art , sound engineering , translations , research , and porting the mod to Mac and Linux . Three members of Firaxis Games also provided assistance . The team released separate versions for Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within until the end of 2013 , and thereafter only released versions for Enemy Within . Long War has been downloaded from NexusMods over 650 @,@ 000 times by over 500 @,@ 000 separate users . 
 The aim of the Long War mod is , in the words of its developers , to create " much deeper strategic and tactical play and a greater variety of problems to throw at the player " . The mod makes changes to many of the game 's existing features , adds new concepts , and brings back concepts from the first game in the franchise , Julian Gollop 's UFO : Enemy Unknown . As the mod 's name implies , a campaign in Long War takes significantly longer than a campaign in the unmodified game , with Eurogamer 's Chris Bratt estimating it at around 150 hours . However , the mod does have an option that significantly shortens the campaign . ( at 3 : 20 ) 
 According to Amineri , one of the mod 's core developers , initial versions of Long War used changes to the game 's configuration file to change content in the game . After other mod makers that were not part of the Long War project discovered how to make changes to the game by directly working with its Unreal Engine , more significant game alterations became possible , and the forums of NexusMods became a hub where such changes were exchanged . Many of the mod 's key features , including the increased number of soldiers and the lengthened campaign , first appeared in version beta 1 @.@ 9 , which was released in mid 2013 . Shortly after Enemy Within released , Amineri and <unk> completed development of a Java @-@ based tool called <unk> that allowed the team to more effectively manage and implement the changes made by the mod . In the late stages of the mod 's development , the team worked directly with the Unreal Development Kit . 
 = = Gameplay differences = = 
 Long War introduced several new concepts into the game . Soldiers that are sent on missions come back fatigued . If they are sent back out on another mission before resting off their fatigue , they return from the second mission with injuries . The combination of fatigue and much longer injury times requires players to maintain a larger number of soldiers . ( at 2 : 10 ) The mod also adds improvements over time for the enemy forces . Over the course of the game , both the aliens and the EXALT paramilitary group introduced in Enemy Within conduct their own research , granting their units new abilities . The player has the opportunity to slow down this research by defeating the aliens or EXALT when they launch missions , and conversely the research happens faster when the player is unable to stop missions and when members of the council of nations that fund the player pull out of the council . It is difficult to halt their research completely , as the aliens capture a council nation early in the game and will occasionally launch missions with vastly superior forces that the player does not have a reasonable chance to defeat . The mod does add special missions that the player can launch to re @-@ take council nations that have fallen under alien control . ( at 3 : 45 ) 
 In the original game , players can initially field four soldiers at a time , which can be upgraded to six soldiers later in the game . In the mod , players begin the game able to deploy six soldiers , which can be upgraded to eight , with certain missions allowing the player to bring as many as twelve soldiers . The number of classes that the soldiers can be is doubled from four to eight , with each original class being split into two in the mod . Each class has a corresponding class of cybernetic <unk> soldier that they can be upgraded into . The mod also adds new classes of weapons including battle rifles , carbines , and sub @-@ machine guns . These choices affect soldiers damage and movement compared to the assault rifle from the base game . ( at 0 : 45 ) New usable items and armor types are also added . The mod increases the number of soldier abilities and gives players three choices instead of two when selecting new abilities each time a soldier levels up . Additionally , some of the abilities that were only available to one class in the base game became available to other classes in the mod . The mod increases psionic abilities , and gives players access to psionics earlier than in the base game . Underpinning all of these changes is a larger technology tree . Research also takes longer and has a higher cost . ( at 1 : 20 ) 
 = = Reception = = 
 The developers of the base game have been effusive in their praise for Long War . XCOM 2 lead producer Garth DeAngelis said " It 's unbelievable what they did " and called it his " go @-@ to recommendation " for hardcore fans . Jake Solomon , the lead designer of XCOM : Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 , and Ryan McFall , the lead engineer for XCOM 2 , praised the technical skill of the team behind Long War in a panel discussion at <unk> . Solomon , who recommended the mod in a tweet in 2014 , also praised the mod for adding so much content and for answering a desire within the player community . He called the base game " basically a 20 @-@ hour tutorial for The Long War " , which Chris Bratt of Eurogamer considered an exceptionally strong recommendation for the mod . ( at 0 : 00 ) 
 The mod has also been warmly received by video game journalists . Wired praised the amount of content added by the game and called it " the absolute best way to play XCOM " . In a video explaining the mod , Eurogamer 's Chris Bratt also praised the amount of new content , but was especially appreciative that the mod forced players to develop new strategies instead of relying on the tactics they used in the base game . ( at 1 : 20 ) Alec Meer of Rock , Paper , Shotgun complimented the mod for keeping the game fresh and capturing the feeling of surviving impossible odds , and gave the mod his strongest possible recommendation . The mod was profiled in PC Gamer 's " Mod of the Week " feature in late 2014 , and in a separate piece a year later , the publication praised how much the team behind the mod was able to accomplish considering that the base game was not built to support modding . Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's Adam Smith , in an article announcing that the Long War team were in " pre @-@ Kickstarter development " of their own game , called Long War " one of the best mods of all time " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In his article recommending the mod , Alec Meer of Rock , Paper , Shotgun speculated that the Long War mod influenced the development of XCOM 2 . One area where Long War 's influence was acknowledged was in the decision to support modding . The development team recognized that Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within were exceptionally difficult to mod , and aimed to make modding more accessible in the sequel . At a panel with XCOM 2 developers , Ryan McFall remarked that " we kind of watched in morbid fascination the Long War crew kind of hacking our game apart " before going on to provide a list of features and assets that would be available to people interested in modding XCOM 2 . Jake Solomon pointed to the successes of Long War and mods to games in the Civilization franchise in explaining the decision to support modding . 
 = Eriskay Pony = 
 The Eriskay Pony is a breed of pony from Scotland . It is generally grey in colour , and has a dense , waterproof coat that protects it in harsh weather . The breed developed in ancient times in the Hebrides islands in Scotland , and a small population remained pure and protected from crossbreeding by the remoteness of the islands . It is used for light draught work , as a mount for children , in many equestrian disciplines , and for driving . The breed is rare today , with the Rare Breeds Survival Trust considering their status critical . There are two breed registries for the Eriskay , the first formed in 1971 and the second in 1986 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The Eriskay Pony generally stands between 12 and 13 @.@ 2 hands ( 48 and 54 inches , 122 and 137 cm ) . It is usually grey in colour , although a few are bay or black . Dark coloured animals generally have the pangaré characteristics of a light @-@ coloured muzzle and ring around their eye . However , according to breed standards , they should not have an eel stripe . Chestnut , piebald , skewbald and excess white markings are discouraged by breed registries . The winter coat is dense and waterproof to protect from the harsh climate , with a thick mane and tail . The head is large , with a wide forehead . The neck and shoulders are well muscled , and the chest deep but generally not broad . The rib @-@ cage is long and the loins short , which increases the strength of the back . The croup is slightly sloping . It is quite similar to the Exmoor pony in body type . The Eriskay has an easy @-@ going temperament and is suitable as a mount for children . It is used for light draught work , as well as dressage , show jumping , three @-@ day eventing , western riding and driving . <unk> have successfully competed in combined driving at highly competitive international level competitions sanctioned by the Fédération <unk> Internationale . They have also been used in therapeutic horse @-@ riding . 
 = = History = = 
 The Eriskay Pony developed in the Hebrides , a group of western isles in Scotland . The origins of the breed are ancient , with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding . It is physically similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland . It is related to other northern breeds , including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony . The Eriskay takes its name from the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides . Originally , the breed had a fairly large population , and until the mid @-@ 19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland . They were used as crofters ' ponies , as pack animals , for light draught and as mounts for children . 
 During the 19th century numbers were much reduced through increased crossbreeding . The crossbreeding was used to produce larger ponies for draught work , and <unk> and other island ponies were crossed with horse breeds from mainland Europe , including Arabs and Clydesdales . Other horses , including the Norwegian Fjord , were crossed with island ponies , including the Eriskay , to produce the Highland pony . A few specimens of the Eriskay were preserved on the remotest islands of Scotland , mainly due to the difficulties of accessing the islands . This stock of ponies remained pure , but through the advent of mechanisation , declined in population to around 20 animals in the early 1970s . In 1941 the SS Politician foundered off the Eriskay coast , and the islanders , using the Eriskay ponies , carried away the cargo of 250 @,@ 000 bottles of whisky . 
 Today the Eriskay is rare . Its population is considered to be at critical status by the UK @-@ based Rare Breeds Survival Trust , meaning that there are 300 or fewer breeding females registered in the world today . In 2006 , there were believed to have been around 300 mares and 4 purebred stallions , and by 2009 this number had risen to around 420 ponies worldwide . It is possible that the Eriskay is the last surviving Hebrides pony breed . There are two breed registries that represent the breed . The first ( the Eriskay Pony ( Purebred ) Studbook Society or Comann Each nan Eilean , formed in 1971 has the goal of maintaining the purity of the Eriskay breed , and disallows all crossbreeding . The second ( the Eriskay Pony Society , formed in 1986 aims to produce ponies with desirable traits , which the registry feels will help promote their survival – this registry has considered the possibility of cross @-@ breeding . The Eriskay Pony Society achieved legal recognition as a breed society and passport issuing organisation for the UK in 1995 ; Comann Each nan Eilean did not receive legal recognition until 2002 . 
 In addition to the domesticated ponies there is a small herd of Eriskay ponies living in a feral state on the Holy Isle . These ponies are descended from a group of five ponies brought to the Holy Isle to when it was owned by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in the 1970s to form a nature reserve . Today the island is owned by the <unk> Buddhist Centre for World Peace and Health . They operate a policy of non @-@ intervention , allowing the ponies to live without human interference .

 NY 335 begins at an intersection with Feura Bush Road southeast of the hamlet of Delmar in the town of Bethlehem . Although Feura Bush Road is now NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route , it was once part of NY 32 . From Feura Bush Road , NY 335 heads northward as a two @-@ lane street named Elsmere Avenue , passing several housing tracts in an otherwise open area of the town . After a half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) , the route meets the Delmar Bypass , a four @-@ lane divided highway carrying NY 32 through Bethlehem . Past the bypass , NY 335 traverses dense residential neighborhoods on its way to the hamlet of Elsmere , one of several communities located along NY 443 . 
 In Elsmere , the route runs along the east side of Bethlehem Cemetery on its way to a junction with Kenwood Avenue , a local east – west street that becomes NY 140 at a junction less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the west in the adjacent hamlet of Delmar . Continuing on , NY 335 serves two more blocks of homes before passing under an overpass that once carried a Delaware and Hudson Railway line . The abandoned overpass serves as a divider between the residential section of the community and Elsmere 's central business district , where NY 335 ends at a junction with NY 443 ( Delaware Avenue ) one block north of the old railroad bridge .

 On May 11 , 1914 , the state of New York awarded a contract to rebuild Elsmere Avenue to state highway standards . The project cost $ 18 @,@ 489 ( equivalent to $ 436 @,@ 795 in 2016 ) , and the reconstructed road was added to the state highway system on October 27 , 1914 , as unsigned State Highway 1184 . It did not receive a posted designation until the 1930s , when it was designated NY 335 . At the time , the route connected to NY 32 at Feura Bush Road . In 1959 , the state of New York developed plans for the Delmar Bypass , which would intersect NY 335 a short distance north of Feura Bush Road . The Bethlehem Central Board of Education had called for a grade @-@ separated interchange between the highway and NY 335 to ensure the safety of school buses on the latter road , a major bus route ; however , the junction was ultimately built as an at @-@ grade intersection . 
 The Delmar Bypass was opened in December 1963 , connecting Elm Avenue in the west to U.S. Route 9W in the east . The state did not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary . In mid @-@ January 1964 , the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near @-@ misses at the crossings . This request was eventually granted . The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY 32 was realigned to follow the highway . As a result , NY 335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end .

 Mythodea — Music for the NASA Mission : 2001 Mars Odyssey is a 1993 choral symphony by Greek electronic composer and artist Vangelis . Originally premiered in concert in 1993 , it was published in 2001 by Vangelis ' new record label Sony Classical , which also set up the NASA connection and promoted a new concert . 
 The 2001 version of Mythodea was recorded and played on @-@ stage by : Vangelis on synthesizers and keyboards , the London Metropolitan Orchestra augmented by two harpists , sopranos Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman , the chorus of the Greek National Opera , and , for the concert only , the Seistron and Typana percussion ensembles . The concert was held in Athens , Greece on June 28 , 2001 , and the record was officially released on October 23 , 2001 , to coincide with the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft entering the orbit of planet Mars . A video of the concert was released in early 2002 .

 The world premiere of <unk> ( first spelling ) took place on July 13 , 1993 as a public performance at the Herodes Atticus Theater , in Athens , Greece , for charity purposes . On stage were : Vangelis , who provided the full musical score accompanied by two harpists ; mezzo @-@ soprano <unk> <unk> , soprano Lucienne Deval , and the chorus and percussion of the Greek National Lyric Stage , conducted by Yvan Cassar . 
 <unk> was then a piece in seven movements . Vangelis not only composed the music , he also wrote the lyrics in Ancient Greek . In a 2001 interview with <unk> magazine , Vangelis stated , 
 " This piece was composed in an hour . Yes , it took me an hour . [ … ] I 'm not using the technology in the conventional way . I 'm not using computers . " 
 For the encore , Vangelis played a selection of his repertoire , including " La Petite Fille de la Mer " ( from the album L <unk> des Animaux ) , " Chariots of Fire " , " <unk> " ( from the album Albedo 0 @.@ 39 ) , three tracks from the soundtrack of the film Conquest of Paradise ( " <unk> " , " City of Isabel " and " Conquest of Paradise " ) , and finished with a performance of the Greek national anthem .

 Mythodea would remain unheard in public for the next eight years , but Vangelis kept a recording of the 1993 concert for himself . Around the year 2000 , Peter Gelb was the head of Sony Classical and was steering the record company in the direction of crossover music rather than mainstream classical repertoire . He had just signed with Vangelis and was in the process of selecting their first release together . Gelb was listening to some tapes that Vangelis had sent to him when he came upon Mythodea . He described the event in an interview : " When I first heard Mythodea I was in ecstasy with its rhythm and power themes , and with no further hesitation I suggested it was recorded immediately . " 
 With the approval of Vangelis to record Mythodea with a full orchestra as Gelb had suggested , Sony Classical developed a marketing plan of Mythodea that with the help of Vangelis ' friend and colleague , Dr. Scott Bolton , grew to include a promotional tie @-@ in with NASA , a dedicated website , an audio CD and a live concert that involved the Greek Government and was broadcast on TV and published on video . The deal with NASA made Mythodea the official music of the mission involving the spacecraft 2001 Mars Odyssey . This mission took the spacecraft to the orbit of Mars on October 23 , 2001 , and the audio CD of Mythodea was scheduled to be officially released on the same day . Vangelis described the connection he felt between the music and the mission on the 2001 Mars Odyssey official website : 
 The premiere of the new version of Mythodea was held on June 28 , 2001 . By this date , the album had already been recorded and was finished . The concert was a live performance of the album , with everyone involved in the recording reprising their roles plus additional performers . The setting was the ancient ( 6th century BC ) Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens , Greece , featured on the album and video covers . Vangelis commented on the selection of location in an interview : " The record company wanted to promote this work and asked me ' where [ ... ] ? ' and I thought that [ ... ] Greece was really appropriate . And at the same time I had a proposition from the Minister of Culture [ ... ] and this is what happened . " 
 The concert was taped for later broadcast on TV and release on DVD . The budget was set at US $ 7 million , split in half between the record company , Sony Classical , and the Greek government , which considered the concert a good promotion for Greece abroad and included it as part of the Greek Cultural Olympiad leading to the 2004 Summer Olympics . There were some objections raised , mainly by fellow musician <unk> <unk> , over the use of both public money and an archaeological site . Vangelis himself , like in 1993 , waived payment for his performance . 
 The spectacle involved 224 musicians on stage , the same involved in the recording : Vangelis , two harpists , the 75 @-@ person London Metropolitan Orchestra , the 120 @-@ person chorus of the Greek National Opera , plus newcomers Greek percussion ensembles Seistron and Typana , that provided 24 timpani . In the back , a projection screen measuring 180 metres in length and 24 metres in height ( 591 ft by 79 ft ) showed images of Mars supplied by NASA , combined with elements of ancient Greek mythology . 
 The number of attending spectators to the ticket @-@ paid event was between 2 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 500 , with another 30 @,@ 000 people watching for free on a giant screen at the nearby Panathinaiko Stadium . The concert lasted just over one hour , after which three encores were played : Chariots of Fire , Conquest of Paradise , and a combination of Movements 9 and 10 . Mars itself made a special appearance at the concert as an announcer told the spectators to look for an orange spot shining in the clear sky above the orchestra . The concert was repeated the following day without an audience , to get extra camera angles . Despite not having been announced , around 50 people who showed up at the venue were admitted for free , authorized by Vangelis himself . Mythodea was expected to be performed by other orchestras , without Vangelis ' participation , but as of 2007 that had not happened .
