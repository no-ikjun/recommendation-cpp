 = = = = Other oxidation states = = = = 
 A few compounds exist in oxidation states other than + 2 and + 4 , but they do not have a great impact on lead chemistry from either theoretical or industrial perspective . Lead ( III ) may be obtained under specific conditions as an intermediate between lead ( II ) and lead ( IV ) , in larger organolead complexes rather than by itself . This oxidation state is not specifically stable , as the lead ( III ) ion ( as well as , consequently , larger complexes containing it ) is a radical ; the same applies for lead ( I ) , which can also be found in such species . Negative oxidation states can occur as Zintl phases , as either free lead anions , for example , in Ba 
 <unk> , with lead formally being lead ( − IV ) , or cluster ions , for example , in a Pb5 − 
 2 ion , where two lead atoms are lead ( − I ) and three are lead ( 0 ) : this illustrates lead 's proclivity towards catenation , an ability shared with tin . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Since lead is a heavier carbon homolog , it shares with carbon the property of being able to build long chains of atoms , bonded via single or multiple bonds : catenation . Lead may therefore behave in a similar way to carbon with regards to covalent chemistry . Lead atoms can build metal – metal bonds of order up to three , although lower orders are also possible . Alternatively , lead is also known to build bonds to carbon ; the carbon – lead bonds are covalent , and compounds containing such bonds thus resemble typical organic compounds . Compound containing the lead – carbon bond are called organolead compounds . In general , such compounds are not very stable chemically . 
 The simplest lead analog of an organic compound is plumbane , the lead analog of methane . It is unstable against heat , decaying in heated tubes , and thermodynamically ; in general , little is known about chemistry of plumbane , as it is so unstable . A lead analog of the next alkane , ethane , is not known . Two simple plumbane derivatives , <unk> and tetraethyllead , are the best @-@ known organolead compounds . These compounds are relatively unstable against heating — tetraethyllead starts to decompose at only 100 ° C ( 210 ° F ) — as well as sunlight or ultraviolet light . General oxidizing nature of organolead compounds find its use in chemistry : tetraethyllead is produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound ; lead <unk> is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry . Other organolead compounds , including homologs of the said compounds , are still less chemically stable . 
 Lead readily forms an equimolar alloy with sodium metal that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds of lead such as tetraethyllead . <unk> may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic ( not molecular ) hydrogen . Atoms of chlorine or bromine displace <unk> in <unk> and tetraethyllead ; hydrogen chloride , a by @-@ product of the previous reaction , further reacts with the halogenated molecules to complete mineralization — a chemical reaction or a series of reactions transforming an organic compound into an inorganic one — of the original compounds , yielding lead dichloride .

 Primordial lead — the isotopes lead @-@ 204 , lead @-@ 206 , lead @-@ 207 , and lead @-@ 208 — was created by the s @-@ process and the r @-@ process . The letter " s " stands for " slow " or " slow neutron capture " , and the letter " r " stands for " rapid neutron capture " : in the s @-@ process another capture takes a long time , centuries or millennia , while the r @-@ process takes only tens of seconds to result in a heavy nuclide of lead 's mass . In the s @-@ process , a nucleus in a star captures another slow neutron , and if the resulting nucleus is unstable , it typically undergoes a beta decay to become an element of the next atomic number . Lead @-@ 204 is created from short @-@ lived thallium @-@ 204 ; on capturing another neutron , it becomes lead @-@ 205 , which , while unstable , is stable enough to generally last longer than a capture takes ( its half @-@ life is around 15 million years ) . Further captures result in lead @-@ 206 , lead @-@ 207 , and lead @-@ 208 . On capturing another neutron , lead @-@ 208 becomes lead @-@ 209 , which quickly decays into bismuth @-@ 209 , which on capturing another neutron becomes bismuth @-@ 210 , which either undergoes an alpha decay to result in thallium @-@ 206 , which would beta decay into lead @-@ 206 , or a beta decay to yield polonium @-@ 210 , which would inevitably alpha decay into lead @-@ 206 as well , and the cycle ends at lead @-@ 206 , lead @-@ 207 , lead @-@ 208 , and bismuth @-@ 209 . As a result , relative abundances of the three have stable lead isotopes are multiplied by a " cycling factor " , which depends on the conditions of the process . Furthermore , lead @-@ 208 and bismuth @-@ 209 have a very low cross section towards neutron capture because of their closed neutron shell at neutron number 126 . Lead and bismuth are thus very common in stars , in which nucleosynthesis mostly happens through the s @-@ process . 
 Apart from the s @-@ process , the latter three isotopes have been synthesized as a result of the r @-@ process ( lead @-@ 204 is not produced in this manner because its isobar mercury @-@ 204 is stable , and it is not formed as a decay product of r @-@ process products ) . The r @-@ process happens in mediums of great electron density . In such conditions , beta decay is blocked , because the high electron density fills all available free electron states up to a Fermi energy which is greater than the energy of nuclear beta decay . But nuclear capture of those free neutrons can still occur , and it causes neutron enrichment of matter . This results an extremely high density of free neutrons which cannot decay , and , correspondingly , a large neutron flux and high temperatures , which is the reason why neutron capture occurs much faster than beta decay . However , the r @-@ process does not directly form as much lead as the s @-@ process , because neutron @-@ rich nuclei with mass numbers 206 – 208 that would decay to lead are not magic , unlike those that reach the closed neutron shell at neutron number 126 and decay to the platinum group metals around mass number 194 . This effect is nevertheless masked , because these lead isotopes are also located at the end of three major decay chains ( see above ) , they are created by the decay of the heavier elements , which are also created by the r @-@ process . <unk> with mass numbers between 210 and 231 inclusive , as well as 233 and 234 ( polonium through actinium , as well as protactinium ) , quickly undergo alpha and beta decay to stable lead and bismuth isotopes . However , nuclides with mass numbers 232 as well as 235 and above soon decay to the extremely long @-@ lived isotopes of thorium and uranium , which decay very slowly to lead . Hence , the amount of lead in the universe is still slowly increasing . 
 The isotopes at the end of the chains make up around 98 @.@ 02 % lead in the universe , with non @-@ radiogenic lead @-@ 204 making up slightly less than two percent . Lead is not an abundant element in general — its per @-@ particle abundance in the Universe is 0 @.@ 06 ppb — still , it is an order of magnitude more abundant than mercury , and further exceeds those of most other elements of similar atomic numbers . After element 40 ( zirconium ) , no element is at least twofold as abundant as lead , and there is no element as abundant as lead starting after element 56 ( barium ) . Lead is three times as abundant as platinum , ten times as mercury , and twenty times as gold . Per mass , lead 's abundance is 10 ppb — the difference between the per @-@ mass and per @-@ particle abundances is justified by mass difference between lead isotopes and the most common elements : the most common nuclide in the Universe , hydrogen @-@ 1 , has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit , while those of lead isotopes have masses of over 200 atomic mass units .

 Since lead commonly reacts with sulfur ( see above ) , it is classified as a chalcophile using the Goldschmidt classification . Lead is likely to form minerals that do not sink into the core but that stay above on Earth in its crust , even though without sinking deep into it . Lead 's abundance in the Earth 's crust is 16 ppm . This results in a great availability of lead minerals and easy extraction of the metal ; for this reason , the mineral form of its sulfide , galena , has been known for millennia , as was the metal itself ( see below ) . Lead 's pronounced <unk> character is close to those of zinc and copper ; as such , it is usually found in ore and extracted together with these metals . Metallic lead does occur in nature , but it is rare . As a result of lead 's chemistry , it occurs in primary minerals exclusively as lead ( II ) , unlike tin , which always occurs as tin ( IV ) . Lead deposits can be hydrothermal vein , impregnation , and replacement deposits ; <unk> sedimentary deposits ; and hydrothermal or marine sedimentary deposits . World resources of lead exceed 2 billion tons . Massive resources are located in Australia , China , Ireland , Mexico , Peru , Portugal , Russia , and the United States . World reserves — resources ready to be mined for which that would be economically feasible — totaled 89 million tons in 2015 , of which Australia had 35 million , China had 15 @.@ 8 million , and Russia had 9 @.@ 2 million . 
 The main lead mineral is galena ( <unk> ) . Galena is mostly found with other minerals , mostly zinc ores . Most other lead minerals are normally related to galena in some way ; for example , <unk> , Pb 
 <unk> 
 4S 
 11 , is a mixed sulfide derived from galena ; <unk> , <unk> 
 4 , is a product of galena oxidation ; <unk> or white lead ore , <unk> 
 3 , is a decomposition product of galena . Zinc , copper , arsenic , tin , <unk> , silver , gold , and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals . 
 Typical background concentrations of lead do not exceed 0 @.@ 1 μg / m3 in the atmosphere ; 100 mg / kg in soil ; 5 μg / L in freshwater and seawater . 
 = = History = = 
 Lead has been commonly used for thousands of years because it is widespread , easy to extract , and easy to work with . It is highly malleable and easily <unk> . Metallic lead beads dating back to 7000 – 6500 BCE , if not before that , have been found in Asia Minor ; this indicates lead was the first metal to be ever smelted . Since then , the metal has been used by many ancient peoples . A major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver , which may be obtained by burning galena , a widespread lead mineral . The Ancient Egyptians are thought to have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets , in glazes , glasses and enamels , and for ornaments ; they also were the first to use lead for cosmetics , a use that would continue through millennia to Ancient Greece and far beyond . Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material , as currency , and for construction . The Ancient Chinese used lead as a stimulant in the royal court , a currency , and a contraceptive ; lead also had a few uses , such as making amulets , for the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans . Peoples of eastern and southern Africa are known to exercise wire drawing . 
 Lead mines were worked in 2000 BCE in the Iberian peninsula by the Phoenicians ; and also in Athens , Carthage , and Sicily . Lead was mined in Ancient China before 1000 BCE . With the development of mining and its territorial expansion in Europe and across the Mediterranean , Rome became the greatest producer of lead during the classical era , with an estimated annual output equaling 80 @,@ 000 tonnes . The Romans obtained lead mostly as a by @-@ product of extensive silver smelting . Lead mining occurred in Central Europe , Britain , the Balkans , Greece , Anatolia , and Hispania , which alone accounted for 40 % of world production . Lead was used for making water pipes in the Roman empire and consequently the Latin word for the metal , plumbum , was the origin of the English word " plumbing " and its derivatives — even though some Romans , such as Vitruvius , were able to recognize its danger for health . Nevertheless , a number of researchers suggest lead poisoning was one of the reasons behind the fall of Rome . Lead poisoning — a condition in which one becomes dark and cynical — was called " saturnine " , after the ghoulish god of Saturn ; the metal was also considered the father of all metals . It was easily available in the Roman society , and as such , its social status was low . 
 During the ancient and classical eras , ( and even far beyond them , until the 17th century ) , tin was often not distinguished from lead or seen as a different kind of the metal that lead is : Romans called lead plumbum nigrum ( literally , " black lead " ) , while tin was called plumbum candidum ( literally , " bright lead " ) . Their association through history can also be seen in other languages : the word <unk> in Czech translates to " lead " , but in Russian the cognate <unk> ( <unk> ) means " tin " . In addition to that , lead also bore a close relation to antimony : Both elements commonly occur as sulfides ( galena and stibnite ) , often together . Pliny declared stibnite would give lead on heating , whereas the mineral on heating actually produces antimony . The originally South Asian <unk> — " galena " in English — spread across Asia with that meaning , and also gave its name to antimony in a number of Central Asian languages , as well as Russian . 
 Lead plumbing in Western Europe may have been continued beyond the fall of the Western Roman Empire into the medieval era , but lead mining in Europe in general fell into decline , and the largest lead production was conducted in South and East Asia , where lead output underwent a strong growth . In European alchemy , lead continued its status of the oldest metal and its association with Saturn — this time , the planet named after the Roman god rather than the god himself . Alchemists accordingly used Saturn 's symbol ( the scythe , <unk> ) to refer to lead . During the period , lead has become increasingly more used as for wine adulteration . This practice was declared forbidden in 1498 by a papal bull , but it continued long past the date , being a reason of various mass poisonings up to late 18th century . In the wake of the Renaissance , the printing press was invented , and lead served as a key material for its parts , starting with the Johannes Gutenberg 's press ; however , lead dust also was commonly inhaled by operators , causing lead poisoning . Additionally , firearms were invented approximately at the same time , and lead , despite its expense over iron , became a chief material for making bullets , because it made less damage to iron gun barrels , had a higher density ( which allowed better retaining velocity and energy ) , and its lower melting point made production much easier : bullets could be made on wooden fire . Lead was extensively used in cosmetics at the time in Western Europe by the aristocracy , as whitened faces were seen as a sign of modesty . The practice eventually expanded to white wigs and <unk> , and it only faded out with the French Revolution in the late 18th century ; one effect of such prolonged contacts with lead was teeth rotting and teeth replacements often were also made of lead ( which temporarily gave sweet breath ) , inducing further damage to the organism . ( A similar fashion appeared in Japan in the 18th century with the emergence of the geishas , with the practice continuing long into the 20th century and the white face becoming a " symbol of a Japanese woman " ; lead was commonly used as a face <unk> . ) 
 In the New World , lead was first produced soon after the European settlers had arrived ; the earliest recorded lead production dates to 1621 , in the Colony of Virginia that had been founded fourteen years earlier . In Australia , mining was introduced by the colonists as well , and they opened the first mine on the continent — a lead mine — in 1841 . However , centuries before the Europeans were able to start the colonization of Africa in the late 19th century , lead mining was known in the Benue Trough and the lower Congo basin , where lead was used for trade with the Europeans and as a currency . 
 In the second half of the 18th century , Britain and later continental Europe and then the United States entered the Industrial Revolution . During the period , lead mining proved important ; the Industrial Revolution was the first time to have greater lead production rates than those of Rome . Britain was the leading producer during the period , losing the status of the greatest producer by the mid @-@ 19th century with depletion of its mines and development of lead mining in Germany , Spain , and the United States . The United States took the lead by 1900 ; other non @-@ European nations — in particular , Canada , Mexico , and Australia — started their massive lead production , and by 1900 , Europe 's output of lead fell below that elsewhere . A great share of demand of lead came from plumbing and painting — lead paints had been invented and regularly used ; with invention of gasoline in late 19th century , lead was extensively used as an additive . At this time , more people — the working class — contacted the metal , and this led to the increase of the numbers of those poisoned by lead . This also led to research of effects of lead intake : lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal ; lead poisoning and gout were linked ( Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients was plumbers and painters ) ; effects of chronic ingestion of lead , including mental disorders , were all studied in the 19th century . The first political acts to decrease the degree of lead poisoning in factories followed in the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom . 
 Further evidence of the threat lead posed to human organisms were revealed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — mechanisms of the harm were better realized , and lead blindness was documented — and countries in Europe and the United States started efforts to reduce the amount of lead a regular person contacts with . The last major innovation to impose contact with lead on humans was adding tetraethyllead to gasoline , invented in the United States in 1921 ; it was phased out in the U.S. and the European Union by 2000 . Most European countries banned usage of lead paint for interiors by 1930 . The result of many regulations and bans put on lead products was significant : in the last quarter of the 20th century , percentage of people with excessive lead blood levels dropped from over three quarters of the population to slightly over two percent in the U.S. By the end of the 20th century , the main good made of lead was the lead – acid battery , which possesses no direct threat to humans . That allowed for a consistent lead production in the industrialized countries . From 1960 to 1990 , lead output in the Western Bloc grew by 31 % . The share of the world 's lead production of the Eastern Bloc increased from 10 % and 30 % from 1950 to 1990 , with the Soviet Union being world 's largest producer during the mid- and late 1970s and the 1980s , and China started a massive lead production in the late 20th century . Unlike the European communist countries , China was largely <unk> by mid @-@ 20th century ; in 2004 , China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead . However , in part similarly to the European industrialization , lead does have a negative effect on the global health in the country . 
 = = Production = = 
 Production and consumption of lead is increasing worldwide . Lead production generally is divided into two major categories , primary and secondary : the primary production is the production from concentrate from the previously mined ores , and the secondary production is the production from scrap . In 2013 , 4 @.@ 74 million metric tons came from the primary production , and 5 @.@ 74 million tons came from secondary production . The top mining countries for lead in 2013 were China , Australia , Russia , India , Bolivia , Sweden , North Korea , South Africa , Poland , and Ireland . The top lead producing countries were China , United States , India , South Korea , Germany , Mexico , United Kingdom , Canada , Japan , and Australia . According to the International Resource Panel 's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010 , the global per capita stock of lead in use in society is 8 kg . Much of this is in more developed countries ( 20 – 150 kg per capita ) rather than less developed countries ( 1 – 4 kg per capita ) .

 Most lead ores contain only a very low percentage of lead , which must be concentrated during processing . During initial ore processing , ores typically undergo crushing , dense @-@ medium separation , grinding , froth flotation , and drying of the resulting concentrate . The resulting concentrate is the initial quantitative metric of mined lead . <unk> ores are roasted , producing primarily lead oxide and a mixture of sulfates and silicates of lead and other metals contained in the ore . Lead oxide from the roasting process is reduced in a coke @-@ fired blast furnace to the metal . Sulfate concentrate is more common for subsequent lead production than oxide concentrate ; it commonly has a lead content fraction of 50 % – 60 % , occasionally varying to up to 30 % or 80 % . 
 Additional layers separate in the process and float to the top of the metallic lead . These are slag ( silicates containing 1 @.@ 5 % lead ) , matte ( sulfides containing 15 % lead ) , and <unk> ( arsenides of iron and copper ) . These wastes contain concentrations of copper , zinc , cadmium , and bismuth that can be recovered economically , as can their content of unreduced lead . 
 Metallic lead that results from the roasting and blast furnace processes still contains significant contaminants of arsenic , antimony , bismuth , zinc , copper , silver , and gold . The melt is treated in a reverberatory furnace with air , steam , and sulfur , which oxidizes the contaminants except silver , gold , and bismuth . The oxidized contaminants are removed by <unk> , where they float to the top and are skimmed off . Since lead ores contain significant concentrations of silver , the smelted metal also is commonly contaminated with silver . Metallic silver as well as gold is removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process , in which zinc is added to lead and adsorbs silver , which dissolves in zinc many times more actively than in lead . <unk> lead is freed of bismuth according to the Betterton @-@ Kroll process by treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium , which forms a bismuth dross that can be skimmed off . Very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically by means of the Betts process . The process uses anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead in an electrolyte of silica fluoride . Once electrical potential is applied , impure lead at the anode dissolves and then plates out in the cathode , while the impurities remain in the solution .

 Contrary to popular belief , pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead . The term comes from the Roman stylus , called the <unk> , a small brush used for painting . When the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool , the particular type of graphite being used was named plumbago ( lit. act for lead , or lead mockup ) .

 Lead metal has a number of mechanical properties that make using it advantageous in comparison with many alternatives : high density , low melting point , ductility , and relative inertness against oxygen attacks . While many metals are superior to lead in some of these aspects , lead is also more common than most of these metals ; moreover , lead minerals are easier to mine and then lead is easier to extract from its ores than many other metals , which makes the resulting metal relatively inexpensive . One disadvantage of using lead , however , is its chemical toxicity , and it has been a reason why lead was or is being phased out for some uses . 
 Lead has been used for bullets since their invention ( see above ) ; however , with the development of firearms , round bullets became pointed and later , lead was jacketed with , for example , copper . The low melting point makes casting of lead easy , and therefore small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment . It is also inexpensive and denser than other common metals . Lead is sometimes alloyed with tin or antimony : this increases the cost and time of making the bullet , but increasing the hardness of the bullet , this makes the bullet more effective against hard targets , eases the tension on the gun barrel and does not contaminate it with lead , as simple lead bullets do . However , concerns have been raised over whether lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment . 
 Because of its high density and resistance to corrosion , lead is used for the ballast keel of sailboats . Its high density allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails while at the same time occupying a small volume and thus offering the least underwater resistance . For the same reason , it is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver 's natural buoyancy and that of his equipment . 
 Lead is alloyed with copper and its alloys ( namely , brass and bronze ) to increase their machinability and to reduce machine tool wear . Lead does not form a solid solution with copper and is found as granules within copper . It acts as a lubricant in copper ; in low concentrations , it also acts as a chip breaker . 
 It is also used to form glazing bars for stained glass or other multi @-@ lit windows . The practice has become less common , not for danger but for stylistic reasons . Lead , or sheet @-@ lead , is used as a sound deadening layer in some areas in wall , floor and ceiling design in sound studios where levels of airborne and mechanically produced sound are targeted for reduction or virtual elimination . It is the traditional base metal of organ pipes , mixed with varying amounts of tin to control the tone of the pipe . 
 Lead has many uses in the construction industry ( e.g. , lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material , cladding , flashing , gutters and gutter joints , and on roof parapets ) . Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs used to fix lead sheet . Lead is still widely used in statues and sculptures . Lead is often used to balance the wheels of a car ; this use is being phased out in favor of other materials for environmental reasons . 
 Apart from its mechanical properties , lead is also useful in batteries , namely lead – acid batteries . The reactions in the battery between lead , lead dioxide , and sulfuric acid provides a reliable source of voltage . This , since lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans ( and thus no toxicity ) , is a use not threatened by toxicity concerns , and has been the largest use of lead in early <unk> <unk> . 
 Lead is also used as electrodes in the process of electrolysis . It is used in solder for electronics , although this usage is being phased out by some countries to reduce the amount of environmentally hazardous waste , and in high voltage power cables as sheathing material to prevent water diffusion into insulation . Lead is one of three metals used in the <unk> test for museum materials , helping detect organic acids , aldehydes , and acidic gases . It is also used as shielding from radiation ( e.g. , in X @-@ ray rooms ) . Molten lead is used as a coolant ( e.g. , for lead cooled fast reactors ) .

 Lead compounds are used as a coloring element in ceramic glazes , notably in the colors red and yellow . 
 Lead <unk> ( LTA ) and lead dioxide have been used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry . <unk> <unk> are cleaved to a pair of carbonyl compounds by stoichiometric LTA . LTA also is a selective oxidant of 5 @-@ methyl groups in 5 @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ carboxylic esters , leading to 5 @-@ <unk> groups or 5 @-@ formyl groups with one or two equivalents of oxidant , respectively , to provide important intermediates for porphyrin synthesis . 
 Lead is frequently used in polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) plastic , which coats electrical cords . 
 Lead is used in some candles to treat the wick to ensure a longer , more even burn . Because of the dangers , European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc . Lead glass is composed of 12 – 28 % lead oxide . It changes the optical characteristics of the glass and reduces the transmission of ionizing radiation . 
 Some artists using oil @-@ based paints continue to use lead carbonate white , citing its properties in comparison with the alternatives . <unk> lead is used as an anti @-@ knock additive for aviation fuel in piston @-@ driven aircraft . Lead @-@ based semiconductors , such as lead telluride , lead selenide and lead antimonide are finding applications in photovoltaic ( solar energy ) cells and infrared detectors .

 Lead is a highly poisonous metal ( whether inhaled or swallowed ) , affecting almost every organ and system in the body . The component limit of lead ( 1 @.@ 0 μg / g ) is a test benchmark for pharmaceuticals , representing the maximum daily intake an individual should have . Even at this level , a prolonged intake can be hazardous to human beings . Much of its toxicity comes from how Pb2 + ions are confused for Ca2 + ions , and lead as a result gets into bones . 
 In the human body , lead inhibits porphobilinogen synthase and <unk> , preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX , the final step in heme synthesis . This causes ineffective heme synthesis and subsequent <unk> anemia . At lower levels , it acts as a calcium analog , interfering with ion channels during nerve conduction . This is one of the mechanisms by which it interferes with cognition . Acute lead poisoning is treated using disodium calcium <unk> : the calcium chelate of the disodium salt of ethylene @-@ diamine @-@ <unk> acid ( EDTA ) . This chelating agent has a greater affinity for lead than for calcium and so the lead chelate is formed by exchange . This is then excreted in the urine leaving behind harmless calcium . According to the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry , a small amount of ingested lead ( 1 % ) will store itself in bones , and the rest will be excreted by an adult through urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure . However , only about 32 % of lead will be excreted by a child . 
 Exposure to lead and lead chemicals occurs primarily through ingestion , to a lesser extent through inhalation and occasionally by direct contact . 
 Ingestion of lead @-@ based paint is the major source of lead exposure for children . As lead paint deteriorates , it peels , is pulverized into dust and then enters the body through hand @-@ to @-@ mouth contact or through contaminated food , water or alcohol . Ingesting certain home remedy medicines may also expose people to lead or lead compounds . Lead can be ingested through fruits and vegetables contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in . Soil is contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes , lead paint and residual emissions from leaded gasoline that was used before the Environment Protection Agency issued the regulation in 1980 . The use of lead for water pipes is problematic in areas with soft or ( and ) acidic water . Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes while soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes . 
 Inhalation is the second major pathway of exposure , especially for workers in lead @-@ related occupations . Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body , the rate is 20 – 70 % for ingested lead ; children absorb more than adults . 
 Dermal exposure may be significant for a narrow category of people working with organic lead compounds , but is of little concern for general population , as most countries stopped using leaded gasoline by 2007 . The rate of skin absorption is also low for inorganic lead . 
 The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system , both in adults and children . Long @-@ term exposure of adults can result in decreased performance in some tests that measure functions of the nervous system . Long @-@ term exposure to lead or its salts ( especially soluble salts or the strong oxidant <unk> ) can cause nephropathy , and colic @-@ like abdominal pains . It may also cause weakness in fingers , wrists , or ankles . Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure , particularly in middle @-@ aged and older people and can cause anemia . Exposure to high lead levels can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death . In pregnant women , high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage . Chronic , high @-@ level exposure has been shown to reduce fertility in males . Lead also damages nervous connections ( especially in young children ) and causes blood and brain disorders . Lead poisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead , but may also occur after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil , dust , or lead @-@ based paint . It is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and is believed to have adverse effects on the central nervous system , the cardiovascular system , kidneys , and the immune system . The treatment for lead poisoning consists of dimercaprol and succimer . 
 The concern about lead 's role in cognitive deficits in children has brought about widespread reduction in its use ( lead exposure has been linked to learning disabilities ) . Most cases of adult elevated blood lead levels are workplace @-@ related . High blood levels are associated with delayed puberty in girls . Lead has been shown many times to permanently reduce the cognitive capacity of children at extremely low levels of exposure . 
 Despite the toxicity of lead in significant amounts , there is some evidence that trace amounts of lead are beneficial in pigs and rats , and that its absence causes deficiency signs including depressed growth , anemia , and disturbed iron metabolism . If true in humans as well , this would make lead by far the heaviest essential element , since its atomic number ( 82 ) is much greater than that of the second @-@ heaviest such element , iodine ( element 53 ) . Nevertheless , these findings are still uncertain , and even if lead does turn out to be beneficial in small quantities , the threshold of toxicity is so low that lead toxicity would remain a much higher priority to address than lead deficiency .

 The extraction , production , use and disposal of lead and its products have caused significant contamination of the Earth ’ s soils and waters , posing a hazard to living organisms because of its toxicity . Atmospheric emissions of lead were at their peak during the Industrial Revolution and the period of leaded petrol in the second half of the twentieth century ; although these periods are over , elevated concentrations of lead persist in soils and sediments in post @-@ industrial and urban areas . Meanwhile , industrial emissions continue in many parts of the world .

 Fish bones are being researched for their ability to <unk> lead in contaminated soil . The fungus Aspergillus versicolor is both greatly effective and fast at removing lead ions . Several bacteria have been researched for their ability to reduce lead ; including the sulfate reducing bacteria <unk> and <unk> ; which are highly effective in aqueous solutions . 
 In the Netherlands , the use of lead shot for hunting and sport shooting was banned in 1993 , which caused a large drop in lead emission , from 230 tonnes in 1990 to 47 @.@ 5 tonnes in 1995 , two years after the ban .

 During the 20th century , the use of lead in paint pigments was sharply reduced because of the danger of lead poisoning , especially to children . By the mid @-@ 1980s , a significant shift in lead end @-@ use patterns had taken place . Much of this shift was a result of the U.S. lead consumers ' compliance with environmental regulations that significantly reduced or eliminated the use of lead in non @-@ battery products , including gasoline , paints , solders , and water systems . Lead use is being further curtailed by the European Union 's RoHS directive . Lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware , vinyl ( such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords ) , and Chinese brass . Old houses may still contain substantial amounts of lead paint . White lead paint has been withdrawn from sale in industrialized countries , but the yellow lead chromate is still in use . Old paint should not be stripped by sanding , as this produces <unk> dust . 
 People can be exposed to lead in the workplace by breathing it in , swallowing it , skin contact , and eye contact . In the United States , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has set the legal limit ( permissible exposure limit ) for lead exposure in the workplace as 0 @.@ 050 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday , which applies to metallic lead , inorganic lead compounds , and lead soaps . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( REL ) of 0 @.@ 050 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday , and recommends that workers ' blood concentrations of lead stay below 0 @.@ 060 mg per 100 g blood . At levels of 100 mg / m3 , lead is immediately dangerous to life and health .

Shepard never entered the field , but was involved in recruiting volunteers . In 1862 he visited Jamestown to inspect , equip and provide uniforms for the Chautauqua regiment , his first return since age twelve , and was welcomed by a group of prominent citizens . Shepard recruited and organized the 51st Regiment , New York Volunteers , which was named the Shepard Rifles in his honor . George W. Whitman , brother of the poet Walt Whitman and a member of the regiment , was notified by Shepard of a promotion ; Shepard may have influenced his subsequent promotion to major in 1865 . In addition , Shepard was involved in correspondence with Walt Whitman . 
 Shepard was placed in charge of the recruiting station in Elmira , and enlisted 47 @,@ 000 men from the surrounding area . Although President Abraham Lincoln offered him a promotion to brigadier general , Shepard declined in deference to officers who had seen field service .

 In 1867 Shepard was presented to Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt at a reception given by Governor Morgan ; their difficult courtship was opposed by Margaret 's father , William Henry Vanderbilt . A year later , on February 18 , 1868 , they were married in the Church of the Incarnation in New York City . After an 1868 trip to Tarsus , Mersin he helped found Tarsus American College , agreeing to donate $ 5 @,@ 000 a year to the school and leave it an endowment of $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @.@ 63 million in 2015 ) . He became one of the school 's trustees and vice president of the board . 
 In 1868 , Shepard became a partner of Judge Theron R. Strong in Strong & Shepard , continuing the business after Strong 's death . He continued to practice law for the next 25 years ; he helped found the New York State Bar Association in 1876 , and in 1884 was its fifth president . In 1875 Shepard drafted an amendment establishing an arbitration court for the New York Chamber of Commerce , serving on its five @-@ member executive committee the following year . In 1880 , the New York City Board of Aldermen appointed Shepard and Ebenezer B. Shafer to revise and codify the city 's local ordinances to form the New @-@ York Municipal Code ; the last revision was in 1859 . 
 During the 1880s he helped found the American Savings Bank , the Bank of the Metropolis and the Columbian National Bank . On March 20 , 1888 , Shepard purchased the Mail and Express newspaper ( founded in 1836 , with an estimated value of $ 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 5 @.@ 27 million in 2015 ) from Cyrus W.

As president of the newspaper company until his death , he approved every important decision or policy . In the same year , Shepard became the controlling stockholder of the Fifth Avenue Stage Company to force it to halt work on Sundays ( the Christian Sabbath ) . 
 When Margaret 's father died in 1885 , she inherited $ 12 million ( $ 316 million in 2015 ) . The family lived at 2 West 52nd Street in Manhattan , one of three houses of the Vanderbilt Triple Palace which were built during the 1880s for William Henry Vanderbilt and his two daughters . After Elliott 's death Margaret transferred the house to her sister 's family , who combined their two houses into one . The houses were eventually demolished ; the nine @-@ story De Pinna Building was built there in 1928 and was demolished around 1969 . 650 Fifth Avenue is the building currently on the site . 
 Shepard and his family toured the world in 1884 , visiting Asia , Africa , and Europe . He documented his 1887 trip from New York to Alaska in The Riva . : New York and Alaska taken by himself , his wife and daughter , six other family members , their maid , a chef , butler , porter and conductor .

 During the early 1890s Shepard moved to Scarborough @-@ on @-@ Hudson in present @-@ day Briarcliff Manor , purchasing a Victorian house from J. Butler Wright . He had a mansion ( named Woodlea , after Wright 's house ) built south of the house , facing the Hudson River , and improved its grounds . Construction of the mansion began in 1892 , and was completed three years later . Shepard died in 1893 , leaving Margaret to oversee its completion . The finished house has between 65 @,@ 000 and 70 @,@ 000 square feet ( 6 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 500 m2 ) , making it one of the largest privately @-@ owned houses in the United States . 
 After Shepard 's death Margaret lived there in the spring and fall , with her visits becoming less frequent . By 1900 she began selling property to Frank A. Vanderlip and William Rockefeller , selling them the house in 1910 . Vanderlip and Rockefeller assembled a board of directors to create a country club ; they first met at Vanderlip 's National City Bank Building office at 55 Wall Street ( Vanderlip was president of the bank at the time ) . Sleepy Hollow Country Club was founded , with Woodlea becoming its clubhouse and the J. Butler Wright house as its golf house . 
 Shepard established a small chapel on his Briarcliff Manor property , and founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church in 1892 . The church and its manse were donated by Margaret after his death . It was designed by Augustus Haydel ( a nephew of Stanford White ) and August D. Shepard , Jr . ( a nephew of Elliott Shepard and William Rutherford Mead ) . The church , dedicated on May 11 , 1895 in Shepard 's memory , was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church .

 Shepard and Margaret had five daughters and one son : Florence ( 1869 – 1869 ) , Maria Louise ( 1870 – 1948 ) , Edith ( 1872 – 1954 ) , Marguerite ( 1873 – 1895 ) , Alice ( 1874 – 1950 ) and Elliott Jr . ( 1877 – 1927 ) . The children attended Sunday school and church , and were educated by private tutors and governesses . Shepard also employed a private chef for his family . Shepard was a strict father known to beat his son , who was described as being as wild as his father was rigid and moralizing . 
 Shepard was tall , with a pleasant expression and manner , and The New York Times called him the " perfect type of well @-@ bred clubman " . He had thick hair , manicured nails , a well @-@ trimmed beard and an athletic figure . An opponent of antisemitism , he attended dinners publicizing the plight of Russian Jews and regularly addressed Jewish religious and social organizations avoided by others . He rented pews in many New York churches , supported about a dozen missionaries and was described as a generous donor to hospitals and charitable societies . Shepard was politically ambitious , and decided to build Woodlea as a symbol of power and influence . Shepard had horses and carriages which were ridden by the family in parks , and he prided himself on his equestrianism . 
 Shepard was a supporter of the Republican Party , contributing $ 75 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 @.@ 98 million in 2015 ) to the 1888 Presidential campaign fund and $ 10 @,@ 000 ( $ 263 @,@ 400 in 2015 ) to the state committee for the Fassett campaign .

 In 1892 , the City University of New York gave Shepard a Master of Laws degree and the University of Omaha gave him a Doctor of Laws degree . On January 11 , 1893 , Shepard addressed the House Committee on the Columbian Exposition in an effort to convince the committee not to open the exposition on a Sunday - the Sabbath . Shepard himself attended , having spent $ 25 @,@ 000 ( $ 658 thousand in 2015 ) on September 7 , 1891 in reserving sixteen rooms with board at the Auditorium Hotel for six months during the fair . 
 Shepard died unexpectedly during the afternoon of March 24 , 1893 at his Manhattan residence . Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him ; they gave him ether at 12 : 45 p.m. For a few minutes Shepard did not seem to react , though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed , so administration of ether was stopped , however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation . His condition started to worsen again ; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes . The doctors then administered oxygen , which helped temporarily ; however , at 4 : 00 p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble , he fell unconscious , and died at 4 : 10 p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs , after the administration of ether , but due to an unknown cause . Shepard was first buried in the Vanderbilt mausoleum in Moravian Cemetery . On November 17 , 1894 one of his daughters , his wife , and her brother George Vanderbilt oversaw the transfer of his remains and those of his daughter Florence to a new Shepard family tomb . 
 Shepard 's estate included the $ 100 @,@ 000 Tarsus American College endowment , $ 850 @,@ 000 in real estate and $ 500 @,@ 000 in personal property for a total of $ 1 @.@ 35 million ( $ 35 @.@ 6 million in 2015 ) . His will distributed money and property to his wife and children , his brother Augustus , and religious organizations . Shepard funded a number of scholarships and prizes , including one at the City University of New York and New York University 's annual Elliott F. Shepard Scholarship , and donated a large collection of books from lawyer Aaron J. <unk> 's library to the New York University School of Law . 
 When the wife of Chicago publisher Horace O 'Donoghue read him the news of Shepard 's death four days after the event , he picked up a razor and slit his throat . Although his suicide was first thought to be impulsive , it was later learned that the likely cause was O 'Donoghue 's large debts to Chicago publishing houses .

 = Ezra Pound = 
 Ezra Weston Loomis Pound ( 30 October 1885 – 1 November 1972 ) was an expatriate American poet and critic , and a major figure in the early modernist movement . His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism , a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry , stressing clarity , precision and economy of language . His best @-@ known works include Ripostes ( 1912 ) , Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ( 1920 ) and the unfinished 120 @-@ section epic , The Cantos ( 1917 – 69 ) . 
 Working in London in the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines , Pound helped discover and shape the work of American and Irish contemporaries such as T. S. Eliot , James Joyce , Robert Frost , and Ernest Hemingway . He arranged for the 1915 publication of Eliot 's " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " and the serialization from 1918 of Joyce 's Ulysses . Hemingway wrote of him in 1925 : " He defends [ his friends ] when they are attacked , he gets them into magazines and out of jail . ... He introduces them to wealthy women . He gets publishers to take their books . He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying ... he advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide . " 
 Outraged by the carnage of World War I , Pound lost faith in England and blamed the war on usury and international capitalism . He moved to Italy in 1924 . Through the 1930s and 1940s he embraced Benito Mussolini 's Italian Fascism , expressed support for Adolf Hitler , and wrote for publications owned by British fascist Oswald Mosley . During World War II , he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Jews . As a result , he was arrested by American forces in Italy in 1945 on charges of treason , and was kept for months in detention in a U.S. military camp in Pisa . He was held for three weeks in a six @-@ by @-@ six @-@ foot outdoor steel cage , which he said triggered a mental breakdown , " when the raft broke and the waters went over me . " Deemed unfit to stand trial , Pound was incarcerated in St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington , D.C. , for over 12 years . 
 While in custody in Italy , Pound had begun work on sections of The Cantos . These were published as The Pisan Cantos ( 1948 ) , for which he was awarded the Bollingen Prize in 1949 by the Library of Congress , triggering enormous controversy . 
 Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers , he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 , and returned to live in Italy until his death . His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime ; in 1933 Time magazine called him " a cat that walks by himself , tenaciously <unk> and very unsafe for children . " Hemingway wrote : " The best of Pound 's writing – and it is in the Cantos – will last as long as there is any literature . "

 Pound was born in a small , two @-@ story house in Hailey , Idaho Territory , the only child of Homer Loomis Pound ( 1858 – 1942 ) and Isabel Weston ( 1860 – 1948 ) . His father had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the General Land Office . 
 Both parents ' ancestors had emigrated from England to North America in the 17th century . On his mother 's side , Pound was descended from William Wadsworth ( 1594 – 1675 ) , a Puritan who emigrated from England to Boston on the Lion in 1632 . The <unk> married into the Westons of New York . Harding Weston and Mary Parker were the parents of Isabel Weston , Ezra 's mother . Harding apparently spent most of his life without work , so his brother , Ezra Weston and his wife , Frances , looked after Mary and Isabel 's needs . 
 On his father 's side , the immigrant ancestor was John Pound , a Quaker who arrived from England around 1650 . Ezra 's grandfather , Thaddeus Coleman Pound ( 1832 – 1914 ) , was a Republican Congressman from northwest Wisconsin who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business . Thaddeus 's son Homer , Pound 's father , worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business , until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office . 
 Homer and Isabel married the following year , and Homer built for her a home in Hailey . Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887 when he was 18 months old . Homer followed and in 1889 found a job as an assayer at the Philadelphia Mint . The family moved to Jenkintown , Pennsylvania and in 1893 bought a six @-@ bedroom house in Wyncote . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Pound 's education began in a series of dame schools , some of them run by Quakers : Miss Elliott 's school in Jenkintown in 1892 , the <unk> family 's <unk> Hills School in Wyncote in 1893 , and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894 , also in Wyncote . His first published poem ( " by E. L. Pound , Wyncote , aged 11 years " ) was a limerick in the Jenkintown Times @-@ Chronicle about William Jennings Bryan , who had just lost the 1896 presidential election : " There was a young man from the West , / He did what he could for what he thought best ; / But election came round , / He found himself drowned , / And the papers will tell you the rest . " 
 Between 1897 and 1900 Pound attended Cheltenham Military Academy , sometimes as a boarder , where he specialized in Latin . The boys wore Civil War @-@ style uniforms and studied English , history , and arithmetic , as well as marksmanship , military drilling , and the importance of submitting to authority . Pound made his first trip overseas in the summer of 1898 when he was 13 , a three @-@ month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston ( Aunt Frank ) ; they went to England , Belgium , Germany , Switzerland and Italy . After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year . In 1901 at the age of 15 , he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania 's College of Liberal Arts . 
 Pound wrote in 1913 , in " How I Began " : 
 I resolved that at thirty I would know more about poetry than any man living ... that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere , what part of poetry was ' indestructible ' , what part could not be lost by translation and – scarcely less important – what effects were obtainable in one language only and were utterly incapable of being translated . 
 In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages , I read Oriental stuff in translations , I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this , or who bothered me with " requirements for degrees " . 
 While at the university he met Hilda Doolittle , the daughter of the professor of astronomy . She developed as the poet known as H.D. She followed him to Europe in 1908 , leaving her family , friends and country , and worked with Pound in developing the Imagism movement in London . He sought her hand and in February that year asked her father , the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle , for his permission to marry . Doolittle was a curt man , described as " donnish " and intimidating . He was aware of Pound 's reputation as a ladies ' man , and unimpressed by his career as a poet , and constant moving . Doolittle 's response was dismissive , he replied , " What ! … Why you 're nothing but a nomad ! " Pound asked Hilda to marry him in the summer of 1907 , and though rejected , wrote several poems for her between 1905 and 1907 . He hand @-@ bound 25 of these , calling them Hilda 's Book . He was seeing two other women at the same time – Viola Baxter and Mary Moore – later dedicating a book of poetry , Personae ( 1909 ) , to the latter . He asked Mary to marry him that summer too , but she turned him down . 
 His parents and Frances Weston took Pound on another three @-@ month European tour in 1902 , after which he transferred , in 1903 , to Hamilton College in Clinton , New York , possibly because of poor grades . Signed up for the Latin – Scientific course , he studied the Provençal dialect with William Pierce Shephard and Old English with Joseph D. Ibbotson ; with Shephard he read Dante . From this study he began thinking of an idea for a long poem in three parts – of emotion , instruction and contemplation – planting the seeds for The Cantos . He graduated in 1905 with a <unk> . 
 Pound returned to the University of Pennsylvania for graduate work , studying Romance languages under Hugo A. <unk> , and obtained an MA in the spring of 1906 . He registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega 's plays . A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees and gave him a grant of $ 500 , which he used to return to Europe . 
 Pound spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries , including one in the royal palace . He happened to be standing outside the palace on 31 May 1906 during the attempted assassination by anarchists of King Alfonso , and left the country for fear he would be identified with them . After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris attending lectures at the Sorbonne , followed by a week in London . In July he returned to the United States . In September 1906 his first essay , " Raphaelite Latin " , was published in Book News Monthly . 
 He took courses in the English department at Penn in 1907 , where he annoyed Felix Schelling , the department head , with silly remarks during lectures . One day he said that George Bernard Shaw was better than Shakespeare , and wound an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke . As a result , his fellowship was not renewed at the end of the year . Schelling told Pound that he was wasting his own time and that of the institution . Pound left without finishing his doctorate .

 From the fall of 1907 Pound taught Romance languages at Wabash College in Crawfordsville , Indiana , a conservative town that he called the sixth circle of hell . The equally conservative college dismissed him after he deliberately provoked the college authorities . Smoking was forbidden , but he would smoke <unk> in his office down the corridor from the president 's . He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends , including women , and was forced out of one house after two " <unk> found me sharing my meagre repast with the lady – gent impersonator in my <unk> apartments , " as he told a friend . He was eventually caught in flagrante , although the details remain unclear and he denied any wrongdoing . The incident involved a stranded chorus girl to whom he offered tea and his bed for the night when she was caught in a snowstorm ; when she was discovered the next morning by the landladies , his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief and he was asked to leave the college . Glad to be free of the place , he left for Europe soon after , sailing from New York in March 1908 .

 Pound arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March 1908 , where for a few weeks he earned $ 15 a day working as a guide to American tourists . By the end of April he was in Venice , living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge . In July he self @-@ published his first book of poetry , A Lume Spento ( With <unk> Spent ) . The London Evening Standard called it " wild and haunting stuff , absolutely poetic , original , imaginative , passionate , and spiritual . " The title was from the third canto of Dante 's Purgatorio , which alluded to the death of Manfred , King of Sicily . The book was dedicated to his friend , the Philadelphia artist William Brooke Smith , who had recently died of tuberculosis . 
 In August he moved to London , where he lived almost continuously for the next 12 years ; he told his university friend William Carlos Williams : " London , <unk> old <unk> , is the place for poesy . " English poets such as Maurice Hewlett , Rudyard Kipling and Alfred Lord Tennyson had made a particular kind of Victorian verse – stirring , pompous and propagandistic – popular with the public . According to modernist scholar James Knapp , Pound rejected the idea of poetry as " versified moral essay " ; he wanted to focus on the individual experience ; the concrete rather than the abstract . 
 Arriving in the city with just ₤ 3 , he moved into lodgings at 48 Langham Street , near Great Titchfield Street , a penny bus @-@ ride from the British Museum . The house sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub , which he referred to indirectly in the Pisan Cantos , " concerning the landlady 's doings / with a lodger unnamed / az <unk> near Gt Titchfield St. next door to the pub " . He spent his mornings in the British Museum Reading Room , and lunched at the Vienna Café on Oxford Street . He persuaded the bookseller Elkin Mathews to display A Lume Spento , and in October 1908 caught the attention of the literati . That December he published a second collection , A <unk> for This Yule . After the death of a lecturer at the Regent Street Polytechnic , he took a position lecturing in the evenings on " The Development of Literature in Southern Europe " . 
 Ford Madox Ford described Pound – somewhat tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek – as " approach [ ing ] with the step of a dancer , making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent . Pound was a flamboyant dresser at this stage , and had trousers made of green billiard cloth , a pink coat , a blue shirt , a tie hand @-@ painted by a Japanese friend and an immense sombrero . All this was accompanied by a flaming beard cut to a point and a single , large blue earring . " 
 = = = Meeting Dorothy Shakespear , Personae = = = 
 At a literary salon in January 1909 , Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear – Yeats ' former lover – and was introduced to her daughter Dorothy . They married several years later in 1914 . Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to W. B. Yeats – the greatest living poet in Pound 's view – and they became close friends , although Yeats was older by 20 years . Pound had sent Yeats a copy of A Lume Spento the previous year , before he left for Venice . Yeats had apparently found it charming . 
 Pound was also introduced to sculptor Henri Gaudier @-@ Brzeska , painter Wyndham Lewis , and to the cream of London 's literary circle , including the poet T. E. Hulme . The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens ( 1881 – 1912 ) became a patron ; after knowing him a short time she offered a large annual sum to allow him to focus on his work . Cravens committed suicide in 1912 . Walter Rummel , a pianist and friend of Pounds , had long been a love but married someone else . She may also have been discouraged by Pound 's engagement to Dorothy . 
 In June 1909 the Personae collection was the first of Pound 's works to have any commercial success . It was favorably reviewed ; one review said it was " full of human passion and natural magic " . Rupert Brooke was unimpressed , complaining that Pound had fallen under the influence of Walt Whitman , writing in " <unk> sprawling lengths " . In September he published 27 poems as <unk> . Around the same time Pound moved into new rooms at Church Walk , off Kensington High Street , where he lived most of the time until 1914 . 
 In June 1910 Pound returned to the United States for eight months ; his arrival coincided with the publication of his first book of literary criticism , The Spirit of Romance , based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic . His essays on America were written during this period . They were compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950 . He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity , and he no longer felt at home there . He found the New York Public Library , then being built , especially offensive . According to Paul L. Montgomery , Pound visited the architects ' offices almost every day to shout at them . 
 Pound persuaded his parents to finance his passage back to Europe . It was nearly 30 years before he visited the United States again . On 22 February 1911 he sailed from New York on the <unk> Mauretania , arriving in Southampton six days later . After only a few days in London he went to Paris , where he worked on a new collection of poetry , Canzoni ( 1911 ) , panned by the Westminster Gazette as a " medley of pretension " . When he returned to London in August 1911 , A. R. Orage , editor of the socialist journal The New Age , hired him to write a weekly column , giving him a steady income .

 Hilda Doolittle arrived in London from Philadelphia in May 1911 with the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg 's mother ; when they returned in September , Doolittle decided to stay on . Pound introduced her to his friends , including the poet Richard Aldington , whom she would marry in 1913 . Before that the three of them lived in Church Walk , Kensington – Pound at no . 10 , Doolittle at no . 6 , and Aldington at no . 8 – and worked daily in the British Museum Reading Room . 
 At the museum Pound met regularly with the curator and poet Laurence Binyon , who introduced him to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts that inspired the imagery and technique of his later poetry . The museum 's visitors ' books show that Pound was often found during 1912 and 1913 in the Print Room examining Japanese ukiyo @-@ e , some inscribed with Japanese waka verse , a genre of poetry whose economy and strict conventions likely contributed to Imagist techniques of composition . He was working at the time on the poems that became Ripostes ( 1912 ) , trying to move away from his earlier work ; he wrote that the " stilted language " of Canzoni had reduced Ford Madox Ford to rolling on the floor with laughter . He realized with his translation work that the problem lay not in his knowledge of the other languages , but in his use of English : 
 What obfuscated me was not the Italian but the crust of dead English , the sediment present in my own available vocabulary ... You can 't go round this sort of thing . It takes six or eight years to get educated in one 's art , and another ten to get rid of that education . 
 Neither can anyone learn English , one can only learn a series of Englishes . Rossetti made his own language . I hadn 't in 1910 made a language , I don 't mean a language to use , but even a language to think in . 
 While living at Church Walk in 1912 , Pound , Aldington and Doolittle started working on ideas about language . While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon , they decided to begin a ' movement ' in poetry , called Imagism . Imagisme , Pound would write in <unk> , is " concerned solely with language and presentation " . The aim was clarity : a fight against abstraction , romanticism , rhetoric , inversion of word order , and over @-@ use of adjectives . They agreed in the spring or early summer of 1912 on three principles : 
 1 . Direct treatment of the " thing " whether subjective or objective . 
 2 . To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation . 
 3 . As regarding rhythm : to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of a metronome . 
 <unk> words , particularly adjectives , should be avoided , as well as expressions like " dim lands of peace " , which Pound thought dulled the image by mixing the abstract with the concrete . He wrote that the natural object was always the " adequate symbol " . Poets should " go in fear of abstractions " , and should not re @-@ tell in mediocre verse what has already been told in good prose . 
 A typical example is Pound 's " In a Station of the Metro " ( 1913 ) , inspired by an experience on the Paris Underground , about which he wrote , " I got out of a train at , I think , La Concorde , and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face , and then , turning suddenly , another and another , and then a beautiful child 's face , and then another beautiful face . All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel . " He worked on the poem for a year , reducing it to its essence in the style of a Japanese haiku . Like other modernist artists of the period , Pound was inspired by Japanese art , but the aim was to re @-@ make – or as Pound said , " make it new " – and blend cultural styles instead of copying directly or slavishly . He may have been inspired by a Suzuki Harunobu print he almost certainly saw in the British Library ( Richard Aldington mentions the specific prints he matched to verse ) , and probably attempted to write haiku @-@ like verse during this period . 
 = = = Ripostes and translations = = = 
 Ripostes , published in October 1912 , begins Pound 's shift toward minimalist language . Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration of meaning and economy of rhythm than his earlier work . It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism ; his first use of the word Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume . The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th @-@ century Old English poem The Seafarer – although not a literal translation . It upset scholars , as would Pound 's other translations from Latin , Italian , French and Chinese , either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context . Alexander writes that in some circles , Pound 's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge , and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919 . His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and <unk> of Guido Cavalcanti was also published in 1912 . 
 Pound was fascinated by the translations of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered in the papers of Ernest Fenollosa , an American professor who had taught in Japan . Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars ; in 1913 his widow , Mary McNeil Fenollosa , decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work ; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology . Pound edited and published <unk> 's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918 . 
 The title page of the collection Cathay ( 1915 ) , refers to the poet " <unk> " , the pronunciation in Japanese of the Tang dynasty Chinese poet , Li Bai , whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity . Alexander thinks this is the most attractive of Pound 's work . Chinese critic Wai @-@ lim Yip writes of it : " One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies , but it seems clear that in his dealings with Cathay , even when he is given only the barest details , he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance . " 
 Pound could understand Chinese himself . Some specialist critics see his work as among the best English translations of Chinese poetry , but others have complained that it contains many mistakes . Cathay was the first of many translations Pound would make from the Chinese . Pound used Fenollosa 's work as a starting point for what he called the <unk> method , which proceeded on <unk> 's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph , based on sight rather than sound . Robert Graves recalled " I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew ; Waley shook his head despondently . " Steven Yao , scholar of American and Asian literature , sees Cathay as a " major feat " ; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language . Yao does not view Pound 's lack of Chinese as an obstacle , and states that the poet 's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem .

 In August 1912 Harriet Monroe hired Pound as a regular contributor to Poetry . He submitted his own poems , as well as poems by James Joyce , Robert Frost , D. H. Lawrence , Yeats , H.D. and Aldington , and collected material for a 64 @-@ page anthology , Des <unk> ( 1914 ) . The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics . In November 1913 Yeats , whose eyesight was failing , invited Pound to stay with him as his secretary in Stone Cottage , Sussex , where Yeats had rented rooms . They stayed there for 10 weeks , reading and writing , walking in the woods and fencing . It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage ; two included Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914 . 
 The marriage had proceeded despite opposition from her parents , who worried about his meager income earned from contributions to literary magazines ; it probably was less than £ 300 a year . Dorothy 's annual income was £ 50 , aided by £ 150 from her family . Her parents eventually consented , perhaps out of fear that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight . Pound 's concession to marry in church helped convince them . Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers , near Church Walk , with the newly wed Hilda ( H.D. ) and Richard Aldington living next door . 
 Pound wrote for Wyndham Lewis ' literary magazine Blast , although only two issues were published . An advertisement in The Egoist promised it would cover " Cubism , Futurism , Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art " . Pound took the opportunity to extend the definition of Imagisme to art , naming it Vorticism : " The image is a radiant node or cluster ; it is ... a <unk> , from which , and through which , and into which , ideas are constantly rushing . " Reacting to the magazine , the poet Lascelles Abercrombie called for the rejection of Imagism and a return to the traditionalism of William Wordsworth ; Pound challenged him to a duel on the basis that " Stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace " . Abercrombie suggested their choice of weapon be unsold copies of their own books . The publication of Blast was celebrated at a dinner attended by New England poet Amy Lowell , then in London to meet the Imagists . But Hilda and Richard were already beginning to go in a different direction than Pound 's understanding of the movement , as he aligned more with Wyndham Lewis 's ideas . When Lowell agreed to finance an anthology of Imagist poets , Pound 's work was not included . Upset at Lowell , he began to call Imagisme " <unk> " , and in July 1914 declared it dead , asking only that the term be preserved , although Lowell eventually Anglicized it . 
 = = = World War I , disillusionment = = = 
 Between 1914 and 1916 Pound assisted in the serialisation of James Joyce 's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist , then helped to have it published in book form . In 1915 he persuaded Poetry to publish T. S. Eliot 's " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " . Eliot had sent " Prufrock " to almost every editor in England , but was rejected . He eventually sent it to Pound , who instantly saw it as a work of genius and submitted it to Poetry . " [ Eliot ] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN " , Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914 . " The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both . Most of the swine have done neither . " 
 After the publication in 1915 of Cathay , Pound mentioned he was working on a long poem , casting about for the correct form . He told a friend in August : " It is a huge , I was going to say , gamble , but shan 't , " and in September described it as a " <unk> poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore . " About a year later , in January 1917 , he had the first three trial cantos , distilled to one , as Canto I published in Poetry . He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines . From 1917 he wrote music reviews for The New Age under the pen name William Atheling , and weekly pieces for The Egoist and The Little Review – many of the latter directed against provincialism and ignorance . However the volume of writing exhausted him and he feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry , exclaiming that he " MUST stop writing so much prose " . 
 Pound was deeply affected by the war . He was devastated when Gaudier @-@ Brzeska , from whom he had commissioned a sculpture two years earlier , was killed in the trenches in 1915 . He published Gaudier @-@ Brzeska : A Memoir the following year , in reaction to what he saw as an unnecessary loss . In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened . He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of The Little Review . The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice applied the Comstock Laws against an article Lewis wrote , describing it as lewd and indecent . Around the same time , Hulme was killed by shell @-@ fire in Flanders , and Yeats married Georgie Hyde @-@ Lees . In 1918 , after a bout of illness which was presumably the Spanish influenza , Pound decided to quit writing for The Little Review , mostly because of the volume of work . He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23 @-@ year @-@ old Iseult Gonne as a typist – causing rumors Pound was having an affair with her – but was turned down . 
 In 1919 he published a collection of his essays for The Little Review as <unk> , and in the March 1919 issue Poetry , he published Poems from the Propertius Series , which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet Sextus Propertius . When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921 , he had renamed it Homage to Sextus Propertius in response to criticism of his translation skills . " Propertius " is not a strict translation ; biographer David Moody describes it as " the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence " . Harriet Monroe , editor of Poetry , published a letter from a professor of Latin , W. G. Hale , saying that Pound was " incredibly ignorant " of the language , and alluded to " about three @-@ score errors " in Homage . Monroe did not publish Pound 's response , which began " Cat @-@ piss and porcupines ! ! " and continued , " The thing is no more a translation than my ' <unk> ' is a translation , or than Fitzgerald 's Omar is a translation " . But she interpreted his silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor . 
 = = = Hugh Selwyn Mauberley = = = 
 His poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley consists of 18 short parts , and describes a poet whose life , like his own , has become sterile and meaningless . Published in June 1920 , it marked his farewell to London . He had become disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile to it . Stephen Adams writes that , just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock , so Pound denied he was Mauberley , but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical . It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene , before turning to social criticism , economics , and an attack on the causes of the war ; here the word usury appears in his work for the first time . The critic F. R. Leavis saw this poem to be Pound 's major achievement . 
 The war had shattered Pound 's belief in modern western civilization . He saw the <unk> movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet . He had only the New Age to write for ; his relationship with Poetry was finished , The Egoist was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce 's Ulysses , and the funds for The Little Review had dried up . Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work . Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over , and resolved to move to Paris . 
 Orage wrote in the January 1921 issue of The New Age : " Mr. Pound has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England ; he has left his mark upon more than one of the arts , upon literature , music , poetry and sculpture , and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self @-@ sacrificing stimulus . " 
 = = Paris ( 1921 – 24 ) = = 
 The Pounds settled in Paris in January 1921 in an inexpensive apartment at 70 bis , rue Notre Dame des Champs . He became friendly with Marcel Duchamp , Tristan Tzara , Fernand Léger and others of the Dada and Surrealist movements , as well as Basil Bunting , Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley . He spent most of his time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore Shakespeare and Company , and in 1921 the volume Poems 1918 – 1921 was published . In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of The Waste Land , then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound , who blue @-@ inked the manuscript with comments like " make up <unk> mind ... " and " <unk> " . Eliot wrote : " I should like to think that the manuscript , with the suppressed passages , had disappeared irrecoverably ; yet , on the other hand , I should wish the blue <unk> on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound 's critical genius . " 
 In 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford 's The Transatlantic Review from American attorney John Quinn . The Review published works by Pound , Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein , as well as extracts from Joyce 's Finnegans Wake , before the money ran out in 1925 . It also published several Pound music reviews , later collected into Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony . 
 Hemingway asked Pound to blue @-@ ink his short stories . Although Hemingway was 14 years younger , the two forged what would become a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship , living on the same street for a time , and touring Italy together in 1923 . " They liked each other personally , shared the same aesthetic aims , and admired each other 's work " , writes Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers , with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound 's teaching . Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis , Ford , and Joyce , while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box , but as he told Sherwood Anderson , " [ Ezra ] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish " . 
 Pound was 36 when he met the 26 @-@ year @-@ old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in the fall of 1922 , beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years . Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked , something Dorothy turned a blind eye to over the years . He complained shortly after arriving in Paris that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress . He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob , near the Boulevard Saint @-@ Germain . The two moved in different social circles : Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown , Ohio , steel family , living in her mother 's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank , socializing with aristocrats , while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank . The two spent the following summer in the south of France , where he worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music , and managed to write two operas , including Le Testament de Villon . He wrote pieces for solo violin , which Olga performed .

 The Pounds were unhappy in Paris ; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra 's health was poor . At a dinner a guest had randomly tried to stab him , and to Pound it underlined that their time in France was over . Hemingway observed that Pound " indulged in a small nervous breakdown " , leading to two days in an American hospital . They decided to move to a quieter place , and chose Rapallo , Italy , a town with a population of 15 @,@ 000 . " Italy is my place for starting things " , he told a friend . During this period they lived on Dorothy 's income , supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in . 
 Olga Rudge , pregnant with Pound 's child , followed them to Italy . She showed little interest in raising a child , but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him . In July 1925 she gave birth to a daughter , Mary . She placed her with a German @-@ speaking peasant woman whose own child had died , and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month . 
 When Pound told Dorothy about the birth , she separated from him for much of that year and the next . In December 1925 , she left on an extended trip to Egypt . On her return in March , Pound realized that his wife was pregnant . In June , she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of Le Testament de Villon , without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents . In September , Hemingway drove Dorothy to the American Hospital of Paris for the birth of a son , Omar Pound . In a letter to his parents in October Pound wrote , " next generation ( male ) arrived . Both D & it appear to be doing well " . Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother , Olivia , who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school . When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar , Pound would spend the time with Olga , whose father had bought her a house in Venice . The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently . Mary had a single pair of shoes , and books about Jesus and the saints , while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother . 
 In 1925 the literary magazine This Quarter dedicated its first issue to Pound , including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce . Pound published Cantos XVII – XIX in the winter editions . In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine , The Exile , but only four issues were published . It did well in the first year , with contributions from Hemingway , E. E. Cummings , Basil Bunting , Yeats , William Carlos Williams and Robert McAlmon ; some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound 's rambling editorials on Confucianism and or in praise of Lenin , according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm . He continued to work on Fenollosa 's manuscripts , and in 1928 won The Dial 's poetry award for his translation of the Confucian classic Great Learning ( Dà <unk> , transliterated as Ta <unk> ) . That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo , seeing him for the first time since 1914 . By then Homer had retired , so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves . They took a small house , Villa <unk> , on a hill above the town . 
 Pound began work on The Cantos in earnest after relocating to Italy . The poems concern good and evil , a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise . Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings : those who enjoy hell and stay there ; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave ; and a few who lead the rest to <unk> terrestre . Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts , and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts , beginning again in 1922 . The first three appear in Poetry in June – August 1917 . The Malatesta Cantos appeared in The Criterion in July 1923 , and two further cantos were published in The Transatlantic Review in January 1924 . Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of A Draft of XVI . Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book . 
 = = = Turn to fascism , World War II = = = 
 Pound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism , which he called " usury " , that the solution lay in C.H. Douglas 's idea of social credit , and that fascism was the vehicle for reform ; he had met Douglas in the New Age offices and had been impressed by his ideas . He gave a series of lectures on economics , and made contact with politicians in the United States on matters including education , interstate commerce and international affairs . Although Hemingway advised against it , on 30 January 1933 Pound met Benito Mussolini . Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound , who had earlier sent him a copy of Cantos XXX . During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas , but Mussolini brushed them aside , though he called the Cantos " <unk> " ( entertaining ) . The meeting was recorded in Canto XLI : " ' Ma questo ' / said the boss , ' è <unk> . ' " Pound said he had " never met anyone who seemed to GET my ideas so quickly as the boss " . 
 When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London , Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral , where he saw their 12 @-@ year @-@ old son Omar for the first time in eight years . He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis , who produced a now @-@ famous portrait of Pound reclining . In April 1939 he sailed for New York , believing he could stop America 's involvement in World War II , happy to answer reporters ' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket . He traveled to Washington , D.C. where he met senators and congressmen . His daughter , Mary , said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility , rather than megalomania ; he was offered no encouragement , and was left feeling depressed and frustrated . 
 In June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College , and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing antisemitic material for Italian newspapers . He wrote to James Laughlin that Roosevelt represented Jewry , and signed the letter with " Heil Hitler " . He started writing for Action , a newspaper owned by the British fascist Sir Oswald Mosley , arguing that the Third Reich was the " natural <unk> of Russia " . After war broke out in September that year , he began a furious letter @-@ writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier , arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it . 
 = = = Radio broadcasts = = = 
 Tytell writes that by the 1940s no American or English poet had been so active politically since William Blake . Pound wrote over a thousand letters a year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles , as well as in The Cantos . Pound 's greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry , where the profit motive would govern war and peace . He read George Santayana and The Law of Civilization and Decay by Brooks Adams , finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant . He wrote in The Japan Times that " Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a ' country run by Jews , ' " and told Oswald Mosley 's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the Rothschilds . 
 Pound broadcast over Rome Radio , though the Italian government was at first reluctant , concerned that he might be a double agent . He told a friend : " It took me , I think it was , TWO years , insistence and wrangling etc . , to GET <unk> of their microphone . " He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States , Roosevelt , Roosevelt 's family , and the Jews , and rambling about his poetry , economics , and Chinese philosophy . The first was in January 1935 , and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly ; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre @-@ record the 10 @-@ minute broadcasts , for which he was paid around $ 17 , and they were broadcast every three days . The broadcasts required the Italian government 's approval , though he often changed the text in the studio . Tytell wrote that Pound 's voice had assumed a " rasping , buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar " . The politics apart , Pound needed the money ; his father 's pension payments had stopped – his father died in February 1942 – and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after . 
 The broadcasts were monitored by the United States Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service listening station at Princeton University , and Pound was indicted in absentia for treason in July 1943 . He answered the charge by writing a letter to Attorney General Francis Biddle , which Tytell describes as " long , reasoned , and temperate " , defending his right to free speech . He continued to broadcast and write under pseudonyms until April 1945 , shortly before his arrest .

 The war years threw Pound 's domestic arrangements into disarray . Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant ' Ambrogio . In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evacuated from their apartment in Rapallo . His mother Isabel 's apartment was too small , and the couple moved in with Olga . Mary , then 19 and finished with convent school , was quickly sent back to <unk> in Switzerland , leaving Pound , as she would later write , " pent up with two women who loved him , whom he loved , and who coldly hated each other . " 
 Pound was in Rome early in September when Italy surrendered . He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city , having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son . He walked 450 miles north , spending a night in an air raid shelter in Bologna , then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way . Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived , he was so dirty and tired . He told her everything about his other family ; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger . 
 He returned home to Rapallo , where on 3 May 1945 , four days after Mussolini was shot , armed partisans arrived at the house to find Pound alone . He stuffed a copy of Confucius and a Chinese dictionary in his pocket before he was taken to their headquarters in <unk> . He was released shortly afterwards ; then with Olga gave himself up to an American military post in the nearby town of Lavagna . 
 Pound was transferred to U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps headquarters in Genoa , where he was interrogated by Frank L. <unk> , an FBI agent assigned by J. Edgar Hoover . Pound asked to send a cable to President Truman to offer to help negotiate peace with Japan . He also asked to be allowed a final broadcast , a script called " Ashes of Europe Calling " , in which he recommended peace with Japan , American management of Italy , the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine , and leniency toward Germany . His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to Hoover . 
 On 8 May , the day Germany surrendered , Pound told an American reporter , Ed Johnston , that Hitler was " a Jeanne d 'Arc , a saint " , and that Mussolini was an " imperfect character who lost his head " . On 24 May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa , where he was placed in one of the camp 's " death cells " , a series of six @-@ by @-@ six @-@ foot outdoor steel cages lit up at night by floodlights ; engineers reinforced his cage with heavier steel for fear the fascists would try to break him out . He spent three weeks in isolation in the heat , sleeping on the concrete , denied exercise and communication , except for conversations with the chaplain . After two and a half weeks he began to break down under the strain . Richard <unk> wrote that Pound recorded it in Canto <unk> , where Odysseus is saved from drowning by Leucothea : " hast 'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness , / when the raft broke and the waters went over me . " Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week . On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists , one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown , after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material . He began to write , drafting what became known as The Pisan Cantos . The existence of a few sheets of toilet paper showing the beginning of Canto LXXXIV suggests he started it while in the cage .

 On 15 November 1945 Pound was transferred to the United States . An escorting officer 's impression was that " he is an intellectual ' crackpot ' who imagined that he could correct all the economic ills of the world and who resented the fact that ordinary mortals were not sufficiently intelligent to understand his aims and motives . " He was arraigned in Washington D.C. on charges of treason on the 25th of that month . The charges included broadcasting for the enemy , attempting to persuade American citizens to undermine government support of the war , and strengthening morale in Italy against the United States . 
 He was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital and in June the following year Dorothy was declared his legal guardian . He was held for a time in the hospital 's prison ward – Howard 's Hall , known as the " hell @-@ hole " – a building without windows in a room with a thick steel door , and nine peepholes to allow the psychiatrists to observe him as they tried to agree on a diagnosis . Visitors were admitted for only 15 minutes at a time , while patients wandered around screaming and frothing at the mouth . 
 Pound 's lawyer , Julien Cornell , whose efforts to have him declared insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment , requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947 . The hospital 's superintendent , Winfred Overholser , agreed instead to move him to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward , close to Overholser 's private quarters , which is where he spent the next 12 years . The historian Stanley Kutler was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound , including his hospital records , and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a narcissistic personality , but they considered him sane . Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him . 
 Tytell writes that Pound was in his element in Chestnut Ward . He was at last provided for , and was allowed to read , write , and receive visitors , including Dorothy for several hours a day . He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room , and turned it into his private living room , where he entertained his friends and important literary figures . He began work on his translation of Sophocles 's Women of Trachis and Electra , and continued work on The Cantos . It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released . Olga Rudge visited him twice , once in 1952 and again in 1955 , and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release . She wrote to a friend : " E.P. has – as he had before – bats in the belfry but it strikes me that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration . " 
 Pound 's contemporaries did all they could to get him out of confinement . Robert Frost obtained legal advocacy and successfully campaigned to get Pound out of St. Elizabeths . In 1955 , Hemingway said “ . . . Whatever he did has been punished greatly and I believe he should be freed to go and write poems in Italy where he is loved and understood . ”

 James Laughlin had " Cantos <unk> – LXXXIV " ready for publication in 1946 under the title The Pisan Cantos , and gave Pound an advance copy , but he held back , waiting for an appropriate time to publish . A group of Pound 's friends – Eliot , Cummings , W. H. Auden , Allen Tate , and Julien Cornell – met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released . They planned to have Pound awarded the first Bollingen Prize , a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress , with $ 1 @,@ 000 prize money donated by the Mellon family . 
 The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress , including several of Pound 's supporters , such as Eliot , Tate , Conrad Aiken , Amy Lowell , Katherine Anne Porter and Theodore Spencer . The idea was that the Justice Department would be placed in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released . 
 Laughlin published The Pisan Cantos on 30 July 1948 , and the following year the prize went to Pound . There were two dissenting voices , Francis Biddle 's wife , Katherine Garrison Chapin , and Karl Shapiro , who said that he could not vote for an antisemite because he was Jewish himself . Pound responded to the award by saying , " No comment from the bughouse . " 
 There was uproar . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette quoted critics who said " poetry [ cannot ] convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry . " Robert Hillyer , a Pulitzer Prize winner and president of the Poetry Society of America , attacked the committee in The Saturday Review of Literature , telling journalists that he " never saw anything to admire in Pound , not one line " . Congressman Jacob K. Javits demanded an investigation into the awards committee . It was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress .

 Although Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public , he maintained his views in private . He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish @-@ sounding names , dismissed people he disliked as " Jews " , and urged visitors to read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( 1903 ) , a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination . He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite Eustace Mullins , believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America , and author of the 1961 biography This Difficult Individual , Ezra Pound . 
 Even more damaging was his friendship with John Kasper , a far @-@ right activist and Ku Klux Klan member . Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university , and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends . Kasper opened a bookstore in Greenwich Village in 1953 called " Make it New " , reflecting his commitment to Pound 's ideas ; the store specialized in far @-@ right material , including Nazi literature , and Pound 's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front . Kasper and another follower of Pound 's , David Horton , set up a publishing imprint , Square Dollar Series , which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform . 
 Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too , such as the classicist J.P. Sullivan and the writer Guy Davenport , but it was the association with Mullins and Kasper that stood out . The relationships delayed his release from St Elizabeths . In an interview for the Paris Review in 1958 , when asked by interviewer George Plimpton about Pound 's relationship with Kasper , Hemingway replied that Pound should be released and Kasper jailed . Kasper was eventually jailed for the 1957 bombing of the Hattie Cotton School in Nashville , targeted because a black girl had registered as a student . 
 Pound 's friends continued to try to get him out . Shortly after Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954 , he told Time magazine that " this would be a good year to release poets " . The poet Archibald MacLeish asked him in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound 's behalf ; Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper , but he signed a letter of support anyway , and pledged $ 1 @,@ 500 to be given to Pound when he was released . In 1957 several publications began campaigning for his release . Le Figaro published an appeal entitled " The Lunatic at St Elizabeths " . The New Republic , Esquire and The Nation followed suit ; The Nation argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man , but that he had rights . In 1958 MacLeish hired Thurman Arnold , a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee , to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment . Overholser , the hospital 's superintendent , supported the application with an affidavit saying Pound was permanently and incurably insane , and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose . The motion was heard on 18 April that year by the same judge who had committed Pound to St Elizabeths . The Department of Justice did not oppose the motion , and Pound was free .

 Pound arrived in Naples in July , where he was photographed giving a fascist salute to the waiting press . When asked when he had been released from the mental hospital , he replied : " I never was . When I left the hospital I was still in America , and all America is an insane asylum . " He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at Castle <unk> near Merano in the Province of South Tyrol – where he met his grandson , Walter , and his granddaughter , Patrizia , for the first time – then returned to Rapallo , where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them . 
 They were accompanied by a teacher Pound had met in hospital , Marcella Spann , 40 years his junior , ostensibly acting as his secretary and collecting poems for an anthology . The four women soon fell out , vying for control over him ; Canto <unk> : alluded to it : " Pride , jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell . " Pound was in love with Marcella , seeing in her his last chance for love and youth . He wrote about her in Canto <unk> : " The long flank , the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be , / flowing , ever <unk> . " Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs , but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Marcella was seen off , sent back to America . 
 By December 1959 he was mired in depression . He saw his work as worthless and The Cantos botched . In a 1960 interview given in Rome to Donald Hall for Paris Review , he said : " You – find me – in fragments . " Hall wrote that he seemed in an " abject despair , accidie , meaninglessness , <unk> , waste " . He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview , never finishing a sentence , bursting with energy one minute , then suddenly sagging , and at one point seemed about to collapse . Hall said it was clear that he " doubted the value of everything he had done in his life . " 
 Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia , and in the summer of 1960 Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped . He picked up again , but by the spring of 1961 he had a urinary infection . Dorothy felt unable to look after him , so he went that summer to live with Olga in Rapallo , then Venice ; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar . Pound attended a neo @-@ Fascist May Day parade in 1962 , but his health continued to decline . The following year he told an interviewer , Grazia Levi : " I spoil everything I touch . I have always blundered ... All my life I believed I knew nothing , yes , knew nothing . And so words became devoid of meaning . " 
 William Carlos Williams died in 1963 , followed by Eliot in 1965 . Pound went to Eliot 's funeral in London and on to Dublin to visit Yeats 's widow . Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue @-@ inked version of Eliot 's The Waste Land . He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation . Shortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed he be awarded the Emerson @-@ Thoreau Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , but after a storm of protest the academy 's council opposed it by 13 to 9 ; the sociologist Daniel Bell , who was on the committee , argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it . Two weeks before he died , Pound read for a gathering of friends at a café : " re <unk> / I was out of focus , taking a symptom for a cause . / The cause is <unk> . " 
 On his 87th birthday , 30 October 1972 , he was too weak to leave his bedroom . The next night he was admitted to the Civil Hospital of Venice , where he died in his sleep of an intestinal blockage on 1 November , with Olga at his side . Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral . Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery , Isola di San Michele , where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky . Dorothy died in England the following year . Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound . 
 = = Style = = 
 Critics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist , particularly in his early work , such as " The River Merchant 's Wife " . According to <unk> a modern style is evident as early as Ripostes , and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began The Cantos , writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an " objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own " without use of symbolism or romanticism . 
 Drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines , Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions , yet led the reader to an intended conclusion , believing the " thoughtful man " would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure . Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure , he created a unique form of speech , employing odd and strange words , jargon , avoiding verbs , and using rhetorical devices such as parataxis . 
 Pound 's relationship to music is essential to his poetry . Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as " raucous , nasal , scratchy " , Michael <unk> writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound , an " ear " for words , imbuing his poetry with <unk> . His study of troubadour poetry – words written to be sung ( <unk> et son ) – led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly . He wrote that rhythm is " the hardest quality of a man 's style to counterfeit " . Ingham compares the form of The Cantos to a fugue ; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form , nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously . He goes on to write that Pound 's use of counterpoint is integral to the structure and cohesion of The Cantos , which show multi @-@ voiced counterpoint and , with the juxtaposition of images , non @-@ linear themes . The pieces are presented in fragments " which taken together , can be seen to unfold in time as music does " . 
 = = = Imagism and Vorticism = = = 
 Opinion varies about the nature of Pound 's writing style . Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound 's poetry . Like Wyndham Lewis , Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing , saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the " exact " word , stripping the writing down to the " barest essence " . According to Nadel , " Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction ... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics . " Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate " all but the hardest kernel " from a poem , such as in the two @-@ line poem " In a Station of the Metro " . However , Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic , so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for The Cantos . 
 = = = Translations = = = 
 Pound 's translations represent a substantial part of his work . He began his career with translations of Occitan ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry . Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general , much of which Pound started , consists of some the most " significant modernist achievements in English " . Pound was the first English language poet since John Dryden , some three centuries earlier , to give primacy to translations in English literature . The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism , <unk> , and , perhaps of greater importance , they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work . 
 Michael Alexander writes that , as a translator , Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence . He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu , and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English @-@ speaking audiences . He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama . He translated and championed Greek , Latin and Anglo @-@ Saxon classics , and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft . 
 In Pound 's Fenollosa translations , unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry , which tended to work with strict metrical and <unk> patterns , Pound created free verse translations . Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy . Hugh Kenner contends that Cathay should be read primarily as a work about World War I , not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems . The real achievement of the book , Kenner argues , is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to " rethink the nature of an English poem " . These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts , Kenner argues , are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West . Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound 's use of language in his translation of " The Seafarer " is deliberate , in that he avoids merely " trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language " . 
 = = = The Cantos = = = 
 The Cantos is difficult to decipher . In the epic poem , Pound disregards literary genres , mixing satire , hymns , elegies , essays and memoirs . Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th @-@ century nationalistic approach in favor of early @-@ 20th @-@ century comparative literature . Pound reaches across cultures and time periods , assembling and juxtaposing " themes and history " from Homer to Ovid and Dante , from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , and many others . The work presents a multitude of protagonists as " travellers between nations " . The nature of The Cantos , she says , is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against " a <unk> standard " of modernism . Pound layered ideas , cultures , and historical periods , juxtaposing modern vernacular , Classical languages , and underlying truths , often represented with Chinese ideograms and as many as 15 different languages . 
 Ira Nadel says The Cantos is an epic , that is " a poem including history " , and that the " historical figures lend referentiality to the text " . It functions as a contemporary memoir , in which " personal history [ and ] lyrical retrospection mingle " – most clearly represented in the Pisan Cantos . Michael Ingham sees in The Cantos an American tradition of experimental literature writing about it , " These works include everything but the kitchen sink , and then add the kitchen sink " . In the 1960s William O 'Connor described The Cantos as filled with " cryptic and gnomic utterances , dirty jokes , obscenities of various sorts " . 
 Allen Tate believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning , middle or end . He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and " at the mercy of random flights of ' angelic insight , ' an <unk> self @-@ indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated " . This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of The Cantos . Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure , and regretted that he could not " make it cohere " . 
 = = = Literary criticism and economic theory = = = 
 Pound 's literary criticism and essays are , according to Massimo Bacigalupo , a " form of intellectual journal " . In early works , such as The Spirit of Romance and " I Gather the Limbs of Osiris " , Pound paid attention to medieval troubadour poets – Arnaut Daniel and François Villon . The former piece was to " remain one of Pound 's principal sourcebooks for his poetry " ; in the latter he introduces the concept of " luminous details " . The leitmotifs in Pound 's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events , which , he believed , through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth ; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures . 
 Pound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ABC of Economics and Jefferson and / or Mussolini , published in the mid @-@ 1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini . These were followed by The Guide to <unk> – covering 2500 years of history – which Tim Redman describes as the " most complete synthesis of Pound 's political and economic thought " . Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics , and he wove his economic theories throughout ; neither can be understood without the other . In these pamphlets and in The ABC of Reading , he sought to emphasize the value of art and to " <unk> the political " – written forcefully , according to Nadel , and in a " determined voice " . In form his criticism and essays are direct , repetitive and reductionist , his rhetoric minimalist , filled with " strident impatience " , according to Pound scholar Jason Coats , and frequently failing to make a coherent claim . He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own , although not very successfully , in Coats 's view .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 In 1922 the literary critic Edmund Wilson reviewed Pound 's latest published volume of poetry , Poems 1918 – 21 , and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet . In his essay on Pound , titled " Ezra Pound 's Patchwork " , Wilson wrote : 
 Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial . It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America , but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho . ... His sophistication is still juvenile , his ironies are still clumsy and obvious , he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself ... 
 According to Wilson , the lines in Pound 's poems stood isolated , with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that " do not hang together " . Citing Pound 's first seven cantos , Wilson dubbed the writing " unsatisfactory " . He found The Cantos disjointed and its contents reflecting a too @-@ obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors , and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound 's own life . 
 The rise of New Criticism during the 1950s , in which author is separated from text , secured Pound 's poetic reputation . Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot 's Literary Essays in 1954 " initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound " . Eliot 's essays coincided with the work of Hugh Kenner , who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths . Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound , adding that there is also no one to appeal more through " sheer beauty of language " . Along with Donald Davie , Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound 's work in the 1960s and 1970s . Donald Gallup 's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner 's The Pound Era in 1971 . In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies ( <unk> ) was established , and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of The Cantos , to be followed by a number of research editions of The Cantos . 
 Following Mullins ' biography , described by Nadel as " partisan " and " melodramatic " , was Noel Stock 's factual 1970 Life of Ezra Pound – although the material included was subject to Dorothy 's approval . The 1980s saw three significant biographies : John Tytell 's " neutral " account in 1987 , followed by Wilhelm 's multi @-@ volume biography . Humphrey Carpenter 's sprawling narrative , a " complete life " , built on what Stock began ; unlike Stock , Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound 's relatives . In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi @-@ volume biography , combining narrative with literary criticism , the first work to link the two . 
 In the 1980s Mary de <unk> released the first dual @-@ language edition of The Cantos , including " Canto LXXII " and " Canto <unk> " . These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines , and are characterized by 21st @-@ century literary scholars as no more than war @-@ time propaganda . In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound 's prose and poetry was published , now considered a " fundamental research tool " , according to Nadel . Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in @-@ depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years . Tim Redman writes about Pound 's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini , and Leon <unk> about Pound 's economic theories , especially during the Italian period , investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist . In 1999 <unk> wrote about the state of Pound criticism , that " the effort to uncover coherence in a ... crazy quilt of verse styles , critical principles , <unk> economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components . " He emphasized that Pound 's " economic and political opinions have not been properly dated , nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated . " 
 Nadel 's 2010 Pound in Context is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship . Pound 's life , " the social , political , historical , and literary developments of his period " , is fully investigated , which , according to Nadel is " the grid for reading Pound 's poetry . " In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1 @,@ 500 documents in the " Pound files " held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars , and almost certainly contain evidence that " Pound was politically cannier , was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism , and was more involved with Mussolini 's regime than has been posited " . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Pound helped advance the careers of some of the best @-@ known modernist writers of the early 20th century . In addition to Eliot , Joyce , Lewis , Frost , Williams , Hemingway and Conrad Aiken , he befriended and helped Marianne Moore , Louis <unk> , Jacob Epstein , Basil Bunting , E.E. Cummings , Margaret Anderson , George Oppen , and Charles Olson . Hugh <unk> argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th @-@ century English @-@ language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound 's generation and the two generations after him . In 1917 Carl Sandburg wrote in Poetry : " All talk on modern poetry , by people who know , ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere . He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker , poseur , trifler and vagrant . Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch . The point is , he will be mentioned . " 
 The outrage after Pound 's wartime collaboration with Mussolini 's regime was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion . Arthur Miller considered him worse than Hitler : " In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra ... he knew all America 's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as Goebbels ever did . " The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists , and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re @-@ evaluation . Macha Rosenthal wrote that it was " as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest " in Ezra Pound . 
 Pound 's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry . Pound scholar Wendy Stallard <unk> writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic . She believes the positioning of Pound as " National Monster " and " designated fascist intellectual " made him a stand @-@ in for the silent majority in Germany , occupied France and Belgium , as well as Britain and the United States , who , she argues , made the Holocaust possible by aiding or standing by . 
 Later in his life , Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies . Allen Ginsberg states that , in a private conversation in 1967 , Pound told the young poet , " my poems don 't make sense . " He went on to supposedly call himself a " moron " , to characterize his writing as " stupid and ignorant " , " a mess " . Ginsberg reassured Pound that he " had shown us the way " , but Pound refused to be mollified : 
 <unk> good I 've done has been spoiled by bad intentions – the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things , ' [ he ] replied . Then very slowly , with emphasis , surely conscious of Ginsberg 's being Jewish : ' But the worst mistake I made was that stupid , suburban prejudice of anti @-@ <unk>

 = Albert Dock = 
 The Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool , England . Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick , it was opened in 1846 , and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron , brick and stone , with no structural wood . As a result , it was the first non @-@ combustible warehouse system in the world . 
 At the time of its construction the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from / to the warehouses . Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world 's first hydraulic cranes . Due to its open yet secure design , the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy , cotton , tea , silk , tobacco , ivory and sugar . However , despite the Albert Dock 's advanced design , the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years , larger , more open docks were required , although it remained a valuable store for cargo . 
 During the Second World War , the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty serving as a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet . The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool , notably during the May Blitz of 1941 . In the aftermath of the war , the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain . Numerous plans were developed for the re @-@ use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed . Having lain derelict for nearly ten years , the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981 , when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up , with the Albert Dock being officially re @-@ opened in 1984 . 
 Today the Albert Dock is a major tourist attraction in the city and the most visited multi @-@ use attraction in the United Kingdom , outside London . It is a vital component of Liverpool 's UNESCO designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City and the docking complex and warehouses also comprise the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Grand beginnings and early history = = = 
 The history of the Albert Dock dates back to 1837 , when Jesse Hartley first began the development of plans for a combined dock and warehouse system . The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow civil engineer Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite ' radical ' , as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses . However , this idea was not new , and as far back as the 1803 Warehousing Act , legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur , whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of St Katharine 's Dock in London , which was opened in 1828 . As part of the development process , Hartley was eager to test the fire resistance of any particular design by constructing an 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) by 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) dummy structure , filling it with timber and tar , and setting it alight . After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of cast iron , brick , sandstone and granite . The design was submitted for planning permission in 1839 although it wasn 't until 1841 , when the bill authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by Parliament , that construction was allowed to begin . 
 The site chosen for the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east , the entrance channel to Canning Dock to the north and by Dukes Dock to the south . The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared , with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub , several houses and the Dock Trustee 's Dockyard . Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock 's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed , whilst hundreds of ' <unk> ' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall . The dock basin was completed by February 1845 , allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock , although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to ' lay @-@ up ' . 
 The dock complex was officially opened in 1846 by Albert , Prince Consort , husband of Queen Victoria and the man in honour of whom it was named . This event marked the first occasion in Liverpool 's history in which a member of the Royal Family had made a state visit to the city and as a result the occasion was marked with a major celebrations . Many thousands of people turned out for the Royal visit with the newspaper The Pictorial Times noting the reception Prince Albert received : 
 " His reception was most enthusiastic ; balconies were erected along the line of procession , and these and the windows of houses were filled with gay and animated parties . There was a most brilliant display of flags , banners & c . [ sic ] . All business is suspended . There are 200 @,@ 000 strangers in town , and all the inhabitants are in the streets . All is gaiety and splendour . " ( The Pictorial Times , 1846 ) . 
 The Prince was taken on a processional tour through the city , including a visit to the town hall where the royal address was made , before departing aboard the ferry across to the Cheshire side of the Mersey and then northwards towards the Albert Dock . Again this stage of the procession route was laden with onlookers with The Pictorial Times describing the Prince 's entrance into the Albert Dock : 
 " From the Cheshire side of the river the Fairy crossed to the Liverpool side , and returned along the line of docks amidst the cheers of assembled thousands and the roar of artillery . The sight was really magnificent , all the ships in the docks were decked out in gayest colours and the river was crowded with boats filled with people . At half @-@ past two the fairy entered the dock , where were assembled two thousand ladies and gentlemen , the elite of the town ; they cheered enthusiastically , which his Royal Highness returned , and in order to gratify the crowd sailed round the dock . " ( The Pictorial Times , 1846 ) . 
 Despite the official opening occurring in 1846 , the construction of the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847 . In 1848 , a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic cargo handling hoist system , the first of its kind in the world . Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the <unk> , his assistant & the warehouse superintendent ; and a cooperage . Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack .

 The enclosed design of the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within Liverpool . As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy , cotton , tea , silk , tobacco , ivory and sugar . At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher , for longer . The dock came to dominate Liverpool 's far eastern trade , with over 90 % of the city 's silk imports from China coming through it and more generally half of all the far eastern trade income . 
 Despite the great prosperity the dock afforded the city , within 20 years of its construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle . Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1 @,@ 000 tonnes , by the start of the 20th century only 7 % of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels . The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn 't large enough , as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it . Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue . Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships , and in a cruel twist of irony , the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive , were now hindering its future development . Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained an integral part of the dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use , whilst in 1899 , part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage . 
 By the 1920s virtually all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock , although its warehouses did remain in use for the storage of goods transported by barge , road or rail . The onset of the Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being ' requisitioned ' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines , small warships and landing craft . During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it , and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack . By the end of the war almost 15 % of the Albert Dock 's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage .

The owners of the dock , the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board ( MDHB ) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage , adopting an attitude of ' if its not broke don 't fix it and if it is broke we still won 't fix it ' . At the same time a change in geo @-@ political orientation towards Europe , coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer , stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK . Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status . 
 Despite this recognition , the increasing debts of the MDHB meant that by the 1960s the company was eager to get rid of the Albert Dock . Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land , the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates , a property developer owned by Harry Hyams . Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space , hotels , restaurants , bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin . With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it ( inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes ) , Oldham Estates were forced into scaling @-@ down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as ' Aquarius City ' , which had as its centrepiece a 44 @-@ storey skyscraper . Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced , than the MDHB 's financial problems reached crisis point , Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through . 
 With the MDHB on the verge of bankruptcy a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system . The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down . The Brunswick Dock gates , which separated the South Docks system from the River Mersey , were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began . In many senses just as the Albert Dock 's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool at the time of its construction , its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole . 
 Throughout the early 1970s plans continued to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock site and the whole of the south docks system in general . Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council 's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site . The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company ( MDHC ) , the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board , however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land . One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic ( now John Moores University ) . The government was even willing to provide £ 3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside . 
 The creation of Merseyside County Council ( MCC ) in 1974 brought new hope that the Albert Dock could be redeveloped , with the MCC placing a high priority on its development . They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal to take over the running of the south docks . Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC ( the dock owners ) , Liverpool City Council ( the local planning authority ) and Merseyside County Council ( the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks ) continued to hinder any development plans . Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the ' Minister for Merseyside ' Michael Heseltine , set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool 's south docks . 
 = = = The MDC and regeneration of the Albert Dock = = = 
 The creation of the Merseyside Development Corporation ( MDC ) in 1981 was part of a new initiative launched by the then Conservative government that earmarked the regeneration of some 800 acres ( 3 @.@ 2 km2 ) of Liverpool 's south docks , by using public sector investment to create infrastructure within an area that could then in turn be used to attract private sector investment . Thus the MDC was not directly responsible for regeneration programmes but rather acted as a spearhead , guiding the development process . Upon its formation it immediately created an initial strategy for the area placing a high priority on restoring those buildings that could be restored & demolishing the rest , restoring a water regime within the dock system ( including the removal of up to 40 ft ( 12 m ) of silt ) and general environmental landscaping . As part of the strategy two flagship schemes were set up : the redevelopment of a site in <unk> for the International Garden Festival and the regeneration of the Albert Dock . 
 In 1982 the MDC entered into negotiations with London @-@ based developers Arrowcroft in order to secure much needed private sector investment . On a visit to the site , Arrowcroft 's chairman Leonard <unk> spoke of how the buildings " talked to him " and upon his return to London set about persuading the company 's board to take on the project . In September 1983 a deal was signed between Arrowcroft plc and the MDC leading to the creation of the Albert Dock Company , which could now start the process of regenerating the Albert Dock . 
 One of the first priorities of the regeneration was the restoration of the dock system , which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open . Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin , dock gates were replaced & bridges restored , whilst the dock walls were repaired . The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock 's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage . Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley 's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition . 
 Development within the Albert Dock was rapid and the newly renovated Edward Pavilion ( formerly north east stack ) was ready in time for the 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race . The race was a big success for the city with over one million visitors into Liverpool over a period of four days , of which 160 @,@ 000 visited the Albert Dock . In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC , the tall ships race and International Garden Festival , attracted over 3 @.@ 5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984 . Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office , which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television . 
 Spurred by the success of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival , Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock 's renovation . With the Edward Pavilion refurbishment a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions ( formerly the south and south east stacks ) , the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II . In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock , having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984 . The museum , developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby . Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses , the Colonnades ( formerly west stack ) . Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors . The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to ' sales day at Harrods ' . 
 The Albert Dock was officially re @-@ opened in 1988 by The Prince of Wales , the great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandson of Prince Albert , the man who had originally opened the docks . It was timed to coincide with the opening of the newly finished Tate Liverpool , which was dubbed the ' Tate of the north ' and at the time the only one outside London . The decision to locate a Tate gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city , as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of modern art in the North of England . 
 In 1988 ITV 's new morning television show This Morning , hosted by Richard and Judy , began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock . As part of the show weather presenter Fred Talbot used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast . Two years later in 1990 The Beatles Story museum opened , the only Beatles themed visitor attraction in Britain , providing yet another draw to the Albert Dock . 
 Throughout the 1990s development continued including a new hotel and the conversion of vacant space for use by larger companies such as Telewest ( Now Virgin Media ) . Finally in 2003 , some 22 years after the renovation of the Albert Dock started , the last remaining undeveloped space was brought into use with the opening of a new Premier Lodge hotel in the Britannia Pavilion . 
 = = Structural design and construction = = 
 When it was constructed the Albert Dock was considered a state of the art docking system . Built almost entirely from cast iron , stone and brick , the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof , and on completion was the world 's first non @-@ combustible warehouse system . It provided 1 @,@ 290 @,@ 000 square feet ( 120 @,@ 000 m2 ) of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of 7 @.@ 75 acres ( 3 @.@ 14 ha ) . In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47 @,@ 000 tonnes of mortar . In total it cost £ 782 @,@ 265 ( approximately £ 41m today ) , whilst today its estimated to be worth £ 230 million . 
 The building 's design complements many existing construction techniques with , what were considered at the time , radical solutions . The warehouses are supported by large load @-@ bearing walls that range from being 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick at the base to 19 inches ( 480 mm ) on the fourth level . One of the most advanced architectural features is the use of stressed skin roofing , which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of . Huge iron trusses are crossed with rivetted and galvanised wrought iron plates , creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above . The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered ' highly flexible ' , as new windows , stairwells and lift shafts could be added without risk to the building 's structural integrity . 
 The advanced design stretches far beyond what can be seen from the ground . The structures are free from wood , but their foundations contain 13 @,@ 729 piles of timber , which would stretch for 48 miles ( 77 km ) in length if laid end to end . Such heavily supportive foundations were needed because the construction land was reclaimed from the River Mersey to build on . Given the ' quicksand ' nature of the Mersey 's tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability . The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks ( now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades ) rise and fall with every tide . 
 One of the most notable features of the Albert Dock are the huge cast iron columns that line the quayside . At 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high and almost 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) in circumference , the columns are based upon the Greek Doric style of architecture . Hartley 's decision to use cast iron was an economic one as at the time it was cheaper than granite . Nonetheless , because of the huge dock walls that were built , the Albert Dock 's construction required so much granite that the dock trustee 's had to open their own mine in Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland . The quality of the build materials used as well as the docks sheer size are considered a strong illustration of the great prosperity that the Port of Liverpool afforded the city at the time and the building 's style is described as cyclopean classicism .

 Today the Albert Dock is one of Liverpool 's most important tourist attractions and a vital component of the city 's UNESCO world heritage Maritime Mercantile City . As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool , the Albert Dock is also the most visited multi @-@ use attraction in the United Kingdom outside London , with in excess of four million visitors per year . Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the Merseyside Maritime Museum , the Beatles Story and the Tate Liverpool . There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock : a Holiday Inn and Premier Inn both located in the Britannia Pavilion . All the five warehouses around the dock , referred to as A , B , C , D and E , are Grade I listed buildings . Also listed Grade I is the former dock traffic office . Other buildings around the dock are listed Grade II ; they are the former hydraulic pumping station , and the swing bridge leading from the dock towards the Pierhead . As at June 2009 Albert Dock 's north @-@ side car park and entrance from Mann Island is closed off and is a building site to build a new museum . 
 In the aftermath of the dock 's regeneration in the 1980s a policy had been adopted to try to attract retailers into the newly created premises within . However , after many years of struggling to compete with other major shopping areas in the city , the Albert Dock Company Ltd announced in 2007 a shift into attracting more bars and restaurants . As of 2008 , bars and restaurants resident in the Albert Dock include <unk> Bar & Restaurant , Revolution Bar , Spice Lounge , <unk> and Whats Cooking ?

 = Hamilton Disston = 
 Hamilton Disston ( August 23 , 1844 – April 30 , 1896 ) , was an industrialist and real @-@ estate developer who purchased four million acres ( 16 @,@ 000 km ² ) of Florida land in 1881 , an area larger than the state of Connecticut , and reportedly the most land ever purchased by a single person in world history . Disston was the son of Pennsylvania @-@ based industrialist Henry Disston who formed Disston & Sons Saw Works , which Hamilton later ran and which was one of the largest saw manufacturing companies in the world . 
 Hamilton Disston 's investment in the infrastructure of Florida spurred growth throughout the state . His related efforts to drain the Everglades triggered the state 's first land boom with numerous towns and cities established through the area . Disston 's land purchase and investments were directly responsible for creating or fostering the towns of Kissimmee , St. Cloud , Gulfport , Tarpon Springs , and indirectly aided the rapid growth of St. Petersburg , Florida . He furthermore oversaw the successful cultivation of rice and sugarcane near the Kissimmee area . 
 Although Disston 's engineered canals aided water transport and steamboat traffic in Florida , he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee and in the Everglades . He was forced to sell much of his investments at a fraction of their original costs . However , his land purchase primed Florida 's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida , and another joining the west coast , which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida . Disston 's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area , where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist , but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida . 
 = = Early life and business = = 
 Hamilton Disston was born in Philadelphia , the eldest son of nine children born to Mary Steelman and Henry Disston , an English immigrant and descendant of French nobility . Disston 's father was a successful industrialist who rose from being orphaned just days after arriving in the United States to running the Keystone Saw Works when Hamilton was a child . Henry Disston was responsible for multiple machining and saw patents , and in the spirit of Victorian @-@ era paternalism , envisioned and engineered a community around his steel factory in Tacony , Pennsylvania . After attending public school , Hamilton left at 15 years old , opting for an apprenticeship at the saw factory which , by that time , was a $ 500 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ year international venture . His father threatened to fire him for repeatedly leaving the factory to work for a volunteer fire department . Hamilton twice joined the Union Army only to have Henry purchase his release , but Hamilton organized a Company of saw factory employees during the Gettysburg Campaign . Henry finally agreed to support the " Disston Volunteers " financially . 
 After the American Civil War , Disston returned to work in his father 's factory as an executive . In 1878 , following the death of Henry Disston , Hamilton and his brothers Horace , William , and Jacob inherited the company which had been renamed to Henry Disston & Sons . Hamilton became the controlling member of the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ employee company and expanded production to 1 @.@ 4 million hacksaws and three million files per year . Only a month after Henry 's death , Hamilton gave President Rutherford B. Hayes a tour of the factory where an unshaped piece of steel was manufactured into a 26 @-@ inch ( 660 mm ) hand saw in only 42 minutes , and was presented to the president at the end of the tour — etched with his name . 
 While the saw manufacturing business continued growing , Disston branched out , investing in a chemical firm , a Chinese railroad , real estate in Atlantic City , New Jersey and mining in the western United States . 
 = = Disston Land Purchase = = 
 In the 1840s and 1850s , the sparsely populated state of Florida came to own approximately 15 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 61 @,@ 000 km2 ) of mostly swamp land , granted by the U.S. Congress to states with wetlands for the purpose of reclaiming the land under water by constructing canals and levees . In Florida , consolidated grants for the purpose of building rail infrastructure and reclaiming wetlands were placed in a trust called the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida ( IIF ) . The trust fund was managed by the Governor of Florida and four state officials . The fund pledged land to railroad companies and guaranteed bonds issued by the railroad companies on the land . When the high costs associated with the American Civil War and Reconstruction caused railroad companies to default on the bonds , the fund became liable and rapidly sank into debt and eventually into Federal Court receivership . By the time Governor George Franklin Drew took office in 1877 , the fund was nearly $ 1 million in debt . The state constitution forbade issuing bonds to repay it ; investors were not interested in Florida , no rail lines were built , and progress in the state stalled . 
 In 1877 , diplomat Henry Shelton Sanford invited Disston , an avid sport fisherman , on a fishing trip through Florida . During the trip , Disston realized the possibility that enormous tracts of land could be reclaimed for agriculture by using canals to drain Florida 's Lake Okeechobee . 
 An application for foreclosure of the IIF and its land was filed in federal court in 1880 . Negotiations to relieve the debt were held with various potential investors , including Sanford and Alexander St. Clair @-@ Abrams , but did not come to fruition . Disston and five associates , meanwhile , entered into a land reclamation contract with the Internal Improvement Fund in January 1881 . The contract stipulated that Disston and associates would be deeded half of whatever land his Atlantic and Gulf Coast Canal and Okeechobee Land Company reclaimed around Lake Okeechobee , the Kissimmee , Caloosahatchee and Miami Rivers . Congressman and Disston family friend , William D. " Pig Iron " Kelley , described Disston 's first contract : " He instituted broad preliminary investigations from which he received satisfactory reports ; he surveyed the entire field of the proposed work , and with Napoleonic instinct and foresight saw in the proposition an opportunity to promote his country 's welfare by the reclamation of a more than kingly domain . 
 Disston stood to gain up to 12 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 49 @,@ 000 km2 ) with his drainage contract , although it would displace numerous squatters . Florida 's Armed Occupation Act of 1842 had granted land to squatters in order to force the local Seminole Indians off the land , but Disston 's contract would force the squatters off any land that Disston could show was submerged . The drainage contract , however , was in jeopardy because it did not affect the massive debt bearing down on the Internal Improvement Fund . Court orders related to the debt threatened to derail the contract so Governor William D. Bloxham visited Disston in Philadelphia to persuade him to relieve the debt . During the visit , Disston tentatively agreed to purchase four million acres ( 16 @,@ 000 km ² ) of Internal Improvement Fund land for 25 cents per acre , an agreement which became a formal contract on June 1 , 1881 . Disston signed the contract on June 14 and The New York Times described the transaction with , " What is claimed to be the largest purchase of land ever made by a single person in the world " . It made him the largest landowner in the United States . On December 17 , 1881 , Disston sold two million acres ( 8 @,@ 000 km ² ) of his land to English Member of Parliament , Sir Edward James Reed , for $ 600 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Promotion and politics = = 
 While some in Florida disapproved of the sale for giving away the land too cheaply , it had positive effects . In the four years following Disston 's purchase , four times as many rail lines were added than the 20 preceding years . Land sales multiplied six times after the sale and the state 's taxable property value doubled . Around 150 @,@ 000 tourists came to Florida during the winter of 1884 alone . 
 To lure people to Florida , Disston opened real estate offices across America as well as England , Scotland , Germany , Italy , Sweden and Denmark . He promoted himself as owning two @-@ thirds of the entire state . These efforts drew people to the Orlando area ; and the major cities of Sarasota and Naples , Florida grew out of land sold by Disston . Fort Myers became the base of his Caloosahatchee River dredging efforts and its population rapidly increased . Disston 's headquarters were on the shores of Lake Tohopekaliga and became the city of Kissimmee . 
 Disston " <unk> " in politics , starting as early as 1876 in local issues . He and three other industrialists in Philadelphia — James <unk> , William Leeds , and David Lane — were known as the " Big Four " , controlling Republican nominations and appointments to city positions in a machine system until new political bosses replaced them in 1890 . His wealth allowed him to associate with tycoons and political celebrities , and he was often sought after to advise politicians though he refused to run for office . He publicly supported future president Benjamin Harrison , Congressman William D. Kelley , and political boss Matthew Quay . 
 In 1883 , he arranged for President Chester A. Arthur , a fellow Republican , to take a fishing trip to Kissimmee as part of a large publicity campaign for the city . Disston founded a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 81 km2 ) sugarcane plantation , out of which sprang the city of St. Cloud . Refineries for the plantation were constructed in Kissimmee and near Lake Okeechobee . 
 The key to Disston 's Florida plans was a massive dredging effort to drain the Kissimmee River floodplain that flows into Lake Okeechobee , to remove the surface water in the Everglades and the surrounding lands regardless of season . The canals were engineered to guide the overflow of Lake Okeechobee into the St. Lucie River and then into the Atlantic Ocean in the east ; the Caloosahatchee River overflow was directed to the Gulf of Mexico in the west , and eventually canals were to be constructed south through the Everglades . Disston was advised to begin with a large canal connecting Lake Okeechobee with the St. Lucie but the prohibitive costs forced him to begin with smaller dredging operations to straighten the Kissimmee River and to connect Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee . Dredging commenced around Lake Okeechobee during the winter of 1881 – 1882 . In June 1883 , a report concluded that the Kissimmee valley was indeed drying up as Disston planned , and another report a year later reported further drainage with nearly 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reclaimed land credited to Disston . 
 = = Disston City = = 
 In addition to dredging , Disston 's plans included the creation of a major city in the Tampa Bay area to rival the budding city of Tampa . By 1884 , he established the Lake Butler Villa Company , one of four land companies he operated . Disston founded the town of Tarpon Springs , much of which was built by Lake Butler Villa Company , including a commercial pier and two hotels , using lumber from his sawmill in Atlantic City , New Jersey . After deciding that Tarpon Springs would not become the metropolis he hoped for , Disston shifted his efforts south and established a town he called Disston City . He invested heavily in steamboats and built a wharf , a school , and the area 's first hotel . In 1885 , a Maryland doctor declared the area to be the healthiest in the world which drew many investors and developers including F. A. Davis , who partnered with Disston 's brother , Jacob , in further developing the Pinellas peninsula , where Pinellas County was established . 
 In the mid @-@ 1880s , Russian developer Peter Demens was building the Orange Belt Railway across central Florida with a planned western terminus in the Tampa Bay area . On December 1 , 1886 , Disston offered Demens approximately 60 @,@ 000 acres ( 240 km2 ) of land to stretch his railroad to Disston City . Demens countered with a demand of an additional 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 200 km2 ) but Disston refused , mistakenly believing that Disston City would thrive if the railroad merely came close to the area . Instead Demens terminated his railway at St. Petersburg , which he named after Saint Petersburg , his home city in Russia . While Disston City never met Disston 's expectations and became the small city of Gulfport , St. Petersburg reaped the rewards of Demens 's railway and became one of the largest cities in Florida . 
 = = Disappointment = = 
 Disston 's success at draining peninsular Florida quickly turned to disappointment . The positive report of his drainage results in 1883 was followed by a dreadful report in 1887 . While it still credited Disston with draining parts of the upper Kissimmee valley , it credited a drought with drying the area north of Lake Okeechobee . Meanwhile , Lake Okeechobee — which typically rises and falls seasonally , and is affected by the frequent flooding and droughts associate with the Florida climate — was inundated despite Disston 's canals , and the only canal out of the lake that Disston actually completed resulted in the Caloosahatchee River flooding the surrounding area . Furthermore , Disston 's planned canals to the east and south out of Lake Okeechobee had not materialized . 
 The 1887 commission concluded that Disston had received 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 900 km2 ) which he had not earned . Disston , however , reached a compromise whereby he would keep land that he had been given in return for spending $ 200 @,@ 000 to improve drainage including improving the flow of the canals he had already dug . In total , he dug over 80 miles ( 130 km ) of canals and received 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 500 km2 ) of land under the terms of his first drainage contract of January 1881 . Although he never finished his canal plans for Lake Okeechobee , and the Everglades remained relatively unaffected by the structures intended to drain them , he was formally credited with reclaiming large portions of land and generally improving the drainage of peninsular Florida . 
 Regardless of the lack of success in Disston 's canals , the money he paid to the Internal Improvement Fund allowed other industrialists to take an interest in the development of Florida . In the early 1880s , railroad tycoon Henry Morrison Flagler spent a vacation in the town of St. Augustine , a brief distance south of Jacksonville , and , enchanted with it , decided to build an opulent hotel there . He extended the rail line — renaming it the Jacksonville , St. Augustine & Indian River Railway — to Daytona Beach , and then to Palm Beach . As the railroad was built , citrus farms followed , and Flagler constructed hotels down the east coast , envisioning a version of the French Riviera in Florida . A friendly competition developed between Flagler and another railroad magnate named Henry Bradley Plant . While Flagler oversaw the construction of rail lines and hotels along the east coast , Plant concentrated on extending the railroad from Sanford to Tampa , crossing the state and connecting the coasts . At the terminus of this line he built the exquisite Tampa Bay Hotel , opened in 1891 . 
 = = Death = = 
 Disston himself continued living in Disston City until more bad fortune prompted his return to Philadelphia . The financial Panic of 1893 , the Wilson @-@ Gorman Tariff Act of 1894 and two devastating freezes ( see Great Freeze for details ) caused financial difficulties and he mortgaged his Florida assets for $ 2 million . 
 On April 30 , 1896 , Disston had dinner with the mayor of Philadelphia and attended a theatre production with his wife in Philadelphia . The following morning , he was found dead at age 51 . Although some claim that Disston committed suicide in his bathtub with a self @-@ inflicted gunshot to the head , almost every obituary , as well as the official coroner 's report , stated that he died of heart disease in bed . The New York Times further reported that , several months before his death , Disston suffered from a bout of typhoid pneumonia . 
 He was poignantly mourned in Philadelphia as a benevolent employer of over 3 @,@ 000 and a rare businessman who treated his employees exceptionally well . The Chicago Tribune wrote that he was " peculiar in his ideas . His hand was always in his pocket and his influence always for his less successful fellow @-@ men to whom he took a fancy . " He was reported in 1889 to give $ 17 @,@ 000 in Christmas gifts to his employees . His philanthropy branched out in other areas as well . In 1882 he sponsored the immigration of approximately 40 or 50 Russian Jewish families and purchased homes for them , assuring they would settle in Pennsylvania . 
 At the time of his death , Disston 's estate was valued at $ 100 @,@ 000 but he also carried a $ 1 million life insurance policy , the second largest in the United States . His family had no interest in Florida and creditors foreclosed on his Florida mortgage four years after his death . Henry Flagler 's railroad reached a settlement of a little more than 500 people named Miami the year Disston died .

 Northumberland Avenue is a street in the City of Westminster , Central London , running from Trafalgar Square in the west to the Thames Embankment in the east . The road was built on the site of Northumberland House , the London home of the Percy family , the Dukes of Northumberland between 1874 and 1876 , and on part of the parallel Northumberland Street . 
 When built , the street was designed for luxury accommodation , including the seven @-@ storey Grand Hotel , the Victoria and the Metropole . The Playhouse Theatre opened in 1882 and become a significant venue in London . From the 1930s onwards , hotels disappeared from Northumberland Avenue and were replaced by offices used by departments of the British Government , including the War Office and Air Ministry , later the Ministry of Defence . The street has been commemorated in the Sherlock Holmes novels including The Hound of the Baskervilles , and is a square on the British Monopoly board .

 The area which is now occupied by Northumberland Avenue was originally called Hartshorn Lane . It was formed around 1491 after the Abbott of Westminster granted land to the grocer , Thomas Walker , including an inn known as the Christopher and stables . The land was sold to Humfrey Cooke in 1516 , then to John Russell in 1531 . In 1546 , it was sold back to Henry VIII . 
 In 1608 – 09 , Henry Howard , 1st Earl of Northampton built a house on the eastern side of the former Chapel and Hospital of St. Mary <unk> , at Charing Cross , including gardens running to the River Thames and adjoining Scotland Yard to the west . The estate became the property of Algernon Percy , 10th Earl of Northumberland when he married Howard 's great @-@ great niece , Lady Elizabeth , in 1642 , whereupon it was known as Northumberland House . In turn , the street was named Northumberland Street . The house was damaged in the Wilkes ' election riots of 1768 , but was saved after its owner , Hugh Percy , 1st Duke of Northumberland opened the nearby Ship Ale House , driving off rioters . 
 By the 18th century , Northumberland Street was primarily used as a thoroughfare between markets in the West End of London and the wharfs along the Thames . In 1720 , historian John Strype wrote that Northumberland Street was " much clogged and pestered with Carts repairing to the <unk> " . 
 In June 1874 , the whole of Northumberland House was purchased by the Metropolitan Board of Works and demolished to form Northumberland Avenue , which would accommodate hotels . Contemporary planning permissions forbade hotels to be taller than the width of the road they were on ; consequently Northumberland Avenue was built with a wide carriageway . Part of the parallel Northumberland Street was demolished in order to make way for the avenue 's eastern end . The street was open by 1876 . The hotels were popular for American visitors as they were near to the West End , government buildings on Whitehall and all the mainline stations . 
 By the 1930s , accommodation on Park Lane and Piccadilly was more popular , leading to closures on Northumberland Avenue . The seven floor Grand Hotel at No. 8 became a retail headquarters . It is now an events venue for corporations including Marks & Spencer . The venue is the first in Europe to install amBX lighting .

 Several British government departments have been located in buildings on Northumberland Avenue ; the Ministry of Defence and the Air Ministry formerly occupied the triangular @-@ shaped Hotel Metropole on the street . Other buildings include the Nigerian High Commission at No. 9 and a London School of Economics halls of residence . 
 The Playhouse Theatre on Northumberland Avenue was built by Sefton Parry and opened in 1882 as the Avenue Theatre . George Alexander produced his first play here . In 1905 , the theatre was destroyed after part of Charing Cross Station fell on it , and was rebuilt two years later . Alec Guinness first performed on stage at the theatre . It was used for BBC broadcasts from 1951 to 1975 , broadcasting radio comedies such as The Goon Show and several sessions by the Beatles . 
 The Grand Hotel was built between 1882 and 1887 . It had seven floors , 500 rooms and a large ballroom which has largely survived intact from its original design . The original reception room was renamed the Mayflower Room in 1923 , and is now called the Salon . Unlike other hotels on Northumberland Avenue that were taken over by the War Office , the Grand has survived as an entertainment and exhibition venue . 
 The Hotel Metropole was designed by Frederick Gordon and constructed between 1883 and 1885 . Prince Albert , later King Edward VII , was a regular visitor to the hotel , entertaining guests in its Royal Suite . It had become one of the most popular hotels in London by the turn of the 20th century , being described by the War Office in 1914 as " of world @-@ wide reputation " , and was the original location of the Aero Club and Alpine Club . In 1936 , it was leased to the Government for £ 300 @,@ 000 ( now £ 18 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 ) to provide temporary accommodation for various departments . During World War II , room 424 was used as the headquarters of MI9 , the principal section of military intelligence supporting Allied prisoners of war . The hotel continued to be operated as a government building after the war , and began to be used by the Air Ministry in 1951 . 
 The Hotel Victoria opened in 1887 , its name commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria held that year . It held 500 bedrooms and was the second largest hotel in London of its type on opening , overrunning its budget by around £ 520 @,@ 000 ( now £ 44 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 ) . The hotel was self @-@ powered , generating its own electricity from dynamos . It was bought by Frederick Gordon in 1893 , giving him a monopoly on all hotels on Northumberland Avenue . A refurbishment was started in 1911 , though delayed due to the First World War , which resulted in a new annexe , the Edward VII Rooms . It closed in 1940 and was used by the War Office in need of extra accommodation . The War Office bought the building outright in 1951 , renaming it the Victoria Buildings . It was subsequently renamed Northumberland House . 
 Thomas Edison 's British headquarters , Edison House , was situated on the road . Several prominent personalities of the late 19th century had their voices recorded there by phonograph , including Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and poet Robert Browning . Mary Helen Ferguson , the first English female audio typist , worked at Edison House and supervised all musical recordings . In 1890 , retired military trumpeter Martin <unk> recorded at Edison House using a bugle he believed to have been sounded at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854 . 
 The Royal Commonwealth Society is at No. 18 Northumberland Avenue . It was founded in 1868 as the Colonial Society to improve relationships with colonies in the British Empire including Canada and Australia , and moved to its current premises in 1885 . The current name dates from 1958 , reflecting the change from the Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations . The Commonwealth Club opened on the premises in 1998 and features the only suspended glass dining room in London . The Royal African Society was based at the same location , before moving to the School of Oriental and African Studies in Russell Square .

 Northumberland Avenue is referenced several times in Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes novels , including The Greek Interpreter and The Hound of the Baskervilles . The stories refer to wealthy Oriental visitors staying in hotels along the avenue , including the Grand , the Metropole and the Victoria . The Northumberland Arms , at the junction of Northumberland Street and Northumberland Avenue , a public house , was renamed the Sherlock Holmes in 1957 , and contains numerous Holmes @-@ related exhibits from the 1951 Festival of London . 
 The street is part of a group of three on the London Monopoly board , with Pall Mall and Whitehall . All three streets connect at Trafalgar Square . 
 Northumberland Avenue formed part of the marathon course of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games . The women 's Olympic marathon took place on 5 August and the men 's Olympic marathon on 12 August , with the Paralympics following on 9 September . 
 = Minecraft = 
 Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Swedish programmer Markus " Notch " Persson and later developed and published by Mojang . The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world . Other activities in the game include exploration , resource gathering , crafting , and combat . Multiple gameplay modes are available , including survival mode where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health , a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly , an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players , and a spectator mode where players can fly around and clip through blocks , but cannot place or destroy any . The PC version of the game is renowned for its third @-@ party mods , which add various new items , characters , worlds , and quests to the game . 
 Minecraft received five awards during the 2011 Game Developers Conference . Of the Game Developers Choice Awards , it won the Innovation Award , Best Downloadable Game Award , and Best Debut Game Award ; from the Independent Games Festival , it won the Audience Award and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize . In 2012 , Minecraft was awarded a Golden Joystick Award in the category Best Downloadable Game . As of June 2016 , over 106 million copies had been sold , with more than 40 million unique Minecraft players each month across all the various platforms the game is available on making it the best @-@ selling PC game to date and the second best @-@ selling video game of all time behind Tetris . On 15 September 2014 , Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US $ 2 @.@ 5 billion ; the acquisition was completed on 6 November 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Minecraft is an open world game that has no specific goals for the player to accomplish , allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game . However , there is an achievement system . Gameplay by default is first person , but players have the option to play in third person mode . The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks . The game world is composed of rough 3D objects — mainly cubes — arranged in a fixed grid pattern and representing different materials , such as dirt , stone , various ores , water , lava , tree trunks , etc . While players can move freely across the world , objects can only be placed at fixed locations on the grid . Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere , thus allowing for various constructions . 
 At the start of the game , the player is placed on the surface of a procedurally generated and virtually infinite game world . The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields . Players can walk across the terrain consisting of plains , mountains , forests , caves , and various water bodies . The in @-@ game time system follows a day and night cycle , with one full cycle lasting 20 real @-@ time minutes . Throughout the course of the game , players encounter various non @-@ player characters known as mobs , including animals , villagers and hostile creatures . Non @-@ hostile animals — such as cows , pigs , and chickens — can be hunted for food and crafting materials , and spawn in the daytime . By contrast , hostile mobs — such as large spiders , skeletons , and zombies — spawn during nighttime or in dark places , such as caves . Some Minecraft @-@ unique creatures have been noted by reviewers , such as the Creeper , an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player ; and the <unk> , a creature with the ability to teleport and pick up blocks . 
 The game world is procedurally generated as players explore it , using a map seed which is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation unless manually specified by the player . Although there are limits on movement up and down , Minecraft allows for an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane , only running into technical problems when extremely distant locations are reached . The game achieves this by splitting the game world data into smaller sections called " chunks " , which are only created or loaded into memory when players are nearby . 
 The game 's physics system has often been described by commentators as unrealistic . Most solid blocks are not affected by gravity . Liquids flow from a source block , which can be removed by placing a solid block in its place , or by scooping it into a bucket . Complex systems can be built using primitive mechanical devices , electrical circuits , and logic gates built with an in @-@ game material known as <unk> . 
 Minecraft features two alternate dimensions besides the main world — the Nether and the End . The Nether is a hell @-@ like dimension accessed via player @-@ built portals that contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the overworld . The End is a barren land in which a boss dragon called the Ender Dragon dwells . Killing the dragon cues the game 's ending credits , written by Irish author Julian Gough . Players are then allowed to teleport back to their original spawn point in the overworld , and will receive " The End " achievement . There is also a second boss called " The Wither " , which upon defeat drops a specific material needed to build a <unk> beacon that can enhance certain abilities of all nearby players . 
 The game primarily consists of four game modes : survival , creative , adventure , and spectator . It also has a changeable difficulty system of four levels ; the easiest difficulty ( peaceful ) prevents hostile creatures from spawning . 
 = = = Survival mode = = = 
 In this mode , players have to gather natural resources ( such as wood and stone ) found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items . Depending on the difficulty , monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character , requiring the player to build a shelter at night . The mode also features a health bar which is depleted by attacks from monsters , falls , drowning , falling into lava , suffocation , starvation , and other events . Players also have a hunger bar , which must be periodically refilled by eating food in @-@ game , except in " Peaceful " difficulty , in which the hunger bar does not drain . If the hunger bar is depleted , automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete . Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar , and also regenerates regardless of fullness if players play on the " Peaceful " difficulty . 
 There are a wide variety of items that players can craft in Minecraft . Players can craft armour , which can help mitigate damage from attacks , while weapons such as swords can be crafted to kill enemies and other animals more easily . Players may acquire resources to craft tools , such as axes , shovels , or pickaxes , used to chop down trees , dig soil , and mine ores , respectively ; tools made of iron perform their tasks more quickly than tools made of stone or wood and can be used more heavily before they break . Players may also trade goods with villager mobs through a bartering system involving trading emeralds for different goods . Villagers often trade with emeralds , wheat or other materials . 
 The game has an inventory system , and players can carry a limited number of items . Upon dying , items in the players ' inventories are dropped , and players re @-@ spawn at the current spawn point , which is set by default where players begin the game , but can be reset if players sleep in a bed . Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they <unk> . Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players , mining , smelting ores , breeding animals , and cooking food . Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools , armour and weapons . Enchanted items are generally more powerful , last longer , or have other special effects . 
 = = = Hardcore mode = = = 
 Players may also play in hardcore mode , this being a variant of survival mode that differs primarily in the game being locked to the hardest gameplay setting as well as featuring permanent death ; upon players ' death , their world is deleted . When a player dies on a server set to hardcore mode , the player is banned from that server . 
 = = = Creative mode = = = 
 In creative mode , players have access to all of the resources and items in the game through the inventory menu , and can place or remove them instantly . Players , who are able to fly freely around the game world , do not take environmental or mob damage , and are not affected by hunger . The game mode helps players focus on building and creating large projects . 
 = = = Adventure mode = = = 
 Adventure mode was added to Minecraft in version 1 @.@ 3 ; it was designed specifically so that players could experience user crafted custom maps and adventures . Gameplay is similar to survival mode but introduces various player restrictions , which can be applied to the game world by the creator of the map . This is so that players can obtain the required items and experience adventures in the way that the mapmaker intended . Another addition designed for custom maps is the command block ; this block allows mapmakers to expand interactions with players through certain server commands . 
 = = = Spectator mode = = = 
 Spectator mode allows players to fly around through blocks and watch gameplay without interacting . In this mode , the <unk> becomes a menu that allows the player to teleport to players in the world . It is also possible to view from the point of view of another player or creature . Some things may look different from another creature 's point of view . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Multiplayer on Minecraft is available through player @-@ hosted and business @-@ hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world . Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider . Single @-@ player worlds have local area network support , allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup . Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators , who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players around . Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed to enter the server . Multiplayer servers offer players a wide range of activities , with some servers having their own unique rules and customs . Player versus player ( PvP ) can also be enabled to allow fighting between players . Many servers today have custom plugins that enable the player and the server to do many different things that are not normally possible . In 2013 , Mojang announced Minecraft Realms , a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without the hassle of setting up their own . Realms varies from a standard server in that only invited players can join the server , and that they do not use a server IP . Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their realm ; however , the server can only have ten people online at a time , and does not support user @-@ made plugins . At announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 , Realms will enable Minecraft to support cross @-@ platform play between Windows 10 , iOS , and Android versions starting in June 2016 , with Xbox One support to come later in 2016 and eventually support for virtual reality devices . 
 = = Development = = 
 Markus " Notch " Persson began developing the game as a project . He was inspired to create Minecraft by several other games such as Dwarf Fortress , Dungeon Keeper , and later Infiniminer . At the time , he had visualised an isometric 3D building game that would be a cross between his inspirations and had made some early prototypes . Infiniminer heavily influenced the style of gameplay , including the first @-@ person aspect of the game , the " blocky " visual style and the block @-@ building fundamentals . However , unlike Infiniminer , Persson wanted Minecraft to have RPG elements . 
 Minecraft was first released to the public on 17 May 2009 , as a developmental release on <unk> forums , later becoming known as the Classic version . Further milestones dubbed as Survival Test , <unk> and <unk> were released between September 2009 and February 2010 , although the game saw updates in @-@ between . The first major update , dubbed alpha version , was released on 28 June 2010 . Although Persson maintained a day job with <unk> at first , he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full @-@ time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded . Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically . These updates included features such as new items , new blocks , new mobs , survival mode , and changes to the game 's behaviour ( e.g. , how water flows ) . 
 To back the development of Minecraft , Persson set up a video game company , Mojang , with the money earned from the game . On 11 December 2010 , Persson announced that Minecraft was entering its beta testing phase on 20 December 2010 . He further stated that users who bought the game after this date would no longer be guaranteed to receive all future content free of charge as it " scared both the lawyers and the board . " However , bug fixes and all updates leading up to and including the release would still be free . Over the course of the development , Mojang hired several new employees to work on the project . 
 Mojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on 18 November 2011 . The game has been continuously updated since the release , with changes ranging from new game content to new server hosts . On 1 December 2011 , Jens " Jeb " <unk> took full creative control over Minecraft , replacing Persson as lead developer . On 28 February 2012 , Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular server platform " <unk> " to improve Minecraft 's support of server modifications . This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the <unk> modification , although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open @-@ source project with many contributors , licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License . On 15 September 2014 , Microsoft announced a $ 2 @.@ 5 billion deal to buy Mojang , along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property . The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for " trying to do the right thing . " It was completed on 6 November 2014 , and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes ' " World 's Billionaires " . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Minecraft 's music and sound effects were produced by German sound designer Daniel " <unk> " Rosenfeld . The background music in Minecraft is non @-@ lyrical ambient music . On 4 March 2011 , Rosenfeld released a soundtrack , titled Minecraft – Volume Alpha ; it includes most of the tracks featured in Minecraft , as well as other music not featured in the game . The video game blog Kotaku chose the music in Minecraft as one of the best video game soundtracks of 2011 . On 9 November 2013 , Rosenfeld released the second official soundtrack , titled Minecraft – Volume Beta , which includes the music that was added in later versions of the game . A physical release of Volume Alpha , consisting of CDs , black vinyl , and limited @-@ edition transparent green vinyl LPs , was issued by acclaimed indie electronic label Ghostly International on 21 August 2015 .

 = = = Personal computer versions = = = 
 The PC was the original platform for Minecraft ; the game runs on multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows , OS X , and Linux . Apart from the main version , there are other versions of Minecraft available for PC , including Minecraft Classic and Minecraft 4k . 
 Minecraft Classic is an older version of Minecraft , available online for players . Unlike newer versions of Minecraft , the classic version is free to play , though it is no longer updated . It functions much the same as creative mode , allowing players to build and destroy any and all parts of the world either alone or in a multiplayer server . There are no computer creatures in this mode , and environmental hazards such as lava will not damage players . Some blocks function differently since their behaviour was later changed during development . 
 Minecraft 4k is a simplified version of Minecraft similar to the classic version that was developed for the Java 4K game programming contest " in way less than 4 kilobytes " . The map itself is finite — composed of 64 × 64 × 64 blocks — and the same world is generated every time . Players are restricted to placing or destroying blocks , which consist of grass , dirt , stone , wood , leaves , and brick . 
 Minecraft : Windows 10 Edition is a version exclusive to Microsoft 's Windows 10 operating system . The beta for it launched on the Windows Store on 29 July 2015 . This version features the ability to play with Xbox Live friends ( but not with those who have the Xbox One version ) , and to play local multiplayer with owners of the Pocket Edition . Other features include the ability to use multiple control schemes , such as a controller ( preferably an Xbox controller ) , keyboard , or touchscreen ( for Windows Phone and Microsoft Surface ) , and to record and take screenshots in @-@ game via the built @-@ in <unk> . 
 = = = Console versions = = = 
 The Xbox 360 version of the game , developed by 4J Studios , was released on 9 May 2012 . On 22 March 2012 , it was announced that Minecraft would be the flagship game in a new Xbox Live promotion called Arcade NEXT . The game differs from the home computer versions in a number of ways , including a newly designed crafting system , the control interface , in @-@ game tutorials , split @-@ screen multiplayer , and the ability to play with friends via Xbox Live . The version 's crafting interface does not require players to place items in the correct place in a crafting menu , however , this option was added in a later update . The interface shows the blocks required to craft the selected item , and crafts it if the players have enough blocks . The worlds in the Xbox 360 version are also not " infinite " , and are essentially barricaded by invisible walls . The Xbox 360 version was originally similar in content to older PC versions , but is being gradually updated to bring it closer to the current PC version . 
 At Gamescom 2013 , Sony announced that Minecraft would be released as a PlayStation 4 launch title , and would later be released as for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 . However , the game was later delayed and the PlayStation 4 version did not launch alongside the console . It was released on the PlayStation 3 on 17 December 2013 , on the PlayStation 4 on 4 September 2014 , and on the PlayStation Vita on 14 October 2014 in North America , and in Europe the next day . Like the Xbox versions , the PlayStation versions were developed by 4J Studios , and are nearly identical to the Xbox 360 version . 
 During their E3 2013 press conference Microsoft showed a trailer for Minecraft : Xbox One Edition . It is similar to Minecraft : Xbox 360 Edition but features larger worlds , expanded multiplayer features , and other enhancements . This version released on 5 September 2014 . 
 On 17 December 2015 , Minecraft : Wii U Edition was released . The Wii U version received a physical release on 17 June 2016 in North America , in Japan on 23 June 2016 , and in Europe on 30 June 2016 . 
 = = = Pocket Edition = = = 
 On 16 August 2011 , Minecraft : Pocket Edition was released for the Xperia Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version . It was then released for several other compatible devices on 8 October 2011 . An iOS version of Minecraft was released on 17 November 2011 , at the price of $ 6 @.@ 99 per download . 
 A port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft acquired Mojang . The port concentrates on the creative building and the primitive survival aspect of the game , and does not contain all the features of the PC release . On his Twitter account , Jens <unk> noted that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is written in C + + and not Java , due to iOS not being able to support Java . Gradual updates are periodically released to bring the port closer to the PC version . On 10 December 2014 , in observance of Mojang 's acquisition by Microsoft , a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8 @.@ 1 . 
 On 2 April 2014 , a version of Minecraft based on the Pocket Edition was released for the Amazon Fire . 
 Minecraft : Pocket Edition is currently at version 0 @.@ 15 @.@ 0 , with a Realms alpha test for Android users . 
 = = = Raspberry Pi = = = 
 A version of Minecraft for the Raspberry Pi was officially revealed at MineCon 2012 . Mojang stated that the Pi Edition is similar to the Pocket Edition except that it is downgraded to an older version , and with the added ability of using text commands to edit the game world . Players can open the game code and use programming language to manipulate things in the game world . The game was leaked on 20 December 2012 , but was quickly pulled off . It was officially released on 11 February 2013 . 
 = = = Virtual reality = = = 
 On 27 April 2016 , Mojang released version compatible with the Samsung Gear VR onto the Oculus store . 
 = = User @-@ generated and downloadable content = = 
 A wide variety of user @-@ generated content for Minecraft , such as modifications , texture packs and custom maps , are available for download from the Internet . Modifications of the Minecraft code , called " mods , " add a variety of gameplay changes , ranging from new blocks , new items , new mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms to craft . The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay , such as <unk> , waypoints , and durability counters , to ones that add to the game elements from Pokémon , Portal , and The Hunger Games . To make mods easier to create and install , Mojang announced in November 2012 that it plans to add an official modding API . As of 2015 , Mojang has yet to reveal more about their modding API . 
 Texture packs that customise the game 's graphics are also available . In version 1 @.@ 6 , texture packs were replaced with " resource packs " . These play the same role as texture packs , but allow custom sounds as well . Custom maps have become popular as well . Players can create their own maps , which often contain rules , challenges , puzzles and quests , and share them for others to play . In version 1 @.@ 3 , Mojang added adventure mode for custom maps and in 1 @.@ 4 , Mojang added command blocks , which were created specially for custom maps . Command blocks allow the player to put a command to do specific tasks . There are ' One @-@ Block Commands ' where a user uses only one command ( for command blocks ) to make a modification to the game . You can use a One @-@ Block Command by copying a One @-@ Block Command and then pasting it into a command block . Finally , you activate it with something called <unk> . In 1 @.@ 9 , Mojang added 2 new versions ( Repeat , and Chain ) of the classic command block , which were also created specifically for custom maps . 
 The Xbox 360 Edition supports downloadable content , which is available to purchase via the Xbox Games Store ; these content packs usually contain additional character skins . It later received support for texture packs in its twelfth title update while introducing " mash @-@ up packs " , which combines texture packs with skin packs and changes to the game 's sounds , music and user interface . The first mash @-@ up pack ( and by extension , the first texture pack ) for the Xbox 360 Edition was released on 4 September 2013 , and is themed after the Mass Effect franchise . Unlike the PC version , however , the Xbox 360 Edition does not support player @-@ made mods or custom maps . On May 9 , 2016 , Mojang announced that a mash @-@ up pack based on the Super Mario franchise will be released on May 17 , 2016 exclusively for the Wii U Edition .

 On 12 January 2011 , Minecraft passed 1 million purchases less than a month after entering its beta phase . At the same time , the game had no publisher backing and has never been commercially advertised except through word of mouth , and various unpaid references in popular media such as the Penny Arcade webcomic . By April 2011 , Persson estimated that Minecraft had made € 23 million ( US $ 33 million ) in revenue , with 800 @,@ 000 sales of the alpha version of the game , and over 1 million sales of the beta version . In November 2011 , prior to the game 's full release , Minecraft beta surpassed 16 million registered users and 4 million purchases . By March 2012 , Minecraft had become the 6th best @-@ selling PC game of all time . As of 10 October 2014 , the game has sold 17 million copies on PC , becoming the best @-@ selling PC game of all time . As of 10 October 2014 , the game has sold approximately 60 million copies across all platforms , making it one of the best @-@ selling video games of all time . On 25 February 2014 , the game reached 100 million registered <unk> of June 2016 , over 106 million copies had been sold , making it the best @-@ selling PC game to date and the second best @-@ selling video game of all time behind Tetris . 
 The Xbox 360 version of Minecraft became profitable within the first 24 hours of the game 's release in 2012 , when the game broke the Xbox Live sales records with 400 @,@ 000 players online . Within a week of being on the Xbox Live Marketplace , Minecraft sold upwards of 1 million copies . GameSpot announced in December 2012 that Minecraft sold over 4 @.@ 48 million copies since the game debuted on Xbox Live Arcade in May 2012 . In 2012 , Minecraft was the most purchased title on Xbox Live Arcade ; it was also the fourth most played title on Xbox Live based on average unique users per day . As of 4 April 2014 , the Xbox 360 version has sold 12 million copies . In addition , Minecraft : Pocket Edition has reached a figure of 21 million in sales . The PlayStation 3 version sold one million copies in five weeks . The release of the game 's PlayStation Vita version boosted Minecraft sales by 79 % , outselling both PS3 and PS4 debut releases and becoming the largest Minecraft launch on a PlayStation console . The PS Vita version sold 100 @,@ 000 digital copies in Japan within the first two months of release , according to an announcement by SCE Japan Asia . By January 2015 , 500 @,@ 000 digital copies of Minecraft were sold in Japan across all PlayStation platforms , with a surge in primary school children purchasing the PS Vita version .

 In January 2016 , Microsoft announced a new tool for education , called Minecraft : Education Edition or MinecraftEDU , planned to be released in 2016 . Minecraft has already been used in classrooms around the world to teach subjects ranging from core STEM topics to arts and poetry . Minecraft : Education Edition will be designed specifically for classroom use . The Education Edition gives teachers the tools they need to use Minecraft on an everyday basis . 
 There are few differences between Minecraft and MinecraftEDU . The main concept is the same , an open sandbox world . The student ’ s characters in MinecraftEDU will be able to retain characteristics . Students will also be able to download the game at home , without having to buy their own version of the game . Finally the last large difference is that students can take in @-@ game photos . These photos will be stored in an online notebook with the students online notes . These online notebooks will be <unk> with other students .

 A Lego set based on Minecraft called Lego Minecraft was released on 6 June 2012 . The set , called " Micro World " , centres around the game 's default player character and a Creeper . Mojang submitted the concept of Minecraft merchandise to Lego in December 2011 for the Lego <unk> program , from which it quickly received 10 @,@ 000 votes by users , prompting Lego to review the concept . Lego <unk> approved the concept in January 2012 and began developing sets based on Minecraft . Two more sets based on the Nether and village areas of the game were released on 1 September 2013 . A fourth Micro World set , the End , was released in June 2014 . Six more sets will be available November 2014 . 
 Mojang collaborates with Jinx , an online game merchandise store , to sell Minecraft merchandise , such as clothing , foam pickaxes , and toys of creatures in the game . By May 2012 , over 1 million dollars were made from Minecraft merchandise sales . T @-@ shirts and socks were the most popular products . In March 2013 Mojang signed a deal with the Egmont Group , a children 's book publisher , to create Minecraft handbooks , annuals , poster books , and magazines . 
 = = Popular culture and social media = = 
 Social media sites such as YouTube , Facebook , and Reddit played a significant role in popularising Minecraft . Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania 's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one @-@ third of Minecraft players learned about the game via Internet videos . In 2010 , Minecraft @-@ related videos began to gain affluence on YouTube , often made by commentators . The videos usually contain screen @-@ capture footage of the game and voice @-@ overs . Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players , walkthroughs of various tasks , and parodies of works in popular culture . By May 2012 , over 4 million Minecraft @-@ related YouTube videos had been uploaded . Some popular commentators have received employment at Machinima , a gaming video company that owns a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube . The Yogscast is a British organisation that regularly produces Minecraft videos ; their YouTube channel has attained billions of views , and their panel at MineCon 2011 had the highest attendance . Other well known YouTube personnel include Jordan Maron , who has created many Minecraft parodies , including " Minecraft Style " , a parody of the internationally successful single " Gangnam Style " by South Korean rapper PSY . Herobrine is a major community icon of Minecraft , who first appeared as a single image on 4chan 's / v / board . According to rumours , Herobrine appears in players ' worlds and builds strange constructions . However , Mojang has confirmed that Herobrine has never existed in Minecraft , and there are no plans to add Herobrine . 
 Minecraft has been referenced by other video games , such as <unk> , Torchlight II , Borderlands 2 , Choplifter HD , Super Meat Boy , The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim , The Binding of Isaac , Team Fortress 2 , and FTL : Faster Than Light . It was also referenced by musician deadmau5 in his performances . A simulation of the game was featured in Lady Gaga 's " G.U.Y. " music video , along with the command " / <unk> ARTPOP " . After the release of Minecraft , some video games were released with various similarities with Minecraft , and some have been called " clones " of the game . There have been a few Minecraft @-@ like and Minecraft @-@ inspired games across various gaming platforms since the game became popular . Examples include Ace of Spades , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Total Miner . David Frampton , designer of The <unk> , reported that one failure of his 2D game was the " low resolution pixel art " that too closely resembled the art in Minecraft which resulted in " some resistance " from fans . 
 Additionally , in response to Microsoft 's acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP , various developers suddenly announced even further clone titles that are being developed specifically for Nintendo 's consoles , as they were the only major platforms to not officially receive Minecraft at the time , despite early rumours that the game was in development for the Wii U. These clone titles are either in development for Wii U , such as <unk> ( Nexis Games ) , Cube Life : Island Survival ( <unk> ) , and Discovery ( <unk> ) , the Nintendo 3DS , such as <unk> ( Wobbly Tooth Games ) and Cube Creator 3D ( Big John Games ) , or for both Wii U and Nintendo 3DS , such as Stone Shire ( Finger Gun Games ) . In an interview Kotaku had with Shigeru Miyamoto and Shinya Takahashi in regards to Minecraft coming to Nintendo 's platforms , Miyamoto stated that the Wii U GamePad is a " good fit " for the title , and Nintendo could have popularised the game in Japan . In a July 2015 interview with Mojang COO Vu Bui , it was revealed that the company is still interested in releasing the game on more platforms , including Nintendo 's , and declared that even Microsoft 's acquisition would not hinder that prospect . According to Bui , he has " never heard a reason why [ they ] haven 't ended up on Wii U or 3DS . It just hasn 't happened yet . " In August 2015 , Telltale Games confirmed to The Verge that the spin @-@ off title Minecraft : Story Mode is coming to Wii U , making it the first game in the franchise on a Nintendo console . A Wii U version of Minecraft was announced on 7 December 2015 . It was released on 17 December 2015 . 
 In 2012 , Mojang received offers from Hollywood producers who want to produce Minecraft @-@ related TV shows ; however , Mojang stated that they would engage in such projects when " the right idea comes along . " A documentary about the development of Mojang and Minecraft was released in December 2012 . Titled Minecraft : The Story of Mojang , the film was produced by 2 Player Productions . The second episode of the seventeenth season of the animated television series South Park titled " Informative Murder Porn " , features the boys distracting their parents from fighting each other with Minecraft . In the South Park episode , gruff character Corey <unk> explained the Minecraft game by noting , " Minecraft , it don 't got no winner , it don 't got no objective . You 're just f * * * * in ' <unk> ' s * * * ! " On 27 February 2014 , Notch revealed that Mojang is in talks with Warner Bros. regarding a Minecraft film to be produced by Roy Lee and Jill Messick . On 8 October 2014 , Mojang COO Vu Bui stated that the movie was " in its early days of development " , saying that it was a " large @-@ budget " production , and also said that it might not be released until 2018 . On 16 October 2014 , the studio announced that it had hired Shawn Levy to direct the film . In July 2015 , it was announced the studio had hired Rob <unk> to direct the film . The studio announced that the film will be released on May 24 , 2019 . 
 = = Applications = = 
 The possible applications of Minecraft have been discussed extensively , especially in the fields of computer @-@ aided design and education . In a panel at MineCon 2011 , a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks , stating that rendering using Minecraft was much more user @-@ friendly for the community , making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks . In 2012 , a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab , Cody Sumter , said that " Notch hasn 't just built a game . He 's tricked 40 million people into learning to use a CAD program . " Various software has been developed to allow virtual designs to be printed using professional 3D printers or personal printers such as <unk> and <unk> . 
 In September 2012 , Mojang began the Block By Block project in cooperation with UN Habitat to create real @-@ world environments in Minecraft . The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see . Using Minecraft , the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern , and citizens are invited to enter the Minecraft servers and modify their own neighbourhood . Carl <unk> , Mojang 's managing director , called the game " the perfect tool to facilitate this process , " adding that " the three @-@ year partnership will support UN @-@ Habitat 's Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016 . " Mojang signed Minecraft building community , <unk> , to help render the environments into Minecraft . The first pilot project began in Kibera , one of Nairobi 's informal settlements , and is in the planning phase . The Block By Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011 , Mina Kvarter ( My Block ) , which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualise how they wanted to change their part of town . According to <unk> , the project was a helpful way to visualise urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture . The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions . 
 In April 2014 the Danish <unk> Agency generated all of Denmark in a scale of 1 : 1 in Minecraft based on their own free <unk> . This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at 171 meters ( ranking as the country with the 30th smallest elevation span ) where the limit in default Minecraft is about 192 meters above in @-@ game sea level . 
 Minecraft has also been used in educational settings . In 2011 , an educational organisation named <unk> was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools . The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools . In September 2012 , <unk> said that approximately 250 @,@ 000 students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company . A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects , including history , language arts and science . For an example , one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore . 
 In September 2014 , the British Museum in London announced plans to recreate its building along with all exhibits in Minecraft in conjunction with members of the public . 
 = David Lovering = 
 David Lovering ( born December 6 , 1961 ) is an American musician and magician . He is best known as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies , which he joined in 1986 . After the band 's breakup in 1993 , Lovering drummed with several other acts , including The Martinis , Cracker , Nitzer Ebb and Tanya Donelly . He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist ; performing scientific and physics @-@ based experiments on stage . When the Pixies reunited in 2004 , Lovering returned as the band 's drummer . 
 As a drummer Lovering was inspired by bands from a variety of genres , including Rush and Steely Dan . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Youth and college = = = 
 David Lovering was born in Burlington , Massachusetts . He learned to play drums during his teenage years and joined his high school 's marching band . According to his friend John Murphy , Lovering was always very " drum oriented " in his musical taste . In his high school yearbook entry , Lovering stated his three main ambitions : to be in a rock band , to be an electrical engineer , and to tour with Rush , his favorite band . After graduating from high school , Lovering studied electronic engineering at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston . He got a job at a Radio Shack store with Murphy , and the pair often played practical jokes while at work . One such incident involved Lovering wiring the store toilet to a fire alarm . After graduating from Wentworth with a bachelor 's degree in 1982 , he took a job building lasers , and continued to drum in local bands such as Iz Wizard and Riff Raff . A number of different genres of music have influenced him , including bands Steely Dan , Led Zeppelin , and Devo . 
 = = = Pixies = = = 
 On Memorial Day 1985 , Lovering attended Murphy and Kim Deal 's wedding service . In January 1986 Deal was hired to play bass in the newly formed Pixies , an alternative rock band formed by Charles " Black Francis " Thompson and Joey Santiago . Murphy suggested that Lovering audition for the band – who were still without a drummer . Lovering had stopped drumming by this point and was at first unimpressed by the trio 's performance of the band 's songs . However , after playing along he agreed to join . Lovering and the band wrote and rehearsed material throughout 1985 and 1986 and performed at small venues in Boston . The band decided to record 18 songs for a demo tape in 1987 . Lovering co @-@ wrote one of the tape 's songs , " Levitate Me " ( his only major writing contribution to any Pixies song ) and appeared on the cassette 's front cover , jogging naked with his back turned to the camera . " Levitate Me " later appeared on the band 's first release Come on Pilgrim , which included seven other songs taken from the demo tape . 
 The Pixies entered the studio again in 1988 to record their second album Surfer Rosa . Lovering 's contribution on songs such as " Bone Machine " – which begins with a 10 @-@ second drum solo – " Break My Body " and " River Euphrates " established his steady , accurate style . Doolittle , the band 's major label debut , followed in 1989 . During the album 's recording sessions , Thompson convinced Lovering to sing on " La La Love You " , which had been written as a " dig at the very idea of a love song " . The album 's producer Gil Norton later said that during the sessions Lovering " went from not wanting to sing a note to ' I can 't get him away from the microphone ' . He was such a showman " . In addition to drums and vocals , Lovering played bass guitar on the album 's penultimate track , " Silver " . 
 After the release of Doolittle , the relationship between the band members became strained because of constant touring and the pressure of releasing three albums in two years . After the final date of the Doolittle " Fuck or Fight " tour in November 1989 , the band was too exhausted to attend their end @-@ of @-@ tour party the following night and shortly afterwards announced a hiatus . After the band reconvened in mid @-@ 1990 , Lovering moved to Los Angeles along with the rest of the band . The Pixies released two more albums , Bossanova ( 1990 ) and Trompe le Monde ( 1991 ) . Lovering sang lead vocals on the " Velouria " B @-@ side " Make Believe " ; a song about his admitted " obsession " with US singer @-@ songwriter Debbie Gibson . The Pixies toured sporadically throughout 1991 and 1992 . They eventually broke up in 1992 , mostly due to tensions between Thompson and Deal , although it was not publicly announced until 1993 . 
 = = = The Scientific Phenomenalist and other projects = = = 
 Following the Pixies ' breakup , Lovering drummed with several artists , including Nitzer Ebb , but turned down an invitation to join the Foo Fighters . Lovering then joined Santiago 's band The Martinis , appearing on their song " Free " on the soundtrack of Empire Records . However , he soon left the band to become a touring drummer for Cracker . Lovering moved from band to band , drumming with Tanya Donelly 's group on 1997 's <unk> for Underdogs and with Boston band <unk> <unk> . After facing difficulty finding new work , Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming . 
 Towards the end of the 1990s , Lovering 's friend Grant @-@ Lee Phillips took him to a magic convention . Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions , and later said " I had to learn how to do it " . Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle , a magic @-@ oriented nightclub in Los Angeles . There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob <unk> , and the pair soon became friends . <unk> convinced Lovering to apply for a performers ' membership to the Magic Castle . After gaining his membership , Lovering reinvented himself as " The Scientific Phenomenalist " . His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience . His decision to pursue a career in magic was influenced by the fact that as a musician , he " couldn 't top the Pixies " . 
 As the Scientific <unk> , Lovering performs science and physics experiments in a lab coat while on stage . He shuns traditional magic tricks , and prefers " things that are more mental , using mental powers " . He later explained : " It 's all kind of upbeat , really weird physics experiments that you 'll never see . [ ... ] I 'd rather have them [ the audience ] going ' Is it [ magic ] or isn 't it ? ' rather than ' It 's all science ' or ' It 's all magic ' . So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don 't do " . Lovering cites sleight @-@ of @-@ hand artist Ricky Jay , mind reader Max Maven and Eugene Burger as influences on his technique . His performances often involve intricate self @-@ built machines . 
 Lovering became part of The Unholy Three , a trio of magicians that resides at the Magic Castle , and performs " a new wave , alternative , avant @-@ garde kind of magic " . He toured his act across the United States as the opener for Frank Black ( the new stage name of former Pixies band @-@ mate Thompson ) , Grant @-@ Lee Phillips , The Breeders and Camper Van Beethoven . He performed his act at the Shellac @-@ curated All Tomorrow 's Parties music festival in 2002 . He later commented that his performance at the festival was " perhaps my greatest achievement " . Lovering resumed drumming , appearing at some Frank Black and the Catholics shows . He also appeared on one track of The Martinis ' 2004 album The Smitten Sessions . 
 = = = Pixies reunion = = = 
 By the summer of 2003 , Lovering was feeling depressed . In a 2004 interview , he commented : " I remember I was on the way to the bank , and I was just bummed out — everything , financially , was really a mess for me . I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible . I was bottoming out . And I 'm on the way to the bank and my cellphone rings . It 's Joe [ Santiago ] ; he says , ' Guess what ? ' " Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies . Lovering was overjoyed at the news . He added that " the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies , I couldn 't believe that I had given up something that I loved " . In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single , " Bam Thwok " . 
 Lovering appeared in the 2006 documentary <unk> , which covered the Pixies ' 2004 reunion tour . His father died midway during the tour , and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result . According to Thompson , Lovering " messed up a couple of songs " during a number of live shows . " It was all caught on film " , said Thompson , " but they re @-@ edited this to look like it happened in the middle of our tour and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David . It really wasn 't like that at all " . He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006 , while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three . In 2007 , Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis . Later that year , he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , with Los Angeles musicians Amit <unk> and Oscar Rey .

 = Robert de Bethune = 
 Robert de Bethune ( sometimes Robert de <unk> , or Robert de Béthune , or Robert of Bethune ; died 1148 ) was a medieval Bishop of Hereford . The son of a knight , he became a teacher before becoming a canon , a type of monk , by 1115 . He was elected prior of Llanthony Priory in the middle 1120s , and was named bishop by King Henry I of England in 1130 . As bishop , he was often appointed a judge by the papacy , and was known for the care he took of his diocese . 
 After Henry 's death in 1135 , Bethune first supported King Stephen , who seized the throne from Henry 's heiress the Empress Matilda , but when Matilda 's forces captured Stephen , Bethune switched sides to support Matilda . When Matilda did not secure the throne , Bethune once more switched back to supporting Stephen . Construction of Hereford Cathedral was completed under Bethune 's episcopate , and consecrated in 1142 and 1148 . Stephen appointed Bethune as one of the English bishops that the king allowed to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148 , and Bethune died there in April 1148 . A hagiography is the only surviving evidence of Bethune 's cathedral chapter 's attempts to promote him as a saint . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bethune was the youngest son of a knight , and was at first educated by his eldest brother , who was named <unk> and was a schoolmaster . Although the medieval chronicler Robert de Torigni describes Bethune as Flemish , Bethune 's medieval biographer , William <unk> says that he and Bethune grew up in neighbouring villages in Buckinghamshire . It thus is likely that Bethune was born near Wingrave , Buckinghamshire , to a family descended from Flemish settlers . He was a schoolmaster in England , teaching elementary subjects , before he went to study theology under William of Champeaux and Anselm of Laon . He was a canon of Llanthony Priory before 1115 , and was elected prior of that house in the middle 1120s . Before becoming prior , he was entrusted with establishing a cell of the priory at Weobley , which had been established by Hugh de Lacy shortly before Lacy 's death around 1115 . 
 = = Bishop of Hereford = = 
 The see of Hereford had been vacant since 1127 , and in 1130 , King Henry I of England took the advice of the local magnates and nominated Bethune to the see . Bethune 's diocesan bishop as prior , Urban , the Bishop of Llandaff , at first refused permission for Bethune 's elevation . However , the archbishop of Canterbury , William of Corbeil , advised that the matter be referred to the papacy . Pope Innocent II ordered that Bethune be allowed to accept the see of Hereford in 1131 . He was consecrated on 28 June 1131 at Rochester . In nominating Bethune , the king is said to have felt that he needed one " godly bishop " around . Most of Henry 's bishops were given their sees as rewards for royal service , and were not particularly noted for piety . 
 Bethune was known as a strict Augustinian canon , a priest living a monastic life but not a monk . Bethune was often appointed a judge delegate by the papacy to try cases and disputes , which had been referred back to England by the popes . The historian David Knowles said of Bethune that he was a man of wide outlook , with a great desire for reform . He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese . He also held synods in his diocese , including two during the first year of his episcopate . 
 = = Stephen 's reign = = 
 After the accession of King Stephen of England , Bethune supported Stephen and was often at his court . Stephen had seized the throne at King Henry 's death , depriving Henry 's surviving legitimate daughter and heiress , Matilda , of the throne . Matilda is usually known as the " Empress " because of her first marriage to the German Emperor Henry V , who died in 1125 . Bethune accompanied Thurstan , the Archbishop of York , when Thurstan secured a truce between Stephen and the King of Scots , David shortly after the Battle of the Standard in 1138 . When the Empress Matilda landed in England in September 1139 in pursuit of the throne , one of the local magnates of Hereford , Miles of Gloucester supported Matilda , while Bethune continued to support Stephen . Miles ' hostility drove Bethune from his diocese , and Miles was in control of Hereford in 1140 , leaving Bethune to perform his episcopal duties in Shropshire . During this time , Bethune assisted Theobald of Bec , the new Archbishop of Canterbury , in consecrating Maurice as Bishop of Bangor . Bethune had earlier persuaded the bishop @-@ elect to swear fealty to King Stephen , after Maurice had originally refused . Bethune 's standing as a bishop known for his piety and independence of the king helped persuade Maurice that the homage was canonical . 
 Sometime after Stephen was captured by the Empress ' forces in 1141 , Bethune switched sides , and he was with the Empress Matilda at Winchester on 4 March 1141 , when Matilda claimed the throne of England . He also was present at the council that proclaimed Matilda " lady of the English " shortly thereafter . His diocese of Hereford was in the center of the lands that Matilda controlled , and he was one of the few bishops who was often in Matilda 's court . However , Matilda was never crowned , being driven from London before her planned coronation could take place . One of her chief supporters was captured in late 1141 , and to secure his release , Matilda released Stephen from captivity , thus prolonging the conflict . Between 1142 and 1148 , England was in a state of civil war , with parts of the country supporting Matilda and parts supporting Stephen . 
 Welsh raids at the beginning of Stephen 's reign had driven Bethune 's former canons from Llanthony and the bishop gave them refuge at Hereford before establishing them at a new site near Gloucester . The land the canons were settled on had belonged to the diocese , and this led Bethune into conflict with his cathedral chapter , led by their dean , Ralph . Bethune was forced to travel to Pisa to secure an order from Innocent II declaring that the chapter obey their bishop . 
 Around 1142 , Bethune was involved with a conflict with Miles of Gloucester , who was now the Earl of Hereford , which led to the bishop <unk> Miles and all the inhabitants of the city of Hereford , and " had the doors of the church blocked with thorns and the crosses taken down and placed on the ground " . This dispute arose over an attempt by Miles to tax the churches in his earldom , which Bethune regarded as unlawful . Miles died in 1143 which ended the dispute over the taxes . Also after his death Bethune was free to leave Empress ' faction and thus returned to supporting Stephen . In 1142 , Hereford Cathedral , which had begun under Robert de Losinga around 1079 , was finally ready for consecration . The work was finally completed in 1148 , and it was once consecrated in that year . The year 1148 also saw the departure of Matilda from England , as her support had dwindled over the previous few years and Stephen was able to secure control of most of England . He was never able to completely remove Matilda 's supporters , however . 
 King Stephen gave permission for some of England 's bishops , including Bethune , to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148 . Stephen had expelled the papal legates , or representatives , who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Rheims , and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church . These three , Bethune , Hilary of Chichester , and William de Turbeville , were allowed to attend the council . Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend , but he managed to evade those watching him and arrived in Rheims along with his clerk , Thomas Becket . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Bethune died on 16 April 1148 at Rheims just after the close of the Council of Rheims . As his corpse returned to Hereford , miracles were alleged to have taken place along its route . He was buried in Hereford Cathedral . 
 Bethune 's episcopal acta , or his decisions and other documents relating to his episcopal career , have been published in the English Episcopal Acta series , in the volume relating to the diocese of Hereford . A medieval catalogue of works at Llanthony Priory also recorded that they owned a collection of letters by Bethune , but this has not survived . 
 A Life , or hagiography , giving his life and miracles , was written about him , by one of the Bethune 's canons , William <unk> . It contains few details of Bethune 's life itself . Instead , it is an attempt by his canons to secure sainthood for Bethune . Although the life describes miracles that took place at Bethune 's tomb , no evidence survives of a formal cult being developed , and he was never canonised . The historian Avram Saltman called him " the model bishop of his time " , because of his care for his diocese and his abilities . 
 = Orfeo ed Euridice = 
 Orfeo ed Euridice ( French version : Orphée et Eurydice ; English : Orpheus and Eurydice ) is an opera composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck based on the myth of Orpheus , set to a libretto by Ranieri de ' Calzabigi . It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale , meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing . The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762 in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa . Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck 's " reform " operas , in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a " noble simplicity " in both the music and the drama . 
 The opera is the most popular of Gluck 's works , and one of the most influential on subsequent German opera . Variations on its plot – the underground rescue @-@ mission in which the hero must control , or conceal , his emotions – include Mozart 's The Magic Flute , Beethoven 's Fidelio and Wagner 's Das Rheingold . 
 Though originally set to an Italian libretto , Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of French opera , particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity . Indeed , twelve years after the 1762 premiere , Gluck re @-@ adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre @-@ Louis Moline . This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice , and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes . 
 = = Background = = 
 Francesco Algarotti 's Essay on the Opera ( 1755 ) was a major influence in the development of Gluck 's reformist ideology . Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria , with the drama pre @-@ eminent , instead of the music or ballet or staging . The drama itself should " delight the eyes and ears , to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience , without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense " . Algarotti 's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist , Calzabigi . Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform , and he stated : " If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music , he did not create it from nothing . I provided him with the material or the chaos , if you like . We therefore share the honour of that creation . " 
 Other influences included the composer Niccolò Jommelli and his maître de ballet at Stuttgart , Jean @-@ Georges Noverre . Noverre 's Lettres sur la danse ( 1760 ) called for dramatic effect over acrobatic ostentation ; Noverre was himself influenced by the operas of Rameau and the acting style of David Garrick . The considerable quantity of ballet in Orfeo ed Euridice is thought to be due to his influence . Jommelli himself was noted for his blending of all aspects of the production : ballet , staging , and audience .

 The first lines of arias , choruses , etc . , are given in Italian ( 1762 version ) and French ( 1774 version ) . 
 = = = Act 1 = = = 
 A chorus of nymphs and shepherds join Orfeo around the tomb of his wife Euridice in a solemn chorus of mourning ; Orfeo is only able to utter Euridice 's name ( Chorus and Orfeo : " Ah , se intorno " / " Ah ! Dans ce bois " ) . Orfeo sends the others away and sings of his grief in the aria " Chiamo il mio ben " / " <unk> de mon amour " , the three verses of which are preceded by expressive recitatives . This technique was extremely radical at the time and indeed proved overly so for those who came after Gluck : Mozart chose to retain the unity of the aria . Amore ( Cupid ) appears , telling Orfeo that he may go to the Underworld and return with his wife on the condition that he not look at her until they are back on earth ( 1774 only : aria by Amour , " Si les doux accords " ) . As encouragement , Amore informs Orfeo that his present suffering shall be short @-@ lived with the aria " Gli <unk> <unk> " / " <unk> au silence " . Orfeo resolves to take on the quest . In the 1774 version only he delivers an <unk> ( " L <unk> <unk> dans mon âme " ) in the older , showier , Italian style , originally composed for an occasional entertainment , Il <unk> <unk> ( 1765 ) , and subsequently re @-@ used in another one , Le <unk> d <unk> ( 1769 ) . 
 = = = Act 2 = = = 
 In a rocky landscape , the Furies refuse to admit Orfeo to the Underworld , and sing of Cerberus , its canine guardian ( " Chi mai dell ’ <unk> " / " Quel est l <unk> " ) . When Orfeo , accompanied by his lyre ( represented in the opera by a harp ) , begs for pity in the aria " <unk> <unk> con me " / " <unk> @-@ vous toucher " , he is at first interrupted by cries of " No ! " / " Non ! " from the Furies , but they are eventually softened by the sweetness of his singing in the arias " Mille <unk> " / " Ah ! La flamme " and " Men <unk> " / " La <unk> " , and let him in ( " Ah , <unk> incognito <unk> " / " <unk> chants doux " ) . In the 1774 version , the scene ends with the " Dance of the Furies " ( No. 28 ) . 
 The second scene opens in Elysium . The brief ballet of 1762 became the four @-@ movement " Dance of the Blessed Spirits " ( with a prominent part for solo flute ) in 1774 . This is followed ( 1774 only ) by a solo which celebrates happiness in eternal bliss ( " Cet <unk> " ) , sung by either an unnamed Spirit or Euridice , and repeated by the chorus . Orfeo arrives and marvels at the purity of the air in an arioso ( " Che <unk> ciel " / " Quel nouveau ciel " ) . But he finds no solace in the beauty of the surroundings , for Euridice is not yet with him . He implores the spirits to bring her to him , which they do ( Chorus : " Torna , o bella " / " <unk> du <unk> objet " ) . 
 = = = Act 3 = = = 
 On the way out of Hades , Euridice is delighted to be returning to earth , but Orfeo , remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1 , lets go of her hand and refusing to look at her , does not explain anything to her . She does not understand his action and reproaches him , but he must suffer in silence ( Duet : " Vieni , <unk> il tuo <unk> " / " <unk> , suis un <unk> " ) . Euridice takes this to be a sign that he no longer loves her , and refuses to continue , concluding that death would be preferable . She sings of her grief at Orfeo 's supposed infidelity in the aria " Che <unk> <unk> " / " Fortune <unk> " ( in 1774 , there is a brief duet before the reprise ) . Unable to take any more , Orfeo turns and looks at Euridice ; again , she dies . Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria " Che farò senza Euridice ? " / " J ’ ai perdu mon Eurydice " ( " What shall I do without Euridice ? " / " I have lost my Euridice " ) Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades , but Amore returns to stop him ( 1774 only : Trio : " <unk> Amour " ) . In reward for Orfeo 's continued love , Amore returns Euridice to life , and she and Orfeo are reunited . After a four @-@ movement ballet , all sing in praise of Amore ( " <unk> Amore " ) . In the 1774 version , the chorus ( " L ’ Amour <unk> " ) precedes the ballet , to which Gluck had added three extra movements . 
 = = Performance history = = 
 The opera was first performed in Vienna at the Burgtheater on 5 October 1762 , for the name @-@ day celebrations of the Emperor Francis I. The production was supervised by the reformist theatre administrator , Count Giacomo Durazzo . Choreography was by Gasparo <unk> , and set designs were by Giovanni Maria <unk> the Elder , both leading members of their fields . The first Orfeo was the famous castrato Gaetano Guadagni . Orfeo was revived in Vienna during the following year , but then not performed until 1769 . For the performances that took place in London in 1770 , Guadagni sang the role of Orpheus , but little of the music bore any relation to Gluck 's original , with J. C. Bach – " the English Bach " – providing most of the new music . Haydn conducted a performance of the Italian version at <unk> in 1776 . During the early 19th century , Adolphe Nourrit became particularly well known for his performances of Orpheus at the Paris Opera . In 1854 Franz Liszt conducted the work at Weimar , composing a symphonic poem of his own to replace Gluck 's original overture . Typically during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century , the role of Orfeo was sung by a female contralto , and noted interpreters of the role from this time include Dame Clara Butt and Kathleen Ferrier , and the mezzo @-@ sopranos Rita <unk> , Marilyn Horne , Dame Janet Baker , Susanne <unk> , and Risë Stevens ( at the Metropolitan Opera ) . Among conductors , Arturo Toscanini was a notable proponent of the opera . His November 1952 radio broadcast of act 2 was eventually released on LP and CD . 
 = = Revised versions = = 
 In 1769 for Le <unk> d <unk> at Parma which was conducted by the composer , Gluck transposed part of the role of Orfeo up for the soprano castrato Giuseppe <unk> , maintaining a libretto in Italian . This version has not been performed in modern times . 
 = = = Gluck 's 1774 Paris Opera version = = = 
 Gluck revised the score again for a production by the Paris Opera , which premiered on 2 August 1774 at the second Salle du Palais @-@ Royal . This version , named Orphée et Eurydice , had a French libretto by Pierre @-@ Louis Moline , which was both a translation of and an expansion upon Calzabigi 's original text . Gluck expanded and rewrote parts of the opera , and changed the role of Orpheus from a part for a castrato to one for high tenor or the so @-@ called haute @-@ contre – the usual voice in French opera for heroic characters – as the French almost never used castrati . This version of the work also had additional ballet sequences , conforming to the tastes that were prevalent at the time in Paris , and included the long " Dance of the Furies " , originally from Gluck 's ballet Don Juan , and the famous " Dance of the Blessed Spirits " for flute and strings . By 1825 operatic castrati themselves had virtually vanished , and performances of the original version for castrato became increasingly rare . The modern practice of approximating castrati by using countertenors as replacements only dates to 1950 . 
 = = = Berlioz 's 1859 version for contralto = = = 
 From 1784 to 1859 the Parisian diapason ( concert pitch ) rose steadily from 820 to 896 cycles per second , thus Gluck 's French version for haute @-@ contre became increasingly impractical . When Adolphe Nourrit sang the role at the Opéra in 1824 his music was altered . Giacomo Meyerbeer suggested to the French contralto Pauline Viardot that she should perform the role of Orfeo . The composer Hector Berlioz was a close friend of Viardot and the leading expert in France on the music of Gluck . He knew the score of " the largely forgotten Italian original as thoroughly as he knew the French " , and agreed to prepare a version of the opera – in four acts – with Viardot 's voice in mind , adapting the role of Orphée for a female alto . In his adaptation , Berlioz used the key scheme of the 1762 Vienna score while incorporating much of the additional music of the 1774 Paris score . He returned to the Italian version only when he considered it to be superior either in terms of music or in terms of the drama . He also restored some of the more subtle orchestration from the Italian version and resisted proposals by Viardot and the theatre 's director Léon Carvalho to modernize the orchestration . In the end Camille Saint @-@ Saëns , who was acting as Berlioz 's assistant on the project , did some of the minor rewriting which Berlioz had declined to do . 
 The Berlioz version was first presented at the Théâtre Lyrique on 18 November 1859 with Viardot as Orphée , Marie Sasse as Eurydice , Marie Ernestine <unk> as L 'Amour , Mlle Moreau as L 'Ombre , and Adolphe <unk> as the conductor . The sets were designed by Charles @-@ Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry , and the choreography was by Lucien Petipa . ( The seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Jules Massenet was the orchestra 's timpanist . During the rehearsals Berlioz had complimented the young player on the accuracy of his tuning . ) The production was a popular and critical success , filling the house every night , and was given a total of 138 times by the company . 
 = = = Subsequent versions = = = 
 By 1860 most theaters in Paris had lowered concert pitch to diapason normal . This was not as low as in Gluck 's time : " a Commission had lately recommended that the pitch in France should be lowered from an A of 896 to 870 vibrations . " Still this was apparently enough that later in the 19th century the role of Orpheus came to be sung almost as frequently by a tenor as by a contralto . 
 Berlioz 's version is one of many which combine the Italian and French scores , although it is the most influential and well regarded . Since about 1870 three @-@ act adaptations of the Berlioz score , translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out , were common . An 1889 edition for contralto , published by Ricordi , became the most popular . On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing . Dietrich Fischer @-@ Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany . Fischer @-@ Dieskau recorded the opera several times ; his recordings are still available commercially . 
 = = Orfeo and the reform = = 
 The opera was the first by Gluck showing signs of his ambition to reform opera seria . Self @-@ contained arias and choruses make way for shorter pieces strung together to make larger structural units . Da capo arias are notable by their absence ; Gluck instead uses strophic form , notably in act one 's " Chiamo il mio ben così " , where each verse is interposed with dramatic recitative , – that is , <unk> , where the voice is accompanied by part or all of the orchestra – and rondo form , such as in act three 's famous " Che farò senza Euridice ? " . Also absent is traditional secco recitative , where the voice is accompanied only by the basso continuo . On the whole , old Italian operatic conventions are disregarded in favour of giving the action dramatic impetus . The complexity of the storyline is greatly reduced by eliminating subplots . Gluck was influenced by the example of French <unk> en musique , particularly those of Rameau . Like them , the opera contains a large number of expressive dances , extensive use of the chorus and accompanied recitative . The coup de théâtre of opening the drama with a chorus mourning one of the main characters is very similar to that used in Rameau 's Castor et Pollux ( 1737 ) . Other elements do not follow Gluck 's subsequent reforms ; for instance , the brisk , cheerful overture does not reflect the action to come . The role of Orfeo calls for an especially gifted actor , so that the strophic " Chiamo il mio ben così " does not become dull , and so that tragic import can be given both to this aria and to " Che farò senza Euridice ? " , both of which are based on harmonies that are not obviously mournful in nature . The first Orfeo , Gaetano Guadagni , was reputedly a fine actor who had certainly taken lessons while in London from the renowned Shakespearian actor David Garrick . Guadagni was apparently also able to project a moving and emotive tone without raising his voice . Indeed , Gluck faced criticism of " Che farò senza Euridice ? " on the grounds that it was emotionally uninvolved ; he responded by pointing out the absolute necessity of fine execution of the aria : " make the slightest change , either in the movement or in the turn of expression , and it will become a saltarello for marionettes " . 
 Gluck 's reforms , which began with Orfeo ed Euridice , have had significant influence throughout operatic history . Gluck 's ideals heavily influenced the popular works of Mozart , Wagner , and Weber , with Wagner 's Gesamtkunstwerk vision especially influenced by that of Gluck . Old @-@ style opera seria and the domination of embellishment @-@ orientated singers came to be increasingly unpopular after the success of Gluck 's operas as a whole and Orfeo in particular . In Orfeo ed Euridice the orchestra is far more predominant than in earlier opera , most notably in Orfeo 's arioso " Che <unk> ciel " . Here the voice is reduced to the comparatively minor role of recitative @-@ style declamation , while the oboe carries the main melody , supported by solos from the flute , cello , bassoon , and horn . There is also accompaniment from the strings ( playing in triplets ) and the continuo in the most complex orchestration that Gluck ever wrote . 
 = = Orchestration = = 
 Gluck made a number of changes to the orchestration of Orfeo when adapting it from the original Italian version to the French version of 1774 . <unk> and chalumeaux are replaced by more common and modern oboes and clarinets , while the part played by trombones considerably decreases , possibly due to a lack of technical ability on the part of the French <unk> . <unk> were instruments that were typically used for church music , and chalumeaux were predominant only in chamber music : both cornetts and chalumeaux were unpopular in France in 1774 . In many ways the change from chalumeau to oboe corresponds to that from castrato to high tenor . Neither castrato nor chalumeau were to survive . 
 In both the Italian and French version Orfeo 's lyre is represented by the harp , and it was this use of the instrument in 1774 that it is usually thought introduced the harp to French orchestras . Each verse of the strophic " Chiamo il mio ben <unk> " is accompanied by different solo instruments . In Vienna these were flute , horns , and English horns , but in 1774 Gluck was required to change this orchestration to that of a single horn and two clarinets , again replacing uncommon instruments with those in far more widespread usage . During the aria " Chiamo il mio ben <unk> " and the interspersing recitatives Gluck added another offstage orchestra consisting of strings and chalumeaux , in order to provide an echo effect .

 Henri Pauli Toivonen ( 25 August 1956 – 2 May 1986 ) was a Finnish rally driver born in Jyväskylä , the home of Rally Finland . His father , Pauli , was the 1968 European Rally Champion for Porsche and his brother , Harri , became a professional circuit racer . 
 Toivonen 's first World Rally Championship victory came with a Talbot Sunbeam Lotus at the 1980 Lombard RAC Rally in Great Britain , just after his 24th birthday . He had the record of being the youngest driver ever to win a world rally until his countryman Jari @-@ Matti Latvala won the 2008 Swedish Rally at the age of 22 . After driving for Opel and Porsche , Toivonen was signed by Lancia . Despite nearly ending up paralysed at the Rally Costa Smeralda early in 1985 , he returned to rallying later that year . He won the last event of the season , the RAC Rally , as well as the 1986 season opener , the Monte Carlo Rally , which his father had won exactly 20 years earlier . 
 Toivonen , driving a Lancia Delta S4 , died in an accident on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica . His American co @-@ driver , Sergio Cresto , also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded . The fatal accident had no close witnesses and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe , making it impossible to determine the cause of the accident . Within hours of the accident , Jean @-@ Marie Balestre , then President of the FISA , had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season , ending rallying 's popular supercar era . 
 Toivonen started his career in circuit racing and was also very competitive on tarmac . He raced successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events , achieved praise from Eddie Jordan , in whose Formula Three team Toivonen made a few guest appearances , and impressed in his Formula One test for March Grand Prix . The annual Race of Champions , originally organised in Toivonen 's memory , awards the winning individual driver the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Toivonen had strong ties to rallying at an early age . He was born in Jyväskylä , the city which has hosted the Rally Finland since 1951 . His father , Pauli Toivonen , was a successful international rally driver who would go on to win the Monte Carlo , 1000 Lakes and Acropolis rallies and become the 1968 European Rally Champion . Henri Toivonen learned to drive when he was five years old , but despite his rallying connections , started competition in circuit racing . He began with karts and won the Finnish Cup in touring cars before switching to Formula Vee , winning one round of the Scandinavian Championship in his first year . Toivonen graduated to Formula Super Vee the following year and won a round of the European Championship , as well as becoming the 1977 Finnish Champion in the Formula Vee class . Due to his family 's concerns about the safety of circuit racing , he switched to rallying full @-@ time . Toivonen 's kart was purchased by the parents of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old Mika Häkkinen , who would later be a two @-@ time Formula One World Drivers ' Champion . 
 Due to Finnish legislation , which at that time limited new drivers to a top speed of 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) on open roads , Toivonen was unable to compete in rallying until he was 19 years old . With Antero Lindqvist as his co @-@ driver , he made his World Rally Championship debut at the 1975 1000 Lakes Rally ( now the Neste Oil Rally Finland ) , driving a privately entered Simca Rallye 2 . He retired from the rally during the 36th special stage due to a broken sump . While still focusing on his circuit racing career , he competed in his second world rally two years later and finished fifth in the 1977 1000 Lakes in a Chrysler Avenger . 
 Toivonen started his 1978 season at the Arctic Rally , the second round of both the European Rally Championship and World Rally Championship 's " FIA Cup for Drivers " , the predecessor to the official drivers ' world championship which was established in 1979 . He finished second , 3 : 41 minutes behind Ari Vatanen , and over seven minutes ahead of Markku Alén , who would go on to win the Cup . Toivonen went on to compete in two world championship rallies for Citroën . Although he did not finish either event , his driving attracted attention ; a private Porsche team offered Toivonen a car for the 1000 Lakes Rally , as did Chrysler for the Lombard RAC Rally . At his home event , Toivonen had to retire due to an engine failure , but he finished ninth at the RAC Rally . That same year , Toivonen captured his first rally win at the Nordic Rally , an event in the Finnish Rally Championship . In the 1979 season , he gathered rallying experience by competing in 15 rallies in the British , Finnish and European championships . Toivonen also competed in two WRC events : the 1000 Lakes with a Fiat 131 Abarth and the RAC with a Ford Escort RS . He retired from both , but at his home event he had been matching the pace of the leaders before leaving the road . These performances led to a contract with the factory Talbot Competition team for the 1980 season . 
 = = Works career = = 
 = = = Talbot ( 1980 – 81 ) = = = 
 Toivonen 's first season driving for a major car manufacturer 's ' works ' team was largely a trial year . He started the season by winning the Arctic Rally in January , but only drove his Talbot Sunbeam Lotus in four selected World Rally Championship events . His exuberant driving style often led to crashes , and his results were often not representative of his pace . In hopes of better results , the team partnered Toivonen with three different co @-@ drivers during the season : Antero Lindqvist , Paul White and Neil Wilson . At the 1000 Lakes Rally , Toivonen retired due to an accident during the 11th special stage . At the next rally in Sanremo with Lindqvist , Toivonen finished fifth . In late November , Toivonen , this time partnered by White , surprised both experts and spectators by winning the Lombard RAC Rally , over four minutes ahead of runner @-@ up Hannu Mikkola . Neither Toivonen nor Talbot were expected to be competitive in the rally . In an interview published in Autosport three days before the rally started , Toivonen himself had not expected to challenge for the win : 
 " I don ’ t think that I have done enough events to win the rally just by driving skill , for instance . If I win , it will be because I have a little bit of luck and some of the others have trouble . I mean , Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat him . You have to wait for him to have trouble . Then you are in with a chance . " 
 At 24 years and 86 days , he remained the youngest driver to win a WRC event until his countryman Jari @-@ Matti Latvala won the 2008 Swedish Rally at the age of 22 . Latvala stated that " It 's a super feeling , it 's almost unbelievable . Henri ( Toivonen ) was one of my idols and secretly I 've always wanted to beat his record as the youngest winner . " Over 20 years after the 1980 RAC , Paul White ( nicknamed " <unk> " by Toivonen ) commented that he still receives questions about the rally and Henri Toivonen . He noted that the Talbot team , run by Des O 'Dell and 15 full @-@ time personnel , was much smaller than other works teams and " had to draft in ' mercenary ' mechanics to help . " Toivonen 's results led to another year in the Talbot squad . In the 1981 season , he was signed up for a larger WRC programme and had a new co @-@ driver , Fred Gallagher , who would later partner Juha Kankkunen and Björn Waldegård in a Toyota <unk> <unk> Turbo . Toivonen 's rear @-@ wheel drive Group 2 Sunbeam Lotus was now less competitive against the Group 4 cars and the all @-@ wheel @-@ drive Audi Quattro , but despite four retirements , the second places at Rally Portugal and Sanremo , as well as a fifth place at the Monte Carlo Rally , resulted in a seventh place overall in the drivers ' world championship . Together with more consistent team mate Guy <unk> , he brought Talbot a surprise manufacturers ' title . He also competed in the last round of the British Open Rally Championship , the Audi Sport International Rally , and won the event . 
 = = = Opel ( 1982 – 83 ) = = = 
 For the 1982 season , Toivonen switched to the Rothmans @-@ sponsored Opel team , which was co @-@ managed by David Richards . Toivonen 's team mates were Ari Vatanen , who had won the previous year 's championship ( with Richards as his co @-@ driver ) , the 1980 and 1982 world champion Walter Röhrl and Jimmy McRae , the previous year 's British Rally Champion and father of future rally star Colin McRae . In his <unk> 400 debut in Portugal , Toivonen surprised the event favourites by leading the rally before retiring five stages from the finish . He competed in only four more WRC events , but finished on the podium twice , at the Acropolis Rally and at the RAC Rally . In the European Rally Championship , he participated in four rallies , registering three podiums and one retirement . He also made a guest appearance in one round of the British Formula Three circuit racing championship , where he finished tenth driving a Ralt <unk> . In his Formula One test for March Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit , Toivonen was 1 @.@ 4 seconds faster than the team 's regular driver Raul Boesel . 
 Toivonen continued with Opel into the 1983 season , now driving the Manta 400 , which took advantage of the new Group B regulations . Although the Manta was a Group B car , it was underpowered against the likes of the Audi Quattro A2 and Lancia 037 , which were controlling the world rally scene at the time . Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International Rally , a round of the British Open Rally Championship and the European Rally Championship , in the Isle of Man , at his first attempt . He also finished first at the Mille <unk> rally in France , but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event . Toivonen and his co @-@ driver , Ian <unk> , received only a consolation trophy . In the World Rally Championship , he retired in three rallies , finished sixth at the Monte Carlo Rally and fourth at the Rallye Sanremo . He also drove a Ferrari 308 <unk> at the San Marino Rally , where he was co @-@ driven by Juha Piironen for the first time . The pair retired from the event , but Piironen would become his main co @-@ driver for the next two seasons , and later have a long and successful partnership with four @-@ time world champion Juha Kankkunen . In late October , Toivonen again competed on the circuits . This time he entered two sportscar races , driving a Porsche 956 for Richard Lloyd Racing in the World Sportscar Championship . Partnered with Derek Bell and Jonathan Palmer , he finished fourth at Imola and third in the next race at Mugello . 
 = = = Porsche ( 1984 ) = = = 
 After a score of ten starts , two podiums , three other top six finishes and five retirements , Toivonen left Opel Team Europe for the 1984 season . He was linked to the lead drive at the Peugeot Talbot Sport , Peugeot 's new factory World Rally Championship team , but eventually signed to drive a Porsche 911 SC RS for the Rothmans @-@ sponsored Porsche factory team in the European Rally Championship . The team was run by <unk> , a new motorsport group set up by David Richards , Toivonen 's former boss at Opel . His European season with Porsche turned out to be a success . He started with two retirements , a third and a second place , but went on to win five rallies in a row and led the championship from Italian Lancia driver Carlo Capone . As Toivonen had a contract with Lancia for the World Rally Championship , and Lancia boss Cesare Fiorio wanted Capone to win the European title , it was suggested that Fiorio might enter Toivonen in WRC events to keep him away from important ERC rounds . However , Toivonen 's title campaign ended in a back injury and a resulting enforced rest that was expected to take up to two months . He missed several events and finished second in the championship behind Capone . 
 Toivonen 's WRC contract with Lancia Martini consisted of five events . Fiorio stated that the team needed another top driver as " Audi will have four top drivers next year so it would be very difficult competing with only two . " Toivonen had his Lancia 037 debut in Portugal with very limited testing experience : " It has been snowing in Italy every time I have been to try this car , so I don 't know its limits . " However , similarly to his Opel <unk> 400 debut at the same event two years ago , Toivonen immediately took the lead and set several fastest stage times before retiring . This time the retirement was not caused by a broken clutch , but a mistake and a crash by Toivonen . After a retirement also in Greece , he finished third in his home event , the 1000 Lakes Rally . These three remained Toivonen 's only WRC events of the season as his back injury forced him to miss the Sanremo and RAC rallies . Before Sanremo , Markku Alén re @-@ signed with Lancia and Fiorio stated he wanted to sign Toivonen with a similar two @-@ year contract , depending on the condition of his back and his contractual situation with Rothmans Porsche , who had claimed Toivonen had already re @-@ signed with them . Toivonen chose to become a full @-@ fledged Lancia driver for the 1985 season . 
 = = = Lancia ( 1985 – 86 ) = = = 
 The 1985 season started badly when Toivonen crashed his Lancia 037 into a brick wall at the Rally Costa Smeralda , in the European Championship , seriously injuring his back and breaking three vertebrae in his neck . At the beginning of May , Lancia drivers Toivonen and Alén lost a friend and team @-@ mate , when Italian driver Attilio Bettega crashed fatally during the fourth special stage at the Tour de Corse . Toivonen made his comeback from his injuries at the 1000 Lakes Rally in August and finished fourth . He finished third at the next rally in Sanremo , his final event with the car . The 037 did not suit Toivonen 's driving style and had fallen well behind Audi and Peugeot in terms of performance , as it was rear @-@ wheel drive and had only 325 horsepower ( 242 kW ) compared to the 440 of Peugeot and 500 of Audi . It was replaced by the Lancia Delta S4 for the final event of the season : the RAC Rally . The Delta S4 had all @-@ wheel drive and was both supercharged and turbocharged , the former increasing power in the middle of the engine 's speed range and the latter boosting power at higher engine speeds . The car could reportedly accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) in 2 @.@ 3 seconds , on a gravel road . The Delta S4 turned out to be a success . Toivonen won the rally and Alén finished second only 56 seconds behind . Although Toivonen competed in only four world rallies in 1985 , his results placed him career @-@ best sixth overall in the championship . 
 The 1986 season started with a dominant win for Toivonen at the Monte Carlo Rally with new co @-@ driver Sergio Cresto . Fellow " Flying Finns " Timo Salonen and Hannu Mikkola finished second and third . Toivonen 's father , Pauli Toivonen , had won the event 20 years earlier after ten cars , including the first four to cross the finishing line , were disqualified due to having non @-@ standard headlights . The disqualification had caused an uproar and Prince Rainier of Monaco refused to attend the prize @-@ giving ceremony . Henri Toivonen 's victory caused his father to comment " now the name of Toivonen has been cleared " . The Monte Carlo win made Toivonen the favourite for the title . However , at the Swedish Rally he retired from the lead due to an engine failure . At the next rally in Portugal , Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford <unk> on a special stage and plunged into the crowd . The accident killed three spectators and injured more than 30 . Toivonen along with all the other factory team drivers decided to withdraw from the event , but Lancia disapproved of the retirement . Toivonen stated that " the Lancia team will not accept anything but a win . " During the Portuguese rally , Toivonen is often reported to have tested his Delta S4 at the Estoril circuit and to have set a fastest lap time that would have qualified him in sixth position at the 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix . MTV3 and ESPN , citing Kankkunen and Fiorio , respectively , looked into the claim a few decades later and came to a skeptical conclusion . Red Bull explored the story further by interviewing former Lancia manager Ninni Russo , whose connections stated that Toivonen had made a time on the full circuit that " was in the first ten of the F1 cars from their test at Estoril two or three weeks before . " Despite the setbacks , Toivonen remained the title favourite with no driver seeming able to match his pace . 
 = = Death = = 
 The 1986 Tour de Corse , a world rally around the island of Corsica , began on Thursday , 1 May . Toivonen had a sore throat and was suffering from the flu , but he insisted on driving after having lost his championship lead in the last two rallies . According to several sources , he was also taking medicine to treat fever . Despite his ill health , he was taking stage win after stage win and leading the rally by a large margin . After the first leg , Toivonen commented : 
 " This rally is insane , even though everything is going well at the moment . If there is trouble , I 'm as good as dead . " 
 Toivonen was complaining about the car being too powerful for a rally like the Tour de Corse . He found it very hard to keep the car balanced on the road and admitted it was very exhausting . In a short interview before he steered his Lancia into the 18th stage , Toivonen made a comment which would remain his last words in public : 
 " Today , we have driven the equivalent of a full <unk> ( Finnish Rally ) . It 's hard to keep up with the speed . " 
 During the second leg , on Friday , 2 May , at the seventh kilometre of the 18th stage , Corte – Taverna , Toivonen 's Lancia went off the side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail . The car plunged down a ravine and landed on its roof . The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver 's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded . The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate , an item used mainly on gravel rallies , which was not fitted for the all @-@ asphalt Tour de Corse . The explosion happened within seconds of the crash , and Toivonen and his co @-@ driver , Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive . The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4 , built of fast @-@ burning kevlar @-@ reinforced plastic composite , was unidentifiable as a car afterwards . Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats . Toivonen left behind wife <unk> ( married in 1982 ) and two young children , son Markus and daughter Arla , while Cresto was single with no children . 
 Toivonen 's accident remains a mystery because it had no close witnesses . Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage , it proved to be impossible to determine the cause of the crash from the footage . No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no @-@ one at the race finish knew about the accident . Toivonen 's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule . The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke . By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the accident scene , they could only put down the flames , which had been fanned by breezes . Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the accident because the remains of the car were so charred . 
 Walter Röhrl later confirmed that Toivonen was taking medicine for his flu . In a later interview with Motorsport News , fellow driver Malcolm Wilson claimed that since the neck injuries sustained in his 1985 Costa Smeralda crash , Toivonen had suffered from random blackouts but did not tell his team because he did not want to lose his place at Lancia . At least one person who attended the aftermath of the accident reported that there were no skid marks on the tarmac , fuelling speculation that Toivonen could have suddenly lost consciousness at the wheel , but the cause of the accident is still unknown . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Within hours of Toivonen 's accident , Jean @-@ Marie Balestre and the FISA decided to ban Group B cars from competing in the 1987 season . The planned Group S was also cancelled and manufacturers were stuck with cars they could not race . Audi and Ford withdrew from Group B racing immediately , but other teams competed until the end of the season . The Tour de Corse continued the next day and Bruno Saby won with his Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2 . Prior to Santos ' and Toivonen 's crashes , many commentators and drivers had warned of accidents resulting from drivers simply being unable to control their powerful cars . FISA was criticised for recognising the problem too late . A FISA investigation later proved that drivers ' reactions were too slow to keep up with the speed of the Group B cars , and drivers ' eyes could not adjust their focus between the fast corners , resulting in tunnel vision . However , due to the high speed of the cars , rallying was more popular among spectators than ever . FISA had to face criticism also for overreacting to Toivonen 's accident . John Davenport , author and former rally co @-@ driver , stated in 2004 that " Group B could have been tamed . They were only unsafe in so much as the fuel system , which caused Toivonen 's death , and the crowd control needed changing – it wasn 't the actual cars . " Group B cars have been described as " too fast to race . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Toivonen was known as a competitive driver both on gravel and tarmac surfaces , and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying . After becoming a rally driver , he still competed in some circuit racing events , successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan 's British Formula Three Championship team . Jordan called Toivonen 's performances " incredible " and compared him to Ayrton Senna . After Toivonen 's death , Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One : 
 " I don 't know if he would have become a champion in Formula One . It always takes a lot of luck , and now [ after the accident ] one can doubt if he would have been granted that . But he would have won Grands Prix – of that I 'm absolutely sure . " 
 During his World Rally Championship career , Toivonen competed in 40 world rallies , gathering three wins , nine podium places , 185 stage wins and retiring 22 times . With only wins and retirements in the last five of his rallies , he was at the peak of his career in the Lancia Delta S4 , after finally finding a car that was both competitive and suitable for his driving style . However , Toivonen admitted having problems with the car : " I may have won the RAC Rally with Lancia , but I just did not know how to drive it . It seemed to have a mind of its own . " Lancia team boss Cesare Fiorio later claimed that Toivonen was the only driver who could really control the Delta S4 . 
 In a Henri Toivonen obituary , titled Rebel With a Cause , published in Motor five days after Toivonen 's fatal accident , rally author Martin Holmes named him a " rebel driver " , and proof that young drivers can be successful in rallying , a sport which had previously been dominated by older , more experienced drivers . However , Toivonen could not achieve the necessary level of consistency to avoid a number of high speed accidents . Prior to the introduction of the Delta S4 , he was known for his ability to make up large amounts of time in single stages . This led to a number of stage wins but also to several bad accidents resulting from driving mistakes . Toivonen 's career almost ended in early 1985 , when he was nearly paralysed in the Rally Costa Smeralda accident – 1985 would have been his first full WRC season , excluding the endurance events Safari Rally and Rallye Côte d 'Ivoire for which he was never entered in his career . The World Rally Archive 's Hall of Fame now names him an " icon for the one of the most controversial periods of rallying . " 
 Toivonen was buried in Espoo , where his family moved from Jyväskylä when Toivonen was still very young . In Corsica , a marble slab dedicated to him and Sergio Cresto was placed at the curve where Toivonen drove out . The memorial place always has an unopened bottle of Martini , which is a reference to Toivonen 's Martini @-@ sponsored Lancia factory team . A local resident puts new flowers by the slab every day . In July , the Rally Marca <unk> in Italy was titled " Memorial Henri Toivonen " in honour of Toivonen . The rally was stopped after a fatal accident on the fourth stage . In 1988 , former rally driver and arguably the most successful female race car driver in history , Michèle Mouton , organised the first Race of Champions to commemorate Toivonen 's death . The Race of Champions was originally restricted to rally drivers , but became even more popular with the introduction of Formula One and NASCAR stars . The Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy is still awarded to the winner of the individual event every year . 
 Another trophy bearing Toivonen 's name was the Henri Toivonen Grand Attack Trophy , which was awarded by Peugeot 's Rally Challenge , organised by Des O 'Dell , " to the driver who most embodied the spirit shown by the young Finn . " In 2006 , Toivonen was honoured at the Neste Oil Rally Finland . An exhibition in memory of him was opened on 17 August in the Rally HQ Jyväskylä <unk> . The interviewing event was attended by his former team mate Markku Alén , former co @-@ driver Juha Piironen , current Ford factory team boss Malcolm Wilson and his brother Harri Toivonen . Harri Toivonen quit his racing career in 2002 , ending the 40 @-@ year racing history of the Toivonen family .

 = Renaissance in Scotland = 
 The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural , intellectual and artistic movement in Scotland , from the late fifteenth century to the beginning of the seventeenth century . It is associated with the pan @-@ European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century . It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era , including humanism , a spirit of scholarly enquiry , scepticism , and concepts of balance and proportion . Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians , but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education , intellectual life , literature , art , architecture , music and politics . 
 The court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas . It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy . The Renaissance led to the adoption of ideas of imperial monarchy , encouraging the Scottish crown to join the new monarchies by asserting imperial jurisdiction and distinction . The growing emphasis on education in the Middle Ages became part of a humanist and then Protestant programme to extend and reform learning . It resulted in the expansion of the school system and the foundation of six university colleges by the end of the sixteenth century . Relatively large numbers of Scottish scholars studied on the continent or in England and some , such as Hector Boece , John Mair , Andrew Melville and George Buchanan , returned to Scotland to play a major part in developing Scottish intellectual life . Vernacular works in Scots began to emerge in the fifteenth century , while Latin remained a major literary language . With the patronage of James V and James VI , writers included William Stewart , John Bellenden , David Lyndsay , William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie . 
 In the sixteenth century , Scottish kings , particularly James V , built palaces in a Renaissance style , beginning at Linlithgow . The trend soon spread to members of the aristocracy . Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art , with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists . While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage as a result of the Reformation , house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy , with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century . Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms . Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603 , the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage , changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope . In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism , Mannerism and the Baroque . 
 = = Definitions and debates = = 
 Renaissance is a concept formulated by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt in the mid @-@ nineteenth century to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds . It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude , a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art . The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later , in the late fifteenth century . Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century , when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque . However , the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 to the end of the seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance . 
 In the twentieth century , historians disputed the validity of the concept of a Renaissance as unique , as a reaction against the " dark age " of the Medieval , as a clear break with the past and as a unified movement . Instead they emphasised the many intellectual trends and movements that went before it , such as the twelfth @-@ century Renaissance on which it built . It was also once common for historians to suggest that Scotland had little or no participation in the Renaissance . More recently , the significant changes in intellectual and cultural life in the period have been seen as forming a watershed in Scottish cultural history . This has been perceived as opening the path for the Reformation , and later for the modernisation of thought and social life in the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution , to which Scotland would make a significant contribution . 
 = = Court and kingship = = 
 The court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas . It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy . This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry , which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult . It saw its origins in the classical era , with Hector of Troy , Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar often depicted as proto @-@ knights . Tournaments provided one focus of display , the most famous being those of the Wild Knight in 1507 and the Black Lady in 1508 under James IV . They were also pursued enthusiastically by James V who , proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood , displayed their insignia on the Gateway at Linlithgow Palace . 
 During her brief personal rule , Mary , Queen of Scots brought with her many of the elaborate court activities that she had grown up with at the French court . She introduced balls , masques and celebrations designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity . The most elaborate event was the baptism of the future James VI at Stirling Castle in 1566 , organised by her French servant Bastian Pagez . This combined complex imagery , incorporating classical themes of the goddess Astraea and the revival of the classical golden age , with the chivalry of the Round Table . The ceremony was followed by a banquet , hunts , feasting , poetry , dance and theatre , cumulating in a staged siege and fireworks . The court returned to being a centre of culture and learning under James VI . He cultivated the image of a philosopher king , evoking the models of David , Solomon and Constantine that were seen in his " joyous entry " into Edinburgh in 1579 . The grandest event of his reign was the baptism of his son and heir Prince Henry in 1595 . For this the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle was rebuilt to mirror the proportions of the Temple of Solomon . There were three days of feasting , a staged tournament and a masque featuring a ship of state crewed by classical deities and muses . <unk> by William Fowler , it was pointedly designed to build the image of the king and support his claim to the English and Irish thrones . 
 New ideas also had an impact on views of government , described as new or Renaissance monarchy , which emphasised the status and significance of the monarch . The Roman Law principle that " a king is emperor in his own kingdom " , can be seen in Scotland from the mid @-@ fifteenth century . In 1469 Parliament passed an act declaring that James III possessed " full jurisdiction and empire within his realm " . From the 1480s , the king 's image on his silver groats showed him wearing a closed , arched , imperial crown , in place of the open circlet of medieval kings , probably the first coin image of its kind outside Italy . It soon began to appear in heraldry , on royal seals , manuscripts , sculptures and as crown steeples on churches with royal connections , as at St. Giles Cathedral , Edinburgh . The first Scottish monarch to wear such a crown was James V , whose diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532 . They were included when it was reconstructed in 1540 , subsisting in the Crown of Scotland . The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force , defending national borders and interests , royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion . New Monarchy can also be seen in the reliance of the crown on " new men " rather than the great magnates , the use of the clergy as a form of civil service , the development of standing armed forces and a navy . The aggrandisement of the monarchy reached its apogee in James VI 's development of the concept of imperial rule into a divine right . 
 = = Education = = 
 = = = Schools = = = 
 In the early Middle Ages , formal education was limited to monastic life , but from the twelfth century new sources of education had begun to develop , with song and grammar schools . These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs . By the end of the Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns . There were also petty schools , more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education . They were almost exclusively aimed at boys , but by the end of the fifteenth century , Edinburgh also had schools for girls . These were sometimes described as " sewing schools " , and probably taught by lay women or nuns . There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers . The growing emphasis on education in the late Middle Ages , cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496 , which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools and which endorsed the humanist concern to learn " perfyct Latyne " . All this resulted in an increase in literacy , although it was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite , with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the fifteenth century . 
 The humanist concern with widening education was shared by the Protestant reformers , with a desire for a godly people replacing the aim of having educated citizens . In 1560 , the First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish but proved financially impossible . In the burghs the old schools were maintained , with the song schools and a number of new foundations becoming reformed grammar schools or ordinary parish schools . Schools were supported by a combination of kirk funds , contributions from local heritors or burgh councils and from parents that could pay . They were inspected by kirk sessions , who checked for the quality of teaching and doctrinal purity . There were also large number of unregulated " adventure schools " , which sometimes fulfilled a local need and sometimes took pupils away from the official schools . Outside the established burgh schools , a master often combined his position with other employment , particularly minor posts within the kirk , such as clerk . At best the curriculum included catechism , Latin , French , Classical literature and sports . It took until the late seventeenth century to produce a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands , and in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas by the time the Education Act was passed in 1696 , forming the basis of the system 's administration until 1873 . 
 = = = Universities = = = 
 The twelfth @-@ century Renaissance resulted in the emergence of some major intellectual figures from Scotland . Probably the most significant was John Duns Scotus ( c . 1265 – 1308 ) , a major influence on late medieval religious thought . After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in 1296 , English universities were largely closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant . Just over a thousand Scots have been identified as attending continental universities between the twelfth century and 1410 . Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities , such as Walter Wardlaw ( died 1387 ) and Laurence de Lindores ( 1372 ? – 1437 ) . This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413 , the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495 . Initially , these institutions were designed for the training of clerics but would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law . In this period Scottish universities did not teach Greek , focused on metaphysics and put a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle . Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere . Scottish scholars continued to study on the Continent and at English universities which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century . 
 As early as 1495 some Scots were in contact with the leading figure in the northern humanist movement , the Netherlands @-@ born Desiderius Erasmus ( 1466 – 1536 ) . They were also in contact with the French humanist and scholar Jacques Lefèvre d <unk> ( c . 1455 – 1536 ) . Erasmus was tutor to James VI 's illegitimate son , and Archbishop of St. Andrews , Alexander Stewart ( c . 1493 – 1513 ) . These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life . By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece , born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris , returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen . The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century , the most important of whom was John Mair , generally described as a scholastic , but whose Latin History of Greater Britain ( 1521 ) was sympathetic to the humanist social agenda . Another major figure was Archibald Whitelaw , who taught at St. Andrews and Cologne , becoming a tutor to the young James III and royal secretary from 1462 – 93 . Robert Reid , Abbot of Kinloss and later Bishop of Orkney , was responsible in the 1520s and 1530s for bringing the Italian humanist Giovanni Ferrario to teach at Kinloss Abbey , where he established an impressive library and wrote works of Scottish history and biography . Reid was also instrumental in organising the public lectures which were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s on law , Greek , Latin and philosophy , under the patronage of Mary of Guise . They developed into the " Tounis College " , which would become the University of Edinburgh in 1582 . 
 After the Reformation , Scotland 's universities underwent a series of reforms associated with Andrew Melville , who returned from Geneva to become principal of the University of Glasgow in 1574 . Influenced by the anti @-@ Aristotelian Pierre Ramus , he placed an emphasis on simplified logic , elevating languages and sciences to the status enjoyed by philosophy and allowing accepted ideas in all areas to be challenged . He introduced new specialist teaching staff , replacing the system of " regenting " , where one tutor took the students through the entire arts curriculum . Metaphysics was abandoned and Greek became compulsory in the first year , followed by Aramaic , Syriac and Hebrew , launching a new fashion for ancient and biblical languages . Glasgow had probably been declining as a university before his arrival , but students now began to attend in large numbers . Melville assisted in the reconstruction of Marischal College , Aberdeen , and in order to do for St Andrews what he had done for Glasgow , he was appointed Principal of St Mary 's College , St Andrews in 1580 . The result was a revitalisation of all Scottish universities , which were now producing a quality of education the equal of that offered anywhere in Europe . 
 Major intellectual figures in the Reformation included George Buchanan . He taught in universities in France and Portugal , translated texts from Greek into Latin , and was tutor to the young Mary , Queen of Scots for whom he wrote Latin courtly poetry and masques . After her deposition in 1567 , his works De Jure Regni apud Scotos ( 1579 ) and Rerum Scoticarum Historia ( 1582 ) were among the major texts outlining the case for resistance to tyrants . Buchanan was one of the young James VI 's tutors and although he helped in producing a highly educated Protestant prince , who would produce works on subjects including government , poetry and witchcraft , he failed to convince the king of his ideas about limited monarchy . James would debate with both Buchanan and Melville over the status of the crown and kirk . 
 = = Literature = = 
 In the late fifteenth century , Scots prose also began to develop as a genre and to demonstrate classical and humanist influences . Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose , such as the Auchinleck Chronicle , the first complete surviving work includes John Ireland 's The Meroure of Wyssdome ( 1490 ) . There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s , including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode and the treatise Secreta Secetorum , an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle 's advice to Alexander the Great . 
 The establishment of a printing press under royal patent from James IV in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature . The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas 's version of Virgil 's Aeneid , the Eneados . It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language , finished in 1513 , but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden . Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars , poets with links to the royal court . These included James I ( who wrote The Kingis Quair ) . Many of the makars had a university education and so were also connected with the Kirk . However , William Dunbar 's Lament for the Makaris ( <unk> ) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost . Before the advent of printing in Scotland , writers such as Dunbar , Douglas , together with Robert Henryson and Walter Kennedy , have been seen as leading a golden age in Scottish poetry . They continued medieval themes , but were increasingly influenced by new continental trends and the language and forms of the Renaissance . 
 As a patron James V supported poets William Stewart and John Bellenden . Stewart produced a verse version of the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Boece and Bellenden produced a prose translation of Livy 's History of Rome in 1533 . Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon , the head of the Lyon Court and diplomat , was a prolific poet . He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540 , the first surviving full Scottish play , which satirised the corruption of church and state , making use of elements such as medieval morality plays , with a humanist agenda . 
 In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted the literature of the country of his birth . His treatise , Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody , published in 1584 when he was aged 18 , was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue , Scots , to which he applied Renaissance principles . He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians , the Castalian Band , which included William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie . By the late 1590s his championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting the English throne , and some courtier poets who followed the king to London after 1603 , such as William Alexander , began to anglicise their written language . James 's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the Scottish court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama , which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign , but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The impact of the Renaissance on Scottish architecture has been seen as occurring in two distinct phases . The selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture in the early fifteenth century was followed towards the end of the century by a phase of more directly influenced Renaissance palace building . The re @-@ adoption of low @-@ massive church building with round arches and pillars , in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly dominant in England in the late medieval era , may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands , and may have been a conscious reaction to English forms in favour of continental ones . It can be seen in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral , begun in 1406 , the facade of St Mary 's , Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone 's Kings College , Aberdeen ( 1500 – 9 ) . About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries . Many , like Trinity College , Edinburgh , showed a combination of Gothic and Renaissance styles . 
 The extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under James III , accelerated under James IV , reaching its peak under James V. These works have been seen as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles . Linlithgow was first constructed under James I , under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun . From 1429 , it was referred to as a palace , apparently the first use of this term in the country . This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular , corner @-@ towered Italian signorial palace of a palatium ad moden castri ( a castle @-@ style palace ) , combining classical symmetry with neo @-@ chivalric imagery . There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV , in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions . James V encountered the French version of Renaissance building while visiting for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois in 1536 and his second marriage to Mary of Guise may have resulted in longer term connections and influences . Work from his reign largely disregarded the insular style prevalent in England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European , beginning with the extensive work at Linlithgow . This was followed by <unk> at Holyrood , Falkland , Stirling and Edinburgh , described as " some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain " . Rather than slavishly copying continental forms , most Scottish architecture incorporated elements of these styles into traditional local patterns , adapting them to Scottish idioms and materials ( particularly stone and harl ) . Work undertaken for James VI demonstrated continued Renaissance influences , with the Chapel Royal at Stirling having a classical entrance built in 1594 and the North Wing of Linlithgow , built in 1618 , using classical pediments . Similar themes can be seen in the private houses of aristocrats , as in Mar 's Wark , Stirling ( c . 1570 ) and Crichton Castle , built for the Earl of Bothwell in the 1580s . 
 The unique style of great private houses in Scotland , later known as Scots baronial , has been located in origin to the period of the 1560s . It kept many of the features of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces . It drew on the tower houses and peel towers , which had been built in hundreds by local lords since the fourteenth century , particularly in the borders . These abandoned defensible curtain walls for a fortified refuge , designed to outlast a raid , rather than a sustained siege . They were usually of three stories , typically crowned with a parapet , projecting on corbels , continuing into circular bartizans at each corner . New houses retained many of these external features , but with a larger ground plan , classically a " Z @-@ plan " of a rectangular block with towers , as at Colliston Castle ( 1583 ) and Claypotts Castle ( 1569 – 88 ) . Particularly influential was the work of William Wallace , the king 's master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631 . He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618 , Winton House for George Seton , 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on Heriot 's Hospital , Edinburgh . He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan like that used at Château d 'Ancy @-@ le @-@ Franc . This style can be seen in lords houses built at Caerlaverlock ( 1620 ) , Moray House , Edinburgh ( 1628 ) and Drumlanrig Castle ( 1675 – 89 ) , and was highly influential until the baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century . 
 From about 1560 , the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland . Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship , with no need for elaborate buildings divided up by ritual , resulting in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings , ornaments and decoration . There was a need to adapt and build new churches suitable for reformed services , with greater emphasis on preaching and the pulpit . Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles , a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century , as at Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s , Greenock ( 1591 ) and Durness ( 1619 ) . The church of Greyfriars , Edinburgh , built between 1602 and 1620 , used this layout with a largely Gothic form while that at Dirleton ( 1612 ) had a more sophisticated classical style . A variation of the rectangular church that developed in post @-@ Reformation Scotland was the " T " -shaped plan , often used when adapting existing churches as it allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit . Examples can be seen at Kemback in Fife ( 1582 ) and Prestonpans after 1595 . The " T " plan continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at Weem ( 1600 ) , Anstruther Easter , Fife ( 1634 – 44 ) and New Cumnock ( 1657 ) . In the seventeenth century a Greek cross plan was used for churches such as Cawdor ( 1619 ) and Fenwick ( 1643 ) . In most of these cases one arm of the cross was closed off as a laird 's aisle , with the result that they were in effect " T " -plan churches . 
 = = Art = = 
 We know almost nothing about native Scottish artists in the Middle Ages . As in England , the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions , but the versions of native royal portraits that survive from the late Middle Ages are generally crude by continental standards . Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent , particularly the Netherlands , generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance . The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone ; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld ; Hugo van Der Goes 's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh , commissioned by James III ; and the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named . There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries , usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons . These included the prayer book commissioned by Robert Blackadder , Bishop of Glasgow , between 1484 and 1492 and the Flemish illustrated book of hours , known as the Hours of James IV of Scotland , given by James IV to Margaret Tudor and described as " perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use " . 
 Surviving stone and wood carvings , wall paintings and tapestries suggest the richness of sixteenth century royal art . At Stirling Castle , stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German patterns , and like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King 's Presence Chamber , known as the Stirling Heads , they include contemporary , biblical and classical figures . Scotland 's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm , with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass , religious sculpture and paintings . The parallel loss of patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists , who turned to secular patrons . One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls , with large numbers of private houses of burgesses , lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes , of which over a hundred examples survive . These include the ceiling at Prestongrange , undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr , Commendator of Newbattle , and the long gallery at Pinkie House , painted for Alexander Seaton , Earl of Dunfermline , in 1621 . These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism , with elements that call on heraldry , piety , classical myths and allegory . 
 In 1502 Henry VII sent his Flemish portrait painter Maynard Wewyck to the court of James IV and Margaret Tudor . Later in the sixteenth @-@ century anonymous artists made portraits of important individuals , including the Earl of Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon ( 1566 ) , and George , 7th Lord Seton ( c . 1575 ) . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by minorities and regencies between 1513 and 1579 . James VI employed two Flemish artists , Arnold Bronckorst ( floruit , in Scotland , 1580 – 1583 ) and Adrian Vanson ( fl . 1581 – 1602 ) , who have left us a visual record of the king and major figures at the court . The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen ( 1589 / 90 @-@ 1644 ) , who became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I and trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright ( 1617 – 94 ) . 
 = = Music = = 
 The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423 , where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer , may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release . In the late fifteenth century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands , then the centre of musical production in Western Europe , before returning home . They included John Broune , Thomas Inglis and John Fety , the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh , introducing the new five @-@ fingered organ playing technique . In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle , with a new and enlarged choir and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music . Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII 's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503 . The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver ( c . 1488 – 1558 ) , a canon of Scone Abbey . Five masses and two votive <unk> have survived in his <unk> . One of the masses provides the only example of the use of the continental fashion of the cantus firmus to have survived in Britain . The antiphon " Oh Bone Jesu " was scored for 19 voices , perhaps to commemorate the 19th year of the reign of James V. His complex polyphonic music could only have been performed by a large and highly trained choir such as the one employed in the Chapel Royal . James V was also a patron to figures including David Peebles ( c . 1510 – 79 ? ) , whose best known work " Si quis diligit me " ( text from John 14 : 23 ) , is a motet for four voices . These were probably only two of many accomplished composers of their times , their work surviving largely in fragments . 
 In this era Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing . Accounts indicate that there were <unk> at the court from the reign of James III and in the houses of the great lords and clergymen . Instruments also appear in art of the period , with a ceiling at <unk> Castle showing muses with lute , bass viol , fiddle , harp , cittern , flute and <unk> , similar to a mixed consort found in England in this period . Music also became one of the accomplishments of the Renaissance courtier and even royalty . James IV entertained his bride Margaret Tudor during their marriage celebrations by playing " the <unk> and lute " and Margaret herself had been taught the lute as a child . James V , as well as being a major patron of sacred music , was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court , although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives . 
 The Reformation would have a severe impact on church music . The song schools of the abbeys , cathedrals and collegiate churches were closed down , choirs disbanded , music books and manuscripts destroyed and organs removed from churches . The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship , drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs . The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis , which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James , John and Robert Wedderburn . Never adopted by the kirk , they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s . Later the Calvinism that came to dominate the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music , placing an emphasis on what was biblical , which meant the Psalms . The Scottish psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church . It drew on the work of French musician Clément Marot , Calvin 's contributions to the Strasbourg psalter of 1529 and English writers , particularly the 1561 edition of the psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva . The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm , but of 150 psalms , 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century , common tunes , which could be used for psalms with the same metre , became more common . The need for simplicity for whole congregations that would now all sing these psalms , unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns , necessitated simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings . There is some evidence that polyphony survived and was incorporated into editions of the psalter from 1625 , but usually with the congregation singing the melody and trained singers the contra @-@ tenor , treble and bass parts . 
 The return of James V 's daughter Mary from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign , and her position as a Catholic , gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal , but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets , drums , fifes , bagpipes and tabors . Like her father she played the lute , virginals and ( unlike her father ) was a fine singer . She brought French musical influences with her , employing lutenists and viol players in her household . James VI was a major patron of the arts in general . He made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music , attempting to revive burgh song schools from 1579 . He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry . He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment , as did other members of his family . When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I , he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland . Beginning to fall into disrepair , the Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits , leaving the court in Westminster as the only major source of royal musical patronage . 
 = = Decline and influence = = 
 The Renaissance in Scotland has been seen as reaching its peak in the first half of the sixteenth century , between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots . The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603 , changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas . In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism . In art and architecture , Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620 . 
 The legacy of the Renaissance can be seen in the transformation of the ruling elite in Scottish society from a warrior caste to one with more refined morals and values . Humanism created an acceptance of the importance of learning , which contributed to the legacy of the Scottish school and university systems . Specifically , the 1496 Education Act has been seen as establishing a precedent for a public system of education , which was taken up by the reformers in 1560 and informed later legislation and expansion . The establishment of the Scottish universities , and especially the humanist reforms associated with Melville , allowed Scotland to participate in the " educational revolution " of the early modern era and would be vital to the development of the Enlightenment in Scotland . These circumstances have been seen by David <unk> as making education " vital to the sense of Scottishness " . 
 The Renaissance left a legacy across intellectual fields including poetry , historical writing and architecture , which continued into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature . Part of the explanation for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment , is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy , poetry , music , mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe . From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine , law , philosophy , geology and history . Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century . 
 = Alan Wake = 
 Alan Wake is an action @-@ adventure survival horror video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Studios , released for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows . The story follows best @-@ selling thriller novelist Alan Wake , as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife 's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls , Washington , all while experiencing events from the plot in his latest novel , which he cannot remember writing , coming to life . 
 In its pacing and structure , Alan Wake is similar to a thriller television series , with episodes that contain plot twists and cliffhangers . The game itself consists of six episodes , and the fiction is continued by two special episodes , titled " The Signal " and " The Writer " , that were made available as downloadable content ( DLC ) within the same year of the game 's release . Together , they make the first season of a possibly longer story . Additionally , a six @-@ episode live @-@ action web series called Bright Falls acts as a prequel to the game , and a number of related books also expand upon the Alan Wake story . 
 Chiefly written by Sam Lake , Alan Wake took over five years to create — an unusually long development time in the game industry . The game received positive reviews from critics , and is often praised for its visuals , sound , narrative , pacing , and atmosphere . Alan Wake was awarded the first spot in Time magazine 's list of the top 10 video games of 2010 . Alan Wake 's American Nightmare , a full stand @-@ alone title , was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service . 
 On 5 April 2016 , Remedy released Quantum Break , a spiritual successor to Alan Wake , with many references of this game hidden throughout the campaign .

 Alan Wake is an action @-@ adventure psychological horror third @-@ person shooter video game described by Remedy as " the mind of a psychological thriller " and " the body of a cinematic action game " put together . In interviews , the game 's creators hold that the game does not belong squarely in the survival horror video game genre . The game is primarily set in the fictional idyllic small town of Bright Falls , Washington . The main gameplay happens in various areas of Bright Falls – such as the forest , a national park , or a farm – during the night time ; these are punctuated by calmer , non @-@ combative sequences set during the day . 
 The player controls the eponymous protagonist Alan Wake . In the game , a " darkness " is taking over humans , animals and objects . These enemies , dubbed the " Taken " , are murderous shadows that attack Wake , wielding weapons of their own , ranging from mallets and knives to shovels and chainsaws . They vary by speed , size , and the amount of damage they can take , and some can teleport between short distances . Besides the Taken , the player must combat flocks of possessed ravens and animated objects . When enemies are close , Alan can perform a slow @-@ motion cinematic dodge maneuver . 
 The Taken are protected by a shield of darkness , initially rendering them impervious to attack ; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light , which burns the darkness away . This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons , such as a revolver or shotgun . <unk> beams act as a reticle . The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted , which destroys the darkness faster , but also reduces the light 's battery level . Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition , the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out , or wait for it to recharge slowly . The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken . The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy , and a stronger darkness may recharge over time . When a Taken is finally destroyed , it disappears . 
 The player is often encouraged to take advantage of environmental light sources and placing , and to use other light @-@ based weapons and accessories , such as flare guns , hand @-@ held flares and flashbangs . Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken . <unk> and other light stands can provide a safe haven , which the Taken cannot enter , and will regenerate the character 's health faster . Otherwise , health regenerates slowly with time , when not taking any damage . In certain sections of the game , it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls . When in a car , the player can run down Taken on the road , or boost the vehicle 's headlights to destroy them . 
 A major element of gameplay is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake 's latest novel — Departure . Although Wake does not remember writing this book , its storyline seems to be becoming real around him . These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world , out of chronological order ; they often describe scenes that have yet to occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges . Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world ( 100 in all ) , as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series , radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls ' local radio station , and textual signs around the town . The radio shows and signs provide a deeper understanding of the town 's history and culture . The game 's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks . 
 = = Story = = 
 Alan Wake ( voiced by Matthew Porretta ) is a best @-@ selling psychological thriller author but has been suffering from a two @-@ year stretch of writer 's block . He and his wife Alice travel to the small mountain town of Bright Falls in the state of Washington for a short vacation on the advice of Alice and his friend and agent Barry Wheeler . Before arrival , Alan has a nightmare about shadowy figures who tried to harm him before an ethereal figure interrupts his dream and teaches him how to use light to fight the shadows . On their arrival , Alan goes to retrieve the keys and map to their rented cabin from Carl Stucky , the cabins landlord , but he is visited by a mysterious old woman , who tells him that Stucky had fallen ill and she was entrusted to give Alan the keys . After Alan leaves , Stucky is shown trying catch up to him and give him the real keys . 
 Alan and Alice arrive at a cabin on an island in the middle of Cauldron Lake . As they unpack , Alan finds that Alice arranged this trip to try to break his writer 's block , scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him . Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk , but runs back when Alice cries for help . He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake 's waters by a mysterious force . Alan dives into the water after her , blacking out as he submerges . 
 Alan regains consciousness a week later , apparently having driven his car off the road , but with no memory of how he got there . He starts to head back towards town , but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him . He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light . Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with his name on the by @-@ line , a work he has had not written . Eventually making it to town , Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Barker of his wife 's disappearance , but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior . Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice 's disappearance , while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help . 
 Alan receives a call from man purporting to be Alice 's kidnapper , demanding the pages of Departure in exchange for her . Meeting at a state park , Alan is about to turn over the pages when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out . He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman 's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake . Dr. Hartman listens to Alan 's story , and believes he is suffering a psychotic break , everything that he 's witnessed part of his imagination . Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it ; while running , Alan finds evidence that Dr. Hartman is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake . Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside . Returning to town , they find the FBI have arrived , and attempt to arrest him , before the shadowy forces inter @-@ vein , allowing Alan and Barry to escape . 
 Alan and Barry start to learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk . They believe an entity called the Dark Presence is trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality . It has previously tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane — the figure in the diving suit — but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island . The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan . That night , as Alan and Barry take shelter , they get drunk on moonshine , and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week , and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape . 
 Sarah and the FBI arrive to arrest the two , but the shadowy figures drag the FBI agents away . Sarah , now convinced of the Dark Presence , helps Alan and Barry to find Cynthia Weaver , a hermit that fears the Dark Presence . She shows them to the " Well @-@ Lit Room " and to a weapon that is able to defeat the Dark Presence : the Clicker , a simple light switch that has been infused with the power of Alan 's writings . Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone to face the Dark Presence , using his newfound ability to affect reality with his thoughts aided by the Clicker . The Dark Presence is dispelled but there is no sign of Alice , and Alan believes that to maintain balance , he must give himself to the lake . As Alan sinks below the waters , Alice climbs safely out of the lake . Within the depths of the lake , Alan finds himself in the cabin , and realises that Departure is not yet finished , and turns back to the typewriter to continue the story and write his own means to be free of the lake . He comments to himself that " It 's not a lake — it 's an ocean . "
