 = Behind That Locked Door = 
 " Behind That Locked Door " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . Harrison wrote the song in August 1969 as a message of encouragement to Bob Dylan , who was making a highly publicised comeback to the concert stage , accompanied by the Band , with a headlining performance at the Isle of Wight Festival . " Behind That Locked Door " is a rare Harrison composition in the country music genre and the second song dealing with the friendship between himself and Dylan , after their 1968 collaboration " I 'd Have You Anytime " . Its lyrics address Dylan 's elusive nature , and reflect the high regard in which Harrison held the American singer 's work . The same reluctance on Dylan 's part to re @-@ engage with a concert audience led to him retreating again from live performance until August 1971 , when he responded to Harrison 's request to play at the Concert for Bangladesh . 
 Harrison recorded " Behind That Locked Door " in London early in the summer of 1970 , shortly after taking part in a session for Dylan 's New Morning album in New York . Co @-@ produced by Phil Spector , the recording features a prominent contribution from Nashville pedal steel virtuoso Pete Drake , and twin keyboard parts from Gary Wright and Billy Preston in the tradition of the Band , whose sound influenced Harrison 's arrangement . With its understated performance , the track is a comparatively rare departure from the big production commonly associated with All Things Must Pass . On release , Alan Smith of the NME described the song as " a tremendous piece of country @-@ meets @-@ Hawaii " and recommended that it be sent to country singer Slim Whitman " without further delay " . 
 An alternate take of " Behind That Locked Door " appears on the 2012 Harrison compilation Early Takes : Volume 1 . Olivia Newton @-@ John , Jim James , the Felice Brothers and Norah Jones are among the artists who have covered the song .

 In mid August 1969 , Bob Dylan had confounded the media 's expectations by shunning the Woodstock Festival , an event he had helped to inspire . Instead , after three years in virtual seclusion with his family , Dylan decided to make his comeback a fortnight after Woodstock , by headlining the Isle of Wight Festival at Wootton , just off the south coast of England . Now a popular act in their own right , the Band agreed to back Dylan for the performance , just as they had ( as the Hawks ) on his controversial 1966 world tour . In a repeat of his UK concerts from 1966 , leading figures in the English music scene began to gather on the island to show their support for Dylan , the singer widely considered " the minstrel to a generation " . 
 Alone among the many celebrity guests , George Harrison had spent time with Dylan during his period away from the limelight , in Bearsville , near Woodstock . In between promoting Radha Krishna Temple ( London ) ' s debut single on Apple Records , his own production of " Hare Krishna Mantra " , Harrison and wife Pattie Boyd stayed with Dylan 's family at <unk> Farm , near Bembridge , during the week preceding the festival . The two musicians strengthened the bond they had established in upstate New York and were heard performing near @-@ perfect impersonations of the Everly Brothers in the farmhouse . 
 In addition to a crowd estimated at 200 @,@ 000 , a group of 300 American journalists descended on the Isle of Wight , adding unwelcome pressure on Dylan . In the days leading up to his performance on Sunday , 31 August , the British press dubbed the event " D Day " , in reference to the Allies ' invasion of German @-@ occupied France in June 1944 ; in the words of music journalist John Harris , " Dylan 's show had by now been inflated into the gig of the decade . " As a further impediment to Dylan 's planned comeback , audiences in 1969 expected to hear the rock music associated with his and the Hawks ' 1965 – 66 tours , a style that he had abandoned with his recent country album , Nashville Skyline . This contrast was encouraged by the organisers ' promotional campaign for the event , particularly in the design for the official festival posters . Referring to Dylan 's more conservative 1969 image , author Clinton Heylin writes : " There was little doubt that this was a different Dylan , even if the graphic on the fluttering posters advertising the festival was a stark black @-@ and @-@ white shot of a <unk> Dylan in classic ' 66 pose . " The arrival of Harrison 's fellow Beatles John Lennon and Ringo Starr , on Saturday , 30 August , added to the heightened speculation that one or more members of the band might make a guest appearance with Dylan the following evening . 
 Harrison gifted Dylan his vintage Gibson J @-@ 200 acoustic guitar before the show and was then taken aback that Dylan arranged for " Hare Krishna Mantra " to be played over the PA minutes before he and the Band went on stage . Mukunda Goswami , one of the six pioneer devotees who founded the Hare Krishna movement 's London temple and played on the recording , has identified this exposure as reflective of how the ancient Maha Mantra " penetrated British society " as a result of the Harrison @-@ produced single . Harrison watched Dylan 's performance from the VIP enclosure , an experience that informed the lyrics to a new composition , " Behind That Locked Door " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 John Harris describes " Behind That Locked Door " as a " sweet acknowledgement of Dylan 's shyness " . According to Harrison 's recollection in a December 2000 interview for Billboard magazine , he began writing the song the night before Dylan played . Further to the statement of friendship in their 1968 collaboration " I 'd Have You Anytime " – which Harrison began as a way of getting Dylan to let down his guard and " Let me in here " – in " Behind That Locked Door " , he urges Dylan to confide in a friend and " let out your heart " . 
 Author Ian Inglis notes the Isle of Wight performance as having been a " hugely important and anxious occasion " for Dylan and views Harrison 's opening verse as a " personal plea " for him to " pull out of his depression , to face the world again , and to look to the future " . After asking " Why are you still crying ? " , Harrison assures Dylan that " The love you are blessed with / This world 's waiting for … " 
 In the second verse , Harrison sings of how he values Dylan 's friendship , together with " the tales you have told me / From the things that you saw " . For much of his career , Harrison repeatedly identified Dylan as one of his biggest musical influences , along with Ravi Shankar . To Inglis , these verse @-@ two lines reflect the level of Harrison 's respect for his work , since " while millions of others may look to the Beatles for guidance , he looks to Dylan " . 
 Harrison musical biographer Simon Leng observes that , in the " counseling " Harrison gives Dylan in " Behind That Locked Door " , he anticipates his own " slough of <unk> " during 1973 – 75 . This self @-@ styled " naughty period " of Harrison 's coincided with the failure of his marriage to Boyd and a fall from grace with music critics following his 1974 " Dark Horse Tour " – a tour on which , similar to Dylan in 1969 , Harrison defied public expectation and attempted to break from his Beatle past . In the final verse to " Behind That Locked Door " , he asks for Dylan 's support in such a scenario : 
 And if ever my love goes 
 If I 'm rich or I 'm poor 
 Come and let out my heart , please , please 
 From behind that locked door . 
 Musically , the song is set in a slow , country @-@ waltz time signature with , as Leng observes , melody and lyrics working " in tandem " . Within each couplet , a rising musical figure presents the " problem " ( " Why are you still crying ? " ) , while the second line consists of a " falling melodic consolation " ( " Your pain is now through " ) . In his 1980 autobiography , Harrison offers little comment about " Behind That Locked Door " , aside from identifying the inspiration behind the song and admitting : " It was a good excuse to do a country tune with pedal steel guitar . " 
 = = Aftermath to the Isle of Wight Festival = = 
 Dylan 's set at the festival was roundly viewed as anticlimactic , if not a " Midnight Flop ! " , in the opinion of one British tabloid . Having recently told Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner that he would return to touring that autumn , Dylan abandoned the idea and also cancelled the proposed live album from his Isle of Wight performance . Showing support for Dylan in the fallout from his comeback , in a late 1969 interview Harrison included the American singer in his personal list of essential contemporary rock artists , saying : " The Beatles , [ the ] Stones , Bob Dylan , Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie , and that 's it . Who needs anything else ? " 
 Inglis highlights " Behind That Locked Door " as an example of how Harrison 's songwriting reflects his " fondness " for family and close friends . Dylan 's reluctance to perform live again was only broken by his friendship with Harrison , when the latter persuaded him to play at the Concert for Bangladesh shows in New York in August 1971 . Although Dylan had been noncommittal about playing at that event until the last minute , a mutual friend of his and Harrison 's , journalist Al Aronowitz , had assured Boyd , " Bob wouldn 't let George down " ; another performer at the shows , drummer Jim Keltner , has said that Dylan felt a special closeness towards Harrison as a result of the Concert for Bangladesh . Four years later , while Harrison was dejected following what author Elliot Huntley terms the " tsunami of bile that the Dark Horse album had unleashed " , he spent considerable time with Dylan in Los Angeles . According to Mukunda Goswami , speaking in a 1982 interview with Harrison , Dylan became a regular visitor to the Los Angeles Radha Krishna temple and embraced the practice of chanting . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Following the Beatles ' break @-@ up in April 1970 , and shortly before beginning work on All Things Must Pass , Harrison participated in a recording session in New York for Dylan 's New Morning album . Among the many tracks they played were " Working on the Guru " , Dylan 's " gentle prod " at Harrison 's association with the Hare Krishna movement , Harris writes , and " If Not for You " , a new Dylan song that Harrison decided to cover on his own album . Dylan also supplied him with a phone number for Pete Drake , the Nashville @-@ based pedal @-@ steel guitarist and record producer whose work had graced " Lay Lady Lay " and other songs on Nashville Skyline . Harrison later praised Drake 's pedal steel playing as " the bagpipes of country & western music " . 
 Working at Abbey Road Studios in London with co @-@ producer Phil Spector , Harrison recorded " Behind That Locked Door " during the first batch of sessions for All Things Must Pass , between late May and early June 1970 . Drake 's pedal steel features strongly on the recording , providing a commentary to Harrison 's vocal in the verses , as well as a mid @-@ song solo , supported by Hammond organ from Billy Preston , and Gary Wright on piano . The arrangement for " Behind That Locked Door " reflects the enduring influence of the Band 's sound on Harrison – through the use of two keyboard players , acoustic guitars , and a restrained backing from the rhythm section , comprising Klaus Voormann on bass and , in Huntley 's description , Alan White 's " shuffle beat " drums . For some years after the song 's release , rumours claimed that it was the Band themselves backing Harrison on the track . 
 Leng credits all three acoustic guitar parts to Harrison , although other sources suggest that Peter Frampton may have participated at the session . Harrison also overdubbed all the backing vocals ( credited on the album to " the George O 'Hara @-@ Smith Singers " ) , a feat much admired by Spector , who has noted Harrison 's willingness to " experiment upon experiment " with his harmony singing on All Things Must Pass . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " Behind That Locked Door " was released as the third track on side two of Harrison 's All Things Must Pass triple album , in November 1970 . Ian Inglis writes of its position in the track order : " In the middle of an album whose songs sweep across the grand themes of history , religion , love , sex , and death , [ ' Behind That Locked Door ' ] is a surprising and touching gesture of simple friendship from one man to another . " The release followed speculation in the music press regarding the Dylan – Harrison joint session in May , and conversely , the critics ' lambasting of Dylan 's Self Portrait double album , released in June 1970 . In his review of All Things Must Pass , the NME 's Alan Smith declared " Behind That Locked Door " a " standout " and " a tremendous piece of country @-@ meets @-@ Hawaii , which should be sent to Slim Whitman without further delay " . Less impressed , Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone dismissed the song as " an inexplicable bit of C & W schlock " , although he conceded that it had a " lovely , lilting background vocal " . Later in the 1970s , Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner highlighted " Behind That Locked Door " and the other Dylan @-@ influenced songs on All Things Must Pass as being " far more intimate , both musically and lyrically , than the rest of the album " . 
 Reviewers and biographers in the 21st century invariably recognise its place among Bob Dylan 's work on his John Wesley Harding ( 1967 ) and Nashville Skyline albums . Writing in Goldmine magazine in 2002 , Dave Thompson remarked : " indeed , this tribute to Dylan 's famous reticence sounds so close to a lost Zim original that His <unk> ' own ' Baby , Stop Crying ' ( from 1978 's Street Legal ) is all but reduced to tributary status itself in comparison . " 
 Alan Clayson approves of the more " understated production aesthetic " next to what he views as an at @-@ times " bloated " sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass . Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison 's success in " temper [ ing ] Phil Spector 's taste for the extreme " and describes " Behind That Locked Door " as one of its composer 's " more attractive " songs , with a fine lead vocal . " [ It ] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another 's pain , " Leng adds , " suggesting that , unlike some of his contemporaries , he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe for a moment or two at least . " In his book Phil Spector : Out of His Head , Richard Williams identifies " Behind That Locked Door " as an example of " how sympathetic to the performer " Spector could be as a producer , in this case , by giving the recording a " mellow , autumnal mix " that " beautifully display [ s ] " Drake 's pedal steel . 
 Elliot Huntley writes that the track provides a showcase for Harrison 's " melodic flair " , as well as a reason to wonder why the ex @-@ Beatle did not record more songs in the country @-@ music genre , since " certainly he seems perfectly at home in these comfortable surroundings " . Huntley speculates on the " interesting " possibility of a whole LP side of similar " ersatz country and western " tracks , as the Rolling Stones would do on their Exile on Main St. double album in 1972 . Harrison biographer Joshua Greene describes the song as a celebration of " love 's victory over pain " .

 In November 2011 , an early take of " Behind That Locked Door " , featuring Harrison 's vocal backed by just two acoustic guitars and Drake 's pedal steel , was included in the British deluxe @-@ edition CD / DVD release of Martin Scorsese 's Living in the Material World documentary . This version appeared worldwide on the Early Takes : Volume 1 compilation in May 2012 . Giles Martin , who went through Harrison 's musical archive at Friar Park while compiling the album , notes the " folk @-@ tinged spoken word quality " of Harrison 's singing on this take , an example of " a kind of conversational intimacy " that he brought to his recordings . 
 Rolling Stone critic David Fricke describes this version of the song as a " sweet Nashville reading " . The Independent 's album reviewer finds it a " [ p ] <unk> engaging " inclusion on a compilation that allows " the sweeter side of George Harrison 's character to shine unencumbered by studio blandishments " .

 = Russian monitor Lava = 
 Lava ( Russian : <unk> ) was an Uragan @-@ class monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . The design was based on the American Passaic @-@ class monitor , but was modified to suit Russian engines , guns and construction techniques . Spending her entire career with the Baltic Fleet , the ship was only active when the Gulf of Finland was not frozen , but very little is known about her service . She was struck from the Navy List in 1900 , converted into a barracks ship in 1902 and then into a storage hulk for mines in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 1 . During World War I , she was converted into a hospital ship in 1916 and was then abandoned by the Soviets in Finland in 1918 ; the ship was probably later scrapped by the Finns around 1922 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Lava was 201 feet ( 61 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , with a beam of 46 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 10 @.@ 16 – 10 @.@ 84 feet ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 524 – 1 @,@ 626 t ) , and her crew numbered eight officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865 . They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877 . 
 The ship was fitted with a two @-@ cylinder , horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine built by Carr and MacPherson of Saint Petersburg . It drove a single propeller using steam that was provided by two rectangular boilers . Specific information on the output of the ship 's engine has not survived , but it ranged between 340 – 500 indicated horsepower ( 254 – 373 kW ) for all the ships of this class . During Lava 's sea trials on 12 July 1865 , she reached a maximum speed of 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 190 long tons ( 193 t ) of coal , which gave her a theoretical endurance of 1 @,@ 440 nmi ( 2 @,@ 670 km ; 1 @,@ 660 mi ) at 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 Lava was designed to be armed with a pair of nine @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading guns purchased from Krupp of Germany and rifled in Russia , but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine @-@ inch smoothbores . These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license @-@ built fifteen @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading Rodman guns in 1867 – 68 . The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine @-@ inch rifled guns . 
 All of the wrought @-@ iron armor that was used in the Uragan @-@ class monitors was in 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates , just as in the Passaic @-@ class ships . The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates , of which the three innermost plates extended 42 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) below the waterline . This armor was backed by a wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of 36 inches ( 914 mm ) . The gun turret was protected by eleven layers of armor and the pilothouse above it had eight layers of armor . Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the funnel up to a height of 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) above the deck . Unlike their predecessors , the Uragans were built without deck armor to save weight , but Lava 's deck was reinforced by the addition of 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) armor plates after completion . 
 = = Career = = 
 Construction of the ship began on 7 September 1863 at the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Lava was laid down on 15 December 1863 and she was launched on 8 June 1864 . She entered service on 1 September 1865 and cost a total of 1 @,@ 142 @,@ 700 rubles , almost double her contract cost of 600 @,@ 000 rubles . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she , and all of her sister ships except Latnik , made a port visit to Stockholm , Sweden in July – August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich . She was present when the American warships Miantonomoh and Augusta visited Kronstadt in July – August 1866 . 
 Sometime after Lava was completed , an armored ring , 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and 15 inches ( 381 mm ) tall , was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it . Later , an armored , outward @-@ curving bulwark was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there . Three sponsons were later added , probably during the 1870s , to the upper portion of the turret . Each sponson , one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret , mounted a light gun , probably a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) Engstrem gun , for defense against torpedo boats . A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret , also probably during the 1870s . 
 Little is known about the ship 's career other than that she was assigned to the newly formed Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870 and she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze . Lava was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900 , although she was not stricken until 17 August . The ship was used as a floating barracks by the Third Destroyer Division from 1902 to 1908 and was then used as an observation post during gunnery training . Lava was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 1 on 14 April of that year . She was converted into a floating hospital in 1916 and may have received her old name at that time . She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors ( Helsinki ) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk , but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922 . The ship was supposedly broken up there around that time , but may have still been in existence in 1941 . 
 = John Benjamin Murphy = 
 John Benjamin Murphy , born John Murphy ( December 21 , 1857 in Appleton , Wisconsin – August 11 , 1916 Mackinac Island , Michigan ) , was an American physician and abdominal surgeon noted for advocating early surgical intervention in appendicitis appendectomy , and several eponyms : Murphy ’ s button , Murphy drip , Murphy ’ s punch , Murphy ’ s test , and Murphy @-@ Lane bone skid . He is best remembered for the eponymous clinical sign that is used in evaluating patients with acute cholecystitis . His career spanned general surgery , orthopedics , neurosurgery , and cardiothoracic surgery , which helped him to gain international prominence in the surgical profession . Mayo Clinic co @-@ founder William James Mayo called him " the surgical genius of our generation " . 
 Over the course of his career he was renowned as a surgeon , a clinician , a teacher , an innovator , and an author . In addition to general surgical operations , such as appendectomy , <unk> , bowel resection for intestinal obstruction , and mastectomy , he performed and described innovative procedures in neurosurgery , orthopedics , gynecology , urology , plastic surgery , thoracic surgery , and vascular surgery . He also ventured into techniques such as <unk> , <unk> , prostatectomy , nephrectomy , hysterectomy , bone grafting , and <unk> . 
 = = Life and death = = 
 Murphy was born in a log cabin in Appleton , Wisconsin . His parents , Michael Murphy and Ann Grimes Murphy , were Irish immigrants who escaped from the potato famine and who later raised him on their own farm . He was a striking , mercurial figure : tall and strong with a red beard and mustache . 
 Murphy died of heart disease in Mackinac Island , Michigan after having been ill for six months . He was staying at the Grand Hotel and was attended by his wife and Drs. L. L. MacArthur and James Keefe . After he suffered from angina pectoris for several years , his death was attributed to <unk> . Two days prior to his death he correctly predicted the findings of his own autopsy : " I think the necropsy will show plaques in my aorta . " 
 = = Education and training = = 
 Murphy attended public school in Appleton and graduated from Appleton High School in 1876 . He obtained a doctorate from Rush Medical College in 1879 and entered an eighteen @-@ month internship at Cook County Hospital . He then practiced there briefly . From 1882 – 1884 he performed practical work at universities and hospitals in Vienna , Munich , Berlin and Heidelberg . Most of this time was spent working in Vienna with Theodor <unk> , who introduced <unk> techniques that are still in use today . 
 = = Academic career = = 
 After his sojourn in Europe , he returned to Chicago to start a general practice . He was quickly recognized as a leader in abdominal surgery and was appointed lecturer in surgery at Rush Medical College at the end of 1884 . In 1890 he was elected Professor of Surgery . In 1892 , he was named Professor of Clinical Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons ( currently University of Illinois College of Medicine ) . By 1899 , he had become acclaimed for bone surgery . From 1901 – 1905 he held a position at the Northwestern University Medical School . From 1905 – 1908 , he worked at Rush Medical College , and from 1908 – 1916 he returned to Northwestern University Medical School . Meanwhile , he also taught at the Graduate Medical School of Chicago , and from 1895 until his death in 1916 , he was the surgeon @-@ in @-@ chief at the Mercy Hospital . From 1908 on he also held a commission in the Army Reserve Medical Corps . 
 While at Mercy , he developed a following for his " wet clinics " , in which he operated and lectured to an audience . Physicians from around the world attended these sessions . The only method for wider dissemination of these lectures and demonstrations was print publication . A secretary transcribed his words , and they were printed as " The Surgical Clinics of John B. Murphy , M.D. , at Mercy Hospital , Chicago " . This became ' The Surgical Clinics of Chicago " , and , subsequently , the " Surgical Clinics of North America " , which continue in publication in 2008 . 
 = = Notable experiences = = 
 Early in his career , on May 4 , 1886 , he was one of the doctors summoned to the scene of the Haymarket Affair in the Near West Side community area of Chicago . He dressed approximately 30 men while working until 3 : 30 AM . A bomb had been thrown at the Chicago Police officers leading to several deaths and a high profile trial , in which Murphy was called to testify . The labor unrest leading up to and surrounding the events led to the tradition of May Day labor rallies . 
 After an October 14 , 1912 assassination attempt on former United States President Theodore Roosevelt in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , Roosevelt was brought to Chicago 's Mercy Hospital . When he asked Roosevelt about any fears he might have about his bullet wound he said that Roosevelt responded , " I 've hunted long enough , Doctor , to know that you can 't kill a Bull Moose with a short gun .

 Although his surgical prowess was not questioned , his approach to practice was considered pretentious by a segment of his professional colleagues in the U.S. , and his work was more highly regarded by his contemporaries in Europe than in Chicago . He was an early advocate of intervention via the removal of the appendix in all cases of appendicitis . His thoughts were controversial in a time of conservative management of appendicitis . Having been met with skepticism after his first presentation of appendectomy , he gathered evidence from 250 cases and presented his opinions again as an authority on the subject . 
 He was known for the following eponyms : Murphy ’ s button ( a mechanical device used for intestinal anastomosis ) , Murphy ’ s punch ( a punch tenderness at the <unk> @-@ vertebral angle in cases of <unk> abscess ) , Murphy 's sign ( a sign of inflammation of the gallbladder ) , Murphy ’ s test ( a test for deep @-@ seated tenderness and muscular rigidity in cases of <unk> abscess ) , Murphy drip for administration of fluids by <unk> in patients with peritonitis , and Murphy @-@ Lane bone skid ( a common commercial steel instrument used for femoral head procedures ) . 
 Murphy developed his eponymous <unk> button for a <unk> anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum ( his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis ) , but it was equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses . He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it less than a week after developing it on a dog . The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end @-@ to @-@ end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years . 
 In 1896 , Murphy was the first person to successfully unite a femoral artery severed by a gunshot wound . In 1898 , Murphy was first in the United States to induce artificial immobilization and collapse of the lung ( pneumothorax ) in treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis . He pioneered bone grafting techniques and made inroads in the management of ankylosis , especially with reconstruction . He was also considered an innovator for surgical intervention for prostate cancer , performance of end @-@ to @-@ end anastomosis of hollow viscera . 
 In 1912 , he performed what was arguably the first biliary tract endoscopy . 
 He was a founding member of the American College of Surgeons . 
 = = Honors = = 
 He was knighted with the Order of St. Gregory the Great at the direction of Pope Benedict XV by Archbishop George <unk> on June 16 , 1916 . He was awarded Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame in 1902 , and a Doctor of Science by University of Sheffield , England in 1908 . 
 Although Murphy 's flamboyant demeanour and consequent unpopularity among his colleagues kept him from early membership in several professional associations , he was eventually elected President of both the Chicago Medical Society and the American Medical Association ( AMA ) .The American Surgical Association realized their mistake and belatedly granted Murphy membership . 
 There is a public elementary school named in his honor the John B. Murphy Public School located at <unk> West Grace Street in the Irving Park community area on the northwest side of Chicago , which opened in 1924 . 
 = Zinfandel = 
 Zinfandel ( also known as Primitivo ) is a variety of black @-@ skinned wine grape . The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards . DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Kaštelanski and Tribidrag , as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia ( the " heel " of Italy ) , where it was introduced in the 18th century . The grape found its way to the United States in the mid @-@ 19th century , where it became known by variations of the name " Zinfandel " , a name which is probably of Austrian origin . 
 The grapes typically produce a robust red wine , although in the United States a semi @-@ sweet rosé ( blush @-@ style ) wine called White Zinfandel has six times as many sales as the red wine . The grape 's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent . 
 The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made . Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas , whereas blackberry , anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier @-@ ripening Primitivo clone .

 = = = Europe ( 6000 BCE – 1870 ) = = = 
 Archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of Vitis vinifera occurred in the Caucasus region around 6000 BCE , and winemaking was discovered shortly after that . Cultivation of the vine subsequently spread to the Mediterranean and surrounding regions . Croatia once had several indigenous varieties related to Zinfandel , which formed the basis of its wine industry in the 19th century . This diversity suggests that the grapes have been grown in Croatia longer than anywhere else . However , these varieties were almost entirely wiped out by the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century , eventually reducing Zinfandel to just nine vines of locally @-@ known " Crljenak Kaštelanski " discovered in 2001 on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia . 
 The first documented use of the term Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s . The name derives from the terms <unk> or <unk> , which refer to the grape 's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties . This name 's appearance , 40 years after the first documented use of the term Zinfandel , was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic ; however , this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine 's Croatian origin . 
 Primitivo is now thought to have been introduced as a distinct clone into the Apulia region of Italy in the 18th century . Don Francesco Filippo <unk> , the priest of the church at Gioia del Colle near Bari , selected an early ( " primo " ) ripening plant of the <unk> variety and planted it in <unk> . This clone ripened at the end of August and became widespread throughout northern Apulia . Cuttings came to the other great Primitivo DOC ( <unk> di origine <unk> or " denomination of controlled origin " ) as part of the dowry of the Countess <unk> of Altamura when she married Don Tommaso Schiavoni @-@ Tafuri of Manduria in the late 19th century .

 The arrival of Zinfandel in the United States may have been via the Imperial Nursery in Vienna , Austria , which probably obtained the vines during the Habsburg Monarchy 's rule over Croatia , which was expanded when Austria acquired the Dalmatian territories of the former Republic of Venice in 1797 . George Gibbs , a horticulturist on Long Island , received shipments of grapes from Schönbrunn and elsewhere in Europe between 1820 and 1829 . Sullivan suggests that the " Black <unk> of Hungary " mentioned by William Robert Prince in A Treatise on the Vine ( 1830 ) may have referred to one of Gibbs 's 1829 acquisitions . Webster suggests that the name is a modification of the Hungarian <unk> ( <unk> ) , which derives from the German <unk> , a white grape ( <unk> Sylvaner ) from Austria 's <unk> . 
 Gibbs visited Boston in 1830 , and Samuel Perkins of that city began selling " <unk> " soon afterward . In 1830 , Gibbs also supplied Prince with " Black St. Peters " , a similar variety that may have come from England , where many vines have " St. Peters " in their names . Little is known about this vine , except that the Black St. Peters that arrived in California in the 1850s was the same as what became known as Zinfandel by the 1870s . 
 By 1835 Charles M. Hovey , Boston ’ s leading nurseryman , was recommending " Zinfindal " as a table grape , and it was soon widely grown in heated greenhouses for the production of table grapes as early as June . The first reference to making wine from " Zinfindal " appears in John Fisk Allen 's Practical Treatise in the Culture and Treatment of the Grape Vine ( 1847 ) . Meanwhile , the fad of hothouse cultivation faded in the 1850s as attention turned to the Concord and other grape varieties that could be grown outdoors in Boston . 
 = = = California ( 1850 – 1933 ) = = = 
 Prince and other nurserymen such as Frederick W. <unk> joined the California Gold Rush in the 1850s , and took Zinfandel with them . Prince 's notebook records that the grape dried " perfectly to Raisin " and that he believed his Zinfandel was the same as the " Black Sonora " he found in California . When the vine known as " Black St. Peters " arrived in California , it was initially regarded as a distinct variety , but by the 1870s it was recognized as the same grape as Zinfandel . 
 Joseph W. Osborne may have made the first wine from Zinfandel in California . He planted Zinfandel from <unk> at his Oak Knoll vineyard just north of Napa , and his wine was much praised in 1857 . Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after , and by the end of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California . 
 These Zinfandel old vines are now treasured for the production of premium red wine , but many were ripped up in the 1920s , during the Prohibition years ( 1920 – 1933 ) , but not for the obvious reason . Even during the Prohibition , home winemaking remained effectively legal , and some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home . While Zinfandel grapes proved popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards , it was vulnerable to rot on the long journey to East Coast markets . The thick @-@ skinned Alicante Bouschet was less susceptible to rot , so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market . 3000 cars – about 38 @,@ 000 short tons ( 34 @,@ 000 t ) – of Zinfandel grapes were shipped in 1931 , compared to 6000 cars of Alicante Bouschet . 
 = = = Rediscovery after Prohibition ( 1933 – present ) = = = 
 By 1930 , the wine industry had weakened due to the Great Depression and Prohibition . Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California 's Central Valley , a non @-@ optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel . Thus , the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes , and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines . However , some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines . 
 By the middle of the 20th century the origins of California Zinfandel had been forgotten . In 1972 , one British wine writer wrote , " there is a fascinating Californian grape , the <unk> , said to have come from Hungary , but apparently a <unk> now unknown there . " In 1974 and 1981 , American wine writers described it as " a California original , grown nowhere else " and " California 's own red grape " . 
 In 1972 , Bob <unk> of the Sutter Home Winery decided to try draining some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel . He <unk> this juice as a dry wine , and tried to sell it under the name of <unk> de <unk> , a Swiss wine made by this <unk> method . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation , so he added " White Zinfandel " to the name , and sold 220 cases . At the time , demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes , encouraging other California producers to make " white " wine from red grapes , with minimal skin contact . However , in 1975 , <unk> 's wine experienced a stuck fermentation , a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol . He put the wine aside for two weeks , then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker , sugary wine . Just as Mateus Rosé had become a huge success in Europe after World War II , this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular . White Zinfandel still accounts for 9 @.@ 9 % of U.S. wine sales by volume ( 6 @.@ 3 % by value ) , six times the sales of red Zinfandel . Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California 's Central Valley . 
 Wine critics considered white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s , although modern white Zinfandels have more fruit and less cloying sweetness . Nevertheless , the success of this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas , which came into their own at the end of the 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion . Although the two wines taste dramatically different , both are made from the same ( red ) grapes , processed in a different way . 
 = = Relationship to Primitivo , Crljenak Kaštelanski and Tribidrag = = 
 Zinfandel was long considered " America 's vine and wine " , but when University of California , Davis ( UCD ) professor Austin Goheen visited Italy in 1967 , he noticed how wine made from Primitivo reminded him of Zinfandel . Others also made the connection about that time . Primitivo was brought to California in 1968 , and ampelographers declared it identical to Zinfandel in 1972 . The first wine made from these California vines in 1975 also seemed identical to Zinfandel . In 1975 , PhD student Wade Wolfe showed that the two varieties had identical isozyme fingerprints . 
 Dr. Lamberti of Bari had suggested to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo might be the Croatian variety Plavac Mali . By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical , probably by isozyme analysis . Some Croatians , however , became convinced that Plavac Mali was the same as Zinfandel , among them Croatian @-@ born winemaker Mike <unk> . In 1991 <unk> and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers ( ZAP ) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine , and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel . With this support , UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia , in collaboration with the University of Zagreb . 
 In 1993 , Meredith used a DNA fingerprinting technique to confirm that Primitivo and Zinfandel are clones of the same variety . Comparative field trials have found that " Primitivo selections were generally superior to those of Zinfandel , having earlier fruit maturity , similar or higher yield , and similar or lower bunch rot susceptibility . " This is consistent with the theory that Primitivo was selected as an early @-@ ripening clone of a Croatian grape . 
 By 1998 , Meredith 's team realized that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel but rather that one was the parent of the other . In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo / Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali . The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić ( University of Zagreb ) to be <unk> , an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta . 
 This discovery narrowed down the search to the central Dalmatian coastal strip and its offshore islands . Eventually a matching DNA fingerprint was found among the samples . The match came from a vine sampled in 2001 in the vineyard of Ivica <unk> in Kaštel Novi . This Crljenak Kaštelanski ( " Kaštela Red " ) appears to represent Primitivo / Zinfandel in its original home , although some genetic divergence may have occurred since their separation . Meredith now refers to the variety as " ZPC " – Zinfandel / Primitivo / Crljenak Kaštelanski . 
 This Croatian vineyard contained just nine Crljenak Kaštelanski vines mixed with thousands of other vines . In 2002 , additional vines known locally as <unk> were found in the Dalmatian coastal town of Omiš . Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards , although virus infections have delayed their release . The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletić in 2005 . Meanwhile , plantings of Primitivo have increased in California , where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling . Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors . 
 In the 2012 book Wine Grapes Masters of wine <unk> Robinson and Julia Harding and Swiss grape geneticist Dr. José <unk> detail the search for Zinfandel 's origins . After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe , a single 90 @-@ year @-@ old grape vine from the garden of an elderly lady in Split , Croatia , provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was a Croatian grape that has been known as Tribidrag since at least the 15th century . 
 = = = Legal issues = = = 
 Local wine @-@ labeling regulations are slowly catching up with the DNA evidence , a process that has been slowed by trade disputes . The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999 , meaning that Italian <unk> can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws . Italian winemakers have taken advantage of these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels , with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ( TTB ) . 
 As of December 2007 , the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as approved grape varieties for American wines , but they are not listed as synonyms . U.S. producers , therefore , must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms , but no decision on this proposal ( <unk> 1513 – <unk> , formerly <unk> 1512 @-@ <unk> ) has been made .

 Zinfandel is grown across the continental United States , although California grows the largest proportion . U.S. producers make wine in styles that range from late harvest dessert wines , <unk> ( White Zinfandel ) and <unk> @-@ style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine in the style of port . The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate , location , and age of the vineyard in which they are grown , as well as the technology employed by the winemaker . 
 Historically , California Zinfandel vines were planted as a field blend interspersed with <unk> ( Petite Sirah ) , Carignan , Grenache , <unk> , Mission and Muscat . While most vineyards are now fully segregated , California winemakers continue to use other grapes ( particularly Petite Sirah ) in their Zinfandel wines . Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11 % of California 's vineyard land area . Around 400 @,@ 000 short tons ( 350 @,@ 000 tonnes ) are crushed each year , depending on the harvest , placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot . 
 = = = = California regions = = = = 
 In California , 20 % of the Zinfandel @-@ growing counties hold 80 % of the Zinfandel growing area ; however , major producing areas such as San Joaquin County , Stanislaus County , and Madera County produce Zinfandel primarily for blends or jug wine . 
 Certain California regions are regarded as " exceptional " for Zinfandel , each with identifiable flavor characteristics : 
 Amador has a reputation for big , full @-@ bodied Zinfandel . These extra @-@ ripe wines have been called jammy , <unk> , and <unk> , having aromas of sweet berries . 
 Although the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA in Santa Clara Valley produces Zinfandel from just 9 acres ( 3 @.@ 6 ha ) , the Zinfandel from that region is known for its complexity and depth . 
 Sonoma county has a Zinfandel @-@ producing land area second only to that of San Joaquin County . The county contains the warm Dry Creek Valley AVA , known for its juicy Zinfandel with bright fruit , balanced acidity and notes of blackberry , anise and pepper . Dry Creek Valley produces Zinfandel in a variety of styles ranging from the high @-@ alcohol Amador style to balanced , spicy wines . 
 San Luis Obispo , particularly the Paso Robles AVA with its hot days and cool maritime evenings , produces Zinfandel known for being soft and round . 
 While the Napa Valley AVA is known primarily for its Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot , and Syrah , Napa also produces Zinfandel wines described as plummy and intense , tasting of red berry fruits with cedar and vanilla . Zinfandel in Napa tends to be made in a claret style like red Bordeaux . 
 The Russian River Valley generally produces well during warm vintages . Otherwise , the grapes do not fully ripen , leaving the wines with excessive acidity . The area has mostly " old vine " Zinfandel , characterized as spicy and somewhat lower in alcohol than Zinfandel from other regions . 
 Mendocino County Zinfandel wines have been considered high quality , but they are less known because they are not heavily marketed . 
 Lodi has some of the oldest Zinfandel vines in California . While often used for White Zinfandel production , in the red style , Lodi Zinfandels have a reputation for being juicy and approachable .

 Most Primitivo is grown in Apulia , a coastal region known as the " heel " of Italy , and it is estimated to be the country 's 12th most widely planted grape variety . The main three DOC areas are Primitivo di Manduria , Gioia del Colle Primitivo ( <unk> ) and <unk> del <unk> Primitivo ( <unk> o Vecchio ) . The Manduria DOC covers still red wine as well as sweet ( Dolce Naturale ) and fortified ( <unk> Dolce Naturale , <unk> Secco ) wine . <unk> requires a minimum of 85 % Primitivo ; the others are 100 % Primitivo . Gioia del Colle Rosso and Rosato contain 50 @-@ 60 % Primitivo , and Cilento Rosso / Rosato contains around 15 % . 
 Historically , the grape was fermented and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont , where it was used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas . When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge , plantings in the region and production of non @-@ blended varietal increased . Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic , highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16 % alcohol by volume ( ABV ) . Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American @-@ style Zinfandel . 
 = = = Other locations = = = 
 The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its own right before the link to Zinfandel was revealed . UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletić in Croatia , which he planted on the island of Hvar . He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005 . There is high demand for red grapes in the country , and the government has been supportive of ongoing research . Figures from the department of viticulture and <unk> at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia in 2001 , there were about 2 @,@ 000 vines in 2008 . 
 Old vine Zinfandel plantings dating from the 1930s have been found in Baja California , Mexico . There are also small Zinfandel plantings in Western Australia , Mudgee in New South Wales and the McLaren Vale area of South Australia . South Africa has a small production of Zinfandel , including one estate rated among the country 's Zinfandel producers and winner of an international prize . 
 = = Viticulture and winemaking = = 
 Zinfandel vines are quite vigorous and grow best in climates that are warm but not too hot , because grapes may shrivel in hot weather . Zinfandel 's thin @-@ skinned grapes grow in large , tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot . The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content . If weather conditions permit , the grapes may be late @-@ harvested to make dessert wine . Zinfandel is often praised for its ability to reflect both its terroir and its winemaker 's style and skill . 
 The grapes exhibit an uneven pattern of ripening : a single bunch may contain both raisin @-@ like , over @-@ ripe grapes and green , <unk> grapes . Some winemakers choose to <unk> the bunches with these varying levels of ripeness , while others hand @-@ harvest the bunches , even by single berries , in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks . This extensively laborious practice is one component in the high cost of some Zinfandels . 
 Red Zinfandel wines have been criticized for being too " hot " ( too alcoholic ) , although modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable . On the other hand , Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol @-@ removing technologies , such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones , remove a sense of terroir from the wine . If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15 % alcohol , Peterson argues , it should be accepted on its own terms . 
 Factors that affect the wine 's flavors include length of fermentation , length of the maceration period with skin contact , the level of oak aging , and the degrees Brix of the harvested grapes . White Zinfandel is normally harvested early at 20 ° Bx when the grapes have yet to develop much varietal character , though some examples can develop hints of tobacco and apple skin . At 23 ° Bx ( the degree that most red wine is considered " ripe " ) , strawberry flavors develop . Cherry flavors appear at 24 ° Bx followed by blackberry notes at 25 ° Bx .

 = Troude 's expedition to the Caribbean = 
 Troude 's expedition to the Caribbean was a naval operation by a French force under Commodore Amable @-@ Gilles Troude during the Napoleonic Wars . The French squadron departed from Lorient in February 1809 in an attempt to reach and resupply the island colony of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea , then under invasion from a British expeditionary force . The force arrived much too late to affect the outcome of the successful invasion and took shelter from a British squadron in the Îles des Saintes , where they were blockaded by part of the British invasion fleet , led by Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane . Two weeks after the French ships arrived , British troops invaded and captured the Saintes , constructing mortar batteries to bombard the French squadron . With his position unsustainable , Commodore Troude decided to break out . 
 Attempting to escape under cover of darkness on 14 April , the French squadron was spotted by a number of small British ships stationed close inshore . These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit . The rearmost French ship of the line , Hautpoult , was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit , which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico . The British suffered 45 casualties , the French nearly 100 . The remainder of the French squadron escaped , with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France , eventually reaching Cherbourg in May . 
 The French expedition 's two frigates , both only partially armed , were detached during the action and took shelter in harbour at Guadeloupe . In June , heavily laden with trade goods , they attempted to escape to Europe , but were pursued by elements of the British blockade force . Félicité was overrun after four days of manoeuvre , submitting to the more powerful British frigate HMS Latona without a fight . Furieuse was able to escape immediate pursuit , but was subsequently discovered on 3 July by the smaller British ship HMS Bonne Citoyenne . In a fierce engagement two days later , the small British ship was able to defeat and capture the French vessel , which was later commissioned into the Royal Navy . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the Napoleonic Wars , the French Navy suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the British Royal Navy , culminating in the destruction of much of their Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . Unable to compete at sea , the French were increasingly confined to their principal naval bases , especially Brest on the Biscay coast and Toulon in the Mediterranean . With British squadrons patrolling the entrances to these ports , the French found it difficult not only to conduct regular overseas trade , but also to supply and reinforce their overseas colonies . As a result , the colonies faced financial collapse and the constant threat of attack by British forces , especially in the Caribbean , where by 1809 their island colonies of Martinique and Guadeloupe were surrounded by British held islands and blockaded by a strong British fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane . 
 During the summer of 1808 , messages arrived in France from Martinique , outlining the desperate situation of their supplies , morale and economy . It was determined that reinforcements and food supplies would be sent and the frigate Thétis was despatched in November 1808 . Within days , Thétis had been captured at the Action of 10 November 1808 , and subsequent operations had mixed success : the frigate Amphitrite reached Martinique , but a number of smaller ships were intercepted and defeated , both in Europe and the West Indies . In desperation , a major operation was planned , intended to transport substantial supplies and sufficient troops to resist the inevitable British invasion on Martinique . To this end , Commodore Amable @-@ Gilles Troude was provided with the ships of the line Courageux , Polonais and Hautpoult , with the frigates Félicité and Furieuse en flûte as armed storeships , carrying the bulk of the supplies . 
 On 21 February 1809 , a large French fleet under Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez attempted to escape Brest and was chased by the blockade squadron and driven to shelter under the Ile d 'Aix . Shortly afterwards , three French frigates attempted to break out of Lorient , but were challenged and destroyed at the Action of 24 February 1809 . These operations were the preliminaries to the Battle of Basque Roads in April , but also provided the cover required for Troude 's force to escape Lorient while the British were engaged elsewhere . Travelling rapidly across the Atlantic , the French encountered no British warships but were able to seize a number of lone British merchant ships , from whom Troude learned that the invasion of Martinique was already underway . While Troude 's expedition had been preparing at Lorient , Cochrane had been preparing his own operation to Martinique , following the interception of the same despatches warning of the island 's low morale and preparedness in the summer of 1808 . <unk> an expeditionary force of 44 ships and 10 @,@ 000 men at Carlisle Bay , Barbados , Cochrane began the invasion on 30 January 1809 and his troops rapidly overran the French defences , despite stiff resistance in the central highlands . By 10 February , the only remaining point in French hands was Fort Desaix , which held out until the magazine was breached on 24 February , at which point Governor Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse surrendered unconditionally . 
 = = Îles des Saintes = = 
 Troude was wary on his arrival in the Leeward Islands on 29 March , refusing to approach Martinique and instead anchoring near the Îles des Saintes until the situation in the islands could be established . Before he could make contact with nearby Guadeloupe , he was discovered by patrolling British warships and a warning sent to Cochrane , who was on his flagship HMS Neptune off Martinique . Within hours Neptune was cruising off the Saintes , joined by the ships of the line HMS Pompee , HMS York , HMS Belleisle , HMS Captain , HMS Polyphemus and a number of smaller warships that could operate closer inshore . Blockading the Saintes was a difficult task : the French had three channels through which they could escape , too many to be effectively blocked by the forces at Cochrane 's disposal . In addition , the Troude 's force could not be attacked directly , the width of the channels making it impossible for the British ships to attack in full strength . 
 For two weeks the British and French squadrons watched one another , the British unable to attack and the French unable to escape . In an effort to break the deadlock , Cochrane sent to Martinique for a body of 3 @,@ 000 men under Major @-@ General Frederick Maitland . With this force he launched a surprise invasion of the islands on 14 April , the amphibious operation commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Acasta and executed successfully with only minor casualties . Parties of seamen went ashore in the wake of the soldiers , working rapidly to establish a battery of two 8 @-@ inch howitzers on Morne @-@ Russell . These guns began firing during the afternoon and by 20 : 00 Troude had given orders for his squadron to sail through the western channel during the night . 
 In their efforts to monitor the French , Cochrane 's squadron had become divided , so that Neptune and Pompee were the only ships within reach of Troude 's squadron when they passed through the channel . Neither ship was well placed to fight the larger French force and both were taken by surprise , only alerted to the French escape by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron shortly before 22 : 00 . Pompee was closest to the French , and Captain William Charles Fahie managed to fire two broadsides into the rearmost ship , Hautpoult before the Troude 's squadron pulled away from her . Neptune , Pompee and the small brig HMS Recruit took up the chase , the fast Recruit annoying the French with persistent minor attacks , while Neptune came too close to Hautpoult and was fired on , losing one man killed and four wounded . The French escape , while necessitated by the British battery , was actually a feint : the frigates Félicité and Furieuse had remained hidden off the Saintes during the night and at 09 : 00 on 15 April , with the main combat continuing to the west , slipped away into Basse @-@ Terre on Guadeloupe , chased in vain by HMS Intrepid under Captain Warwick Lake . French batteries drove off the British pursuit and the frigates were anchored in harbour and their stores successfully unloaded . 
 = = Battle = = 
 During the night of 14 – 15 April 1809 , contact was maintained with the French squadron by Recruit , Captain Charles John Napier firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern @-@ chasers , guns situated in the rear of a ship to fire on pursuers . Shortly after 04 : 00 , Pompee came within range and began to fire her bow @-@ chasers , the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea . Frustrated by her inability to escape Recruit , Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10 : 45 , causing severe damage but failing to dissuade Napier , who immediately counter @-@ attacked . Hautpoult 's manoeuvre caused her to lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots , neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents . 
 At 20 : 00 , Troude ordered Hautpoult to steer to the northwest while he took Courageux and Polonais southwest in an effort to divide the pursuit . Pompee and Recruit kept with Hautpoult , while Neptune , accompanied by the brig HMS Hawk continued to follow Troude 's main force . During the night however Troude outdistanced Neptune , and on the morning of 16 April Cochrane ordered all available ships to converge on Hautpoult . The lone French ship of the line had finally forced the damaged Recruit to retire , but could see Pompee and Neptune to the southeast and the newly arrived frigates HMS Latona under Captain Hugh Pigot and HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts to the northeast , with the Spanish coast of Puerto Rico directly north . During the day the chase continued , Neptune falling behind but Pompee remaining in sight and the frigates gaining on Hautpoult . At 17 : 00 , Puerto Rico appeared on the horizon , the French forced to follow the coastline westwards . During the night , the British pursuers were confused by the overcast sky , which helped Hautpoult to partially obscure herself among the lights from shore . 
 At 02 : 45 on 17 April , Castor closed within range of Hautpoult and opened fire , exchanging broadsides with the much larger French ship for 75 minutes and slowing her sufficiently for Pompee to come within range . Sailing between Castor and the French ship , Fahie closed within 50 yards ( 46 m ) and opened fire with his broadside . Within 15 minutes Hautpoult attempted to escape by pulling forward and engaging with Castor again , but the damage done to her sails and rigging hindered the manoeuvre and Pompee pulled across her stern , threatening to rake her . With defeat inevitable , the French captain surrendered , Neptune , York , Captain , Hazard , Hawk , Recruit , Polyphemus , HMS Ethalion and HMS Ringdove all coming within sight as dawn broke , joining Pompee , Castor and Latona . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Hautpoult had fought hard during the engagement and was badly damaged , suffering between 80 and 90 casualties . Pompee was also badly damaged , losing nine killed and 30 wounded , including Fahie wounded . Other casualties were suffered on Castor , with one killed and five wounded ; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded . In total , British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded . Cochrane ordered Pompee and the newly captured French ship back to port , promoting Napier to command the ship of the line for his service on Recruit and despatching York and Captain to hunt for Troude 's remaining squadron . Despite their efforts , Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May . In addition to Napier there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby . Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal , awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847 .

 During May 1809 , the frigates Félicité and Furieuse remained at Guadeloupe , taking on stores and preparing for their eventual return journey to France . Although they were both large frigates , they had been largely disarmed in France to create space for cargo : Furieuse was provided with only 20 cannon ( including 12 carronades ) and a crew of just 200 , while Félicité had even fewer defences , carrying just 14 cannon and 174 men . Watching these ships was a small British blockade force led by Hugh Pigot in Latona with a few brigs and sloops , Cochrane 's invasion fleet having been dispersed .

 On 14 June under the cover of darkness , the French frigates set sail , laden with colonial merchandise for sale in France . They were immediately spotted leaving Basse @-@ Terre by the blockade squadron , but although the brig HMS Haughty managed to fire a few shots before they pulled away , only Latona and Cherub under Captain Thomas Tudor Tucker were able to maintain contact . Throughout 15 , 16 and most of 17 June the chase continued , until the frigates separated : Furieuse led Cherub away from Latona and then outdistanced her , disappearing into the Atlantic . Félicité was unable to escape Latona however , and on 18 June was overrun . Outgunned by his larger opponent , Félicité 's captain surrendered immediately . An old and worn ship , she was not deemed worthy of purchase into the Royal Navy and was instead sold to Haiti , reappearing in 1812 as the Améthyste under the control of a privateer commissioned by Haitian rebels . Captain Yeo quickly attacked and captured her during the Action of 3 February 1812 . 
 = = = Furieuse = = = 
 Although Furieuse had escaped Cherub 's pursuit , she still had to cross the Atlantic . Passing up the Eastern Seaboard of the United States , her commander , Lieutenant Gabriel @-@ Etienne @-@ Louis Le <unk> Kerdaniel , raided British merchant shipping and was consequently delayed . At 15 : 00 on 5 July , the 20 @-@ gun sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain William Mounsey , on passage from Halifax , Nova Scotia to Quebec , spotted Furieuse to the southwest taking possession of a British merchant ship . As Bonne Citoyenne approached , Kerdaniel abandoned the merchant ship and sailed northwards , Mounsey giving chase but trailing 5 nautical miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ) behind throughout the day . 
 As darkness fell , Furieuse disappeared ahead , Mounsey pursuing in the hope of rediscovering his opponent during the night . At 03 : 00 on 6 July , the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again , Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened . At 09 : 10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her , opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range . Mounsey replied immediately , the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours , the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating . In the exchange , the British ship fired 129 broadsides , while Furieuse only managed 70 : Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing . With his ammunition spent , Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18 : 16 to board and capture her , at which point Kerdaniel , whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable , surrendered . 
 Due to her small size and high speed , Bonne Citoyenne suffered minimal casualties of one man killed and five wounded , although the ship itself was badly damaged . French losses were far more severe , with 35 killed , 37 seriously wounded including her captain , and 20 lightly wounded . Furieuse , built as a 40 @-@ gun frigate , had proven unable to match the speed an agility of the smaller ship and as a result her reduced armament had proven inadequate when faced with Mounsey 's determined opposition . It was not until 01 : 30 on 7 July that temporary repairs were complete and the two ships began the long , slow journey to Halifax , Nova Scotia . The following day however , two of the Furieuse 's masts collapsed and Mounsey was forced to take her in tow , both ships in constant danger of foundering . After 25 days in tow , Furieuse arrived in Halifax . Mounsey and his officers were widely praised for their success and Mounsey was given command of the repaired and newly purchased HMS Furieuse several months later as a reward . His first lieutenant was also promoted and the whole crew benefitted from the award of prize money . As with the April engagement , the capture of Furieuse was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal .

 The failure of Troude 's squadron to escape the British pursuit highlights the dominance of the Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809 . With Martinique gone , and French Guiana and San Domingo falling the same year , Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies . Despite the supplies carried by Troude 's ships , the situation there was desperate : food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island 's morale . When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809 , the French losing two more frigates , the inhabitants had no alternative but to wait for the inevitable British invasion . In January 1810 , Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe , which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea . 
 = 20th Battalion ( New Zealand ) = 
 The 20th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the New Zealand Military Forces , which served during the Second World War as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division . During the war it was converted to an armoured regiment . 
 The 20th Battalion was formed in New Zealand in 1939 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Kippenberger . After a period of training it embarked for the Middle East and then onto Greece in 1941 as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division . It participated in the Battles of Greece and later in Crete . Evacuated from Crete , it then fought in the North African Campaign . It suffered heavy losses during Operation Crusader , when it was effectively destroyed by the 15th Panzer Division . Brought back up to strength , the battalion played a key role in the breakout of the 2nd New Zealand Division from Minqar Qaim in June 1942 , where it had been encircled by the 21st Panzer Division . The following month , the battalion suffered heavy casualties during the First Battle of El Alamein . 
 In October 1943 , the battalion was converted to an armoured unit and designated 20th Armoured Regiment . To replace men lost at El Alamein , personnel were drawn from a tank brigade being formed in New Zealand . The regiment spent a year in Egypt training with Sherman tanks , before embarking for Italy in October 1943 to join the Eighth Army . It participated in the Italian Campaign , fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino . The regiment finished the war in Trieste and remained there for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans also present in the city withdrew . Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations , the regiment was disestablished in late 1945 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) , for service at home and abroad . Following consultation with the British Government , it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be in the form of an infantry division , the 2nd New Zealand Division , which would require nine battalions of infantry . Consequently , several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers . 
 The 20th Battalion was formed in Christchurch at Burnham Military Camp in early October under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Kippenberger . After a period of training , it departed for the Middle East on 5 January 1940 as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade , 2nd New Zealand Division . The battalion arrived at its base in Maadi , Egypt on 14 February , and was involved in training and garrison duty at Baggush for most of the next 12 months . 
 = = = Greece and Crete = = = 
 The British Government anticipated an invasion of Greece by the Germans in 1941 and decided to send troops to support the Greeks , who were already engaged against the Italians in Albania . The 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of Allied units dispatched to Greece in early March . The 4th Infantry Brigade was tasked with the defence of the Aliakmon Line in northern Greece , with the 20th Battalion preparing and manning the defences along the western end of the line . On 6 April , the Germans invaded Greece and their advance was so rapid that it quickly threatened the Florina Gap . The 4th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn to the Servia Pass where it manned defences that were superior to its previous positions . On 14 April German forces reached the Servia Pass and the brigade defended its positions for three days before being withdrawn . The battalion was the rearguard of the brigade for most of its withdrawal until it was evacuated to Crete on 28 April . 
 On Crete , the 20th Battalion was detached from the 4th Infantry Brigade to form part of a new ad hoc 10th Infantry Brigade , under the command of Kippenberger . The battalion 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Lieutenant Colonel James Thomas Burrows , was in command for most of the Battle of Crete . On the opening day of the invasion of Crete , the battalion was positioned to the east of the town of Galatas . On 22 May , it was used in a counterattack on Maleme airfield , which had been allowed to be occupied by the Germans the previous day . The delayed arrival of its relief meant the battalion was late to its starting position . The attack was unsuccessful and resulted in heavy casualties , although not as high as the Germans ' own losses . 
 When Galatas fell to the Germans on 25 May , the 20th Battalion was in danger of being cut off . It successfully regrouped and assisted in the recapture of the town . The battalion withdrew on 26 May , which marked the beginning a retreat to Hora <unk> , on the southwest coast of Crete . Kippenberger rejoined the battalion after his previous command , the 10th Brigade , was disestablished after the capture of Galatas . On arrival at the evacuation beaches , it was found that there was insufficient room on the Australian destroyers that were the designated transport for all of the battalion 's personnel . The bulk of the battalion was evacuated on 30 May although Kippenberger was forced to select 40 men to stay behind and form a rearguard under the command of Burrows . After manning defensive positions to prevent Germans infiltrating the cordon around the evacuation beaches , the rearguard was evacuated the following day . 
 = = = North Africa = = = 
 The 20th Battalion was evacuated to Egypt , having lost over half its original complement of personnel during the Greece and Crete campaigns . After a short period of rest , Kippenberger set about bringing the battalion back up to strength . Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers , separated from the battalion for various reasons during the previous two months while in Greece and Crete , continued to arrive for several weeks as they made their way across the Mediterranean by various means , including small sailboats . By mid @-@ June , the battalion was at full strength and several weeks were spent at the battalion 's previous positions at Baggush , engaged in intensive desert training . 
 = = = = Operation Crusader = = = = 
 In November 1941 , the battalion participated in Operation Crusader as part of the British Eighth Army and was engaged in offensive operations towards the Sidi Azeiz area . On the night of 25 November , along with the 18th Battalion , it was tasked with the night @-@ time capture of Belhamed , a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh . As the units moved to their positions , Kippenberger made a navigational error which resulted in his headquarters company becoming separated from the other companies of the battalion . It took him until daylight for him to reestablish contact with the remainder of the battalion which , when he located it , was in its expected position having taken the hill with few losses . Shortly after his arrival Kippenberger was wounded by machine gun fire and evacuated . The battalion held the hill for three days before it was destroyed by elements of the 15th Panzer Division in a counterattack . Only one man managed to escape capture . 
 = = = = Rebuilding = = = = 
 A number of the 20th Battalion 's personnel had not been involved in the battle , most of whom were unfit , recovering from injuries , on leave or attending training courses . These men , numbering about 137 , formed the nucleus of the reformed battalion at Baggush in early December . Other personnel who had been temporarily deployed elsewhere also returned to the battalion during December . By the end of the month , the battalion , now under the command of Burrows ( Kippenberger had been promoted to brigadier and given command of the 5th Infantry Brigade ) , was brought back up to strength with 600 reinforcements . For the next two months , Burrows oversaw training of his new command while it was based at Baggush and then later at Maadi . In February 1942 , the battalion was on the move , with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division , to Syria to defend against a possible attack through Turkey on the Middle East oilfields by the Germans . 
 In Syria , the battalion prepared defences in its assigned sector around <unk> Fortress , digging weapons pits as well as undergoing further training . Following the attack on the Eighth Army 's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa , the 2nd New Zealand Division was recalled to Libya . On 17 June , the battalion left for Mersa Matruh , a 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) journey that took four days to complete . After a period of indecision as to where the division was to be best used , it moved to Minqar Qaim with the 20th Battalion remaining behind at Matruh for two days to act as security for engineers laying minefields before joining up with the division . 
 At Minqar Qaim , the division was to hold and delay the advance of the Panzer Army Africa for as long as it could while remaining intact . By the middle of the afternoon of 27 June , the division had been encircled by the 21st Panzer Division . Panzer units approached a number of the 2nd New Zealand Division 's positions , including the 20th Battalion 's sector on the northern side of the Minqar Qaim escarpment , and were successfully beaten off . The New Zealanders broke out that evening with the 4th Brigade breaching the German lines and the 20th Battalion on the northern flank of the chosen withdrawal route . During the action at Minqar Qaim and the subsequent breakout , the battalion 's casualties were light , with thirteen men killed and it reached the El Alamein line by 28 June . 
 = = = = El Alamein = = = = 
 On 14 and 15 July 1942 , during the First Battle of El Alamein , the battalion was engaged in what would be known as the Battle of Ruweisat Ridge . Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line , dominating the surrounding area . The 4th Brigade was to take the western end of the ridge , with Kippenberger 's 5th Brigade tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge . The 5th Indian Brigade was allocated to deal with the eastern end . British tanks , in the form of two armoured brigades , were to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack . However , little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades , nor was a clear chain of command established . This would have implications for the outcome of the battle . 
 After a night @-@ time advance , the 20th Battalion was positioned on the ridge in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions . On daybreak , it was discovered that the advance had bypassed numerous strong points , leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact . The supporting British armour was nowhere to be seen and the supporting artillery and anti @-@ tank units were unable to break through , leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge . Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour . On reaching one of the British brigades , its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger 's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up . By the time the armoured support arrived , the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun , leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy . 
 A counterattack by elements of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July . The limited number of anti @-@ tank guns present were exposed and quickly immobilised or forced to withdraw . This left the infantry to be surrounded and large numbers were forced to surrender . Some soldiers made it to the positions of 19th Battalion , but it too became surrounded . By nightfall , the brigade had been overrun . Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact . Of the 20th Battalion , nearly 200 men were taken prisoner . 
 = = = Conversion to armour = = = 
 About half of the 20th Battalion had been wounded , killed or captured during the Battle of Ruweisat Ridge and it was withdrawn to Maadi to be brought back up to strength . It had previously been decided to form an armoured brigade to provide tank support to the 2nd New Zealand Division and as a result , the 1st New Zealand Army Tank Brigade was formed . This brigade was still undergoing training in New Zealand in September when it was decided to convert the 4th Brigade to armour instead . Personnel were transferred from the tank brigade in New Zealand to bring the 4th Brigade back up to strength . As one of the constituent units of the brigade , the 20th Battalion was officially re @-@ designated the 20th Armoured Regiment on 5 October 1942 . 
 The regiment , with three squadrons of tanks , would spend the next year in training , learning to use the signalling equipment and guns of the tanks it was expected to use . One squadron was to be equipped with Crusaders with the other two squadrons operating Shermans . However , the mechanically unreliable Crusaders were later replaced with Shermans . Burrows initially oversaw the transition to armour until he returned to New Zealand on furlough in May 1943 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel J. W. McKergow . 
 With the close of the North African campaign in May 1943 , attention then turned to the European theater of operations . Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed in the Pacific theater , it was decided that the division , having served with the Eighth Army throughout the desert campaign , would remain in Europe . Accordingly , in October , the division moved to join the Eighth Army in Italy . 
 = = = Italy = = = 
 The 20th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and gradually travelled up Italy towards the Sangro River , which it duly crossed on 3 December . In the following weeks , the regiment was involved in a supporting role in the 5th and 6th Brigades ' attack on Orsogna , as part of the Moro River Campaign . Although the infantry made some gains , the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate , with a number of back and forth actions . The regiment lost a number of tanks during the fighting but generally acquitted itself well and was withdrawn from the line the following month . McKergow had been wounded at Orsogna , and Lieutenant Colonel H. A. Purcell took over command of the regiment . 
 Following its withdrawal from the area around Orsogna , the 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of divisions that was transferred from the Eighth Army to the Fifth Army , then engaged on the western side of the Apennines . This was part of an overall strategy to breach the Gustav Line and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front . Together with the 4th Indian Division and supporting British and American artillery , the division formed the New Zealand Corps , under the command of the New Zealand divisional commander , Major General Bernard Freyberg . The corps moved to Cassino , the defenders of which had resisted American forces for several weeks . 
 As at Orsogna , the 20th Armoured Regiment was to play a supporting role in the forthcoming Cassino attack , with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing the brunt of the battle . When the attack began on 15 March , the regiment was initially held as a reserve , ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate . The infantry struggled to make progress in the face of determined resistance . Over the next week , some of the squadrons of the regiment became involved in small scale raid actions . On 24 March , the regiment moved into the area of Cassino controlled by the New Zealand infantry , and essentially became mobile pillboxes . The tanks were vulnerable to artillery and German patrols and the troops of the various squadrons of the regiment were rotated in and out of the town in two day shifts . While the New Zealand infantry had been relieved by the Guards Brigade in the early April , the 20th Armoured Regiment stayed in the line until the end of the month . 
 After the New Zealand Corps was disbanded , a period of rest and training in the Volturno Valley followed for the 20th Armoured Regiment before it returned to action in May . It was temporarily split from the 4th Brigade and its various squadrons detached in support of separate operations being conducted by 5th and 6th Brigades in advances to Avezzano . Following the Normandy landings , the Italian campaign was reduced to a sideshow , although one which still had considerable value in tying down German forces that could otherwise be used elsewhere . The regiment , now rejoined with 4th Brigade , supported the infantry brigades as they advanced to Florence , and entered the city in August . The 2nd New Zealand Division was transferred to the I Canadian Corps , then on the Adriatic Coast , and advanced up to Rimini . Here the B Squadron of the regiment supported an attack by a Greek mountain brigade towards Rimini on 14 September . 
 On 19 and 20 October , the 4th Armoured Brigade was involved in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River , with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank . This was primarily a tank action , in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry . Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives , the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river on the evening of 21 October . The regiment 's Shermans fired an hour @-@ long barrage of high explosive shells along their front to create a diversion , under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio . 
 In late 1944 , the 20th Armoured Regiment crossed the Lamone River and its squadrons supported the infantry battalions of the 6th Brigade in attacks in and around the town of Faenza in December . The regiment then wintered along the Senio River . It would be involved in supporting infantry on the front lines until early February 1945 . The regimental chaplain was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) after his efforts in organising and evacuating wounded infantry during this phase of the war . 
 = = = Trieste and disbandment = = = 
 After a period of rest , the 20th Armoured Regiment returned to the front lines in early April . It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard . On 2 May , the regiment 's A Company was the leading element of the 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste . While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered , it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city . In fact , the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all . 
 The regiment , along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division , remained in and around Trieste for several weeks to counter the presence of the partisans , who had laid claim to the city . It was not until mid @-@ June that the partisans withdrew from the city . It would be several more weeks before it was determined by the New Zealand government that the division would not be required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations . However , the longest serving men of the regiment had been steadily returning to New Zealand on furlough since early 1944 , and most were not required to come back to active service . By the end of August , the last elements of the regiment had withdrawn from Trieste to wintering positions near Florence . In mid @-@ September , it was decided to send the latest reinforcement drafts , then assembling in New Zealand , to Japan to serve as an occupation force ( <unk> ) and that the men of 20th Armoured Regiment would not be required . This accelerated the demobilisation process and accordingly the regiment was officially disbanded on 2 December 1945 . 
 During the war , the 20th Battalion and its successor , the 20th Armoured Regiment , lost 366 officers and men either killed in action or who later died of their wounds , including 30 men who died as prisoners of war . Nearly 750 personnel were made prisoners of war .

 Some of the personnel of the 20th Battalion were highly decorated , including two members , both of C Company , that were awarded the Victoria Cross ( VC ) . Sergeant Jack Hinton was awarded a VC for his actions during the Battle of Greece . Captain Charles Upham was awarded a VC for his actions during the Battle of Crete , and later won a bar to his VC for his actions during the Battle of Ruweisat Ridge on 15 July 1942 . Six members of the battalion , including some of its commanders , were awarded the Distinguished Service Order while four members were appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire . Several other awards for gallantry were also made .

 The spotted green pigeon or Liverpool pigeon ( Caloenas maculata ) is a species of pigeon of unknown provenance which is most likely extinct . It was first mentioned and described in 1783 by John Latham , who claimed to have seen two specimens and a drawing depicting the bird . The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure , and early writers suggested many different possibilities , though the idea that it was related to the Nicobar pigeon ( C. nicobarica ) prevailed , and it was therefore placed in the same genus , Caloenas . Today , the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum , Liverpool . Overlooked for much of the 20th century , it was only recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List in 2008 . In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon , and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire . 
 The surviving specimen is 32 cm ( 12 @.@ 5 in ) long , and has very dark , brownish plumage with a green gloss . The neck @-@ feathers are elongated , and most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings have a yellowish spot on their tips . It has a black bill with a yellow tip , and the end of the tail has a pale band . It has relatively short legs and long wings . It has been suggested it had a knob on its bill , but there is no evidence for this . Unlike the Nicobar pigeon , which is mainly terrestrial , the physical features of the spotted green pigeon suggest it was mainly arboreal , and fed on fruits . It may have been native to an island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean , and it has been suggested that a bird referred to in 1928 as titi by Tahitian islanders was this bird . The spotted green pigeon may have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area , and may have disappeared due to over @-@ hunting and predation by introduced animals . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The spotted green pigeon was first mentioned and described by the English ornithologist John Latham in his 1783 work A General Synopsis of Birds . Latham stated that he had seen two specimens , in the collections of the British major Thomas Davies and the naturalist Joseph Banks , but it is uncertain how these ended up in the respective collections , and their provenance is unknown . Though Banks received many specimens from the British explorer James Cook , and Davis received specimens from contacts in New South Wales , implying a location in the South Pacific Ocean , there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources . After Davies ' death , his specimen was bought by Edward Smith @-@ Stanley , the 13th Earl of Derby in 1812 , who kept it in Knowsley Hall . Smith @-@ Stanley 's collection was transferred to the Derby Museum in 1851 , where the specimen was prepared from the original posed mount ( which had perhaps been <unk> by Davies himself ) into a study skin . This museum later became World Museum , Liverpool , where the specimen is housed today ( numbered <unk> 3538 ) , but Banks ' specimen is now lost . Latham also mentioned a drawing of a spotted green pigeon in the collection of Ashton Lever , but it is unknown which specimen this was based on ; it could have been either , or a third individual . Latham included an illustration of the spotted green pigeon in his 1823 work A General History of Birds , and though it is unknown what he based his illustration on , it differs from Davies ' specimen in some details . It is possible that it was based on the drawing in the Leverian collection , since Latham stated that this drawing showed the end of the tail as " deep ferruginous " ( rust @-@ coloured ) , a feature also depicted in his own illustration . 
 The spotted green pigeon was scientifically named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 , based on Latham 's description . The original binomial name Columba maculata means " spotted pigeon " in Latin . Latham himself accepted this name , and used it in his 1790 work Index <unk> . Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies ' specimen , this can therefore be considered the holotype specimen of the species . Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species ; James Francis Stephens suggested that it belonged in the fruit pigeon genus Ptilinopus in 1826 , and Johann Georg Wagler instead suggested that it was a juvenile Nicobar pigeon ( Caloenas nicobarica ) in 1827 . Tommaso Salvadori listed the bird in an appendix about " doubtful species of pigeons , which have not yet been identified " in 1893 . In 1898 , Henry Ogg Forbes supported the validity of the species , after examining Nicobar pigeon specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development . He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the Nicobar pigeon , Caloenas . In 1901 , Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert agreed that the pigeon belonged to Caloenas , but suggested that it was probably an " <unk> " , though more than one specimen had been recorded . 
 The spotted green pigeon was only sporadically mentioned in the literature throughout the 20th century ; little new information was published , and the bird remained an enigma . In 2001 , Errol Fuller suggested that the bird had been historically overlooked because Rothschild ( an avid collector of rare birds ) dismissed it as an aberration , perhaps because he did not own the surviving specimen himself . Fuller considered it a valid , extinct species , and also coined an alternative common name for the bird : the Liverpool pigeon . On the basis of Fuller 's endorsement , BirdLife International listed the spotted green pigeon as " Extinct " on the IUCN Red List in 2008 ; it was previously " Not Recognized " . In 2001 , the ornithologist David Gibbs stated that the spotted green pigeon was only superficially similar to the Nicobar pigeon , and possibly distinct enough to warrant its own genus ( related to Ptilinopus , Ducula , or <unk> ) . He also hypothesised that the bird might have inhabited a Pacific island , based on stories told by Tahitian islanders in 1928 about a green and white speckled bird called titi . The palaeontologist David Steadman disputed the latter claim in a book review , noting that titi is an onomatopoeic word ( resembling the sound of the bird ) used especially for shearwaters ( members of Procellariidae ) in east Polynesia . The ornithologists Julian P. Hume and Michael Walters , writing in 2012 , agreed with Gibbs that the bird warranted generic status . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 In 2014 , an ancient DNA analysis by the geneticist Tim H. <unk> and colleagues compared the genes of the only spotted green pigeon specimen with that of other pigeons , based on samples extracted from two of its feathers . One of the resulting phylogenetic trees ( or cladograms ) is shown below : 
 The spotted green pigeon was shown to be closest to the Nicobar pigeon . The genetic distance between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species , but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus . This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus , and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique , extinct taxon . The Caloenas genus was placed in a wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal ( tree @-@ dwelling ) and terrestrial ( ground @-@ dwelling ) traits . That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus . A third species in the genus Caloenas , the Kanaka pigeon ( C. <unk> ) , is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga . This species was larger than the two other members of the genus , so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon . The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results . 
 The distribution of the Nicobar pigeon and the Kanaka pigeon ( which does not appear to have had diminished flight abilities ) suggests dispersal through island hopping and an origin for the spotted green pigeon in Oceania or southeast Asia . The fact that the closest relatives of Caloenas were the extinct subfamily Raphinae ( first demonstrated in a 2002 study ) , which consists of the dodo from Mauritius and the Rodrigues solitaire from Rodrigues , indicates that the spotted green pigeon could also have originated somewhere in the Indian Ocean . In any case , it seems most likely that the bird inhabited an island location , like its relatives . That the Caloenas pigeons were grouped in a clade at the base of the lineage leading to Raphinae indicates that the ancestors of the flightless dodo and Rodrigues solitaire were able to fly , and reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from south Asia .

 Latham 's 1823 description of the spotted green pigeon from A General History of Birds ( expanded from the one in A General Synopsis of Birds ) reads as follows : 
 Length twelve inches . Bill black , tipped with pale yellow ; round the eye somewhat naked ; general colour of the plumage dark green , and glossy ; the head and neck are darker than the rest , and of one plain colour ; the feathers of the neck long and narrow , like the hackles of a Cock ; every feather of the wings and scapulars tipped with a spot of very pale cinereous white , with a point running upwards , somewhat triangular : quills and tail black ; the feathers of the first tipped with cinereous white , those of the last with ferruginous white , and even at the end : belly , thighs , and vent , dusky black : the legs are brown , and the shins covered half way with downy feathers ; claws black . We have only seen two specimens ; one in the collection of Gen. Davies , the other in possession of Sir Joseph Banks . In a drawing of one at Sir Ashton Lever 's , the end of the tail is deep ferruginous . 
 Most literature addressing the spotted green pigeon simply repeated Latham 's descriptions , adding little new information , until Gibbs published a more detailed description in 2001 , followed by the museum curator Hein van Grouw in 2014 . The surviving specimen measures 32 cm ( 12 @.@ 5 in ) in length , though study specimens are often stretched or compressed during taxidermy , and may therefore not reflect the length of a living bird . The weight has not been recorded . The spotted green pigeon appears to have been smaller and <unk> than the Nicobar pigeon , which reaches 40 cm ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) , and the Kanaka pigeon appears to have been 25 % larger than the latter . At 126 mm ( 5 in ) in length , the tail is longer than that of the Nicobar pigeon , but the head is smaller in relation . The bill is 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 7 in ) , and the tarsus measures 33 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) . Though the wings of the specimen appear to be short and rounded , and have been described as being 175 mm ( 6 @.@ 8 in ) long , van Grouw discovered that the five outer primary feathers have been pulled out of each wing , and suggested that the wings would therefore had been about 50 mm ( 2 in ) longer in life , around 225 mm ( 8 @.@ 8 in ) in total . This is in accordance with Latham 's 1823 illustration , which shows a bird with longer wings . 
 The bill of the specimen is black with a yellowish tip , and the cere is also black , with feathers on the upper side , almost to the nostrils . The lores are naked , and the upper part of the head is sooty black . The rest of the head is mostly brownish @-@ black . The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss , the latter with coppery reflections . The feathers of the neck are elongated ( sometimes referred to as hackles ) , and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips . Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish @-@ black with a dark green gloss . Almost all of these feathers have a triangular , yellowish @-@ buff spot at their tips . The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers , vague and dark on the primary feathers . The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers , which have a pale spot or band at the tips . The breast is brownish @-@ black with a faint green sheen . The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen , brownish @-@ black on the underside , with a narrow , cinnamon @-@ coloured band at the end . This differs from the rust @-@ coloured tail @-@ tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever , and Latham 's own illustration . The legs are small and slender , have long toes , large claws , and a comparatively short tarsus , whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus . 
 When examining the specimen , van Grouw noticed that the legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions . The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life , not the outer . The plate accompanying Forbes ' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side , and depicts the legs as pinkish , whereas they are yellow in the skin . The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob at the base of its bill , similar to that of the Nicobar pigeon . This idea seems to have originated with Forbes , who had the bird depicted with this feature , perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas ; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002 . This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob , and Latham did not mention or depict this feature , so such depictions are probably incorrect . The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin , but red paint around the right eye @-@ socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes . It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird , yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham 's illustration , which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen . Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green , though this was probably guesswork . 
 The triangular spots of the spotted green pigeon are not unique among pigeons , but are also seen in the spot @-@ winged pigeon ( Columba maculosa ) and the speckled pigeon ( C. guinea ) , and are the result of lack of melanin deposition during development . The yellow @-@ buff coloured spots are very worn , while less worn feathers have white tips ; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage , and that the latter were fresher . The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons , perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long . The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon , and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure . The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented , except for the tips of the feathers , and even the down was dark , unlike that of most other birds ( a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage ) . 
 Though the plumage of the spotted green pigeon resembles that of the Nicobar pigeon in some respects , it is also similar to that of species in the imperial pigeon genus Ducula . The metallic @-@ green colouration is commonly found among them , and similar hackles can be seen in the goliath imperial pigeon ( D. goliath ) . The Polynesian imperial pigeon ( D. aurorae ) has similar soft feathers , and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon ( D. pacifica ) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult . Therefore , van Grouw found it possible that the dull , brownish @-@ black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird , as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence . He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham 's illustration may represent the adult plumage . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 The behaviour of the spotted green pigeon was not recorded , but theories have been proposed based on its physical features . Gibbs found the delicate , part @-@ feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits . After noting that the wings were not short after all , van Grouw stated that the bird would not have been terrestrial , unlike the related Nicobar pigeon . He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird ( longer tail , shorter legs , primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail ) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula . It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds , have likewise been strongly arboreal , and kept to the dense canopy of forests . By contrast , the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor . The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors , whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon are similar to those of frugivorous ( fruit @-@ eating ) pigeons . The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees . The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits . 
 Believing that the wings were short and round , Gibbs thought the bird was not a strong flyer , and therefore not nomadic ( periodically moving from place to place ) . In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer , van Grouw also thought it would have been a sedentary ( mostly staying at the same location ) bird , that preferred not to fly across open water , similar to species in Ducula . It may have had a limited distribution on a small , remote island , which may explain why its provenance remains unknown . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 The spotted green pigeon is most likely extinct , and may already have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area . The species may have disappeared due to being over @-@ hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals . Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s . 
 = Early life of L. Ron Hubbard = 
 L. Ron Hubbard was the inventor of Dianetics and founder of Scientology . Born in Tilden , Nebraska in March 1911 , Hubbard grew up with his family in Helena , Montana . He was unusually well @-@ traveled for a young man of his time due to his father 's frequent relocations in connection with his service in the United States Navy . He lived in a number of locations in the United States and traveled to Guam , the Philippines , China , and Japan . He enrolled at George Washington University in 1930 to study civil engineering , but dropped out in his second year . While at GWU , he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for fellow students which looms large in his official biography but was a flop according to contemporary accounts . He subsequently spent time in Puerto Rico panning for gold , before returning to the United States , marrying his pregnant girlfriend , and embarking on a career as a " penny @-@ a @-@ word " writer . 
 The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic terms and draws on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy . The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that many aspects of the official version of Hubbard 's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives , notably the life of Jesus . Many details of Hubbard 's early life remain disputed ; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church . 
 = = Family and ancestry = = 
 Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13 , 1911 , in Tilden , Nebraska . He was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard , a former United States Navy sailor who worked as a newspaper employee at the time of his son 's birth , and Ledora May Waterbury , a housewife who had originally trained as a teacher . L. Ron was named after his maternal grandfather , Lafayette " Lafe " O. Waterbury . After moving to Kalispell , Montana , the family settled in 1913 in the state capital , Helena . Hubbard 's father worked as a manager and bookkeeper , first for a local theater and later for a coal company owned by his father @-@ in @-@ law . The elder Hubbard re @-@ enlisted in the Navy when the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , while his mother Ledora May worked as a clerk for the state government . 
 Some early Scientology biographies present a fictitious family heritage for Hubbard . According to an account published in the Church of Scientology 's Ability magazine in 1959 , Hubbard was " descended from Count de Loup who entered England with the Norman invasion and became the founder of the English de Wolfe family which emigrated to America in the 17th century . On his father 's side , from the English Hubbards , who came to America in the 19th century . " The story went that Count de Loup ( or de <unk> ) was a French courtier who saved the King of France from an attack by a wolf ; the grateful monarch bestowed the title of Count de <unk> , which was eventually anglicized to " De Wolf " , the name of Hubbard 's maternal grandfather . No records exist to substantiate this story . Harry Ross Hubbard was an orphan , born Henry August Wilson in August 1886 , who had been adopted by an Iowa farming couple by the name of Hubbard . The couple changed his given names to Harry Ross . 
 A biographical profile published by the Church of Scientology in 1973 states that the young Hubbard " spent many of his childhood years on a large cattle ranch in Montana " that was owned by his wealthy grandfather , Lafe Waterbury . According to Church accounts , Hubbard passed long days on the ranch " riding , breaking broncos , hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer . " Another Church biography describes his grandfather as a " wealthy Western cattleman " from whom Hubbard " inherited his fortune and family interests in America , Southern Africa , etc . " 
 Contemporary records and Hubbard 's relatives contradict this depiction . Hubbard 's grandfather , Lafe Waterbury , briefly owned a plot of land covering 320 acres ( 0 @.@ 5 mi2 ) near Kalispell , where he <unk> horses and worked as a veterinarian . A local city directory for 1913 stated Waterbury 's assets as a relatively modest $ 1 @,@ 550 . The Hubbards and <unk> lived in a pair of townhouses , not a ranch , in the center of Helena , only two blocks from each other and not far from the Montana State Capitol . They also owned a small plot outside the city . Hubbard 's aunt told the Los Angeles Times in 1990 that the family did not have a ranch , " just several acres ( with ) a barn on it . ... We had one cow ( and ) four or five horses . " 
 = = Childhood = = 
 = = = Growing up = = = 
 Biographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology depict Hubbard as a child prodigy . He is portrayed as riding a horse before he was able to walk and able to read and write by the time he was four . According to a Scientology account , the young Hubbard lived in the rugged West , " [ r ] <unk> horses at the age of three and a half " and facing dangers such as " escaping a pack of coyotes astride his mare named Nancy Hanks . " He was said to have " considered until he was 10 years old that the handling of a rifle or hunting coyotes or trying to break broncos was more useful than school knowledge " , and " [ a ] <unk> to send him to school were seldom availing . " 
 According to the Church publication What is Scientology ? , Hubbard was " reading and writing at an early age , and soon satisfying his insatiable curiosity with the works of Shakespeare , the Greek philosophers , and other classics . " His mother Ledora is described as " a rarity in her time . A thoroughly educated woman , who had attended teacher 's college prior to her marriage to Ron 's father , she was aptly suited to tutor her young son . " Christensen comments that this presentation of the exceptional qualities of his mother is typical of hagiographies – such as the Virgin Mary – and forms a kind of after @-@ the @-@ event rationalization , in which qualities assigned to the subject are also attributed to the subject 's mother . Presenting Ledora as " aptly suited " to educate her son suggests that she was , in effect , chosen to be his mother ; she is not presented as responsible for stimulating her son 's interest in the classics but was there simply to assist his development . ( Indeed , as Christiansen notes , his parents do not have important roles in his official biography and are only significantly mentioned at the beginning of the story , where their respective professions are emphasized . ) 
 Hubbard 's official biographers also state that , during his childhood in Montana , he was befriended by " Old Tom " , a medicine man from the Native American Blackfeet tribe . He is also purported to have become , at six years old , " one of the few whites ever admitted into Blackfoot society as a bona fide blood brother " . This has been disputed by his unofficial biographers . Jon Atack notes that the Blackfoot reservation was over a hundred miles away from Helena . A Los Angeles Times investigation in 1990 reported that " Old Tom " was not listed in a 1907 register of the Blackfeet and that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood . Although the Church of Scientology states that Hubbard was awarded blood brotherhood " in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders " , a Scientologist of fractional Blackfoot ancestry sought during the mid @-@ 1980s to prove that Hubbard had been a Blackfoot blood brother but was unsuccessful . 
 = = = Boy Scouts and " Snake " Thompson = = = 
 During the 1920s , the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas . Harry Hubbard rejoined the Navy as an enlisted man but was promoted to Ensign in October 1918 and Lieutenant in November 1919 . His posting aboard the USS Oklahoma in 1921 required his wife and son to relocate to the ship 's home ports , first San Diego , then Seattle . Hubbard joined the local Boy Scouts and later said that when he was 13 , he became the " youngest Eagle Scout in the country " . The Boy Scouts of America has said that , at the time , it did not keep a record of the ages of its Eagle Scouts , only an alphabetical list of those who had received the award . Journalist Michael Streeter comments that , in light of this , " it remains unclear just how Hubbard would have known he was its youngest member . " 
 A Scientology biography states that Hubbard 's achievement of Eagle Scout status was " an early indication that he did not plan to live an ordinary life . " Christiansen notes that this passage implies that Hubbard consciously " planned " to live an extraordinary life , strengthening the underlying idea that from early childhood he worked towards the goals that led to Scientology . He was presented to President Calvin Coolidge in a ceremony that the Church of Scientology describes as Hubbard having " represented American Scouting at the White House " , by which time " the thirteen @-@ year @-@ old L. Ron Hubbard had become a reasonably famous figure in fairly adventurous circles . " Atack describes the event more prosaically as a meet @-@ and @-@ greet in which Hubbard was one of forty boys who spoke their names to the President and shook his hand . Another Scientology biography says that Hubbard became " the fast friend of the President 's son , Calvin Coolidge , Jr . , whose untimely death is probably responsible for L. Ron Hubbard 's early interest in healing research . " Atack deems this fictitious , as Calvin Coolidge , Jr. and Hubbard never crossed paths . 
 The Hubbards traveled to Washington , D.C. in 1923 aboard the USS U.S. Grant , traveling from Seattle to Hampton Roads , Virginia , via the Panama Canal . During this trip , Hubbard reportedly received an education in Freudian psychology from Commander Joseph " Snake " Thompson , a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and student of Sigmund Freud . According to the Church of Scientology , Thompson " took it upon himself to pass on the essentials of Freudian theory to his young friend . " Hubbard later said that through Thompson 's friendship , " I attended many lectures given at naval hospitals and generally became conversant with psychoanalysis as it had been exported from Austria by Freud . " Another Scientology text states that Thompson spent " many an afternoon in the Library of Congress teaching L. Ron Hubbard what he [ knew ] of the human mind . " 
 There is no independent confirmation of Hubbard 's claims , though Thompson 's existence has been proven . This encounter is used in Scientology 's biographies as evidence that Hubbard was trained in a scientific approach to the mind , but found it unsatisfying . Christiansen notes that Dianetics was " very much inspired by Freudian theory " . Hubbard 's invocation of Thompson therefore serves to highlight his claimed knowledge of Freud 's ideas , but also his exceptional maturity ; as the official account has it , " Ron was also left with many unanswered questions " which prompted him to undertake further enquiries . This , in Christiansen 's view , has strong parallels with the story of the child Jesus : " in particular , the emphasis on the clever child having different skills and qualities from those of boys of the same age " , as displayed in incidents such as the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Jesus lecturing the scribes in the Temple of Jerusalem . 
 The following year , Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton , Washington . His son was enrolled at Union High School , Bremerton and later studied at Queen Anne High School in Seattle . In 1927 , Hubbard 's father was sent to the U.S. Naval Station in Guam . Although Hubbard 's mother also went to Guam , Hubbard himself did not accompany them but was placed in his grandparents ' care in Helena , Montana , to complete his schooling .

 Between 1927 and 1929 , Hubbard traveled to Japan , China , the Philippines , and Guam . What is Scientology and other Scientology texts present this era as a time when he sought , and was freely offered , ancient Eastern wisdom but found it lacking , as he had earlier with Western science . A biographical account in Hubbard 's 1982 novel Battlefield Earth says that , " he worked ... aboard a coastal trader which plied the seas between Japan and Java . He came to know old Shanghai , Beijing and the Western Hills at a time when few Westerners could enter China . " He is said to have spent weeks questioning Buddhist lamas and watching them meditate . He also recounted meeting Old Mayo , supposedly the last Chinese magician in a line that stretched back to the Court of Kublai Khan . According to the Church of Scientology , these travels were funded by his " wealthy grandfather " . Hubbard is described not as a tourist but as a gifted student , intensely curious for answers to human suffering and warmly received everywhere because he was perceived as special . He is purported to have faced many dangers in the company of " Major Ian <unk> of the British Secret Service " , including an " encounter with Cantonese pirates , the engineering of a jungle road across Guam 's denser corner , and the evening he decked an Italian swordsman named <unk> . ( Although not before he took a saber cut across the left cheek , and <unk> nearly lost a hand ) . " 
 Hubbard 's unofficial biographers present a very different account of his Asian travels , drawing on his school records , his contemporary diaries , and his father 's service record . Hubbard recorded two trips to the east coast of China in his diaries . The first was made in the company of his mother while traveling from the United States to Guam in 1927 . It consisted of a brief stop @-@ over in two Chinese ports before the pair transferred to a U.S. Navy transport , the USS Gold Star , for the journey to Guam . Hubbard spent about six weeks on the island before returning to the United States . He used his diary to record his impressions of the places he visited , noting his unfavorable impression of the poverty and the appearance of the inhabitants of Japan and China , whom he described as " gooks " , " lazy " , and " ignorant " . His second visit was a family holiday that took Hubbard and his parents to China via the Philippines in 1928 . It is unclear whether he ever traveled to western China , Tibet , or India ; Atack comments that Hubbard 's only corroborated visit to India appears to have been a flight change at Calcutta in 1959 . 
 On his return to the United States in September 1927 , Hubbard enrolled at Helena High School , but earned poor grades . He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle . In June , he traveled to Guam on a U.S. Navy transport , the USS Henderson , to reunite with his parents . His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis , Maryland . 
 = = = Second trip to Asia = = = 
 A number of naval families , including Hubbard 's , traveled from Guam to China aboard the USS Gold Star between October and December 1928 . The ship visited Manila in the Philippines and traveled on to Qingdao ( Tsingtao ) , from where Hubbard and his parents traveled inland to Beijing , before returning to the ship for transport to Shanghai and Hong Kong and finally back to Guam . The Church of Scientology presents a completely different version of this family holiday , stating that Hubbard " made his way deep into Manchuria 's Western Hills and beyond – to break bread with Mongolian bandits , share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of Kublai Khan . " According to Atack , these occurrences are not mentioned in the diary that Hubbard kept of his trip . Many years later , Hubbard said that " I was a <unk> @-@ <unk> kid ; I wasn 't thinking about deep philosophic problems . " 
 As on his previous trip , Hubbard recorded his impressions in his diary . He remained unimpressed with China . After seeing Qingdao he wrote : " A Chinaman can not live up to a thing , he always drags it down . " He characterized the sights of Beijing as " <unk> stations " for tourists and described the palaces of the Forbidden City as " very trashy @-@ looking " and " not worth mentioning " . He visited a section of the Great Wall of China near Beijing , which did impress him , but his overall conclusion of the Chinese was very negative : " They smell of all the baths they didn 't take . The trouble with China is , there are too many chinks here . " 
 Back on Guam , Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays . He is said to have " befriend [ ed ] the local Chamorros and [ taught ] in the native schools " , exploring " cliff @-@ side caves to disabuse local villagers of a devil named <unk> " . Despite his mother 's assistance with his education , he failed the Naval Academy entrance examination . His father 's next posting took the family to Washington , D.C. , where Hubbard was sent to study at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas , Virginia within the D.C. metropolitan area . The Hubbards returned to Helena , Montana for a short visit to Hubbard 's grandparents in August 1929 before he enrolled at Swavely the following month . 
 Hubbard proved unable to enter the Naval Academy because he was found to be too near @-@ sighted to meet the physical admission criteria . In the late 1940s , Hubbard wrote a series of private Affirmations in which he tells himself " your eyes are getting progressively better . They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy . " 
 In February 1930 he enrolled at Woodward School for Boys in Washington , D.C. as a means of earning credits for admission to George Washington University , thereby avoiding the university 's entrance examination , and successfully graduated in June . The following September , he entered George Washington University as a freshman . 
 While at Woodward , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Hubbard enlisted as a Private in the United States Marine Corps Reserve , stating his age as 21 and listing his profession as " photographer " . He was promoted to First Sergeant only six weeks later , a development that Atack attributes to the fact that the unit he joined – the 20th Marine Corps Reserve – was actually a training unit connected with George Washington University . His character was rated " excellent " but on October 22 , 1931 he was discharged with the notation , " Not to be re @-@ enlisted . " Despite his limited experience of the Marine Corps , he told readers of Adventure magazine in October 1935 that " I 've known the Corps from Quantico to <unk> , from the South Pacific to the West Indies . "

 = = = Nuclear physicist claims = = = 
 Hubbard 's two @-@ year career at George Washington University looms large in his own accounts and the biographies published by the Church of Scientology . George Malko comments in Scientology : The Now Religion , 
 Hubbard 's career at George Washington University is important because many of his researches and published conclusions have been supported by his claims to be not only a graduate engineer , but " a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics . " 
 Official biographical accounts of his life state that his " study of engineering , mathematics and nuclear physics laid the foundation for his later philosophical research . " A profile in one of his books attributes " the mathematical precision of the Scientology Religion " to his studies . According to one Scientology account , 
 [ Hubbard ] studied mathematics , engineering and attended the first American class on atomic and molecular phenomena . Although not necessarily subjects of choice , such were the disciplines that provided him the investigatory tools with which to pursue outstanding questions of the human mind and life . Indeed , L. Ron Hubbard became the first to bring a scientific methodology to age @-@ old questions of existence . 
 Hubbard 's education in " atomic and molecular phenomena " is highlighted in many Scientology biographies . According to one , he was " a member of the first U.S. course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics . " A 1961 publication calls him " L. Ron Hubbard , C.E. , Ph.D. , a nuclear physicist ... educated in advanced physics and higher mathematics and also a student of Sigmund Freud and others , [ who ] began his present researches thirty years ago at George Washington University . " In 1959 , another Scientology publication described him as " Doctor Hubbard , American nuclear physicist and leading world authority on the subject of life sources and mental energies and structures . " He told Scientologists in later years that " Nearly all nuclear physicists – atomic and molecular phenomena boys – ' Buck Rogers Boys ' , we were known as ... Like so many physicists I wrote science fiction for years , and that was the only remunerative use I made of this material . " 
 One account published by the Church of Scientology says that Hubbard theorized that " the world of subatomic particles might possibly provide a clue to the human thought process " and he was " concerned for the safety of the world , recognising that if man were to handle the atom <unk> for the greatest benefit , he would first have to learn to handle himself . " He enrolled on a nuclear physics course " to synthesise and test all knowledge for what was observable , workable and could truly help solve man 's problems . " Another profile calls him " a product of the atomic age " and describes how his classmates dreamed of unlocking the energy of the atom , while Hubbard himself sought to " discover the basic equations of life force , simply , to him , another kind of energy . " Hubbard stated that he " set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe , something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy . " 
 Other Scientology accounts present a different perspective . A 1959 biography describes Hubbard as " never noted for being in class " and says that he " thoroughly detest [ ed ] his subjects . " He attributed his choice of course to his father , having " decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics and so I found myself obediently studying . " In a 1953 lecture , he said that he was " forced into engineering , mathematics , majoring in nuclear physics – very antipathetic to me , but there was order and there was discipline ... " Christiansen comments that the claims made about Hubbard 's expertise and scientific knowledge are crucial to Scientology 's own self @-@ image and legitimation . Hubbard is presented as " a man with an impressive amount of various theoretical as well as practical personal competences and educational qualifications . " Scientology traces its own origins to Hubbard 's " scientific " methodology , which he is said to have learned while at university . Although Scientology positions itself as a religious belief , it nonetheless claims to be a true science , a " technology " capable of achieving precise and replicable results . 
 = = = Academic record and extracurricular activities = = = 
 Hubbard 's academic record , which came to light in the 1970s , revealed that he had been a student in George Washington University 's School of Engineering and had majored in civil engineering . He attended the summer semester in 1931 and the fall and spring semesters in 1931 – 32 . In September 1931 , he was placed on probation and he failed to return for the fall 1932 semester . A Scientology account says that he " <unk> [ ed ] in but thoroughly detest [ ed ] his subjects " ; while the latter may have been true , the former certainly was not , as his grades were consistently poor . At the end of his first year , he received a D average grade , earning an A for physical education , B for English , C for mechanical engineering , D for general chemistry and Fs for German and calculus . During his second year , he enrolled in a class on atomic and molecular physics – the " nuclear physics " course cited in his official biographies – but earned an F grade . His other grades were also poor , ranging from a B for English to D in calculus and electrical and magnetic physics . He dropped out soon afterwards . Although Hubbard told Look magazine in 1950 that " I never took my degree , " a biography published a few years later by the Church of Scientology 's Ability magazine nonetheless identifies him as the holder of a " B. S. in Civil Engineering " . 
 Hubbard was far more interested in extracurricular activities , particularly writing and participating in the university flying club . He wrote for the George Washington University student newspaper , The University Hatchet , as a reporter for a few months in 1931 . According to official biographies , " he earned his wings as a pioneering barnstormer at the dawn of American aviation " and became " a roving reporter for Sportsman Pilot " who " helped inspire a generation of pilots who would take America to world airpower . " One account published by the Church of Scientology states that he was " recognized as one of the country 's most outstanding pilots . With virtually no training time , he takes up powered flight and <unk> throughout the Midwest . " His pilot 's license , however , records that he only qualified to fly gliders rather than powered aircraft . 
 Hubbard left the university after two years and married in 1933 . He began writing for the popular pulp magazines at that time . His first story was “ The Green God , ” which appeared in Thrilling Adventures in 1934 . According to James R. Lewis , Associate Professor of Religion at University of <unk> , he was a quick and prolific writer , which fellow authors envied . According to the Church of Scientology , Hubbard 's decision to drop out of university was not the result of educational failure on his part , but was instead because he found that " beyond a basic methodology , university offered nothing . " Hubbard is said to have " <unk> [ ed ] that formal study had nothing more to offer " .

 = = = Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition = = = 
 Hubbard 's final semester at George Washington University saw him embark on what the Church of Scientology describes as a career as an " adventurer and explorer " . In May 1932 , he announced in The University Hatchet that he had organized an expedition to the Caribbean for " fifty young gentleman rovers " aboard the schooner Doris Hamlin . The aims of the " Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition " were to explore and film the pirate " strongholds and bivouacs of the Spanish Main " and to " collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums " . 
 The expedition did not go according to plan after its departure from Baltimore on June 23 , 1932 . Ten of the " gentleman rovers " pulled out before the start and the ship was blown far off course by storms , making an unplanned first landfall at Bermuda . Eleven more members of the expedition quit while there , before the ship sailed on to its intended first port of call , Martinique . En route , it was discovered that the ship 's fresh water had all leaked away . More expedition members abandoned ship on arrival . As the expedition was critically short of money , the ship 's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore , bringing to an end what the captain described as " the worst trip I ever made " . Hubbard nonetheless presented the expedition as a success and blamed the captain for its travails : " the ship 's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous , requiring Ron Hubbard 's hand at both the helm and the charts . " 
 The Church of Scientology states that a " National Museum " ( it does not specify which one ) acquired specimens collected by the expedition and the New York Times purchased some of its photographs . Hubbard 's book Mission into Time states that the expedition 's underwater films and specimens " provided the Hydrographic Office and the University of Michigan with invaluable data for the furtherance of their research . " However , Hubbard 's unofficial biographer Russell Miller reports that the New York Times " hold [ s ] no photographs from the expedition , [ has ] no evidence that it was ever intended to buy such photographs , nor indeed any indication that the newspaper was even aware of the expedition 's existence , " and that neither the U.S. Hydrographic Office nor the University of Michigan has any record of films or specimens from the expedition . 
 According to the Church of Scientology , " even some fifty years later , those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage as the one grand adventure in the twilight of their youth . " Hubbard put it somewhat differently , writing in 1935 that the expedition " was a crazy idea at best , and I knew it , but I went ahead anyway , chartered a four @-@ masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven 't stopped their cursings yet . " He told Look magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition " was a two @-@ bit expedition and financial bust , and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933 . " The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds . 
 = = = Puerto Rican Mineralogical Expedition = = = 
 After leaving university , Hubbard is said to have carried out a further expedition to Puerto Rico . It is described by a 1959 biography as having been undertaken to " blow off steam by leading an expedition into Central America [ sic ] " . An account published in Mission into Time states " Conducting the West Indies Minerals Survey , he made the first complete mineralogical survey of Puerto Rico . This was pioneer exploration in the great tradition , opening up a predictable , accurate body of data for the benefit of others . Later , in other , less materialistic fields , this was to be his way many , many times over . " The Church of Scientology claims that Hubbard 's father " had long dreamed of augmenting his Lieutenant 's pay with a mining venture and a bit of investment capital from like @-@ minded officers " and dispatched Hubbard to the Puerto Rican hinterland where he " sluiced inland rivers and crisscrossed the island in search of elusive gold . " While there , Hubbard " conducted much ethnological work amongst the interior villages and native <unk> " . 
 The expedition 's existence has been questioned by Hubbard 's unofficial biographers . Miller states that neither the United States Geological Survey nor the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources have records of any such expedition . Hubbard stayed on Puerto Rico from November 1932 to mid @-@ February 1933 . According to Miller , Hubbard went there for an entirely different purpose . Harry Ross Hubbard sent a letter to the Navy Department on October 13 , 1932 , in which he requested a passage for his son to San Juan to " place his services at the disposal of the American Red Cross in their relief work on that island . " Three weeks earlier , Puerto Rico had been hit by the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane and suffered catastrophic damage . The storm killed 225 people , injured 3 @,@ 000 more , and left over 100 @,@ 000 people homeless . Hubbard traveled to the island aboard the USS Kittery , arriving on November 4 . It is unclear whether he contributed to the Red Cross relief effort , though in a 1957 lecture he said that he had been " a field executive with the American Red Cross in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster . " 
 At some point during his short stay on the island , he appears to have done some work for a Washington D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated . A letter dated February 16 , 1933 describes Hubbard as the company 's " field representative " who accompanied the letter 's author on a survey of a small property near the town of Luquillo , Puerto Rico . According to his own account , Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold . A photograph published in Hubbard 's book Mission into Time shows him using a gold pan alongside the caption " <unk> with crews on Corozal River ' 32 " and an article in the August 18 , 1933 Washington Daily News describes Hubbard as having " left here last year for Antilles , West Indies , in search of gold so that he might return and marry the girl he met shortly before his departure " . In 1935 , Hubbard wrote in Adventure magazine , 
 <unk> the thought that the Conquistadores might have left some gold behind , I determined to find it ... Gold prospecting in the wake of the Conquistadores , on the hunting grounds of the pirates in the islands which still reek of Columbus is romantic , and I do not begrudge the sweat which splashed in muddy rivers , and the bits of khaki which have probably blown away from the thorn bushes long ago ... 
 After a half year or more of intensive search , after wearing my palms thin wielding a sample pack , after assaying a few hundred sacks of ore , I came back , a failure . 
 He married the girl in question , Margaret " Polly " Grubb , on April 13 , 1933 . Chronically short of money , he turned to full @-@ time fiction writing to support himself and his new wife ; six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933 as he embarked on a literary career that made him a somewhat well @-@ known figure in the world of pulp magazine fiction . 
 = = Significance for Scientology = = 
 Hubbard 's early life is accorded great significance by the Church of Scientology , which draws on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy . Dorthe Refslund Christensen comments : 
 [ The Church 's ] account wants to primarily wants to communicate that L. Ron Hubbard led an unusual life since his childhood ; that he worked for humanity throughout his life ; and that Dianetics and Scientology are based on the unique knowledge and wisdom of this person who has dedicated his entire life to the communication of this knowledge to his fellow man . 
 Hubbard portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer , world traveler and nuclear physicist . By contrast , his critics have characterized him as a liar , charlatan , and madman . Many of his autobiographical statements have been proven to be fictitious . The Church 's portrayal of Hubbard 's life displays many standard features of hagiography , such as the emphasis on the continuity of the subject 's life . Events are woven together in a seamless tapestry that culminates in the subject 's achievement of his spiritual goals . They are presented as part of a " master plan " that gives meaning to the subject 's life in the context of a belief system . By doing this , the belief system is legitimized and given an aspect of genuineness through stressing its originator 's personal qualities . 
 Hubbard is therefore portrayed , as he put it himself , as a man who " knew exactly where I was going " from the age of three . He is presented as a person who constantly worked towards a single objective . Each event in his life is seen as a stepping stone along the way to the development of Dianetics and Scientology . He is cast as a singular and forward @-@ thinking individual whose unique qualities and knowledge are essential prerequisites for his discoveries . As the Church puts it , " even in his early youth he exemplified a rare sense of purpose and dedication which , combined with his adventurous spirit , made him a living legend . " The story of Hubbard 's early life , as told by the Church , is closely related to Scientology 's own self @-@ image as a synthesis of Western scientific precision with Eastern philosophy . His claimed knowledge of these fields and practices underlines his claim to have founded a religion that combines the best of both to appeal to all people . 
 = Shapinsay = 
 Shapinsay is one of the Orkney Islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland . There is one village on the island , Balfour , from which roll @-@ on / roll @-@ off car ferries sail to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland . Balfour Castle , built in the Scottish Baronial style , is one of the island 's most prominent features , a reminder of the Balfour family 's domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries ; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques . Other landmarks include a standing stone , an Iron Age broch , a souterrain and a salt @-@ water shower . 
 With an area of 29 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 11 @.@ 4 sq mi ) , Shapinsay is the eighth largest island in the Orkney archipelago . It is low @-@ lying and fertile , consequently most of the area is given over to farming . Shapinsay has two nature reserves and is notable for its bird life . 
 At the 2011 census , Shapinsay had a population of 307 . The economy of the island is primarily based on agriculture with the exception of a few small businesses that are largely tourism @-@ related . Plans for the construction of a wind turbine are under consideration . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Unlike most of the larger Orkney islands , the derivation of the name ' Shapinsay ' is not obvious . The final ' ay ' is from the Old Norse for island , but the first two syllables are more difficult to interpret . Haswell @-@ Smith ( 2004 ) suggests the root may be <unk> @-@ øy ( helpful island ) owing to the presence of a good harbour , although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago . The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to <unk> , which may suggest a derivation from Judge 's island . Another suggestion is <unk> 's island , although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Standing stones provide evidence of the island 's human occupation since Neolithic times . According to Tacitus , the Roman general Agricola subdued the inhabitants of the Orkney Islands , and a local legend holds that he landed on Shapinsay . During the 18th century , a croft named <unk> was renamed Agricola ( which is also Latin for " farmer " ) . Roman coins have been found on Shapinsay , but they may have been brought to the island by traders . 
 Shapinsay is briefly mentioned in the Norse sagas . The Saga of Haakon Haakonsson states that Haakon IV of Norway anchored in Elwick Bay before sailing south to eventual defeat at the Battle of Largs . 
 = = = 18th century = = = 
 The 18th century saw the beginnings of change to agriculture on Shapinsay , courtesy of the Balfour family . The family owned the estate of Sound , which covered the western part of the island . Sound had passed from the Tulloch family to the Buchanan family in the 17th century . In 1674 , Arthur Buchanan built the house of Sound , where Balfour Castle now stands . His granddaughter married James Fea , who is best known for his role in the capture of the Orkney Pirate John Gow . Fea was a supporter of the Jacobite Rebellion , and the house was burned by Hanoverian troops in revenge . The estate was acquired by Andrew Ross , Stewart Depute in Orkney of the Earl of Morton . Ross 's heirs , the Lindsay brothers , sold the estate to Thomas Balfour in 1782 . Balfour had previously rented the Bu of Burray , a large manor farm on another Orkney island , but had insufficient wealth to acquire the estate even though his wife had inherited a legacy on the death of her aristocratic brother . To raise the necessary funds , Balfour had to sell his military commission and borrow from his brother , John , who was prospering in India with the East India Company . Once installed on the island , he built a new house , <unk> , and founded the village of <unk> , now known as Balfour . He also reformed the local agriculture , enclosing fields and constructing farm buildings . 
 William Irving was born c . 1740 in the small hamlet of <unk> in the northeast of the island . He became a sailor before emigrating to New York in 1763 . One of his sons was Washington Irving , author of Rip van Winkle and the first American author to gain international recognition . 
 Marjory <unk> , a native of Shapinsay , was the last person to be executed in Orkney , in 1728 . She was a young servant , hanged in Kirkwall for the murder of a child . The execution is recorded as requiring 24 armed men , not including officers , and costing £ 15 8s . 
 During this period , burning kelp was a mainstay of the island economy . More than 3 @,@ 048 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ) of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make soda ash , bringing in £ 20 @,@ 000 for the inhabitants . Thomas Balfour 's income from the kelp industry brought him four times the income that farming did . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 The 19th century saw more radical change in Shapinsay . Thomas Balfour 's grandson , David Balfour , transformed the island after inheriting the family estate , which by 1846 encompassed the whole of Shapinsay . Most of the land was divided into fields of 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) , a feature that is still apparent today . Tenants were required to enclose and drain the land or pay for the estate to do it in the form of a surcharge added to their rents . In 1846 , 303 hectares ( 1 @.@ 17 sq mi ) on Shapinsay consisted of arable land . By 1860 , that had trebled to more than 890 @.@ 3 hectares ( 3 @.@ 44 sq mi ) . New crops and breeds of cattle and sheep were also introduced . Balfour 's reforms were described as " the fountain and source of Orkney Improvement . " 
 Balfour also gave the island its most noticeable landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect , David Bryce , to transform <unk> House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle . Other buildings he added to the island include the porter 's lodge ( now a public house called The Gatehouse ) , a water mill , a school , and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s . The gasworks is in the form of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones — including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray , which is inscribed with the year 1725 . The structure appears to be fortified , in accordance with Balfour 's intention to give the village a medieval appearance . David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam , a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve . 
 Fishing for herring and cod also grew in importance during the 19th century . Herring fishing was expanding generally in Scotland at that time , with fishing stations being set up in remote areas . Herring fishing began in 1814 on Stronsay and soon spread throughout the Orkney Islands . By the middle of the century , Shapinsay had 50 herring boats . Cod became important largely because the Napoleonic Wars forced English fishing boats to fish further north . Local fishermen , who had been catching fish using lines from small boats for centuries , also began trawling for cod . However , this was largely a part @-@ time venture , unlike in Shetland , where many inhabitants made a living from fishing . A saying originating from this time states , " a <unk> is a fisherman with a croft , while an Orcadian is a farmer with a boat . " Consequently , fishermen from outside the Orkney Islands earned a large share of the profits . Helliar Holm 's beaches were used to dry both herring and cod after they had been salted . With the end of the Napoleonic Wars , which led to cheaper sources of soda ash becoming available from continental Europe , the kelp industry collapsed by 1830 . This collapse helped fuel agricultural reform , as crofters accustomed to earning a second income had to now earn more from farming . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 The Balfour estate sold its farms on Shapinsay between 1924 and 1928 . This was a common occurrence in Orkney at the time as wealthy landowners moved to more lucrative forms of investment . Farms were generally sold to the sitting tenant or to their neighbours who wished to expand . 
 The 20th century saw many changes in farming on Shapinsay . Mechanised implements came to the island , particularly after the Second World War . In common with the rest of Orkney , the amount of land given over to growing grass increased . The growing of grain ( with the exception of barley ) and turnips steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by silage , usually harvested by mechanical forage harvesters . 
 Orkney was a strategic site during both World Wars , and Shapinsay was no exception . In 1917 , during the First World War , the 836 @-@ tonne ( 823 @-@ long @-@ ton ) Swiftsure was hit by a mine 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) east of Haco 's Ness and sank in 19 metres ( 62 ft ) of water with the loss of a single life . The site of the wreck was not discovered until 1997 . 
 During the Second World War , gun batteries were built on the island . A twin six pounder emplacement at <unk> Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German torpedo boats . A Castle Battery was operational from 1941 – 43 , as was an anti @-@ aircraft battery . Mains electricity arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s , when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall . 
 The trend towards more intensive farming began to be partially reversed by the end of the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants . For example , Richard Zawadzki , owner of Balfour Mains ( the largest farm on the island ) , ceased to breed livestock ( instead keeping animals bred elsewhere ) and grew less grain ( some barley is still grown on the farm ) . Instead , some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme , which aims to encourage natural vegetation , wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers . 
 Tourism started to become important in the latter half of the century ; the first restaurant to incorporate bed and breakfast facilities opened in 1980 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 With an area of 2 @,@ 948 hectares ( 11 sq mi ) , Shapinsay is the 8th largest Orkney island and the 29th largest Scottish island . The highest point of Ward Hill is 64 metres ( 210 ft ) above sea level . The east coast is composed of low cliffs and has several sea caves , including the picturesque geo at the extreme northern tip known as Geo of Ork . Elwick Bay is a sheltered anchorage on the south coast , facing the Orkney mainland ; the island 's largest settlement , Balfour , is at the western end of the bay . 
 The island has several <unk> , or storm beaches , which form narrow spits of shingle or sand cutting across the landward and seaward ends of shallow bays . They can sometimes cut off a body of water from the sea , forming shallow freshwater lochs known as <unk> . Examples include Vasa Loch and <unk> Water . 
 There are several small islands in the vicinity including Broad Shoal , Grass Holm and Skerry of Vasa . Helliar Holm is a tidal islet at the eastern entrance to the main harbour at Balfour ; it has a small lighthouse and a ruined broch . The String , a stretch of water that lies between Helliar Holm and the mainland , has strong tidal currents . 
 = = Geology = = 
 In common with most of the Orkney isles , Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone , which is approximately 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period . These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of Pangaea , eroded and then deposited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian , with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian . The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former . At Haco 's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of <unk> diabase . The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The island 's bird life is particularly rich in waders such as curlew and redshank , found at The Ouse and <unk> Bay , and gull and tern colonies on the rockier shores and <unk> pintail , <unk> and whooper swans are regular summer visitors , and there are also breeding populations of shelducks , hen harriers and bonxies . There is an introduced population of red @-@ legged partridges . Otters can be seen at the Ouse , <unk> Water and Vasa Loch , and at various places around the coast along with common seals and Atlantic grey seals . There are plans to build a hide to allow visitors to observe seals without disturbing them . Shapinsay and Hoy are the only two larger Orkney islands that lack the Orkney vole ( Microtus arvalis orcadensis ) . Wildflowers abound in the summer , and the lichen <unk> <unk> , which is endemic to Scotland , is found in only three locations , including Shapinsay . In addition to the RSPB reserve at Mill Dam there is a Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve at East Hill in the southeast . 
 = = Demography = = 
 The highest recorded population for Shapinsay is 974 , in 1881 . Since then , the population of the island has steadily declined ; less than a third of that number was recorded in the 2001 census . The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century than it had been in the first half of that century . In 2001 , Shapinsay had a population of 300 , a decline of 6 @.@ 8 % from 322 in 1991 . This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period , which was 1 @.@ 9 % . However , the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands , most of which experienced declines of more than 10 % . The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0 @.@ 1 , similar to the 0 @.@ 2 persons per hectare across Orkney . At the time of the 2011 census the usually resident population had increased to 307 . During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . 
 Of the island 's 300 inhabitants recorded in 2001 , 283 were born in the United Kingdom ( 227 in Scotland and 56 in England ) . Seventeen were born outside the United Kingdom ( four elsewhere in Europe , four in Asia , four in North America , one in South America and four in Oceania ) . By age group , 85 of the inhabitants were under 30 years of age , 134 were aged between 30 and 59 , and 71 were age 60 and over . 
 = = Notable buildings = = 
 Balfour Castle dominates views of the southwest of the island and can be seen from the tower of St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall . The castle library features a secret passage hidden behind a false set of bookshelves . The Balfours escaped unwelcome visitors through this passageway , which leads to the conservatory door , enabling the butler to truthfully tell visitors that the Balfours were not in the house . Another feature of the castle is the stags ' heads with gaslights at the tips of their antlers , although these are no longer used as working lights . The castle grounds feature deciduous woodland ( now rare in Orkney ) and 2 acres ( 8 @,@ 100 m2 ) of walled gardens . Though built around an older structure that dates at least from the 18th century , the present castle was built in 1847 , commissioned by Colonel David Balfour , and designed by Edinburgh architect David Bryce . 
 Other buildings constructed by David Balfour include the <unk> Tower , known locally as The Douche . This is a saltwater shower building with a dovecote on top . A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea , the building is now in a serious state of disrepair , with roofing slates missing and the dovecote in danger of collapsing . 
 A more ancient dwelling on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston . Only the interior of this partially buried building has been excavated , allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound . The surviving drystone walls rise to about three metres ( 10 ft ) and are more than four metres ( 13 ft ) thick in some places . 
 The broch shows more evidence of David Balfour 's influence on Shapinsay . He arranged for the site to be excavated by the archaeologists George Petrie and Sir William Dryden in 1861 . The site was neglected after the excavation , slowly filling up with vegetation and rubble before being cleared in 1994 . 
 Shapinsay Heritage Centre is located in Balfour 's former smithy , along with a craft shop and a cafe . The castle 's former gatehouse is now the village public house . 
 = = Economy = = 
 In common with the other Orkney islands , Shapinsay is fertile agricultural land , with farms specialising in beef and lamb which export thousands of cattle and sheep annually . Orkney Ferries provides transport for pedestrians and vehicles , proximity to Kirkwall permitting closer contacts with the Orkney Mainland than is possible for most of the other North Isles . There are six crossings per day , the journey lasting about 25 minutes , which allows for a moderate amount of commuting . Between 1893 and 1964 , the island was served by the steamer Iona . Since 1964 , the <unk> and then the <unk> have operated the service ; the current ferry is the MV Shapinsay . The Orkney Islands Council has considered building a tunnel to the Orkney Mainland . Balfour Castle is now run as a hotel by the family of Captain Tadeusz Zawadzki , a Polish cavalry officer . 
 The Shapinsay development trust is working on the island 's community plan , and owns the island 's wind turbine , which was completed in August 2011 after the community voted for its construction . According to the development trust , the turbine could earn more than £ 5 million during its 25 @-@ year lifetime . 
 Small businesses on Shapinsay include a jam and chutney manufacturer , which uses traditional methods , and a studio offering residential arts courses such as stained glass crafting . 
 = = Education and culture = = 
 Shapinsay has a primary school , which in the 2006 – 7 academic year had 26 pupils . Before 1995 , the island also had a secondary school but lost this because of falling enrolment and improved transport links with Kirkwall , to where Shapinsay secondary pupils now travel . The school doubles as a community centre and is host to a learning centre supported by the UHI Millennium Institute . This centre uses the internet , email and video @-@ conferencing to allow students in Shapinsay to study without leaving the island . 
 In December 2006 , the pupils staged a joint Christmas show with a school in Grinder , Norway , 875 kilometres ( 544 mi ) from Shapinsay . The schools used the internet to collaborate , supported by BT Group ( BT ) , which upgraded the school 's broadband connection . The finale of the show involved the Norwegian pupils singing Away in a Manger in English while the Shapinsay pupils responded with En <unk> Skinner I Natt in Norwegian . This multilingual collaboration was somewhat easier for the Grinder pupils , who are taught English from the age of six . This collaboration was part of an ongoing relationship between the schools , whose children exchange letters and cards . Shapinsay school 's headteacher has visited the Norwegian school , and there are plans for a reciprocal visit in 2008 . 
 Shapinsay Community School has gained a Silver Award under the international Eco @-@ Schools programme . School pupils have carried out an energy audit , helped to plant more than 600 trees close to the school and carried out energy saving campaigns . Shapinsay pupils have also won an award from the Scottish Crofters Commission for producing a booklet on crofting on the island .

 Cubbie Roo , the best known Orcadian giant , has a presence on Shapinsay . He was originally based on the historical figure <unk> <unk> , who built Cubbie Roo 's Castle in 1150 on the isle of Wyre , which is possibly the oldest castle in Scotland , and was mentioned in the Orkneyinga Saga . However , the figure Cubbie Roo has departed far from his historical origins and has become a giant in the fashion that Finn MacCool ( legendary builder of the Giant 's Causeway ) has in Ireland . He is said to have lived on the island of Wyre and used Orkney 's islands as stepping stones . Many large stones on Orkney islands , including Shapinsay , are said to have been thrown or left there by the giant . Cubbie Roo 's Burn is a waterway on Shapinsay that flows through a channel called <unk> . Cubbie Roo 's Lade is a pile of stones on the shore near <unk> Head , the westmost point of Stronsay . This is supposedly the beginning of a bridge between the two islands that the giant had failed to complete . The name derives from the Old Norse <unk> @-@ <unk> , meaning " giant 's causeway " . 
 In 1905 , The Orcadian newspaper reported that a strange creature had been seen off the coast of Shapinsay . It was reportedly the size of a horse , with a spotted body covered in scales . Opinion on the creature 's origin was divided , with some islanders believing it to be a sea serpent , while others opined that it was merely a large seal . 
 = Stephen Lekapenos = 
 Stephen Lekapenos or Lecapenus ( Greek : <unk> <unk> ; died 18 April 963 ) was the second son of the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos ( r . 920 – 944 ) , and co @-@ emperor from 924 to 945 . With his younger brother Constantine , he deposed Romanos I in December 944 , but was overthrown and exiled by the legitimate emperor Constantine VII ( r . 913 – 959 ) a few weeks later . Stephen lived out his life in exile on the island of Lesbos , where he died on Easter 963 .

 Stephen was the second son of Romanos I and his wife Theodora .

His younger brothers were Constantine ( co @-@ emperor 924 – 945 ) and Theophylact ( Patriarch of Constantinople in 933 – 956 ) . He probably also had at least two unnamed younger sisters , known only because of their marriages to the <unk> Romanos Mosele and Romanos <unk> .

 Romanos Lekapenos had risen to power in 919 , when he had managed to appoint himself regent over the young Constantine VII and marry his daughter Helena to him . Within a year , he successively rose from basileopator to Caesar , and was eventually crowned senior emperor on 17 December 920 . To consolidate his hold on power , and with a view of supplanting the ruling Macedonian dynasty with his own family , he raised his eldest son Christopher to co @-@ emperor in May 921 , while Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co @-@ emperors on 25 December 924 . 
 Following Christopher 's early death in 931 , and given Constantine VII 's de facto sidelining , Stephen and Constantine assumed an increased prominence , although formally they still ranked after their brother @-@ in @-@ law in the college of emperors . In 933 , Stephen was married to Anna , the daughter of a certain <unk> , who was crowned Augusta on the same occasion . The couple had one known son , Romanos . According to the 11th @-@ century chronicler George Kedrenos , he was castrated in 945 , but later became a <unk> . 
 Stephen and Constantine Lekapenos came to the fore in 943 , when they opposed a dynastic marriage for their nephew , Romanos II . Their father wanted to have his eldest surviving grandson married to Euphrosyne , a daughter of his successful general John Kourkouas . Although such a union would effectively cement the loyalty of the army , it would also strengthen the position of the legitimate Macedonian line , represented by Romanos II and his father Constantine VII , over the imperial claims of Romanos 's own sons . Predictably , Stephen and Constantine opposed this decision , and prevailed upon their father , who was by this time ill and old , to dismiss Kourkouas in the autumn of 944 . Romanos II instead married Bertha , an illegitimate daughter of Hugh of Arles , King of Italy , who changed her name to Eudokia after her marriage . 
 With Romanos I approaching the end of his life , the matter of his succession became urgent . In 943 , Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death . This greatly upset his two sons , who feared that their brother @-@ in @-@ law would have them deposed and force them to take monastic vows . Motivated , in the opinion of Steven Runciman , partially by self @-@ preservation and partially from genuine ambition , they started planning to seize power through a coup d 'état , with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner . 
 Their fellow conspirators included Marianos Argyros , the protospatharios Basil Peteinos , Manuel Kourtikes , the strategos Diogenes , <unk> , and Philip . Kedrenos , however , considers Peteinos to have served as an agent of Constantine VII among the conspirators . On 20 December 944 , the conspirators set their plans in motion . The two brothers smuggled their supporters in the Great Palace of Constantinople during the midday break in palace activities . They then led their men into the chamber of Romanos I , where they easily captured the " ill old man " . They were able to transport him to the nearest harbour and from there to Prote , one of the Princes ' Islands and a popular place of exile . There , Romanos agreed to take monastic vows and retire from the throne . 
 Having managed to quietly depose their father , the brothers now had to deal with Constantine VII . Unfortunately for them , rumours soon spread around Constantinople , to the effect that , following Romanos 's deposition , Constantine VII 's life was in danger . Before long , crowds gathered before the palace , demanding to see their emperor in person . The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi , Gaeta , Rome , and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII . Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable , recognizing their brother @-@ in @-@ law as the senior emperor . 
 The new triumvirate lasted for about 40 days . The three emperors soon appointed new leaders for the military services . Bardas Phokas the Elder was appointed as the new Domestic of the Schools , and Constantine Gongyles as head of the Byzantine navy . Stephen and his brother managed to reward their fellow conspirators . Peteinos became patrikios and Great <unk> , Argyros was appointed Count of the Stable , Kourtikes a patrikios and droungarios of the Watch . On 26 January 945 , however , at the urging of their sister , the Augusta Helena , another coup removed the two Lekapenoi from power and restored the sole imperial authority to Constantine VII . 
 = = = Exile = = = 
 Initially , the two brothers were sent to Prote . The Byzantine chroniclers have their father welcoming them by quoting a passage from the Book of Isaiah , specifically Chapter 1 @.@ 2 : " Hear , O heavens , and give ear , O earth ; for Jehovah hath spoken : I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me . " Liutprand of Cremona , however , gives a slightly different account , having Romanos receive his sons with bitter sarcasm , thanking them for not neglecting him and begging them to excuse the monks for their ignorance on how to properly receive emperors . Soon , however , Stephen was moved on to a prison at <unk> , and then to Rhodes , before finally settling in Methymna , Lesbos . 
 A plot by some members of the imperial government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated . Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday , 963 . John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII , by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne . It should , however , be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources , usually by poison . 
 = Tichborne case = 
 The Tichborne case was a legal cause célèbre that captivated Victorian England in the 1860s and 1870s . It concerned the claims by an individual sometimes referred to as Thomas Castro or as Arthur Orton , but usually termed " the Claimant " , to be the missing heir to the Tichborne baronetcy . He failed to convince the courts , was convicted of perjury and served a long prison sentence . 
 Roger Tichborne , heir to the family 's title and fortunes , was presumed to have died in a shipwreck in 1854 . His mother clung to a belief that he might have survived , and after hearing rumours that he had made his way to Australia , she advertised extensively in Australian newspapers , offering a reward for information . In 1866 , a butcher known as Thomas Castro from Wagga Wagga came forward claiming to be Roger Tichborne . Although his manners and bearing were unrefined , he gathered support and travelled to England . He was instantly accepted by Lady Tichborne as her son , although other family members were dismissive and sought to expose him as an impostor . 
 During protracted enquiries before the case came to law in 1871 , details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton , a butcher 's son from Wapping in London , who had gone to sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia . After a civil court had rejected the Claimant 's case , he was charged with perjury ; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support . In 1874 , a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton . Before passing a sentence of 14 years , the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant 's counsel , Edward Kenealy , who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct . 
 After the trial , Kenealy instigated a popular radical reform movement , the Magna Charta Association , which championed the Claimant 's cause for some years . Kenealy was elected to Parliament in 1875 as a radical independent but was not an effective parliamentarian . The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884 , and he had no dealings with it . In 1895 , he confessed to being Orton , only to recant almost immediately . He lived generally in poverty for the rest of his life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898 . Although most commentators have accepted the court 's view that the Claimant was Orton , some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that , conceivably , he was Roger Tichborne . 
 = = Family history = = 
 The Tichbornes , of Tichborne Park near Alresford in Hampshire , were an old English Catholic family who had been prominent in the area since before the Norman Conquest . After the Reformation in the 16th century , although one of their number was hanged , drawn and quartered for complicity in the Babington Plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I , the family in general remained loyal to the Crown , and in 1621 Benjamin Tichborne was created a baronet for services to King James I. 
 In 1803 the seventh baronet , Sir Henry Tichborne , was captured by the French in Verdun during the Napoleonic Wars and detained as a civil prisoner for some years . With him in captivity were his fourth son , James , and a nobly born Englishman , Henry Seymour of <unk> . Despite his confinement , Seymour managed to conduct an affair with the daughter of the Duc de Bourbon as a result of which a daughter , Henriette Felicité , was born in about 1807 . Years later , when Henriette had passed her 20th birthday and remained unmarried , Seymour thought his former companion James Tichborne might make a suitable husband — although James was close to his own age and was physically unprepossessing . The couple were married in August 1827 ; on 5 January 1829 Henriette gave birth to a son , Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne . 
 Sir Henry had been succeeded in 1821 by his eldest son , Henry Joseph , who fathered seven daughters but no male heir . As baronetcies are inherited only by males , when Henry Joseph died in 1845 the immediate heir was his younger brother Edward , who had assumed the surname of Doughty as a condition of a legacy . Edward 's only son died in childhood , so James Tichborne became next in line to the baronetcy , and after him , Roger . As the family 's fortunes had been greatly augmented by the Doughty bequest , this was a considerable material prospect . 
 After Roger 's birth , James and Henriette had three more children : two daughters who died in infancy and a second son , Alfred , born in 1839 . The marriage was unhappy , and the couple spent much time apart , he in England , she in Paris with Roger . As a consequence of his upbringing , Roger spoke mainly French , and his English was heavily accented . In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College , where he remained until 1848 . In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards , in which he served for three years , mainly in Ireland . 
 When on leave , Roger often stayed with his Uncle Edward at Tichborne Park and became attracted to his cousin Katherine Doughty , four years his junior . Sir Edward and his wife , though they were fond of their nephew , did not consider marriage between first cousins desirable . At one point the young couple were forbidden to meet , though they continued to do so clandestinely . Feeling harassed and frustrated , Roger hoped to escape from the situation through a spell of overseas military duty ; when it became clear that the regiment would remain in the British Isles , he resigned his commission . On 1 March 1853 he left for a private tour of South America on board La Pauline , bound for Valparaíso in Chile . 
 = = Travels and disappearance = = 
 On 19 June 1853 La Pauline reached Valparaíso , where letters informed Roger that his father had succeeded to the baronetcy , Sir Edward having died in May . In all , Roger spent 10 months in South America , accompanied in the first stages by a family servant , John Moore . In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla , which lies on the route between Valparaíso and Santiago . Moore , who had fallen ill , was paid off in Santiago , while Roger travelled to Peru , where he took a long hunting trip . By the end of 1853 he was back in Valparaíso , and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes . At the end of January , he reached Buenos Aires , where he wrote to his aunt , Lady Doughty , indicating that he was heading for Brazil , then Jamaica and finally Mexico . The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro , in April 1854 , awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica . Although he lacked a passport he secured a berth on a ship , the Bella , which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April . 
 On 24 April 1854 a capsized ship 's boat bearing the name Bella was discovered off the Brazilian coast , together with some wreckage but no personnel , and the ship 's loss with all hands was assumed . The Tichborne family were told in June that Roger must be presumed lost , though they retained a faint hope , fed by rumours , that another ship had picked up survivors and taken them to Australia . Sir James Tichborne died in June 1862 , at which point , if he was alive , Roger became the 11th baronet . As he was by then presumed dead , the title passed to his younger brother Alfred , whose financial recklessness rapidly brought about his near @-@ bankruptcy . Tichborne Park was vacated and leased to tenants . 
 Encouraged by a clairvoyant 's assurance that her elder son was alive and well , in February 1863 Lady Tichborne , Roger 's mother , began placing regular newspaper advertisements in The Times offering a reward for information about Roger Tichborne and the fate of the Bella . None of these produced results ; however , in May 1865 Lady Tichborne saw an advertisement placed by Arthur Cubitt of Sydney , Australia , on behalf of his " Missing Friends Agency " . She wrote to him , and he agreed to place a series of notices in Australian newspapers . These gave details of the Bella 's last voyage and described Roger Tichborne as " of a delicate constitution , rather tall , with very light brown hair and blue eyes " . A " most liberal reward " would be given " for any information that may definitely point out his fate " . 
 = = Claimant appears = = 
 = = = In Australia = = = 
 In October 1865 Cubitt informed Lady Tichborne that William Gibbes , a lawyer from Wagga Wagga , had identified Roger Tichborne in the person of a bankrupt local butcher using the name Thomas Castro . During his bankruptcy examination Castro had mentioned an entitlement to property in England . He had also talked of experiencing a shipwreck and was smoking a briar pipe which carried the initials " <unk> " When challenged by Gibbes to reveal his true name , Castro had initially been reticent but eventually agreed that he was indeed the missing Roger Tichborne ; henceforth he became generally known as the Claimant . 
 Cubitt offered to accompany the supposed lost son back to England and wrote to Lady Tichborne requesting funds . Meanwhile , Gibbes asked the Claimant to make out a will and to write to his mother . The will gave Lady Tichborne 's name as " Hannah Frances " and disposed of numerous nonexistent parcels of Tichborne property . In the letter to his mother , the Claimant 's references to his former life were vague and equivocal but were enough to convince Lady Tichborne that he was her elder son . Her willingness to accept the Claimant may have been influenced by the death of her younger son , Alfred , in February . 
 In June 1866 the Claimant moved to Sydney , where he was able to raise money from banks on the basis of a statutory declaration that he was Roger Tichborne . The statement was later found to contain many errors , although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly . It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia : he and others from the sinking Bella , he said , had been picked up by the Osprey , bound for Melbourne . On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga . He had married a pregnant housemaid , Mary Ann Bryant , and taken her child , a daughter , as his own ; a further daughter had been born in March 1866 . 
 While in Sydney the Claimant encountered two former servants of the Tichborne family . One was a gardener , Michael Guilfoyle , who at first acknowledged the identity of Roger Tichborne but later changed his mind when asked to provide money to facilitate the return to England . The second , Andrew Bogle , had worked for Sir Edward for many years . Bogle did not immediately recognise the Claimant , whose 189 pounds ( 86 kg ) weight contrasted sharply with Roger 's remembered slender build . However , Bogle quickly accepted that the Claimant was Roger , and remained convinced until the end of his life . On 2 September 1866 the Claimant , having received funds from England , sailed from Sydney on board the Rakaia with his wife and children and a small retinue that included Bogle . Good living in Sydney had raised his weight on departure to 210 pounds ( 95 kg ) , and during the long voyage he added another 40 pounds ( 18 kg ) . After a journey involving several changes of ship , the party arrived at Tilbury on 25 December 1866 . 
 = = = Recognition in France = = = 
 After depositing his family in a London hotel , the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne 's address and was told she was in Paris . He then went to Wapping in East London , where he enquired after a local family named Orton . Finding that they had left the area , he identified himself to a neighbour as a friend of Arthur Orton , who , he said , was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia . The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later . On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel , where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes . The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret . He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family . 
 Back in London , the Claimant employed a solicitor , John Holmes , who agreed to go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne . This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille . As soon as she saw his face , Lady Tichborne accepted him . At Holmes 's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son . She was unmoved when Father Châtillon , Roger 's childhood tutor , declared the Claimant an impostor , and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger . She settled an income of £ 1 @,@ 000 a year on him , and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family . 
 = = Laying the groundwork , 1867 – 71 = = 
 = = = Support and opposition = = = 
 The Claimant quickly acquired significant supporters ; the Tichborne family 's solicitor Edward Hopkins accepted him , as did J.P. Lipscomb , the family 's doctor . Lipscomb , after a detailed medical examination , reported that the Claimant possessed a distinctive genital malformation . It would later be suggested that Roger Tichborne had this same defect , but this could not be established beyond speculation and hearsay . Many people were impressed by the Claimant 's seeming ability to recall small details of Roger Tichborne 's early life , such as the fly fishing tackle he had used . Several soldiers who had served with Roger in the Dragoons , including his former batman Thomas Carter , recognised the Claimant as Roger . Other notable supporters included Lord Rivers , a landowner and sportsman , and Guildford Onslow , the Liberal MP for Guildford who became one of the Claimant 's staunchest advocates . Rohan <unk> , in his account of the case , calls this wide degree of recognition remarkable , particularly given the Claimant 's increasing physical differences from the slim Roger . By mid @-@ June 1867 the Claimant 's weight had reached almost 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) and would increase even more in the ensuing years . 
 Despite Lady Tichborne 's insistence that the Claimant was her son , the rest of the Tichbornes and their related families were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud . They recognised Alfred Tichborne 's infant son , Henry Alfred , as the 12th baronet . Lady Doughty , Sir Edward 's widow , had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant 's arrival in England . Lady Tichborne 's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French ( Roger 's first language as a child ) and lacked any trace of a French accent . The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors . Vincent Gosford , a former Tichborne Park steward , was unimpressed by the Claimant , who , when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853 , said he could not remember . The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family 's affairs , including , for example , the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park . Apart from Lady Tichborne a distant cousin , Anthony John Wright Biddulph , was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine ; however , as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support , the Claimant 's position remained strong . 
 On 31 July 1867 the Claimant underwent a judicial examination at the Chancery Division of the Royal Courts of Justice . He testified that after his arrival in Melbourne in July 1854 he had worked for William Foster at a cattle station in Gippsland under the name of Thomas Castro . While there , he had met Arthur Orton , a fellow Englishman . After leaving Foster 's employment the Claimant had subsequently wandered the country , sometimes with Orton , working in various capacities before setting up as a butcher in Wagga Wagga in 1865 . On the basis of this information , the Tichborne family sent an agent , John Mackenzie , to Australia to make further enquiries . Mackenzie located Foster 's widow , who produced the old station records . These showed no reference to " Thomas Castro " , although the employment of an " Arthur Orton " was recorded . Foster 's widow also identified a photograph of the Claimant as Arthur Orton , thus providing the first direct evidence that the Claimant might in fact be Orton . In Wagga Wagga one local resident recalled the butcher Castro saying that he had learned his trade in Wapping . When this information reached London , enquiries were made in Wapping by a private detective , ex @-@ police inspector Jack Whicher , and the Claimant 's visit in December 1866 was revealed . 
 = = = Orton = = = 
 Arthur Orton , a butcher 's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping , had gone to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s . Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart , Tasmania , in the transport ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia . His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages . Thereafter he disappears ; if he was not Castro , there is no further direct evidence of Orton 's existence , although strenuous efforts were made to find him . The Claimant hinted that some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names . Most of Orton 's family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long @-@ lost kinsman , although it was later revealed that he had paid them money . However , a former sweetheart of Orton 's , Mary Ann Loder , did identify the Claimant as Orton . 
 = = = Financial problems = = = 
 Lady Tichborne died on 12 March 1868 , thus depriving the Claimant of his principal advocate and his main source of income . He outraged the family by insisting on taking the position of chief mourner at her funeral mass . His lost income was rapidly replaced by a fund , set up by supporters , that provided a house near Alresford and an income of £ 1 @,@ 400 a year . 
 In September 1868 , together with his legal team , the Claimant went to South America to meet face @-@ to @-@ face with potential witnesses in Melipilla who might confirm his identity . He disembarked at Buenos Aires , ostensibly to travel to Valparaíso overland and there rejoin his advisers who were continuing by sea . After waiting two months in Buenos Aires he caught a ship home . His explanations for this sudden retreat — poor health and the dangers from brigands — did not convince his backers , many of whom withdrew their support ; Holmes resigned as his solicitor . Furthermore , on their return his advisers reported that no one in Melipilla had heard of " Tichborne " , although they remembered a young English sailor called " Arturo " . 
 The Claimant was now bankrupt . In 1870 his new legal advisers launched a novel fundraising scheme : Tichborne Bonds , an issue of 1 @,@ 000 debentures of £ 100 face value , the holders of which would be repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance . About £ 40 @,@ 000 was raised , though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums . The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while . After a delay while the Franco @-@ Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris , the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871 . 
 = = Civil case : Tichborne v. Lushington , 1871 – 72 = = 
 The case was listed in the Court of Common Pleas as Tichborne v. Lushington , in the form of an action for the ejectment of Colonel Lushington , the tenant of Tichborne Park . The real purpose , however , was to establish the Claimant 's identity as Sir Roger Tichborne and his rights to the family 's estates ; failure on his part would expose him as an impostor . In addition to Tichborne Park 's 2 @,@ 290 acres ( 930 ha ) , the estates included manors , lands and farms in Hampshire , and considerable properties in London and elsewhere , which altogether produced an annual income of over £ 20 @,@ 000 , equivalent to several millions in 21st century terms . 
 = = = Evidence and cross @-@ examination = = = 
 The hearing , which took place within the Palace of Westminster , began on 11 May 1871 before Sir William Bovill , who was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas . The Claimant 's legal team was led by William Ballantine and Harding Giffard , both highly experienced advocates . Opposing them , acting on instructions from the bulk of the Tichborne family , were John Duke Coleridge , the Solicitor General ( he was promoted to Attorney @-@ General during the hearing ) , and Henry Hawkins , a future High Court judge who was then at the height of his powers as a cross @-@ examiner . In his opening speech , Ballantine made much of Roger Tichborne 's unhappy childhood , his overbearing father , his poor education and his frequently unwise choices of companions . The Claimant 's experiences in an open boat following the wreck of the Bella had , said Ballantine , impaired his memories of his earlier years , which explained his uncertain recall . Attempts to identify his client as Arthur Orton were , Ballantine argued , the concoctions of " irresponsible " private investigators acting for the Tichborne family . 
 The first witnesses for the Claimant included former officers and men from Roger Tichborne 's regiment , all of whom declared their belief that he was genuine . Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was John Moore , Roger 's valet in South America . He testified that the Claimant had remembered many small details of their months together , including clothing worn and the name of a pet dog the pair had adopted . Roger 's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company . 
 On 30 May Ballantine called the Claimant to the stand . During his examination @-@ in @-@ chief , the Claimant answered questions on Arthur Orton , whom he described as " a large @-@ boned man with sharp features and a lengthy face slightly marked with smallpox " . He had lost sight of Orton between 1862 and 1865 , but they had met again in Wagga Wagga , where the Claimant had discussed his inheritance . Under cross @-@ examination the Claimant was evasive when pressed for further details of his relationship with Orton , saying that he did not wish to incriminate himself . After questioning him on his visit to Wapping , Hawkins asked him directly : " Are you Arthur Orton ? " to which he replied " I am not " . The Claimant displayed considerable ignorance when questioned about his time at Stonyhurst . He could not identify Virgil , confused Latin with Greek , and did not understand what chemistry was . He caused a sensation when he declared that he had seduced Katherine Doughty and that the sealed package given to Gosford , the contents of which he earlier claimed not to recall , contained instructions to be followed in the event of her pregnancy . Rohan McWilliam , in his chronicle of the affair , comments that from that point on the Tichborne family were fighting not only for their estates but for Katherine Doughty 's honour . 
 = = = Collapse of case = = = 
 On 7 July the court adjourned for four months . When it resumed , Ballantine called more witnesses , including Bogle and Francis Baigent , a close family friend . Hawkins contended that Bogle and Baigent were feeding the Claimant with information , but in cross @-@ examination he could not dent their belief that the Claimant was genuine . In January 1872 Coleridge began the case for the defence with a speech during which he categorised the Claimant as comparable with " the great impostors of history " . He intended to prove that the Claimant was Arthur Orton . He had over 200 witnesses lined up , but it transpired that few were required . Lord Bellew , who had known Roger Tichborne at Stonyhurst , testified that Roger had distinctive body tattoos which the Claimant did not possess . On 4 March the jury notified the judge that they had heard enough and were ready to reject the Claimant 's suit . Having ascertained that this decision was based on the evidence as a whole and not solely on the missing tattoos , Bovill ordered the Claimant 's arrest on charges of perjury and committed him to Newgate prison . 
 = = Appeal to the public , 1872 – 73 = = 
 From his cell in Newgate the Claimant vowed to resume the fight as soon as he was acquitted . On 25 March 1872 he published in the Evening Standard an " Appeal to the Public " , requesting financial help to meet his continuing legal and living costs : " I appeal to every British soul who is inspired by a love of justice and fair play , and is willing to defend the weak against the strong " . The Claimant had garnered considerable popular support during the civil trial ; his fight was perceived by many as symbolising the problems faced by the working classes when seeking justice in the courts . In the wake of his appeal , support committees were formed throughout the country . When he was bailed early in April , on sureties provided by Lord Rivers and Guildford Onslow , a large crowd cheered him as he left the Old Bailey . 
 At a public meeting in Alresford on 14 May , Onslow reported that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring in , and that invitations to visit and speak had been received from many towns . As the Claimant addressed meetings up and down the country , journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent , suggestive of East London origins . The campaign drew in some high @-@ level supporters , among whom was George Hammond Whalley , a controversial anti @-@ Catholic who was MP for Peterborough . He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches ; after a meeting in St James 's Hall , London , on 11 December 1872 , each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice . They were both fined £ 100 for contempt of court . 
 With few exceptions the mainstream press was hostile to the Claimant 's campaign . To counteract this , his supporters launched two short @-@ lived newspapers : the Tichborne Gazette in May 1872 and the Tichborne News and Anti @-@ Oppression Journal in June . The former was wholly devoted to the Claimant 's cause and ran until Onslow 's and Whalley 's contempt convictions in December 1872 . The Tichborne News , which concerned itself with a broader range of perceived injustices , closed after four months . 
 = = Criminal case : Regina v. Castro , 1873 – 74 = = 
 = = = Judges and counsel = = = 
 The criminal case , to be heard in the Queen 's Bench , was listed as Regina v. Castro , the name Castro being the last uncontested alias of the Claimant . Because of its expected length , the case was scheduled as a " trial at bar " , a device that allowed a panel rather than a single judge to hear it . The president of the panel was Sir Alexander Cockburn , the Lord Chief Justice . His decision to hear this case was controversial , since during the civil case he had publicly denounced the Claimant as a perjurer and a <unk> . Cockburn 's co @-@ judges were Sir John Mellor and Sir Robert Lush , both experienced Queen 's Bench justices . 
 The prosecution team was largely that which had opposed the Claimant in the civil case , minus Coleridge . Hawkins led the team , his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew , both future judges . The Claimant 's team was significantly weaker ; he would not reengage Ballantine , and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again . Others refused the case , possibly because they knew they would have to present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty . The Claimant 's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy , an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity . Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences , including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising . He was assisted by undistinguished juniors : Patrick MacMahon , an Irish MP who was frequently absent , and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld . Kenealy 's task was made more difficult when several of his upper @-@ class witnesses refused to appear , perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown 's lawyers . Other key witnesses from the civil case , including Moore , Baigent and <unk> , likewise would not give evidence at the criminal trial . 
 = = = Trial = = = 
 The trial , one of the lengthiest cases heard in an English court , began on 21 April 1873 and lasted until 28 February 1874 , occupying 188 court days . The tone was dominated by Kenealy 's confrontational style ; his personal attacks extended not only to witnesses but to the Bench and led to frequent clashes with Cockburn . Under the legal rules that then applied to criminal cases the Claimant , though present in court , was not allowed to testify . Away from the court he revelled in his celebrity status ; the American writer Mark Twain , who was then in London , attended an event at which the Claimant was present and " thought him a rather fine and stately figure " . Twain observed that the company were " educated men , men moving in good society .... It was ' Sir Roger ' , always ' Sir Roger ' on all hands , no one withheld the title " . 
 Altogether , Hawkins called 215 witnesses , including numbers from France , Melipilla , Australia and Wapping , who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne or that he was Arthur Orton . A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant 's writing resembled Orton 's but not Roger Tichborne 's . The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was , Hawkins asserted , a fraud . A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant 's description . Furthermore , the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Osprey 's captain , and the names he gave for two of Osprey 's crew were found to belong to members of the crew of the Middleton , the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart . No mention of a rescue had been found in Osprey 's log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster 's records . Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet , Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties , but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty 's seduction or pregnancy . 
 Kenealy 's defence was that the Claimant was victim of a conspiracy which encompassed the Catholic Church , the government and the legal establishment . He frequently sought to demolish witnesses ' character , as with Lord Bellew , whose reputation he destroyed by revealing details of the peer 's adultery . Kenealy 's own witnesses included Bogle and Biddulph , who remained steadfast , but more sensational testimony came from a sailor called Jean Luie , who claimed that he had been on the Osprey during the rescue mission . Luie identified the Claimant as " Mr Rogers " , one of six survivors picked up and taken to Melbourne . On investigation Luie was found to be an impostor , a former prisoner who had been in England at the time of the Bella ’ s sinking . He was convicted of perjury and sentenced to seven years ' imprisonment . 
 = = = Summing @-@ up , verdict and sentence = = = 
 After closing addresses from Kenealy and Hawkins , Cockburn began summing @-@ up on 29 January 1874 . His speech was prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy 's conduct , " the longest , severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench to a member of the bar " according to the trial 's chronicler John Morse . The tone of the summing @-@ up was partisan , frequently drawing the jury 's attention to the Claimant 's " gross and astonishing ignorance " of things he would certainly know if he were Roger Tichborne . Cockburn rejected the Claimant 's version of the sealed package contents and all imputations against Katherine Doughty 's honour . Of Cockburn 's peroration , Morse remarked that " never was a more resolute determination manifested [ by a judge ] to control the result " . While much of the press applauded Cockburn 's forthrightness , his summing @-@ up was also criticised as " a Niagara of condemnation " rather than an impartial review . 
 The jury retired at noon on Saturday 28 February , and returned to the court within 30 minutes . Their verdict declared that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne , that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty , and that he was indeed Arthur Orton . He was thus convicted of perjury . The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy 's conduct during the trial . After the judges refused his request to address the court , the Claimant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years ' imprisonment . Kenealy 's behaviour ended his legal career ; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit mess and from Gray 's Inn , so that he could no longer practise . On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy 's patent as a Queen 's Counsel .

 = = = Popular movement = = = 
 The court 's verdict swelled the popular tide in favour of the Claimant . He and Kenealy were hailed as heroes , the latter as a martyr who had sacrificed his legal career . George Bernard Shaw , writing much later , highlighted the paradox whereby the Claimant was perceived simultaneously as a legitimate baronet and as a working @-@ class man denied his legal rights by a ruling elite . In April 1874 Kenealy launched a political organisation , the " Magna Charta Association " , with a broad agenda that reflected some of the Chartist demands of the 1830s and 1840s . In February 1875 Kenealy fought a parliamentary by @-@ election for Stoke @-@ upon @-@ Trent as " The People 's Candidate " , and won with a resounding majority . However , he failed to persuade the House of Commons to establish a royal commission into the Tichborne trial , his proposal securing only his own vote and the support of two non @-@ voting tellers , against 433 opposed . Thereafter , within parliament Kenealy became a generally derided figure , and most of his campaigning was conducted elsewhere . In the years of the Tichborne movement 's popularity a considerable market was created for souvenirs in the form of medallions , china figurines , <unk> and other memorabilia . However , by 1880 interest in the case had declined , and in the General Election of that year Kenealy was heavily defeated . He died of heart failure a few days after the election . The Magna Charta Association continued for several more years , with dwindling support ; The Englishman , the newspaper founded by Kenealy during the trial , closed down in May 1886 , and there is no evidence of the Association 's continuing activities after that date . 
 = = = Claimant 's release and final years = = = 
 The Claimant was released on licence on 11 October 1884 after serving 10 years . He was much slimmer ; a letter to Onslow dated May 1875 reports a loss of 148 pounds ( 67 kg ) . Throughout his imprisonment he had maintained that he was Roger Tichborne , but on release he disappointed supporters by showing no interest in the Magna Charta Association , instead signing a contract to tour with music halls and circuses . The British public 's interest in him had largely waned ; in 1886 he went to New York but failed to inspire any enthusiasm there and ended up working as a bartender . 
 He returned in 1887 to England , where , although not officially divorced from Mary Ann Bryant , he married a music hall singer , Lily <unk> . In 1895 , for a fee of a few hundred pounds , he confessed in The People newspaper that he was , after all , Arthur Orton . With the proceeds he opened a small tobacconist 's shop in Islington ; however , he quickly retracted the confession and insisted again that he was Roger Tichborne . His shop failed , as did other business attempts , and he died destitute , of heart disease , on 1 April 1898 . His funeral caused a brief revival of interest ; around 5 @,@ 000 people attended Paddington cemetery for the burial in an unmarked pauper 's grave . In what McWilliam calls " an act of extraordinary generosity " the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name " Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne " to be placed on the coffin before its interment . The name " Tichborne " was registered in the cemetery 's records . 
 = = = Appraisal = = = 
 Commentators have generally accepted the trial jury 's verdict that the Claimant was Arthur Orton . However , McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff ( 1957 ) , in which the author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne . Woodruff 's principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch , at such a distance , and then implement it : " [ I ] t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds of sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world , knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first @-@ hand , that he was her son " . 
 In 1876 , while the Claimant was serving his prison sentence , interest was briefly raised by the claims of William Cresswell , an inmate of a Sydney lunatic asylum , that he was Arthur Orton . There was circumstantial evidence that indicated some connection with Orton , and the Claimant 's supporters campaigned to have Cresswell brought to England . Nothing came of this , although the question of Cresswell 's possible identity remained a matter of dispute for years . In 1884 a Sydney court found the matter undecided , and ruled that the status quo should be maintained ; Cresswell stayed in the asylum . Shortly before his death in 1904 he was visited by the contemporaneous Lady Tichborne , who found no physical resemblance to any member of the Tichborne family . 
 Attempts have been made to reconcile some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case . To explain the degree of facial resemblance ( which even Cockburn accepted ) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family , Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton 's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne , Roger Tichborne 's grandfather . An alternative story has Orton 's mother seduced by James Tichborne , making Orton and Roger half @-@ brothers . Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia , with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity . The Claimant 's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant , Teresa Mary Agnes , maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years . There is no direct evidence for any of these theories . Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter , and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family . 
 Woodruff submits that the legal verdicts , although fair given the evidence before the courts , have not fully resolved the " great doubt " that Cockburn admitted hung over the case . Woodruff wrote in 1957 : " Probably for ever , now , its key long since lost ... a mystery remains " . A 1998 article in The Catholic Herald suggested that DNA profiling might resolve the mystery . The enigma has launched numerous retellings of the story in book and film , including the short story Tom Castro , the <unk> Imposter from Jorge Luis Borges 's Universal History of Infamy , and David Yates 's 1998 film The Tichborne Claimant . Thus , Woodruff concludes , " the man who lost himself still walks in history , with no other name than that which the common voice of his day accorded him : the Claimant " . 
 = Battle of Cobleskill = 
 The Battle of Cobleskill ( also known as the Cobleskill massacre ) was an American Revolutionary War raid on the frontier settlement of Cobleskill , New York on May 30 , 1778 . The battle , having taken place in the modern @-@ day village of <unk> , NY near Cobleskill @-@ Richmondville High School , marked the beginning of a phase in which Loyalists and Iroquois , encouraged and supplied by British authorities in the Province of Quebec , raided and destroyed numerous villages on what was then the United States western frontier of New York and Pennsylvania . 
 A small party of Iroquois entered Cobleskill and drew the local defenders into a trap set by a much larger party of Iroquois and Loyalists under the command of Joseph Brant . After killing a number of the militia and driving off the remainder , Brant 's forces destroyed much of the settlement . New York 's defenders retaliated against Brant 's actions against Cobleskill and other communities by destroying Iroquois villages later in the year , and Continental Army forces destroyed more Iroquois villages in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 . 
 = = Background = = 
 With the failure of British General John Burgoyne 's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 , the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war . British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments . During the winter of 1777 – 78 Brant and other British @-@ allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania . In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga ( present @-@ day Windsor , New York ) . He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May . One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler , who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley . 
 In 1778 the settlement of Cobleskill , New York consisted of twenty families living on farms spread out along Cobleskill Creek . It was part of the Schoharie Creek area which was a significant source of food for the Patriot war effort . Its principal defense was the small local militia under Captain Christian Brown . When attacks by the Iroquois were rumored to be coming in the spring of 1778 , the militia appealed for additional defenses . Continental Army Colonel Ichabod Alden sent a company of thirty to forty men from his 7th Massachusetts Regiment under Captain William Patrick to reinforce the militia . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On the morning of May 30 Brant laid a trap for Cobleskill 's defenders . He sent forward a small number of natives as a lure . Captain Patrick 's force and the local militia spotted them near the southern edge of the settlement . Despite Captain Brown 's warning that the Indians might be setting a trap , Patrick pressed forward as the natives withdrew , engaging them in a running battle . After about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) Brant sprung his trap , and Patrick 's company was engulfed by Brant 's larger force . Both Patrick and his second in command were killed in the battle , as was about half of their force . Brown organized the remaining forces into a fighting retreat back into the settlement . Five men took refuge in the house of George Warner which the attackers set on fire , killing all five men . A total of 22 settlers were killed , eight were wounded , and five captured by Brant 's men , while Brant 's force suffered an estimated 25 casualties . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Brant and his men burned ten houses and associated outbuildings before withdrawing , killing any cattle they could not take . Brant took five [ seven ] prisoners , [ which the Indians prepared to burn at the stake as retribution for a previous group of captives effecting an escape from the Indians , killing several Indians to do so . This group of seven prisoners were made to gather wood for their own funeral <unk> , and the fire was actually lit , before one of the captives , Lt. Maynard , a freemason , gave the mason signal of distress . Chief Brant noticed this , and stopped the execution . All of the seven captives were then made to march 40 days , first to Montreal , then to Quebec , obtaining only the sustenance they were able to gather while on the forced march . On the journey the Indians forced these seven captives to repeatedly " run the gauntlet " and forced them at times to keep their fingertips pushed into hot glowing pipe bowls for the Indians ' amusement . They were never given a choice of their future or lives by the Indians , or Chief Brant at any time . At Quebec these seven were ransomed by the Iroquois to the British authorities , and were kept at Quebec as prisoners of war until the treaty of 1783 . The account of Lt. Maynard is related in " 1000 Famous Freemasons " along with stories of an additional five masons , other revolutionary patriots , who were likewise saved by Brant . The groups capture and journey is chronicled in " Forests and <unk> by BF Hubbard , Montreal , 1874 pp. 62 – 63 @-@ 64 . ] Brant continued to build his forces and raid frontier communities in the Mohawk valley . He considered following up the attack on Cobleskill with one on Cherry Valley , but because the militia was on high alert , he instead withdrew back to Iroquois territory . Cherry Valley was the scene of a massacre the following November by forces led in part by Brant . 
 New York Governor George Clinton , who had been considering operations against Onaquaga , enlarged those plans after the raid on Cobleskill and Brant 's attack on German Flatts in September . In October 1778 Continental and militia forces destroyed Onaquaga and Unadilla , another Indian village that supported Brant and Butler . 
 The settlers of Cobleskill who were rendered destitute by the action received £ 200 in compensation for their troubles . Settlers from many area communities began withdrawing to larger , better fortified communities like Cherry Valley ( which began construction of a fort after the raid ) and Schenectady . This action and later ones by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the Continental Congress to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory . Commanded by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton , the 1779 expedition systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British , but did little to stop the frontier war . 
 = Taman Sari ( Yogyakarta ) = 
 Taman Sari also known as Taman Sari Water Castle is a site of a former royal garden of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta . It is located about 2 km south within the grounds of the Kraton , Yogyakarta , Indonesia . Built in mid 18th century , the Taman Sari had multiple functions , such as a resting area , a workshop , a meditation area , a defense area , and a hiding place . 
 Taman Sari consisted of four distinct areas : a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions located in the west , a bathing complex in the centre , a complex of pavilions and pools in the south , and a smaller lake in the east . Today only the central bathing complex is well preserved , while the other areas have been largely occupied by the Kampung Taman settlement . 
 Since 1995 the Yogyakarta Palace Complex including Taman Sari is listed as a tentative World Heritage Site . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Taman Sari comes from the Javanese words <unk> , meaning a " garden " or " park " and sari , which means " beautiful " or " flowers " . Hence , the name Taman Sari means an area of a beautiful garden adorned with flowers . An old article described it as a " water castle " ( Dutch : <unk> ) ; as by shutting the <unk> , the complex would be completely immersed in water , leaving tall structures standing out . 
 = = History = = 
 The building of Taman Sari commenced during the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwono I ( 1755 – 1792 ) , the first sultan of the Yogyakarta Sultanate , and was completed by the time of Sultan Hamengkubuwono II . The building site , however , had already been known as a bathing place called <unk> Spring since Sunan <unk> IV ’ s reign ( 1719 – 1726 ) . According to Kitab <unk> in Yogyakarta Kraton , the project leader for the construction of Taman Sari was Tumenggung <unk> . He had travelled twice to Batavia to learn about European architecture , which is the reason why the architecture of Taman Sari has marks of European style . The Regent of Madiun , Raden <unk> Prawirasentika , participated in funding the construction of Taman Sari . Prawirasentika also beseeched the Sultan to be relieved of Madiun 's tax obligation . He offered other alternative ways of payment . The Sultan accepted his proposal . In 1758 , the Sultan commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various complements , which would be used to build a beautiful garden . The sultan wanted a place where he could spend some time to relax after many years of wars that he had just experienced . Raden Tumenggung <unk> , under supervision of Raden Arya <unk> ( who later became Sri <unk> II ) , was responsible for the construction . The building was started in 1684 Javanese year ( 1758 AD ) . After finding out how large the complex was , Raden <unk> Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes . He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince <unk> who continued the project to completion . 
 Taman Sari was built three years after the <unk> Agreement as a resting place for Sultan Hamengkubuwono I. The complex consists of about 59 buildings including a mosque , meditation chambers , swimming pools , and a series of 18 water gardens and pavilions surrounded by artificial lakes . The complex was effectively used between 1765 – 1812 . 
 The British invasion of the Yogyakarta Kraton saw considerable parts of the complex destroyed in 1812 . 
 The building of Taman Sari ended upon the completion of the gates and the walls . A <unk> <unk> ( a Javanese chronogram ) on the western gate ( Gedhong Gapura Hageng ) marks the year with the Javanese words <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , denoting the Javanese year of 1691 or about 1765 : <unk> , " core " for 1 ; <unk> , " flower " for 9 ; <unk> , " suck " or " drink " for 6 ; <unk> , " bird " for 1 ; the sentence can be read as " birds gathering pollen of the flower " . The relief around this <unk> <unk> shows birds siphoning honey from flowery trees . 
 The maintenance of Taman Sari was abandoned shortly after Hamengkubuwono I died , partly because the elaborate hydraulic works were so difficult to maintain . The gardens were neglected and the buildings suffered some damage during the Java War of 1825 – 1830 . 
 The palace complex fell out of use following an earthquake in 1867 , which destroyed several buildings and drained the water features . Over time , squatters began to inhabit the site , surrounding the ruins of the deserted pavilions and filling the empty <unk> . 
 In early 1970s , effort at restoration was made . Only the bathing complex has been completely restored . 
 = = = Demang Tegis = = = 
 The manuscript of Serat <unk> mentions the story of Demang Tegis , a Portuguese man said to be one of the architect of Taman Sari . According to the manuscript , a strange man suddenly appeared in <unk> Village ( a locality name on the south coast of Java near Parangtritis ) . With long nose , white complexion , and a foreign language , the villagers suspected that the person was some kind of spirit or forest fairy . They presented him to the current sultan , Hamengkubuwono II . Apparently the sultan found interest in the person and took the strange man as his servant . Some years had passed and the man had finally learned to talk in Javanese . According to him , he was a Portuguese ( or in Javanese , <unk> ) who was stranded from a shipwreck . He also claimed to have been a housebuilder , so the sultan ordered him to erect a fortress . Satisfied by the man ’ s work , the sultan gave him the title " <unk> . " From then on that person was known as Demang <unk> or Demang Tegis . 
 There is a controversy whether Demang Tegis was actually the architect of Taman Sari , as the design resembles a hybrid of Javanese and Dutch styles , rather than Portuguese . P.J. <unk> , in Java – Book III , page 631 wrote , " Local research says that [ Taman Sari ’ s architecture ] was designed by either a Spanish or Portuguese engineer , who was stranded off his sunken ship at the southern beach . However , [ the architecture ] that strongly shows Javanese character contradicts this . " The evidence about Demang Tegis remains an inconclusive , yet the architecture of Taman Sari moved a number of Portuguese experts on architecture and cultural heritage to examine the Taman Sari in 2001 . 
 The widespread assumption of European influence in the design of Taman Sari has been also challenged by the research of Hélène <unk> @-@ <unk> from the University of Pantheon @-@ Sorbonne , presented in a 2003 conference paper . Analysing the historic context and architectural style of the complex , the conclusion is that the creators are most likely local Javanese . The absence of any mention of European involvement in the construction of Taman Sari in Dutch historic descriptions is presented as further evidence in support of this hypothesis . 
 = = Buildings = = 
 Taman Sari can be divided into four areas . The first area is the artificial lake Segaran located in the west . The second area is a bathing complex in the south of the Segaran lake , called the Umbul <unk> bathing complex . The third area , now completely gone , is the Pasarean Ledok Sari and <unk> Pool , located in the south of the bathing complex . The fourth area is the east side of the first and second area , which extend far to the east and to the southeast complex of Magangan . 
 = = = The Segaran lake area = = = 
 The Segaran lake area was the main complex of the Taman Sari during its era . This complex consisted of a man @-@ made lake called Segaran ( " artificial sea " ) with some buildings located on artificial islands in the middle of a lake . The buildings are connected by an underwater tunnel . It was used as the starting point for the royal family to reach the Taman Sari pools via a vessel . Today , the Segaran lake cannot be seen any longer as the water had been drained and the lake bed is now filled with human settlements . The underwater tunnel , which is now underground after the water had gone , still exist and can be accessed . 
 In the middle of Segaran was an artificial island known as Kenongo Island ( Javanese Pulo Kenongo ) . It was named after the <unk> trees which once covered the island . On this island is a one @-@ storeyed structure called the Kenongo building ( Javanese Gedhong Kenongo ) , now in ruins . 
 On the south side of Kenongo Island is a row of small buildings called the <unk> . These buildings were originally used as air vents for the tunnel located below the lake . This underground tunnel , constructed in 1761 , was an alternative way to reach the Kenongo Island other than by a vessel . Also on the south side of the Kenongo Island is another artificial island called Cemethi Island ( Javanese Pulo Cemethi ) or <unk> Island ( Javanese Pulo <unk> ) . It is a one @-@ storeyed structure for the Sultan to meditate , or some said , a hiding place for the royal family during an attack . Another name for this island is <unk> <unk> , because on the south side of this island is a well that hangs above the ground . This place could only be reached via the underwater tunnel . The building of Cemethi Island is now also in ruin . A legend says that there is a secret tunnel that connects the palace with the south sea ( Indian Ocean ) where Nyai Roro Kidul or the Queen of the South has her palace . The supernatural Queen becomes the spiritual wife of Yogyakarta Sultan for many generations . 
 On the west side of Kenongo Island is another one @-@ storeyed circular structure that forms another artificial island in the past called <unk> Well ( <unk> <unk> ) . These one @-@ storeyed building can only be entered via the underwater tunnel . The building was used as a mosque . A niche in the wall of this building was used as a mihrab . The central area of this building is an elevated platform where four staircases meet , and then from the platform , one staircase reach the first floor . On the ground level of this platform is a small pool that was used for Muslim ritual ablution .

 The second area is located on the south of the former artificial lake of Segaran . Even though this area was not the focal point of Taman Sari , it is the best preserved area in the complex and is currently the most popular tourist attraction . The area is accessed via two gates on the east and the west side , each of these gates leads to the center of the complex , first to an inner octagonal @-@ shaped courtyard on the east and the west , and then each of these courtyards leads to a central bathing complex in the center .

 There are two gates that lead to the bathing complex , the western one called Gedhong Gapura Hageng and the eastern one called Gedhong Gapura Panggung . Both gates are decorated with ornaments of stylized birds and flowering <unk> . 
 The west entrance , the Gedhong Gapura Hageng was formerly used as the main entrance to the bathing complex . The east facade of the gate is still visible today , but the west facade is blocked by settlements . The construction of this gate was finished in 1691 Javanese Year ( about 1765 AD ) . The east entrance , the Gedhong Gapura Panggung is still functioning as a gate and is now the main entrance for tourists . The east entrance is a building with four staircases , two on the west side and two on the eastside . Four <unk> once decorated this gate , now there are only two <unk> left . The building was finished in 1684 Javanese calendar ( about 1758 AD ) .

 Each of the gates leads to an octagonal @-@ shaped courtyard . The western gate leads to a western octagonal @-@ shaped enclosed courtyard . In the past , a building stood in the center of this courtyard , which was called the Lopak @-@ lopak building ( Javanese Gedhong Lopak @-@ lopak ) . 
 The eastern gate leads to an octagonal @-@ shaped enclosed courtyard as well . It has a similar layout with the Gedhong Lopak @-@ lopak courtyard , but within it , there are four pavilions known as Gedhong Sekawan . These pavilions were used as the resting place for the royal family .

 Umbul <unk> , also known as Umbul <unk> or Umbul <unk> , is a bathing complex for the royal family . The bathing complex is an enclosed space surrounded by tall structures . It consists of three pools decorated with mushroom @-@ shaped springs and large flower pots . 
 There are two buildings in the bathing complex . The northernmost building was used as the resting place and changing room for the daughters and concubines of the sultan . On the south side of this building is a pool known as Umbul <unk> . The pool is divided into two by a central pathway ( known as <unk> <unk> ) that runs east @-@ west . The next building on the south is a building with a tower in its center . The right wing of the building was used as the sultan 's changing room , the east wing was used as his resting place . The central tower was used by the sultan to observe his daughters and concubines bathing in the pool . 
 On the south of this building is the third pool that was used only by the sultan and his concubines . During its era , only females and the sultan were allowed to enter this bathing complex .

 This area that is located south of the bathing complex , but no visible remains are left . According to a reconstruction of the site , this complex consisted of the complex of Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari and the pool complex of <unk> with several pavilions and a garden . Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari is the only part of the complex that is still protected . Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari was probably used as a meditation place for the sultan , or some said as the meeting place for the sultan and his concubines . In the middle of the building was also a sleeping room for the sultan with water flowing beneath it . There was also a kitchen , a looming room , a storage , two pools for the servants , and a garden . 
 = = = The fourth area = = = 
 The fourth complex is the part of the Taman Sari complex that is practically has no visible remains , except for a former hanging bridge and remains of a pier . The description of this area is retrieved from a reconstruction made from the 1812 English army sketch of the Yogyakarta kraton . This area extends about 600 meters to the east of the Segaran lake area . This area consisted of another artificial lake on the southeast of the Magangan complex toward the northeast of Siti <unk> Kidul complex . In the middle of this artificial lake is another artificial island called <unk> Island ( Javanese Pulo <unk> ) . A building , known as Gading building ( Javanese Gedhong Gading ) stood in the middle of the island . 
 This artificial lake is connected to the east side of the Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west . The canal was about 20 meter wide and there are two bottlenecks that are thought to be the place where a hanging bridge once stood . One of the bridge is now located in the street that connects the kraton complex of Magangan with the <unk> Kidul . The layout of the bridge can still be recognized , although the bridge itself has gone . On the west side of the hanging bridge is a pier that was used by the sultan as his starting point for his journey to the Taman Sari pool on his royal vessel . 
 The canal is bounded on the south and north with a garden , now located on the west side of the kraton complex of <unk> Kidul and Siti <unk> Kidul . Today , all of these canals , bridges , lakes , and gardens have been filled with local settlements ; the garden becomes the Kampung <unk> , the lake becomes the kampung Segaran .

Also located in this area is the <unk> Traditional Market ( Pasar <unk> ) , which hosted the biggest bird market in Yogyakarta for a long time ( until the bird market was relocated to <unk> on <unk> . Bantul in 2010 ) , and the <unk> mosque , a unique mosque built in the early 20th century with a single pillar that is different from the usual Javanese traditional architecture . 
 = Vanilla production in French Polynesia = 
 Vanilla production contributes to the local economy of French Polynesia . Although it was a major export crop after its introduction by the French in 1848 , vanilla is no longer a significant export product . 
 Vanilla was first introduced to French Polynesia by French colonizers as an export crop . Later , it became an important cash crop in the development of the island 's economy . In the early 20th century , production was much greater than it is today , with 150 @-@ 200 tons produced annually and plantations employing a sizable percentage of the population . Over the years , its production has been influenced by several factors and has declined from a high of 200 tons to a 2013 yield of 60 tons . The largest concentration of the vanilla variety Vanilla <unk> ( Tahitian vanilla ) is situated in the Society Islands . The island of Taha 'a , known as the " Vanilla Island " because of its pervasive aroma of vanilla , produces about 80 % of all French Polynesia 's vanilla . 
 = = Background = = 
 Vanilla <unk> ( Tahitian vanilla ) , which is a cross @-@ strain of Vanilla <unk> ( Mexican vanilla and Bourbon vanilla ) and Vanilla odorata ( <unk> Vanilla ) , is produced in French Polynesia , especially in Tahiti , and also Hawaii . Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla <unk> , which is not a direct competitor . Mexican vanilla is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract , due to higher <unk> levels . Tahitian vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin @-@ like scent . Other Tahitian vanilla products include vanilla green tea , vanilla oil , vanilla powder , vanilla rum , and vinegar @-@ based vanilla .

 Vanilla , originally a crop endemic to South America , was introduced in French Polynesia in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand @-@ Alphonse Hamelin , a French commander in the Pacific . The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of the plant to the Tahitian Governor 's garden in Papeete . A new variety of vanilla was subsequently developed in the area and came to be popularly known as Tahitian vanilla . This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as Vanilla <unk> grown in other parts of the world , particularly in respect to taste and scent . It has resulted in greater demand for the Tahitian variety . 
 The introduction occurred only one year after France made French Polynesia its protectorate , and over the next 40 years it became a major export to the United States , France , and Britain . Initially the vanilla plantations were owned by French mainland transplants ; later , the local Tahitians learned the processes and became major producers of the crop , with native families involved in its growth from " seed to pod . " However , in the 20th century , the Chinese , who came initially as labor for the plantations , became the primary actors in processing the crop for , marketing to , and making the crop available to the international market , though still some farms are owned by people of French and native origins .

 Vanilla is grown on small patches of land both as a single crop as well as an inter crop . As it needs lot of water for growth , it is largely grown on the rainier windward side of the island . Initially , vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height , at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground . It starts to flower when about three years old ; the flowering period is from July to August . 
 Production , initially for export , reached a high of 200 tons in 1939 . But it decreased to about 125 tons ( metric ) due to the onset of World War II in 1945 . Exports gradually increased after the war to 300 tons by 1949 but then started to decline with about four tons of export in 1985 as it became ineffective to produce vanilla due to as international competition , the costs of transportation of processed vanilla , exchange rates , state protectionism , plant pathology , varying global economics , and availability of cheaper varieties all affected the economics of vanilla production in the area . 
 The Centre d ’ Experimentation du Pacifique ( CEP ) was established with the goal of reviving the economy . It was launched in 1962 to overcome the drawbacks faced by the economy at large , with vanilla production being the economy 's cornerstone at the time . In an effort to spark innovation and new growing techniques , emphasis was shifted to " shade house cultivation " , with less @-@ intensive labour required ( due to the controlled indoor climate ) , and reduction in chemicals necessary for outdoor farming . Controlled growth resulted in an export record or 12 tons in 2010 . In the present day , the production is largely locally utilized in view of Tahitian vanilla becoming a " status symbol of cultural identity and pride in Polynesia . " Promotional actions instituted by the government to act upon this pride and boost vanilla production are many ; even a dessert served by an airline in the on @-@ board meal is infused with Tahitian vanilla . 
 As of 2013 , vanilla production ( FAO records for 2013 ) in French Polynesia ( specifically Tahiti ) accounted to only about 0 @.@ 07 % of the total world production ; it was 60 tons from an area of 7 hectares ( 17 acres ) with an yield of 13 <unk> per ha , comparative to the 3 @,@ 500 tons yielded by plantations in Madagascar , and 3 @,@ 400 tons yielded in Indonesia . 
 Some plantations are open to tourists ; Maison de la Vanille for instance , near <unk> , permits visitors to view the vanilla preparation and drying processes . The island of <unk> offers a tour , conducted by a private outfit , that takes visitors to one of the older and more voluminous plantations , situated on <unk> Bay .

 " E.B.E. " ( short for extraterrestrial biological entity ) is the seventeenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on February 18 , 1994 . It was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by William Graham . The episode introduced the recurring characters of The Lone Gunmen , played by Bruce Harwood , Dean Haglund and Tom Braidwood ; and saw Jerry Hardin reprise his role as Deep Throat . The episode helped explore the series ' overarching mythology . " E.B.E. " earned a Nielsen household rating of 6 @.@ 2 , being watched by 5 @.@ 8 million households in its initial broadcast ; and received positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . When Mulder and Scully investigate the possible smuggling of a crashed UFO and its inhabitant across America , they find themselves being spied on and face doubts over the motives of a secretive informant . 
 Inspired by the movie All the President 's Men , " E.B.E. " was the first mythology @-@ centred episode written for the show by writers Glen Morgan and James Wong . The episode also introduced the characters of The Lone Gunmen — conspiracy theorists John Fitzgerald Byers ( Bruce Harwood ) , Richard Langly ( Dean Haglund ) and Melvin Frohike ( Tom Braidwood ) .

 In the skies over Iraq 's border with Turkey , an Iraqi fighter pilot shoots down a UFO . Later , in Lexington , Tennessee , a truck driver named Ranheim shoots something in the dark as another UFO flies overhead . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) investigate the sighting the next day , but Ranheim is quickly let go by the uncooperative local authorities . In a seemingly inconsequential event , a woman briefly borrows Scully 's pen before they leave Tennessee . 
 Back in Washington , D.C. , Mulder introduces Scully to the Lone Gunmen , a trio of eccentric conspiracy theorists with whom he collaborates . After returning to FBI headquarters , Scully discovers a surveillance device within her pen . Mulder meets with Deep Throat , who provides him with documentation of an intercepted Iraqi transmission regarding the downed UFO . Scully continues to investigate the Tennessee incident , learning that two thousand pounds of extra weight had been added to Ranheim 's truck . She also learns Ranheim 's true identity as Frank Druce . 
 Mulder intends to track Druce 's truck , which is on its way to Colorado . However , before he leaves , Deep Throat approaches Mulder at his apartment , offering the photo of a purported UFO at Fort Benning , Georgia . Mulder initially believes that Druce 's truck is a decoy meant to distract him from the UFO , but discovers that Deep Throat 's photo is a fake . When Mulder confronts Deep Throat , he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine . He also divulges that the truck is being used to transport an extraterrestrial biological entity , or E.B.E. , that was recovered from the Iraqi crash site . Mulder and Scully escape their pursuers and head towards Las Vegas , the last known location of the truck . 
 Mulder and Scully catch up with the truck , and while pursuing it encounter strange weather . The truck stalls , but when they head inside it they find both Druce and the E.B.E. have vanished . When they investigate the truck and the area , Mulder concludes that the encounter was a constructed hoax , intended to convince the duo to cease further pursuit . With help from MUFON and NICAP , Mulder tracks Druce and the E.B.E. to a power plant in Mattawa , Washington . With assistance from the Lone Gunmen , the agents are able to enter the plant with fake identification . Their unfamiliarity soon gives them away , but Mulder flees from the guards through a restricted area and is about to approach the room where the creature is held when armed guards stop him . 
 Deep Throat appears and calls off the guards , telling Mulder the E.B.E. is dead . He reveals an agreement made between multiple countries after Roswell that any living E.B.E. found would be killed , and that he is one of three men to have executed an E.B.E. Mulder looks through the window into the creature 's holding cell , but it is empty . Afterwards , Deep Throat lets Mulder and Scully go free .

 This episode was the first mythology @-@ centred episode written for the show by writers Glen Morgan and James Wong . Morgan claims that the tone of the episode was inspired by the movie All the President 's Men . Some of the scenes were inspired by photographs sent to Morgan and Wong by location scouts of a BC Hydro power station , which was used as a shooting location in the episode . The empty " lab " area that had held the episode 's eponymous entity in the final scene was , in fact , a research facility used for testing electric current events . 
 The episode also introduced the characters of The Lone Gunmen — conspiracy theorists John Fitzgerald Byers ( Bruce Harwood ) , Richard Langly ( Dean Haglund ) and Melvin Frohike ( Tom Braidwood ) . The characters , who were used to help Mulder appear more credible , were originally meant to only appear in this episode , but due to their popularity on the internet , they returned in the second season episode " Blood " and became recurring characters . The inspiration for the Lone Gunmen came from a group of men that writers Glen Morgan and Marilyn Osborn met at a UFO convention in June 1993 . The trio would eventually feature in the spin @-@ off series The Lone Gunmen . Tom Braidwood , who plays Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike , was the first assistant director for the series , and became Frohike after passing by the office where the producers were casting the roles of the Gunmen . Braidwood 's name had been used in several episodes , including this one , as an in @-@ joke due to his assistant director role .

A total of 5 @.@ 8 million households watched this episode during its original airing . 
 Writer James Wong was disappointed with the episode , feeling that he " didn 't do a great job on the script . We wanted to do a show that 's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory , but at the end I felt like we didn 't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things . I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance . " Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode was one of the most popular first season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable . He also praised Jerry Hardin 's performance in the episode , finding that he lent the show the " believability " that it needed . 
 In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , the episode was rated an A , being called " dense , dazzling , and dark " , with the introduction of The Lone Gunmen being praised . Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club , described it as " occasionally clunky but generally fun " , finding the revelations of Deep Throat 's motivation to be a highlight . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , felt that the episode was a good example of the series refusing " to show its hand too early " , saying that it would even have worked well as a season finale . The plot for " E.B.E. " was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin . 
 = Bottle pool = 
 Bottle pool , also known as bottle @-@ billiards and bottle pocket billiards , is a hybrid billiards game combining aspects of both carom billiards and pocket billiards . Played on a standard pool table , the game uses just two object balls , a cue ball , and a 6 ¾ inch ( 171 mm ) tall , narrow @-@ necked bottle called a shake bottle or tally bottle , traditionally made from leather , that is placed on the table and used as a target for caroms . Those unfamiliar with the game sometimes mistakenly use its name as a synonym for the very different game of kelly pool . Bottle pool has been described as combining " elements of billiards , straight pool and chess under a set of rules that lavishly rewards strategic shot making and punishes mistakes with <unk> point reversals . " 
 Although bottle pool 's origins remain obscure , tournament records and newspaper articles confirm that the game has been played since at least the late 19th century . A mention appears in an 1894 New York Times newspaper article announcing a 64 player tournament to be played at a certain Hanover Clubhouse in Brooklyn , New York . The game was more well known in the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 20th century , during which references to it appear in numerous books and publications including Sinclair Lewis 's Main Street . It is also known to have been played by some notable individuals , such as world @-@ renowned quantum chemist and biochemist Linus Pauling . 
 Over time bottle pool developed an elitist image , its active play more commonly the province of gentlemen 's clubs and select groups than patrons of billiard parlors . For instance , bottle pool is known to have had a dedicated following with faculty at the University of Michigan from 1911 until approximately 1999 , and is the billiard game of choice at exclusive New York City enclaves such as the Racquet and Tennis Club and the Union Club . 
 Despite being one of a short group of non @-@ championship games still detailed in the Official Rules and Records Book of the Billiard Congress of America , as of 2006 , bottle pool was known only to be the billiard sport of general choice at a few New York City social clubs such as the two mentioned previously . A veteran member of both those clubs opined in 2006 that there were then fewer than 1 @,@ 000 dedicated bottle pool players nationwide . 
 = = General rules ( Billiard Congress of America ) = = 
 = = = Set up = = = 
 At the start of bottle pool , the shake bottle is placed inverted ( neck down ) on the center spot at the geographic center of the bed of a pool table . The two object balls used are the 1 ball and the 2 ball . Viewed from the racker 's vantage point , the 1 ball is frozen to the diamond on the foot rail immediately adjacent to the right corner pocket , and the 2 ball to the diamond on the foot rail immediately adjacent to the left corner pocket . 
 The player breaking starts with cue ball in hand from the kitchen ( behind the head string ) and must contact either of the two object balls in order to complete a legal break . The object of the game is to score exactly 31 points before any opponents , with a draconian penalty for overshooting that benchmark . 
 = = = Scoring = = = 
 Points are scored in bottle pool in the following ways : 
 <unk> the 1 ball scores 1 point ; 
 <unk> the 2 ball scores 2 points ; 
 Caroming the cue ball off both object balls scores 1 point ; 
 Caroming the cue ball off one or both object balls and then into the bottle knocking it onto its side scores 5 points ; 
 Caroming the cue ball off one or both object balls and then into the bottle knocking onto its base results in an automatic win . 
 All of the above scoring possibilities can be combined , meaning the maximum number of points available on a single stroke is nine , accomplished by caroming into and pocketing both object balls combined with knocking over the bottle with the cue ball . The winning shot in the game ( other than one which rights the shake bottle ) must bring a player 's score to exactly 31 . If a player overshoots that benchmark , known as a " burst " in the game 's terminology , the amount of points 31 is overshot by becomes the player 's new score . This means , for example , that if a player has 30 points and then scores 5 points ( instead of the requisite 1 point ) by caroming the cue ball off an object ball and into the bottle knocking it on its side , the player 's score resets to four points . 
 When a player reaches exactly 31 points , he must announce this feat to all participants before the next player shoots a shot in order to be victorious . If this is not done , the player may not again invoke his winning score until his turn comes up again in rotation . If another player in the interim successfully scores exactly 31 , and properly announces it , that player wins the game . 
 = = = Illegal shots and fouls = = = 
 Any legally made scoring shot entitles a player to continue shooting . The penalty for a foul in the game is a loss of turn , any point scoring acts made on the same stroke are not counted , and 1 point is deducted from the player 's total score . The incoming player after a foul accepts the table in position except if the cue ball is jumped off the table or a scratch occurs , in which case the incoming player has ball @-@ in @-@ hand from the kitchen . Three consecutive fouls in bottle pool results in a loss of game . 
 In addition to standard fouls defined in the General Rules for Pocket Billiards , such as scratches , push shots , double hits and others , the following are specifically defined fouls peculiar to bottle pool : the cue ball fails to touch an object ball ; the cue ball touches the bottle before contacting an object ball ; the bottle is knocked over by an object ball ; and an object ball is pocketed on the same stroke as an illegal shot . Illegal shots which are not fouls unless a ball is pocketed on the same stroke ( thus resulting in a loss of turn , no score , but not a loss of points ) , include : causing an object ball to touch the bottle at all before the cue ball touches it ( without knocking it over ) ; and causing the bottle to go into a pocket or off the table as a result of action by the cue ball , after it has caromed off an object ball . 
 = = = Bottle and ball spotting rules = = = 
 Whenever the shake bottle is knocked over it is immediately stood up open end down as close as possible to the position on the table at which it came to rest after being upset , as judged from the mouth of the bottle . When the shake bottle is knocked into a pocket , off the table , or where the open end of the bottle intrudes over a pocket opening such that it is impossible to replace it to its upset resting position , the shake bottle is replaced to the table 's center spot . If the center spot is occupied by any ball , then it is placed on the head spot . If both the center and head spots are occupied , then it is placed on the foot spot . If none of the listed spots are available then it remains off the table until such time as the center spot becomes unobstructed . 
 As in the games of snooker , English billiards , cowboy pool and others , pocketed balls are immediately <unk> to their starting position . Where the second object ball , the cue ball or the bottle makes spotting the ball there impossible , it is spotted to the center spot . If the center spot is occupied , the ball is spotted to the head spot . Where both object balls have been potted on a shot , they are spotted with the same dictates for just one ball , first spotting the 1 ball , followed by the 2 ball . Thus , if the starting positions for the two object balls are each occupied , respectively by the cue ball and shake bottle , the 1 ball would be placed on the center spot and the 2 ball on the head spot . 
 = = Variations = = 
 The game is sometimes played with the larger and heavier ( and unnumbered ) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls . Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room , where the faculty devoted most of their time to bottle pool . Not incidentally three @-@ cushion billiards , which uses these larger balls , was also a mainstay in that room and touring three @-@ cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997 . In this variation , a solid @-@ yellow ( or dotted ) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball , and the red ball , known traditionally as the <unk> , is used in place of the 2 ball . The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier , but makes pocketing balls ( and scratching ) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily @-@ sized pool pockets . 
 The rules promulgated by the Manhattan Athletic Club in the 1890s diverge in a number of ways from the modern rules published by the BCA ( though they do use the numbered 1 and 2 balls , rather than carom billiards balls ) . Those house rules provide that when a player bursts , his score is set to zero rather than to the number of points 31 is overshot ; pocketed object balls are replaced on the " red @-@ ball spot " ( the foot spot ) , or if occupied , frozen to the foot rail in the original position of the 1 ball and if occupied , of the 2 ball ; and no foul rules whatever are preferred . 
 One further variation places a 6 @-@ sided die ( although other sided die could also be used ) on top of the bottle . If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table , the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop . This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point @-@ scoring shots . 
 = War of the League of Cambrai = 
 The War of the League of Cambrai , sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and by several other names , was a major conflict in the Italian Wars . The main participants of the war , fought from 1508 to 1516 , were France , the Papal States and the Republic of Venice ; they were joined , at various times , by nearly every significant power in Western Europe , including Spain , the Holy Roman Empire , England , Scotland , the Duchy of Milan , Florence , the Duchy of Ferrara and Swiss mercenaries . 
 Pope Julius II , intending to curb Venetian influence in northern Italy , had created the League of Cambrai , an anti @-@ Venetian alliance of himself , Louis XII of France , Ferdinand II of Aragon and Maximilian I , the Holy Roman Emperor . Although the League was initially successful , friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510 ; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France . 
 The Veneto – Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League , which drove the French from Italy in 1512 ; disagreements about the division of the spoils , however , led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France . Under the leadership of Francis I , who had succeeded Louis to the throne , the French and Venetians would , through victory at Marignano in 1515 , regain the territory they had lost ; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels , which ended the war the next year , would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508 . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In the aftermath of the First Italian War , Pope Alexander VI had , with French assistance , moved to consolidate Papal control over central Italy by seizing the Romagna . Cesare Borgia , acting as <unk> of the Papal armies , had expelled the Bentivoglio family from Bologna , which they had ruled as a fief , and was well on his way towards establishing a permanent Borgia state in the region when Alexander died on 18 August 1503 . Although Cesare managed to seize the remnants of the Papal treasury for his own use , he was unable to secure Rome itself , as French and Spanish armies converged on the city in an attempt to influence the Papal conclave ; the election of Pius III ( who soon died , to be replaced by Julius II ) stripped Cesare of his titles and relegated him to commanding a company of men @-@ at @-@ arms . Sensing Cesare 's weakness , the dispossessed lords of the Romagna offered to submit to the Republic of Venice in exchange for aid in regaining their dominions ; the Venetian Senate accepted and had taken possession of Rimini , Faenza and a number of other cities by the end of 1503 . 
 Julius II , having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare , first in Rome and later in Madrid , quickly moved to re @-@ establish Papal control over the Romagna by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized . The Republic of Venice , although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Apulian coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute , refused to surrender the cities themselves . In response , Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice ; the death of Isabella I of Castile and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance , but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities . Julius , although unsatisfied with his gains , did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic ; for the next two years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia , which , located between Papal and Venetian territory , had in the meantime assumed a status of quasi @-@ independence . 
 In 1507 , Julius returned to the question of the cities in Venetian hands ; once again rebuffed by the Senate , he encouraged Emperor Maximilian I to attack the Republic . Maximilian , using his journey to Rome for the Imperial coronation as a pretext , entered Venetian territory with a large army in February 1508 and advanced on Vicenza , but was defeated by a Venetian army under Bartolomeo d 'Alviano . A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure ; Alviano not only routed the Imperial army but also seized Trieste and Fiume , forcing Maximilian to conclude a truce with Venice . 
 = = League of Cambrai = = 
 Julius , humiliated by the failure of the Imperial invasion , turned to Louis XII of France ( who , having been left in possession of Milan after the Second Italian War , was interested in further expansion into Italy ) with an offer of alliance . In mid @-@ March , the Republic provided a pretext for an attack on itself by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza ( an act in keeping with prevailing custom , though Julius considered it a personal provocation ) ; the Pope called for all Christian nations to join him in an expedition to subdue Venice . On 10 December 1508 , representatives of the Papacy , France , the Holy Roman Empire and Ferdinand I of Spain concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic . The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice 's territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories : Maximilian , in addition to regaining Istria , would receive Verona , Vicenza , Padua and the Friuli ; France would annex Brescia , Crema , Bergamo and Cremona to its Milanese possessions ; Ferdinand would seize Otranto ; and the remainder , including Rimini and Ravenna , would be added to the Papal States . 
 On 15 April 1509 , Louis left Milan at the head of a French army and moved rapidly into Venetian territory . To oppose him , Venice had hired a condottiere army under the command of the Orsini cousins – Bartolomeo d 'Alviano and Nicolo di Pitigliano – but had failed to account for their disagreement on how best to stop the French advance . Consequently , when Louis crossed the Adda River in early May and Alviano advanced to meet him , Pitigliano , believing it best to avoid a pitched battle , moved away to the south . On 14 May , Alviano confronted the French at the Battle of <unk> ; outnumbered , he sent requests for reinforcements to his cousin , who replied with orders to break off the battle and continued on his way . Alviano , disregarding the new orders , continued the engagement ; his army was eventually surrounded and destroyed . Pitigliano managed to avoid encountering Louis ; but his mercenary troops , hearing of Alviano 's defeat , had deserted in large numbers by the next morning , forcing him to retreat to Treviso with the remnants of the Venetian army . 
 The Venetian collapse was complete . Louis proceeded to occupy Venetian territory as far east as Brescia without encountering any significant resistance ; the Venetians lost all the territory that they had accumulated in northern Italy during the previous century . The major cities that had not been occupied by the French — Padua , Verona and Vicenza — were left undefended by Pitigliano 's withdrawal , and quickly surrendered to Maximilian when Imperial emissaries arrived in the Veneto . Julius , having in the meantime issued an interdict against Venice that excommunicated every citizen of the Republic , invaded the Romagna and seized Ravenna with the assistance of Alfonso d 'Este , Duke of Ferrara . D 'Este , having joined the League and been appointed <unk> on 19 April , seized the Polesine for himself . 
 The newly arrived Imperial governors , however , quickly proved to be unpopular . In mid @-@ July , the citizens of Padua , aided by detachments of Venetian cavalry under the command of the <unk> Andrea Gritti , revolted . The landsknechts garrisoning the city were too few in number to mount effective resistance , and Padua was restored to Venetian control on 17 July 1509 . The success of the revolt finally pushed Maximilian into action . In early August , a massive Imperial army , accompanied by bodies of French and Spanish troops , set out from Trento into the Veneto . Because of a lack of horses , as well as general disorganization , Maximilian 's forces would not reach Padua until September , giving Pitigliano the time to concentrate such troops as were still available to him in the city . The Siege of Padua began on 15 September 1509 ; although French and Imperial artillery successfully breached Padua 's walls , the defenders managed to hold the city until Maximilian , growing impatient , lifted the siege on 30 September and withdrew to Tyrol with the main part of his army . 
 In mid @-@ November , Pitigliano returned to the offensive ; Venetian troops easily defeated the remaining Imperial forces , capturing Vicenza , Este , <unk> and Belluno . Although a subsequent attack on Verona failed , Pitigliano destroyed a Papal army under Francesco II of Gonzaga in the process . The Battle of <unk> , a river attack on Ferrara by the Venetian galley fleet under Angelo <unk> failed , however , when the Venetian ships anchored in the Po River were sunk by Ferrarese artillery . Francesco Guicciardini credited the decisive victory to Alfonso himself . A new French advance soon forced Pitigliano to withdraw to Padua once again . 
 Faced with a shortage of both funds and men , the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement . The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh : the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory , as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice , the <unk> cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius , and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them . The Senate argued over the terms for two months , but finally accepted them on February 24 , 1510 . Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution , however , the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid , and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity . 
 This apparent reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French from again invading the Veneto in March . Pitigliano 's death in January had left Andrea Gritti in command of the Venetian forces ; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis , the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May . Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco @-@ Imperial army , but Louis , more concerned by the death of his advisor , the Cardinal d 'Amboise , abandoned his plans for a siege . 
 = = Veneto @-@ Papal alliance = = 
 Julius , meanwhile , had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy ; more significantly , alienated from Alfonso d 'Este by friction over a licence for a salt monopoly in the Papal states and Alfonso 's continued forays against Venetian forces to secure his recently reacquired Polesine , he had formulated plans to seize the Duchy of Ferrara , a French ally , and to add its territory to the Papal States . His own forces being inadequate for the venture , the Pope hired an army of Swiss mercenaries , ordering them to attack the French in Milan ; he also invited Venice to ally with him against Louis . The Republic , facing a renewed French onslaught , readily accepted the offer . 
 By July 1510 , the new Veneto @-@ Papal alliance was on the offensive . An initial attack on French @-@ occupied Genoa failed , but Venetian troops under Lucio <unk> finally drove the French from Vicenza in early August ; and a joint force commanded by Francesco Maria della Rovere , the Duke of Urbino , captured Modena on 17 August . Julius now excommunicated Alfonso d 'Este , thus justifying an attack on the Duchy itself ; in anticipation of his coming victory , the Pope traveled to Bologna , so as to be nearby when Ferrara was taken . 
 The French army , however , had been left unopposed by the Swiss ( who , having arrived in Lombardy , had been bribed into leaving by Louis ) and was free to march south into the heart of Italy . In early October , Charles II d 'Amboise advanced on Bologna , splitting the Papal forces ; by 18 October , he was only a few miles from the city . Julius now realized that the Bolognese were openly hostile to the Papacy and would not offer any resistance to the French ; left with only a detachment of Venetian cavalry , he resorted to excommunicating d 'Amboise , who had in the meantime been convinced by the English ambassador to avoid attacking the person of the Pope and had thus withdrawn to Ferrara . 
 In December , a newly assembled Papal army conquered Concordia and , in December , besieged the fortress of Mirandola ; d 'Amboise , marching to relieve the latter , fell ill and died , briefly leaving the French in disarray . Mirandola fell in January 1511 , the pope having taken personal command of the assault ; but d 'Amboise had been replaced by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio , who took back Concordia and Castelfranco , while the Papal army retreated to <unk> . Alfonso d 'Este , meanwhile , confronted and destroyed the Venetian forces on the Po River , leaving Bologna isolated once more . Julius , afraid of being trapped by the French , departed the city for Ravenna . Cardinal Francesco <unk> , whom he left behind to command the defense of the city , was no better liked by the Bolognese than Julius himself had been ; and when , on 23 May 1511 , a French army commanded by Trivulzio arrived at the gates , they quickly surrendered . Julius blamed this defeat on the Duke of Urbino , who , finding this quite unfair , proceeded to murder <unk> in full view of the Papal guard . 
 = = Holy League = = 
 By June 1511 , most of the Romagna was in French hands ; the Papal army , disorganized and underpaid , was in no condition to prevent Trivulzio from advancing on Ravenna . In response to this debacle , Julius proclaimed a Holy League against France . The new alliance rapidly grew to include not only Spain and the Holy Roman Empire ( which abandoned any pretense of adhering to the League of Cambrai in hopes of seizing Navarre from Queen Catherine and Lombardy from Louis ) , but also Henry VIII of England who , having decided to use the occasion as an excuse to expand his holdings in northern France , concluded the Treaty of Westminster — a pledge of mutual aid against the French — with Ferdinand on 17 November 1511 . 
 In February 1512 , Louis appointed his nephew , Gaston de Foix , to command the French forces in Italy . Foix proved more energetic than Amboise had been ; having checked the advance of Ramón de Cardona 's Spanish troops on Bologna , he returned to Lombardy to sack Brescia , which had rebelled against the French and garrisoned itself with Venetian troops . Aware that much of the French army would be diverted to deal with the impending English invasion , Foix and Alfonso d 'Este besieged Ravenna , the last Papal stronghold in the Romagna , in hopes of forcing the Holy League into a decisive engagement . Cardona marched to relieve the city in early April , and was decisively beaten in the resulting Battle of Ravenna , fought on Easter Sunday ; the death of Foix during the fighting , however , left the French under the command of Jacques de la Palice , who , unwilling to continue the campaign without direct orders from Louis , contented himself with thoroughly sacking Ravenna . 
 By May 1512 , the French position had deteriorated considerably . Julius had hired another army of Swiss mercenaries ; they descended on Milan , bringing with them Maximilian Sforza , who was determined to regain control of the Duchy for his family . The French garrisons abandoned the Romagna ( where the Duke of Urbino quickly captured Bologna and Parma ) and retreated to Lombardy , attempting to intercept the invasion . By August , the Swiss had combined with the Venetian army and forced Trivulzio out of Milan , allowing Sforza to be proclaimed Duke with their support ; La Palice was then forced to withdraw across the Alps . 
 In late August , the members of the League met at Mantua to discuss the situation in Italy ( particularly the partition of territory acquired from the French ) . They quickly came to an agreement regarding Florence , which had angered Julius by allowing Louis to convene the Council of Pisa in its territory . At the Pope 's request , Ramon de Cardona marched into Tuscany , smashed Florentine resistance , overthrew the Republic and installed Giuliano de ' Medici as ruler of the city . 
 On the subject of territory , however , fundamental disagreements quickly arose . Julius and the Venetians insisted that Maximilian Sforza be permitted to keep the Duchy of Milan ; Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand conspired instead to have one of their cousins installed as duke . The Pope demanded the immediate annexation of Ferrara to the Papal States ; Ferdinand objected to this arrangement , desiring the existence of an independent Ferrara to counter growing Papal power . Most problematic , however , was the attitude of Maximilian towards Venice . The Emperor refused to surrender any Imperial territory , which in his eyes included most of the Veneto , to the Republic ; to this end , he signed an agreement with the Pope to exclude Venice entirely from the final partition . When the Republic objected , Julius threatened to reform the League of Cambrai against her . In response , Venice turned to Louis ; on 23 March 1513 , a treaty pledging to divide all of northern Italy between France and the Republic was signed at Blois .

 In late May 1513 , a French army commanded by Louis de la Trémoille crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan ; at the same time , Bartolomeo d 'Alviano and the Venetian army marched west from Padua . The unpopularity of Maximilian Sforza , who was seen by the Milanese as a puppet of his Swiss mercenaries , enabled the French to move through Lombardy with little resistance ; Trémoille , having seized Milan , besieged the remaining Swiss in Novara . On 6 June , the French were attacked by a Swiss relief army at the Battle of Novara , and were routed despite having superior numbers . Detachments of the Swiss army pursued the fleeing French over the Alps and had reached Dijon before being bribed into withdrawing . 
 The rout at Novara inaugurated a period of continuous defeats for the French alliance . English troops under Henry VIII besieged Thérouanne , defeated La Palice at the Battle of the Spurs , and captured Tournai . In Navarre , resistance to Ferdinand 's invasion collapsed ; he rapidly consolidated his hold over the entire region and moved to support another English offensive in the Guyenne . James IV of Scotland invaded England at the behest of Louis ; but he failed to draw Henry 's attention from France , and his death — and the Scots ' catastrophic defeat — at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513 , ended Scotland 's brief involvement in the war . 
 Meanwhile , Alviano , unexpectedly left without French support , retreated into the Veneto , pursued closely by the Spanish army under Cardona . While the Spanish were unable to capture Padua in the face of determined Venetian resistance , they penetrated deep into Venetian territory and by late September were in sight of Venice itself . Cardona attempted a bombardment of the city that proved largely ineffective ; then , having no boats with which to cross the lagoon , turned back for Lombardy . Alviano , having been reinforced by hundreds of volunteers from the Venetian nobility , pursued Cardona and confronted him outside Vicenza on 7 October . In the resulting Battle of La Motta , the Venetian army was decisively defeated , with many prominent noblemen cut down outside the city walls as they attempted to flee . 
 However , the Holy League failed to follow up on these victories . Cardona and Alviano continued to skirmish in the Friuli for the rest of 1513 and through 1514 , fighting several inconclusive battles , but Cardona was unable to make any real progress . Henry VIII , having failed to gain any significant territory , concluded a separate peace with France . Finally , the death of Julius left the League without a leader ; Julius ' successor to the Papacy , Leo X , was rather less concerned with military matters . 
 The death of Louis XII on 1 January 1515 brought Francis I to the throne . Having assumed the title of Duke of Milan at his coronation , Francis immediately moved to reclaim his holdings in Italy . By July , Francis had assembled an army in the Dauphiné . A combined Swiss and Papal force moved north from Milan to block the Alpine passes against him , but Francis , following the advice of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio , avoided the main passes and marched instead through the valley of the Stura . The French vanguard surprised the Milanese cavalry at Villafranca , capturing Prospero Colonna ; meanwhile , Francis and the main body of the French confronted the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano on 13 September . The Swiss advance initially made headway ; however , Francis 's superiority in cavalry and artillery , together with the timely arrival of Alviano ( who had successfully avoided Cardona 's army at Verona ) on the morning of 14 September , led to a strategically decisive victory for Francis and the Venetians . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the defeat at Marignano , the League no longer possessed the ability or the will to continue the war . Francis advanced on Milan , capturing the city on 4 October and removing Sforza from the throne . In December , he met with Leo at Bologna ; the pope , who had in the meantime been deserted by the remainder of his Swiss mercenaries , surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Francis and Modena to the Duke of Ferrara . In return , Leo received guarantees of French noninterference in his proposed attack on the Duchy of Urbino . Finally , the Treaty of Noyon , signed by Francis and Charles V in August 1516 , recognized French claims to Milan and Spanish claims to Naples , removing Spain from the war . 
 Maximilian held out , making another attempt to invade Lombardy ; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back , and by December 1516 , he had entered into negotiations with Francis . The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan , but also confirmed Venetian claims to the remainder of the Imperial possessions in Lombardy ( except for Cremona ) , effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508 . The peace , however , would last only four years ; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis , who had desired the position for himself , to begin the Italian War of 1521 – 26 . The Italian Wars , thus reignited , would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption . 
 = Old Stone House ( Washington , D.C. ) = 
 The Old Stone House is the oldest unchanged building in Washington , D.C. , United States . The house is also Washington 's last Pre @-@ Revolutionary Colonial building on its original foundation . Built in 1765 , Old Stone House is located at <unk> M Street , Northwest in the Georgetown neighborhood . Unlike many Colonial homes in the area , sentimental local folklore preserved the Old Stone House from being demolished . 
 The Old Stone House was constructed in three phases during the 18th century and is an example of vernacular architecture . During its history , the house was started as a one @-@ story building and gradually became a used car dealership later . After a renovation by the National Park Service ( NPS ) in the 1950s , the Old Stone House was turned into a house museum . The Old Stone House stands among the neighborhood 's stores and restaurants as an example of local history for tourists , shoppers , and students . The building is part of the Rock Creek Parkway urban natural area and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 . The Old Stone House is also a contributing property to the Georgetown Historic District , a National Historic Landmark . Today , the home is 85 % original to its 18th @-@ century construction .

 In 1764 , Christopher and Rachel Layman bought Lot Three , a piece of land in Georgetown 's commercial district . They paid £ 1 10s. and financed the construction of a simple one @-@ room house the following year . The lot faced Bridge Street , now known as M Street , NW . The <unk> ' only possessions were Christopher 's tools , a stove , Bibles , and some furniture . When Christopher died unexpectedly in 1765 , Rachel remarried two years later and sold the house to another widow , Cassandra Chew . 
 Chew was a member of the upper @-@ middle class and owned several properties in and around Georgetown . Because of her wealth , Chew was able to finance the construction of a rear kitchen in 1767 and a second floor between 1767 and 1775 . The third floor originated in a property line dispute during the 1790s : the original west wall had been constructed six feet beyond the property line and had to be dismantled . Chew used the opportunity to add the upper floor and was completed by 1790 . 
 Following the American Revolutionary War , government officials had carved out land from Virginia and Maryland to use as the new nation 's capital . Pierre Charles L 'Enfant , appointed by President George Washington to design the city layout , arrived in Georgetown on March 9 , 1791 and began his work . Washington and L 'Enfant held their meetings at Suter 's Tavern , a former building owned by John Suter near 31st and K Streets , NW . At the time , John Suter Jr. was renting a room at the Old Stone House and for many years , locals believed that Washington and L 'Enfant had actually met at the Old Stone House instead . This folklore is the reason the house was never demolished , and for many years a sign hung over the front door which said , " George Washington 's Headquarters . " After some research done by the National Park Service , they found out that the folklore was not true . By that time they had they found that out , they already owned the House and the property . 
 When Chew died in 1807 , she bequeathed Old Stone House to one of her daughters , Mary Smith Brumley , who became the first of many owners who operated businesses out of the house . Like her mother , Brumley was a businesswoman and ran a successful merchant 's shop inside the home . The house , then known as the Layman home , remained in the family until 1875 . 
 Over the years , the house had been used as a shop for hats , tailors , locksmiths , clockmakers , house roofers and house painters . The Old Stone House was still privately owned in 1953 – serving as used car dealership that used the back yard as a parking lot – when the Federal government purchased the property for $ 90 @,@ 000 ( $ 796 @,@ 000 today ) and turned it over to the National Park Service . Between 1953 and 1960 the NPS removed the majority of 19th and 20th century intrusions to the home and the parking lot was turned into an English garden . 
 After the renovation , the Old Stone House was opened to the public in 1960 . It became a part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway , but stewardship of the house was later transferred to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park . In the late 1980s stewardship of the Old Stone House was once again transferred , this time to the Rock Creek Park . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Old Stone House is an example of vernacular architecture . The exterior of the house , constructed of blue granite and fieldstone , was quarried from a location two miles away near the Potomac River . The walls range from two to three feet thick . The oak used in the house was harvested from forests that were once predominant in Georgetown . 
 On the first floor , the original roof and front door were constructed of solid oak and cut with a pit saw . Marks left by the large saw can be seen on the first floor . The kitchen walls and fireplace contain irregular stones that were stacked and affixed with a mortar consisting of sand , lime , ash , and water . The kitchen 's hearth is large enough to heat the entire house . 
 The second floor architecture differs significantly from the first floor since Chew was able to afford higher quality building material . A second doorway and staircase were constructed for family members and guests . The original entrance was then reserved for workmen and deliveries . There are three rooms located on this floor , the dining room , a bedroom , and the parlor . The hallway between the dining room and two front rooms features a high ceiling for ventilation in Georgetown 's hot summers . The second floor walls were plastered and painted . Chair rails were added to prevent damage to the walls . In the dining room , a dumbwaiter concealed by recessed pine cabinetry delivered food from the kitchen below . A clock believed to have been made by John Suter Jr . , located in the dining room , is the only original piece of furniture left in the house . The clock dates back to the early 19th century . The bedroom features a carved wooden mantle that is believed to be of French origin . 
 The third floor , constructed of brick , was a private space . It was completed around 1790 . It is much plainer than the second floor , with unfinished paneling and unpainted walls . There are three rooms on this floor , believed to be children 's bedrooms and a storage area . A closet is attached to the third @-@ floor bedroom , an unusual feature in 18th @-@ century colonial houses . <unk> were considered to be rooms by the British monarchy and therefore were subject to a " closet tax " . Due to it being built after the Revolutionary War , the Old Stone House 's closet was not subject to the tax . 
 The Colonial Revival garden , located behind the house and bordered by a white picket fence , is 399 feet ( 122 m ) deep and 76 feet ( 23 m ) wide . Roses , perennials , and bulbs are located throughout the garden .

 Visitors are greeted by Park Rangers who tell the history of one of the oldest structures in Washington DC . The kitchen , parlor and bedrooms , furnished as they would have been in the late 18th century , are open for viewing . A gift shop operated by Eastern National is located inside the front room of the house . The garden is used for simple wedding ceremonies and as an area for locals and tourists to rest while shopping or to enjoy a lunch break . The building is open to the public seven days a week , from 11 : 00am to 6 : 00pm ( eastern time ) and the garden is open every day from dawn until dusk .
