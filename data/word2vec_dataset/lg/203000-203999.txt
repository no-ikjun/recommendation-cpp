 The Yugoslav Navy decided to order a single large destroyer rather than a repeat pair of smaller Beograd @-@ class destroyers in the late 1930s because the Navy 's planners didn 't believe that the smaller ships could adequately support the raiding strategy that it intended to conduct in the event of a war with Italy . The staff decided on a much larger equivalent of the flotilla leader Dubrovnik that could out @-@ gun any Italian destroyer and cover the escape and return to base of the raiding forces . The French company Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire was selected and based the new ship on their design for the 2 @,@ 610 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 2 @,@ 570 @-@ long @-@ ton ) Le Fantasque @-@ class destroyer . She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders at their shipyard in Split and was named after her place of construction . 
 The Yugoslavs chose to buy the components from a variety of different nations . The pairs of geared steam turbines and Yarrow boilers were intended to give the ship a speed of 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) from 55 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 41 @,@ 000 kW ) and were purchased from Great Britain . The fire @-@ control system , with two directors , and radios were French while the armament was supplied by the Škoda Works of Czechoslovakia and Bofors of Sweden . 
 The ship 's designed armament was five 56 @-@ caliber Škoda 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) guns in single mounts , five single 43 @-@ caliber Bofors 40 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns , four single 15 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) ZB <unk> anti @-@ aircraft machineguns , and two triple mounts for 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The Yugoslav emphasis on anti @-@ aircraft defense meant that Split could only have a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible , which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room . This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The ship was laid down in July 1939 with her launching scheduled for the following year and completion by the end of 1942 . By the time the Italians joined the Germans in invading France in May 1940 , only 600 metric tons ( 590 long tons ) of the 1 @,@ 100 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 083 long tons ) of material necessary to launch her had been delivered . The British government embargoed her machinery in 1940 , despite French protests , when it discovered surreptitious contacts between the Yugoslav and Soviet governments . The Swedish government embargoed the Bofors guns due to the war and the German control of the Škoda Works meant that the Yugoslavs had to suspend construction of Split . 
 When the city of Split was captured by the Italians on 14 April 1941 , the hull remained undamaged and the Regia Marina decided to complete the ship after a delay of several months . They renamed the ship Spalato , the Italian name for the city of Split . New machinery was ordered from Franco Tosi , and five 45 @-@ caliber 13 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) guns , as many Breda 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) AA guns as could be fitted , and four twin mounts for Breda 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) light AA guns replaced the Czech and Swedish weapons . One torpedo tube mount was removed and the Italians planned to add depth charge throwers and racks , the capacity for 40 mines and an EC @-@ 3 ter <unk> radar . 
 The ship was lightly damaged by saboteurs in December which disrupted progress and the Regia Marina decided to suspend construction in April 1942 as she remained nearly two years from completion . By late 1942 , the Regia Marina 's shortage of destroyers had reached a point that every possible hull was needed and construction restarted at a high priority . This allowed her to be launched on 18 July 1943 , but shortly afterwards a change in the Italian leadership caused any further work to be suspended in August and the resources used in her construction to be diverted to finish a large group of small wooden minesweepers . During the fighting between the Germans and the Italians after the Italian surrender on 9 September , Spalato was scuttled in Split harbor on 24 September . The Germans occupied Split three days later , refloated the ship several weeks later and stripped her of any valuable material . As part of their scorched @-@ earth strategy as they abandoned Split , the Germans scuttled Spalato and wrecked the shipyard before the Yugoslav Partisans occupied the port on 27 October 1944 .

 The new communist government of Yugoslavia lacked any sizable warships after the end of the war and decided to resurrect Split as the centerpiece of their new navy . The Yugoslav Navy ordered replacement parts for the machinery from Franco Tosi and contacted Škoda in 1948 to get delivery of her original main armament , which had sat out the war in a warehouse . The damage to the shipyard meant that the navy had to tow the ship to the Kvarner Shipyard ( formerly the Cantieri navali del <unk> ) in Rijeka . Shortly afterwards , however , the Tito @-@ Stalin split deprived the ship of her main armament and the technical assistance needed to complete her . 
 The Yugoslavs re @-@ launched Split in March 1950 to free up the slipway , but no other work was done . In 1953 there was a rapprochement with the NATO powers and the American and the British agreed to help complete the ship . The Tosi machinery ordered earlier had been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship 's armament , fire @-@ control equipment and electronics . 
 = = Description = = 
 Split had an overall length of 120 meters ( 393 ft 8 in ) , a beam of 12 meters ( 39 ft 4 in ) , and a draft of 3 @.@ 7 meters ( 12 ft 2 in ) . The ships displaced 2 @,@ 400 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 362 long tons ) at standard and 3 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 953 long tons ) at deep load . She was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by two Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . The turbines were designed to produce 50 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 37 @,@ 000 kW ) , which would propel the ship at 31 @.@ 5 knots ( 58 @.@ 3 km / h ; 36 @.@ 2 mph ) . Split carried 590 metric tons ( 581 long tons ) of fuel oil , although her range is unknown , and had a crew of 240 . 
 The main armament of Split consisted of four 38 @-@ caliber 5 @-@ inch ( 13 cm ) guns in single mounts , one superfiring pair each fore and aft of the superstructure . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of four twin @-@ gun and four single mounts for license @-@ built Bofors 40 mm guns . The ship carried one quintuple set of 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes and retained her capacity for 40 mines . For anti @-@ submarine combat , Split was equipped with two Hedgehog spigot mortars , six depth @-@ charge throwers and two depth @-@ charge racks . The ship was fitted with a Mk 37 fire @-@ control director for the 5 @-@ inch guns and a Mk 51 director for the AA guns . The Mk 37 director was equipped with a Mk 12 fire @-@ control radar and a Mk 22 height @-@ finding radar . SC and SG @-@ 1 search radars completed her radar suite .

 Construction proceeded at a snail 's pace and the ship was finally commissioned on 4 July 1958 , although she did not enter service until 1959 . She immediately became the navy 's flagship and retained that position for most of her career . Split proved to be top @-@ heavy , short ranged , slow and very cramped for in service . She accidentally collided with the ex @-@ Italian torpedo boat Biokovo in 1963 , damaging the latter so badly that she was immediately struck from the Navy List . In the late 1970s , an explosion of one of Split 's main boiler steam lines killed all of the men standing watch in the boiler room . The boiler was not repaired and she was limited to a speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . The ship became a stationary training ship afterwards . She was decommissioned in 1980 , struck on 2 February 1984 and scrapped in 1986 . 
 = U.S. Route 12 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) is a US Highway that runs from Aberdeen , Washington , to Detroit , Michigan . In Michigan it runs for 210 miles ( 338 km ) between New Buffalo and Detroit as a state trunkline highway and Pure Michigan Byway . On its western end , the highway is mostly a two @-@ lane road that runs through the southern tier of counties roughly parallel to the Indiana state line . It forms part of the Niles Bypass , a four @-@ lane expressway south of Niles in the southwestern part of the state , and it runs concurrently with the Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) freeway around the south side of Ypsilanti in the southeastern . In between Coldwater and the Ann Arbor area , the highway angles northeasterly and passes the Michigan International Speedway . East of Ypsilanti , US 12 follows a divided highway routing on Michigan Avenue into Detroit , where it terminates at an intersection with Cass Avenue . 
 When US 12 was designated in Michigan on November 11 , 1926 , along with the other original US Highways , it ran along a more northerly course . It originally replaced sections of the original M @-@ 11 and M @-@ 17 along Michigan Avenue in the state , the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail , a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area . It entered from Indiana as it does now , but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor – St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo , Battle Creek and Jackson . In the Ann Arbor area , it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown . In the 1940s and 1950s , sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways . Starting in 1959 , these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I @-@ 94 , and in January 1962 , US 12 was shifted to replace US Highway 112 ( US 112 ) . That highway , when it was designated in 1926 replaced the original M @-@ 23 along the Chicago Road . Later , US 112 replaced the first M @-@ 151 when the former was extended to New Buffalo in the mid @-@ 1930s . Since 1962 , the highway has remained relatively unchanged aside from minor truncations in the city of Detroit . US 112 previously had two business loops , both of which were renumbered Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) in 1962 . In 2010 , the Niles business loop was decommissioned , but the one in Ypsilanti remains . One section of the former US 112 was renumbered US 112S for a few years in the 1930s .

 Between the state line near Michiana and the interchange with I @-@ 94 near New Buffalo , US 12 forms a portion of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) . The full length of the highway in the state is also a Pure Michigan Historic Byway . Outside of the various cities , most of US 12 is a rural , two @-@ lane state highway . One section runs concurrently with I @-@ 94 south of Ypsilanti . From there eastward , the US 12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area . The entire length of the highway east of Coldwater is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the US 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 US 12 enters the state of Michigan southwest of New Buffalo near the town of Michiana . The highway runs a bit inland and parallel to the Lake Michigan shore on Red Arrow Highway past the community of Grand Beach before turning eastward away from the lake on the north side of New Buffalo . US 12 intersects I @-@ 94 less than a mile east of this turn and continues due east along Pulaski Highway through rural farmland . The highway is the main east – west street as it crosses through Three Oaks in southern Berrien County . East of <unk> , the highway dips southward around Dayton Lake before passing south of Buchanan . The highway continues eastward , intersecting US 31 ( St. Joseph Valley Parkway ) near Niles . East of that freeway , US 12 expands into an expressway as the Niles Bypass . This bypass intersects M @-@ 139 , crosses the St. Joseph River and intersects M @-@ 51 on the south side of Niles . US 12 turns northeasterly along the bypass east of downtown and then departs to the southeast at an interchange with Main Street and M @-@ 60 just across the county line with Cass County . 
 Continuing through southern Cass County , US 12 runs roughly parallel to the state line . It turns northeasterly to run into Edwardsburg , where it intersects M @-@ 62 . The highway turns southeasterly and runs to the south of Eagle Lake before entering the community of Adamsville . The highway continues on this southeasterly course until it intersects the former M @-@ 205 and M @-@ 217 ( Michiana Parkway ) near Union and turns to the northeast . US 12 intersects the southern end of M @-@ 40 before crossing into St. Joseph County at the eastern crossing of the St. Joseph River . 
 On the eastern side of the river , US 12 enters Mottville and intersects M @-@ 103 . The highway continues as Chicago Road through farmland and intersects US 131 near White Pigeon . It runs along the south side of Klinger Lake and continues to a junction with M @-@ 66 in Sturgis ; the two highways run concurrently for about eight blocks through town . East of Sturgis , US 12 turns northeasterly into Branch County . Still named Chicago Road , it passes through Bronson and Batavia . Northeast of Batavia , US 12 intersects the eastern end of M @-@ 86 near Branch County Memorial Airport . The airport is on the western edge of Coldwater , and after crossing the Coldwater River between Cemetery and South lakes , the highway runs through residential neighborhoods and into downtown . East of Division Street , Business Loop I @-@ 69 ( BL I @-@ 69 ) follows US 12 through downtown and out to an interchange with I @-@ 69 on the east side of Coldwater . The highway continues past retail businesses and parallel to the Sauk River . US 12 passes through the town of Quincy before crossing into Hillsdale County .

 East of Hillsdale County line , US 12 runs easterly into Allen , where it intersects M @-@ 49 . The highway continues northeastward through farmland to Jonesville , where it runs concurrently with M @-@ 99 through downtown and across a different St. Joseph River . The trunkline continues northeasterly through northern Hillsdale County , crossing the South Branch of the Kalamazoo River in Moscow . US 12 runs along the south side of Lake LeAnn in Somerset Center in the northeastern corner of the county . East of Somerset , the highway crosses into northern Lenawee County . 
 Immediately east of the Lenawee County line , US 12 intersects US 127 in the Irish Hills region . South of Brooklyn in Cambridge Junction , it passes the Michigan International Speedway and crosses the River Raisin next to a junction with M @-@ 50 . East of the racetrack , the highway meanders through an area dotted by several smaller lakes until it intersects M @-@ 124 at Walter J. Hayes State Park . Continuing as Michigan Avenue , US 12 angles northeasterly from the park until it hits the Lenawee – Washtenaw county line . The highway follows the line for several miles before reentering Lenawee County . It continues through an intersection with M @-@ 52 and into Clinton before turning northeasterly and fully crossing into Washtenaw County . 
 In Washtenaw County , US 12 passes through Benton in a rural southern section of the county . At Saline , the highway enters the suburban edge of the Ann Arbor – Ypsilanti metro area . US 12 follows Michigan Avenue northeasterly through Saline and across an interchange with US 23 before intersecting I @-@ 94 in Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships . US 12 leaves Michigan Avenue to follow I @-@ 94 at that freeway 's exit 181 ; Michigan Avenue continues into downtown Ypsilanti as a city street . I @-@ 94 / US 12 skirts around the south side of the city and intersects the western end of Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) at Huron Street south of downtown . The freeway continues around the south side of the city and rounds the north end of Ford Lake . It is bounded by residential neighborhoods , and it crosses the Huron River on the eastern side of Ypsilanti . Near the Willow Run industrial complex and airport , US 12 separates from I @-@ 94 and turns northeasterly along an expressway on the north side of the airport . There are three interchanges , including one for the eastern end of M @-@ 17 before US 12 crosses into Wayne County and intersects the eastern end of Bus . US 12 . 
 = = = East into Detroit = = = 
 Once US 12 intersects the eastern end of its business loop , it returns to Michigan Avenue for the remainder of its routing in the state . The roadway is a boulevard in this area , a street divided by a central median . It runs through Canton Township and parallel to the Lower River Rouge . US 12 intersects I @-@ 275 on the eastern side of the township before crossing into Wayne . The highway is bounded by a mix of industrial and commercial properties in suburban Metro Detroit . In downtown Wayne , the two sides of Michigan Avenue split apart , surrounding the central business district of the city and separated by two to three city blocks . East of this split , Michigan Avenue crosses a section of Westland before entering Inkster . 
 In Dearborn , US 12 intersects US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) at an interchange on the western side of the city , and M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) on the eastern side near the River Rouge crossing and Greenfield Village . On the Dearborn – Detroit city border , US 12 pass through a complex interchange with I @-@ 94 ( Edsel Ford Freeway ) and M @-@ 153 ( Ford Road / Wyoming Avenue ) . Michigan Avenue continues northeasterly parallel to I @-@ 94 for a short distance before it turns due east . Once it makes the direction change , it forms the 0 Mile of Detroit 's Mile Road System . US 12 continues through residential areas on Detroit 's West Side , passing through the interchange that connects I @-@ 75 with I @-@ 96 's eastern terminus near the Ambassador Bridge . The highway runs through Corktown , Detroit and beside the site of the former Tiger Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull . East of the former stadium , US 12 crosses M @-@ 10 ( Lodge Freeway ) near the MGM Grand Detroit casino . East of M @-@ 10 , Michigan Avenue enters Downtown Detroit . At the corner of Michigan and Cass , US 12 ends while Michigan Avenue continues several blocks further to terminate at Campus Martius Park at Woodward Avenue .

 The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails . Two of these trails are relevant to US 12 . The St. Joseph Trail ran between the Benton Harbor – St. Joseph area and Detroit by way of what is now Kalamazoo , Battle Creek , Jackson and Ann Arbor . The second , the Sauk Trail , ran further south through what is now Niles , and Coldwater to the Ann Arbor area . 
 The Town of Detroit created 120 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 37 m ) rights @-@ of @-@ way for the principal streets of the city in 1805 , including Michigan Avenue . This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit , with a mandate from the territorial governor to improve on the previous plan . The wide width of the avenues was an emulation of the street plan for Washington , DC , and intended to make Detroit the " Paris of the West " . 
 The southern of these two Indian trails later became the Chicago Road . Father Gabriel Richard , the first priest to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives , petitioned Congress to fund a highway between Detroit and Chicago in March 1824 . A year later , the road was established in federal law , and it was surveyed by the end of 1825 . Construction started in 1829 , and the road was finished across Michigan in 1833 . The northern Indian trail was established as an unnamed territorial road in 1829 . 
 The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , two of the system 's divisions corresponded to the original US 12 . Division 5 had a segment from New Buffalo to Benton Harbor and Watervliet while Division 6 connected Watervliet through Kalamazoo , Jackson and Ann Arbor to Detroit . No divisions corresponded to the future US 112 . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , and the future US 12 corridor was assigned two numbers . From the state line north through Benton Harbor to Watervliet , it carried the original M @-@ 11 designation , and from Watervliet eastward it was the original M @-@ 17 . From Dearborn into Detroit , the original M @-@ 10 ran concurrently along M @-@ 17 . 
 The future US 112 along the Chicago Road had two different numbers in the original highway plan . Between New Buffalo and Niles , the highway was numbered M @-@ 60 , and from Union to Ypsilanti , it was M @-@ 23 . East of Ypsilanti , the corridor was part of M @-@ 17 and M @-@ 10 . In November 1926 , these two highway corridors were renumbered as part of the United States Numbered Highway System . 
 = = = Original US Highway : 1926 – 62 = = = 
 On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) , and US 12 was the designation assigned to a highway running northeasterly from Indiana near Lake Michigan to Benton Harbor – St. Joseph and turning east to Detroit through Kalamazoo , Jackson and Ann Arbor . This designation replaced sections of the original M @-@ 11 and M @-@ 17 through the southern part of the state . By the end of the next year , the MSHD rerouted the highway between Sawyer and Stevensville , and Downtown Stevensville was bypassed in 1928 . Additional work to fully bypass Stevensville was finished in 1929 . 
 In 1931 , the original routing of US 12 along a section of Michigan Avenue between Kalamazoo and Comstock was renumbered US 12A , and a new routing along King Highway south of the original opened . By 1936 , another US 12A debuted in Battle Creek , and by the end of the year , the main highway was rerouted between Augusta and Battle Creek . Another new segment of highway opened that same year east of Jackson , bypassing Leoni and Grass Lake to the north . This new bypass was extended eastward from Sylvan to bypass Chelsea to the south the following year , filling a gap in " super highway " segments between Jackson and Ann Arbor . The last routing change in the 1930s was the opening of Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo , after which US 12 was rerouted to follow it west of downtown . 
 In 1940 , a southern bypass of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue , and the former routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became a Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) . In late 1951 or early 1952 , a northerly bypass of Jackson opened , and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus . US 12 . By the next year , the western half of the Jackson bypass opened , including a bypass of Parma . In 1954 , a new bypass of Kalamazoo and Galesburg opened ; US 12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while M @-@ 96 replaced part of the old route and the US 12A in the area . 
 In 1956 , several changes were made to US 12 's routing . A southern bypass of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti was converted to a freeway . US 12 was rerouted to follow the bypass , supplanting the M @-@ 17 and Bypass US 112 designations used previously on the bypass . US 112 was also rerouted , and it runs concurrently with US 12 along the bypass . The former route of US 12 along Plymouth Road from Ann Arbor east to Detroit was renumbered M @-@ 14 , and the M @-@ 112 designation on the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways was replaced by US 12 . At the same time as these changes were made , the Jackson bypass was upgraded to a full freeway . By the middle of 1958 , the Kalamazoo bypass was converted to a full freeway . 
 Previously delayed so that the designations could be finalized , the MSHD started numbering its Interstate Highways in 1959 , adding I @-@ 94 to the sections of US 12 freeway . Later that year , additional segments of I @-@ 94 / US 12 were opened , starting with a 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) section from Hartford to Coloma , then another from Paw Paw to Kalamazoo which connected with a segment between Galesburg to Battle Creek . The overall 45 @-@ mile ( 72 km ) section from Paw Paw to Battle Creek was dedicated on December 7 , 1959 . By the middle of 1960 , US 12 followed the I @-@ 94 freeway from Coloma to Watervliet and from Paw Paw to the east side of Jackson . It was also routed along the freeway from the west side of Ann Arbor into Detroit , where it followed the southern end of the Lodge Freeway . By the middle of 1961 , the Watervliet – Paw Paw and Jackson – Ann Arbor freeway gaps were completed , and the freeway was extended westward to Stevensville ; By the end of the year , I @-@ 94 / US 12 extended all the way to New Buffalo . In January 1962 , the state made the biggest rerouting change of all to US 12 : the designation was removed from the I @-@ 94 freeway from New Buffalo to Detroit and shifted to completely replace US 112 . 
 = = = US Highway 112 : 1926 – 62 = = = 
 In 1925 , US 112 was originally proposed to run from Oshkosh to Fremont , Wisconsin , on what later became U.S. Route 110 . When it was initially designated in November 1926 , US 112 made a sharp turn to the southwest to connect to US 20 in Elkhart , Indiana . In 1931 , a new trunkline highway was designated between M @-@ 60 at Niles and US 112 at Union . This highway was numbered M @-@ 151 . In 1933 , the section of US 112 from Union to Elkhart was renumbered US 112S . M @-@ 151 and US 112S each lasted until 1935 when US 112 was extended to replace M @-@ 151 . US 112 was also extended to run concurrently with M @-@ 60 to New Buffalo , and US 112S was renumbered M @-@ 205 . 
 In 1936 , the section of US 112 along Michigan Avenue east of Ypsilanti was expanded into a " super highway " . In 1955 , a realignment of US 127 in southern Jackson County removed a short concurrency with US 112 from Somerset Center in Hillsdale County and the current intersection in northwestern Lenawee County . 
 On December 1 , 1956 , the highway department opened the first 6 @.@ 6 miles ( 10 @.@ 6 km ) of a new four @-@ lane divided highway around the south side of Niles , with the final 1 @.@ 6 miles ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) of the bypass opening early the next year . Consequently , they converted the former route through town into a business loop numbered Bus . US 112 back to US 112 / M @-@ 60 . At the end of the decade , another highway concurrency was removed when US 131 was realigned to run directly south of US 112 to the state line instead of running concurrently along US 112 between Mottville and White Pigeon . In January 1962 , the US 112 designation was decommissioned when US 12 was shifted off the I @-@ 94 freeway to replace US 112 . 
 = = = After 1962 = = = 
 After US 12 replaced US 112 , the Bus . US 12 routes were renumbered as Business Loop I @-@ 94 , and the two Bus . US <unk> were renumbered to Bus . US 12 . In 1966 , the state truncated M @-@ 60 and removed it as a concurrent designation along US 12 between New Buffalo and Niles . 
 In October 2000 , the state proposed changing jurisdiction of several highways near Campus Martius Park in Detroit , and US 12 was shortened by four city blocks the next year to end along Michigan Avenue at Griswold Street . This would be shortened again in 2005 to Michigan Avenue and Cass Avenue .

 The roads that have carried US 12 in Michigan have been given a number of memorial highway names . In 1922 , after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis , that street name took on a pejorative connotation . The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name . It was already labeled the Michigan – Detroit – Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time , so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country . Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue , so that is what the paper suggested for a new name . Albion was the first community to change the name of its street after the paper followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924 , Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929 . 
 In 1952 , US 12 was dedicated to the 32nd Infantry Division . The division used a red arrow as its insignia to symbolize how they pierced the German Hindenburg Line during World War I and Japanese defenses during World War II . The soldiers who composed the division were drawn from the Michigan and Wisconsin National Guards . After other proposals failed , US 12 was named the Red Arrow Highway on August 30 , 1952 , and dedicated on March 22 , 1953 . Jurisdiction of most of the roadways that composed US 12 at that time has passed to local governments as I @-@ 94 was built , but the highway still bears that name in Berrien County . 
 Count Casimir Pulaski was a Polish @-@ born noble and soldier who fought on the side of the Americans during the Revolutionary War . He was appointed a brigadier general on the recommendations of George Washington and later became known as the " Father of the American Cavalry " . He was severely wounded during the Siege of Savannah and died while being treated on the brigantine Wasp . The route of US 112 was designated the Pulaski Memorial Highway by Public Act 11 of 1953 and formally dedicated in Detroit on October 4 , 1953 . The segment of what is now US 12 in Berrien County still bears this name . 
 US 12 has also been designated as the Iron Brigade Memorial Highway , a designation which it also has in Indiana , Illinois and Wisconsin . The name honors the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment , part of the Iron Brigade from the American Civil War . The regiment lost more troops than any other on the Union side during the war and provided the military escort for Abraham Lincoln 's funeral in Springfield , Illinois . The unit traveled along the Chicago Road to join the war effort . The highway was dedicated in twin ceremonies in New Buffalo on October 9 , 1994 , and in Detroit on November 11 , 1995 , to the Iron Brigade . 
 In 1986 , the Michigan Department of Transportation consulted with its counterparts in Wisconsin ( WisDOT ) , Minnesota ( Mn / DOT ) and Ontario ( Ministry of Transportation of Ontario , MTO ) about the formation of a circle tour around Lake Superior . The Lake Michigan Circle Tour was signed on maps by 1988 . 
 In May 2001 , the section of US 12 through Saline was designated a Michigan Historic Heritage Route . The segment through Clinton was given the same status in October 2002 . On June 9 , 2004 , the full length of US 12 was dedicated as the US 12 Heritage Trail . In December 2014 , this became a Pure Michigan Byway when Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation renaming the Michigan Heritage Route System to the Pure Michigan Byway System .

The western terminus was at the corner of West Chicago Road and US 12 ( Pulaski Highway ) east of the US 12 / US 31 interchange . From there , the business loop followed Chicago Road northeasterly through residential areas on the west side of town . Bus . US 12 turned north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street , crossing the St. Joseph River . The loop intersected the southern end of M @-@ 139 at Front Street one block east of the river in downtown Niles . Four blocks further east , Bus . US 12 met M @-@ 51 . The two highways merged along Main Street and then turned south along 11th Street at an intersection that also marks the western terminus of Bus . M @-@ 60 ( Oak Street ) . Bus . US 12 / M @-@ 51 continued south along 11th Street to the corner of US 12 ( Pulaski Highway ) and M @-@ 51 ( South 11th Street ) where the business loop terminated . 
 The trunkline was first designated in 1956 as a business route of US 112 . At that time , US 112 and M @-@ 60 were transferred to a bypass south of Niles . When US 112 was decommissioned in January 1962 , Bus . US 112 was redesignated Bus . US 12 to match the new US 12 designation . 
 In 1986 , US 33 was truncated in Michigan to end at US 12 . Bus . US 12 was rerouted in Niles to replace US 33 through town ; Bus . US 31 was added a year later when the signage was updated in the area . In 1998 , US 33 was removed from Michigan completely . At this time , M @-@ 51 was extended over former US 33 and replaced part of the Bus . US 31 designation in Niles . 
 On March 5 , 2010 , the segment of Bus . US 12 between Bus . US 31 and M @-@ 51 was turned over to local control . In April 2010 the Bus . US 12 designation was retired when an extended M @-@ 139 replaced it from the local control section southwestward prior to maps and signage being changed .

 Sierra Leone competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London , from 27 July to 12 August 2012 . This marked the nation 's tenth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1968 Summer Olympics . The Sierra Leone delegation included two track and field athletes ; Ibrahim Turay , a sprinter and Ola Sesay , a long jumper . Sesay and Turay were selected as flag bearers for the opening and closing ceremonies respectively . Neither of the two athletes progressed beyond the first round .

 Sierra Leone participated in ten Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City , Mexico and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London , with the exception of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , and the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal , the latter because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa . The highest number of Sierra Leonean athletes participating in a summer games is fourteen in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , Russia and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , USA . As of 2015 , no Sierra Leonean athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics . Two athletes from Sierra Leone qualified for the London games ; Ibrahim Turay in the track and field 200 m and Ola Sesay in the long jump . They both qualified after meeting the " A " and " B " qualifying standards for their events respectively . Sesay and Turay were flag bearers for the opening and closing ceremonies respectively .

 = Battersea Bridge = 
 Battersea Bridge is a five @-@ span arch bridge with cast @-@ iron girders and granite piers crossing the River Thames in London , England . It is situated on a sharp bend in the river , and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north . The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site since at least the middle of the 16th century . 
 The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge commissioned by John , Earl Spencer , who had recently acquired the rights to operate the ferry . Although a stone bridge was planned , difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead . Designed by Henry Holland , it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771 , and to vehicle traffic in 1772 . The bridge was poorly designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping , and boats often collided with it . To reduce the dangers to shipping , two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders . 
 Although dangerous and unpopular , the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge on the Thames in London , and was the subject of paintings by many significant artists such as J. M. W. Turner , John Sell Cotman and James McNeill Whistler , including Whistler 's Nocturne : Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge , and his controversial Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket . 
 In 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership , and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge , designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co . The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London , it is one of London 's least busy Thames bridges . The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping , and it has been closed many times due to collisions . 
 = = Background = = 
 Chelsea ( Old English <unk> , chalk wharf ) , about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of Westminster on the north bank of the River Thames , has existed as a settlement since at least Anglo @-@ Saxon times . The Thames at this point bends through a sharp angle from a south @-@ north to an east @-@ west flow , and the slow @-@ moving and relatively easily fordable river here is popularly believed to be the site of Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain . Chelsea enjoyed good road and river connections to the seat of government at Westminster and the commercial centre of the City of London since at least the 14th century . It was a centre of the British porcelain industry , and a major producer of baked goods – at peak periods almost 250 @,@ 000 <unk> buns per day were sold . By the 18th century it had large numbers of very prosperous residents . 
 Battersea , listed as <unk> ( St Peter 's Water ) in the Domesday Book and first mentioned in records of 693 AD , on the south bank of the river opposite Chelsea , was by contrast low and marshy land , prone to flooding . Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender , and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries . 
 Although Chelsea and Battersea had been linked by ferry since at least 1550 , the nearest fixed links between the two were Putney Bridge , 2 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) upstream and opened in 1729 , and Westminster Bridge , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) downstream , opened in 1746 . In 1763 John , Earl Spencer , purchased the manor of Battersea , and consequently acquired ownership of the ferry service between Chelsea and Battersea . 
 The ferry was old and somewhat dangerous , and in 1766 Spencer formed the Battersea Bridge Company and sought and obtained Parliamentary consent to build " a fine stone bridge " across the Thames . The bridge was to be built between Cheyne Walk and Battersea , at the point where the river 's course turns sharply east towards Westminster , at a projected cost of £ 83 @,@ 000 ( about £ 10 @,@ 968 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . The Earl had anticipated that many local residents would invest in the project , but soon found that there was widespread scepticism about the scheme . Only 15 investors , including the Earl himself , were willing to invest , and a total of only £ 17 @,@ 662 ( about £ 2 @,@ 215 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) was raised , far less than was needed to finance the ambitious project . 
 = = Old Battersea Bridge = = 
 Spencer calculated that the money raised would be sufficient to finance a modest timber bridge , and a design was commissioned from rising architect Henry Holland . The bridge was built to Holland 's designs by John Phillips , whose uncle Thomas Phillips had built the 1729 bridge at Putney . The bridge was opened to pedestrians in November 1771 while still incomplete . In 1772 a chalk and gravel surface was added and the bridge was opened to vehicle traffic . Tolls were charged on a sliding scale , ranging from 1 ⁄ 2d for pedestrians to 1 shilling for vehicles drawn by four or more horses . The bridge was never formally named , and was referred to on maps of the period as both " Battersea Bridge " and " Chelsea Bridge " . 
 The bridge was not a commercial success . It was 734 feet ( 224 m ) long and only 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide , making it impractical for larger vehicles to use . Holland 's design consisted of nineteen separate narrow spans , the widest being only 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) wide , and boats found it difficult to navigate beneath the bridge ; there were a number of accidents including serious injuries and deaths . Repeatedly rammed by passing shipping , the bridge required frequent costly repairs , and dividends paid to investors were low . During a particularly cold winter in 1795 the bridge was badly damaged by ice , necessitating lengthy and expensive reconstruction , and no dividends at all were paid for the next three years . Concerns were expressed in Parliament about the reliability of the bridge , and the Battersea Bridge Company was obliged to provide a ferry service at the same rate as the bridge tolls , in the event of the bridge being closed for repairs . 
 In an effort to improve the bridge 's poor safety record for its customers , oil lamps were added to the deck in 1799 , making Battersea Bridge the first Thames bridge to be lit . Between 1821 and 1824 the flimsy wooden fences along the edges of the bridge , which were often breaking , were replaced by sturdy iron 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) railings , and in 1824 the oil lamps were themselves replaced by gas lighting . In 1873 , in an effort to improve navigation around the bridge and reduce accidents , two of the piers were removed , making the widest span a more easily navigated 77 feet ( 23 m ) , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders to compensate for the missing piers . 
 = = = Competition and disputes with Vauxhall Bridge = = = 
 In 1806 , a scheme was proposed by Ralph Dodd to open the south bank of the Thames opposite Westminster and London for development , by building a new major road from Hyde Park Corner to Kennington and Greenwich , crossing the river at Vauxhall , about halfway between Battersea Bridge and Westminster Bridge . The Battersea Bridge Company were concerned about the potential loss of custom , and petitioned Parliament against the scheme , stating that " [ Dodd ] is a well known adventurer and <unk> , and the projector of numerous undertakings upon a large scale most if not all of which have failed " , and the bill was abandoned . However , in 1809 a new bill was presented to Parliament for a bridge at Vauxhall , this time obliging the operators of the new bridge to compensate the Battersea Bridge Company for any losses , and the Company allowed it to pass and accepted compensation . The Act obliged the Vauxhall Bridge Company to reimburse the Battersea Bridge Company for any loss in revenue caused by the new bridge . 
 After many delays and setbacks , the new bridge at Vauxhall ( initially named Regent Bridge after George , Prince Regent , but shortly afterwards renamed Vauxhall Bridge ) opened on 4 June 1816 . However , the Vauxhall Bridge Company failed to pay the agreed compensation to the Battersea Bridge Company and were taken to court . After a legal dispute lasting five years , a judgement was made in favour of the Battersea Bridge Company , with the Vauxhall Bridge Company being obliged to pay £ 8 @,@ 234 ( about £ 633 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) compensation . 
 = = = Old Battersea Bridge in art = = = 
 Although the bridge was inconvenient for its users and <unk> constructed , as the last surviving wooden bridge on the Thames in the London area it was considered an important landmark , and many leading artists of the period were attracted to it . Camille Pissarro , J. M. W. Turner , John Sell Cotman and John Atkinson Grimshaw produced significant paintings of the bridge . Walter Greaves , whose family owned a boathouse adjacent to the bridge and whose father had been boatman to Turner , painted numerous scenes of the bridge . Local resident and mentor to Greaves James McNeill Whistler created many images of it , including the influential Hokusai @-@ inspired Nocturne : Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge ( painted c . 1872 – 5 ) , in which the dimensions of the bridge are intentionally distorted and Chelsea Old Church and the newly built Albert Bridge are visible through a stylised London fog . 
 Whistler 's Nocturne series achieved notoriety in 1877 , when influential critic John Ruskin visited an exhibition of the series at the Grosvenor Gallery . He wrote of the painting Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket , that Whistler was " asking two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public 's face " . Whistler sued for libel , the case reaching the courts in 1878 . The judge in the case caused laughter in the court when , referring to Nocturne : Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge , he asked Whistler " Which part of the picture is the bridge ? " ; the case ended with Whistler awarded token damages of one farthing . 
 In 1905 , Nocturne : Blue and Gold became the first significant acquisition by the newly formed National Art Collections Fund , and is now in Tate Britain . 
 = = = Takeover and public ownership = = = 
 A more modern and convenient competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858 , and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply . There were serious public concerns about the safety of the bridge by this time , after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors , who did not intervene because both parties had paid their fares . 
 The new Albert Bridge opened in 1873 , less than 500 yards ( 460 m ) from Battersea Bridge . Mindful of the impact the new bridge would have on older bridge 's financial viability , the 1864 Act of Parliament authorising the Albert Bridge compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge at the time of the new bridge 's opening and to compensate the owners of Battersea Bridge with £ 3 @,@ 000 ( about £ 266 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) per annum until the new bridge opened , and so Battersea Bridge was bought outright by the Albert Bridge Company in 1873 . By this time the bridge was in extremely poor condition , and there were many calls from local residents for it to be demolished . As an interim measure , the Albert Bridge 's architect Rowland Mason Ordish strengthened the foundations of the bridge with concrete while debate continued as to its future . 
 The Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed in 1877 , which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo Bridges and free them from tolls , and in 1879 the Board of Works bought Albert and Battersea bridges for a combined cost of £ 170 @,@ 000 ( about £ 15 @,@ 589 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) and the tolls were removed from both bridges . 
 Inspections by the Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works , Sir Joseph Bazalgette , following the purchase found that Battersea Bridge was in such poor condition that it was unable to be repaired safely . In 1883 it was restricted to pedestrian traffic only , and in 1885 it was demolished to make way for a new bridge designed by Bazalgette . 
 = = New Battersea Bridge = = 
 The contract to build the new bridge was awarded to John Mowlem & Co , and in June 1887 the Duke of Clarence laid a ceremonial foundation stone in the southern abutment and construction work began . Bazalgette 's design incorporated five arches with cast iron <unk> , on granite piers which in turn rest on concrete foundations . The roadway itself is 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide , and 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wide footpaths are cantilevered on either side of the bridge , giving the bridge a total width of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . The balustrade is a distinctive Moorish @-@ style lattice . Construction work was overseen by Bazalgette 's son Edward , and cost a total of £ 143 @,@ 000 ( about £ 14 @,@ 193 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . 
 On 21 July 1890 , the bridge was officially opened by future Prime Minister Lord Rosebery , then chairman of the newly formed London County Council . Unlike its predecessor , the new bridge was officially named Battersea Bridge . Although the road was narrow , trams operated on it from the outset . Initially these were horse @-@ drawn , but from 22 June 1911 the electric trams of London County Council Tramways were introduced . 
 = = = Collisions = = = 
 Although the five spans of the current bridge are far wider than the nineteen spans of the original bridge , Battersea Bridge 's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation . In 1948 , the MV Delta jammed under the bridge , and its master Hendrikus <unk> suffered broken arms and needed to be rescued from the smashed wheelhouse . On 23 March 1950 , the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier , causing serious structural damage , leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together . The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951 . Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950 , so when the bridge was re @-@ opened the tram tracks were lifted . Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005 , when the James Prior , a 200 @-@ ton barge , collided with the bridge , causing serious structural damage costing over £ 500 @,@ 000 to repair . The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out , causing severe traffic congestion ; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006 . Brian King , the master of the James Prior , was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008 , when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed and prosecutors decided not to re @-@ present the case .

 At only 40 feet ( 12 m ) wide , Bazalgette 's bridge is now London 's narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames , and in 2004 was the fifth least @-@ used Thames bridge in London . In 1983 the bridge was designated a Grade II listed structure , protecting its character from further alterations , and in 1992 English Heritage oversaw a project to renovate the bridge , which for some years had been painted blue and red . 
 Paint samples were analysed and photographs from the time of opening consulted , and the bridge was restored to its original appearance . The main body of the bridge was painted in dark green , with the spandrels decorated in gilding . The lamp standards , which had been removed during the Second World War , were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge . A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected at the north end of the bridge in 2005 .

 Shortly after its reopening following the collision with the James Prior , the bridge briefly attained national prominence on 20 January 2006 when a 19 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) long female bottlenose whale became stranded at Battersea Bridge . A rescue operation was mounted , and large crowds flocked to the bridge . The whale was successfully transferred to a barge , but died while being transported back to the sea to be released . A year after the whale 's death , its skeleton was put on public display in the offices of The Guardian newspaper . Today it resides at the Natural History Museum . 
 = Astley , Greater Manchester = 
 Astley is a settlement within the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester , England , variously described as a suburb or a village . Astley lies on flat land to the northwest of the city of Manchester , and is crossed by the Bridgewater Canal and the A580 " East Lancashire Road " . It forms a continuous urban area with neighbouring Tyldesley , and is equidistant from Wigan and Manchester city centre , both 8 @.@ 3 miles ( 13 @.@ 4 km ) away . The Astley Mosley Common ward of Wigan MBC , which covers both settlements , had a population of 11 @,@ 654 in the 2001 Census , falling to 11 @,@ 270 at the 2011 Census . 
 Historically a part of Lancashire , the name Astley is derived from Old English , indicating Anglo @-@ Saxon settlement . It means " east Leigh " or " east of Leigh " , a reference to Astley 's location relative to the town of Leigh ; or <unk> the " eastern wood or clearing " . Throughout the Middle Ages , Astley constituted a township within the parish of Leigh and hundred of West Derby . Astley first appears in written form as <unk> in 1210 , when its lord of the manor granted land to the religious order of Premonstratensian canons at Cockersand Abbey . 
 Medieval and Early Modern Astley is distinguished by the dignitaries who occupied Damhouse , the local manor house around which a settlement expanded . The newly extended Bridgewater Canal reached Astley in 1795 , and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830 . The Industrial Revolution introduced mechanised coal mining and the factory system to the region in and around Astley , triggering its expansion . The village 's only cotton mill was built in 1833 . 
 Mining subsidence coupled with structural and political changes to the mining industry began the decline in Astley 's industrial activities during the mid @-@ 20th century ; its cotton mill closed in 1955 , and the last coal was brought to the surface in 1970 . However , Astley has grown as part of a commuter belt , supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter @-@ city transport links . Astley Green Colliery Museum houses collections of Astley 's industrial heritage .

 Astley is of Old English derivation , and means " East Leigh " , a reference to its position in relation to Leigh . Leigh is derived from leah , meaning a " wood " , a " clearing " or a " meadow " . The earliest written record of Astley was in documents dated 1210 when it appeared as the Middle English <unk> . Other archaic spellings include <unk> ( 1292 ) and <unk> ( 14th and 15th centuries ) . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The earliest evidence of human activity in the area is the remains of a Roman road which served as the route between Roman camps at Coccium ( Wigan ) and Mamucium ( Manchester ) . The road ran to the north of Astley , past Keeper Delph and through Tyldesley . Evidence for the presence of Anglo @-@ Saxons in the sparsely populated , heavily wooded and isolated region is provided by place names incorporating the Old English suffix leah , such as in Leigh , Tyldesley , Shakerley and Astley . 
 = = = Manor = = = 
 Astley emerged during the Early Middle Ages as a township in the parish of Leigh . It was mentioned in documents in 1210 , when Hugh of Tyldesley , Lord of the Manors of Tyldesley and Astley , granted land to Cockersand Abbey . In 1212 , he was recorded as tenant of Astley Hall , the manor house for both Astley and Tyldesley , located just inside the Tyldesley township . After his death , his son Henry inherited the manors . He was succeeded by his son , another Henry , who , when he died in 1301 , divided the lands between three of his six sons . It is from this division that the manors of Astley and Tyldesley were separated . Tyldesleys lived at the Astley manor until April 1353 when Richard Radcliff bought it for 100 marks . The <unk> remained there until 1561 when William Radcliff died childless and the land passed to his half @-@ sister Anne , who married Gilbert Gerard . 
 In 1606 Adam Mort bought the manor house and land in Astley . He was a wealthy man who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh . The chapel was consecrated in 1631 , the year that he died . He built a grammar school that stood for over 200 years until 1833 , when it was demolished and rebuilt . Adam Mort 's grandson , also Adam , rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque over the front door . The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house . It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat . 
 Adam Mort 's descendants continued to support the chapel and school and remained at Damhouse until 1734 when it was bought by Thomas Sutton . After Sutton 's death in 1752 the house was inherited by Thomas Froggatt of Bakewell who contributed to rebuilding the chapel in 1760 . Froggatt 's descendants owned Damhouse until 1800 when it was leased to tenants , one of whom was George Ormerod , owner of the Banks Estate in Tyldesley who gave land for its churchyard and church school . In 1839 the house became the property of Captain Adam Durie of Craig Lascar by marriage to Sarah Froggatt . Damhouse was dilapidated when the <unk> moved in . Captain Durie gave land to build a school on Church Road . After his death in 1843 his widow , Sarah , married Colonel Malcolm Nugent Ross . The Ross 's Arms public house at Higher Green is named in his honour . The Durie 's daughter Katharine , who married first , Henry Davenport and second Sir Edward Robert <unk> , became lady of the manor after her mother 's death but the family was in financial difficulties and the house and estate sold in November 1889 . 
 The Leigh Hospital Board bought Damhouse in 1893 for use as a sanatorium dealing with cases of diphtheria , scarlet fever and , in 1947 , poliomyelitis . Two bombs fell close to the hospital during the Second World War . It became a general hospital in 1948 dealing with chronically ill and geriatric patients and closed in 1994 . 
 = = = Industrial Revolution = = = 
 Astley became more industrialised during the early 19th century , but not so much as neighbouring Leigh , Tyldesley and Boothstown . A factory was built by James and Robert Arrowsmith on Peel Lane at Astley Green , near the Bridgewater Canal in 1833 . Until then , agriculture and cottage spinning and weaving had been the main economic activities . <unk> , muslins and , after 1827 , silk were woven in the area . <unk> weaving declined after the cotton factory was built . Arrowsmith 's factory lasted until 1955 , when mining subsidence damaged its foundations and it was demolished , ending Astley 's link with the textile industry . 
 Astley on the Lancashire Coalfield and had several coal mines within its boundaries . On a map of 1768 , a lane leading to Nook and Gin Pit Collieries was called the Coal Road and later North Coal Pit Lane . Gin Pit 's name alludes a method of coal mining , raising coal using a horse gin . An early colliery at Cross Hillock was abandoned in 1886 because of flooding . Samuel Jackson developed the mines that became Astley and Tyldesley Collieries between Astley and Tyldesley . Peat works were opened close to Astley railway station by the Astley Peat Moss Litter Company Limited in 1888 . 
 On 7 May 1908 the Pilkington Colliery Company started sinking No 1 Shaft of Astley Green Colliery near the Bridgewater Canal . A colliery railway moved coal from the screens to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway but some coal was transported to power stations at Trafford Park and Stretford using the Bridgewater Canal . Pit head baths , a canteen and medical centre designed for the Miners ' Welfare Committee by architect C. Kemp , were built in 1935 – 36 at a cost of over £ 24 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @.@ 5 million as of 2016 ) . There was a mining accident at Astley Green on 7 June 1939 when five men including the manager died in an explosion of firedamp . Women , " pit brow <unk> " , worked on the screens sorting coal from rock until 1955 . The last coal was wound on 3 April 1970 . 
 The headgear at Astley Green Colliery Museum remains a landmark in the 21st century . It is made from wrought @-@ iron lattice girders with rivetted plates at all the joints , three wheels , two large and one small , are mounted at the top . Built by Head Wrightson of Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees in 1912 , it is nearly 30 metres ( 98 ft ) high . In the winding house is a twin tandem compound steam engine made by Yates and Thom of Blackburn who also supplied 16 Lancashire boilers .

 Historically , Astley formed part of the Hundred of West Derby , a judicial division of southwest Lancashire . It was one of six townships or vills that made up the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Leigh . The townships existed before the parish . Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 , the townships formed the Leigh Poor Law Union established on 26 January 1837 , comprising the whole of the ancient parish and part of Winwick . There were workhouses in Pennington , Culcheth , Tyldesley and Lowton , but Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh replaced them in the 1850s . In 1894 the civil parishes of Astley , Culcheth , Kenyon and Lowton became part of Leigh Rural District which lasted until it was dissolved in 1933 and Astley was incorporated into the Tyldesley Urban District . The urban district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 , and Astley became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan , a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . 
 In 2012 Astley and Mosley Common form an electoral ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan . The ward elects three councillors to the 75 @-@ member metropolitan borough council . As of 2012 , the Astley Mosley Common ward is represented by three Labour councillors . 
 After a review of parliamentary representation in Greater Manchester , the Boundary Commission recommended Astley should be part of the Leigh constituency at the United Kingdom general election , 2010 . At the 2010 General Election Andy Burnham retained the Leigh seat with 24 @,@ 295 votes and a majority of 15 @,@ 011 , representing 51 @.@ 3 % of the vote . Burnham was re @-@ elected MP for the Leigh constituency in 2015 with 24 @,@ 312 votes which was 53 @.@ 9 % of the total vote cast .

It forms a continuous urban area with Tyldesley to the north , and , according to the Office for National Statistics , is a part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area , the United Kingdom 's third largest conurbation . 
 Astley is 8 @.@ 3 miles ( 13 @.@ 4 km ) west @-@ northwest of Manchester city centre , and 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) north of the Bridgewater Canal , which straddles the village 's southern hinterland from east @-@ to @-@ west . Astley is crossed east @-@ to @-@ west by the A572 and A580 roads . The hamlet of Astley Green lines a straight road leading southwards through Chat Moss , to the former Astley railway station , which is 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of the village . Astley spans an area of 2 @,@ 685 acres ( 10 @.@ 87 km2 ) , of which 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 km2 ) is peat bog . Astley and Bedford Mosses is one of the last surviving fragments of Chat Moss , most of which has been drained for agriculture or lost through peat removal . It occupies a 33 @-@ hectare ( 82 @-@ acre ) site between Astley and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . It has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) since 1989 . Astley Moss is crossed by the Astley Brook and Moss Brook , tributaries to the Glaze Brook and the River Mersey . 
 The underlying geology consists of the Permo @-@ Triassic New Red Sandstone in the south , and the Middle Coal Measures of the Manchester Coalfield to the north . The upper soils are a mixture of clay and sand , with a subsoil of clay . The Astley area encompasses smaller , suburban and semi @-@ outlying areas , including Blackmoor , Astley Green , Gin Pit and Cross Hillock . The isolated hamlet of terraced houses at Gin Pit was built by the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company . Peace Street , Lord Street and Maden Street were named after directors of the company .

 Before deindustrialisation in the late 20th century , Astley 's economy was linked with the textile industry and coal mines which developed during the Industrial Revolution . Now the main concentration of employment is at the Chaddock Lane Industrial Estate on either side of the A572 road between Astley and the East Lancashire Road . 
 Since the early 1980s , much of the area between Tyldesley and Astley has been built on for housing . Indicators show that the township has a strong housing market , with a high owner occupancy rate of almost 80 % . Parts of Astley are among the 5 % least deprived areas in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan , whilst parts of the Blackmoor area , where social housing is concentrated , are within the 10 – 20 % most deprived neighbourhoods nationally . Facilities in the village include a small local shopping centre at Blackmoor . The development of Astley Green Colliery Museum and the heritage centre at Damhouse attract visitors interested in the area 's heritage . 
 = = Landmarks = = 
 The site of Astley Green Colliery Museum , a scheduled ancient monument , retains its engine house and headgear , a prominent feature that can be seen from around the local area . 
 Damhouse , the former manor house , is a listed building , parts of which were dated to 1595 by the Greater Manchester Archaeological Unit . The house was extended in 1650 . In 1999 , Morts Astley Heritage Trust was formed to preserve Damhouse and open the surrounding woodland to the public . It is situated within the Astley Village conservation area . 
 Morleys Hall lies on part of the lands donated to Cockersand Abbey by Hugh Tyldesley in 1210 . It was owned by the Morleys until 1431 , then subsequently by the <unk> . In 1540 it was described as being largely built of timber on stone foundations and surrounded by a moat . It was rebuilt in 1804 , but parts of the old hall survive . Edward Tyldesley of Wardley Hall married Anne Leyland and inherited Morleys in 1564 . Their granddaughter , Elizabeth Tyldesley , became abbess of the Convent of Poor Clares at Gravelines in the Spanish Netherlands . Sir Thomas Tyldesley was the most famous of this line of the family , having been a Cavalier commander and supporter of Charles II , King of England during the English Civil War . He died in the Battle of Wigan Lane and is buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin , Leigh . The hall passed through the Legh and Wilkinson families until it was sold to Tyldesley Urban District Council and the land used for a sewage works . The hall is a private residence . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Public transport in Astley is co @-@ ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester . Bus services operate to Bolton , The Trafford Centre , Tyldesley , Atherton , Wigan and Manchester , operated by Diamond Bus North West , Stagecoach Manchester and First Greater Manchester . Major A roads link Astley with other settlements , including the A580 " East Lancashire Road " , which opened in 1934 bisecting the village . Its dual carriageway crosses the Bridgewater Canal on a bridge at Morleys . The A572 road connects Astley and Worsley and the <unk> road heads north east to Tyldesley . 
 By 1795 , the original Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success , prompting its owner , Francis Egerton , 3rd Duke of Bridgewater , to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley . The Duke 's plans were approved , despite opposition from the local population . Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn ( now the Boathouse ) was built with stabling for horses that pulled the barges . The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904 , when it was replaced . The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge , which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence . A boatyard was established by <unk> Bridge . 
 The Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830 crosses Astley Moss . It was built on a raft of branches and cotton bales to prevent the track sinking into Chat Moss . The early engines reached speeds of 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) . The first passengers told the driver where they wished to alight until Astley railway station was built in the mid @-@ 1840s . The railway was distant from the village and early travellers came on horseback or in carriages . 
 An early tramway ran to a wharf on the Bridgewater Canal at Marsland Green and a mineral railway system linked Gin Pit Colliery to the Tyldesley Loopline at Jackson 's sidings and Bedford Colliery and Speakman 's Sidings . The colliery locomotives were named after Gin Pit Colliery 's company directors . 
 = = Education = = 
 Adam Mort established a grammar school by the chapel in 1631 which was in use until 1833 . Children from poor families were admitted free and those who could afford to pay covered the costs . Mort 's School closed in 1894 . In 1832 children were taught in a barn at the vicarage , the curate , Alfred Hewlett , improved it and the chapel was used as a classroom . A national school built by subscription on land donated by Captain Durie of Damhouse opened in November 1841 . <unk> Infant School was opened at Gin Pit in 1904 to serve the mining community that had grown up by there . Other schools were built at Ellesmere Street and Marsland Green . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Adam Mort built Astley Chapel which was completed in 1630 and consecrated 3 August 1631 . It was the first of three chapels in Astley , and the first chapel of ease of Leigh parish church . Astley Chapel was rebuilt in 1760 ; Thomas Froggatt gave a contribution towards the cost . The new church was built of brick and measured 54 ft 6 in ( 16 @.@ 61 m ) in length and 36 ft ( 11 m ) in width and held 170 people and was enlarged in 1834 , 1842 and 1847 . It had a small chancel and its embattled western tower contained a single bell . The church , dedicated to Saint Stephen , was destroyed by arson on 18 June 1961 . Also destroyed was the book collection , acquired by the Morts , memorials to the old families and the First and Second World War memorials . It was too severely damaged to restore and a third church has been built on a nearby site . 
 Prominent Catholic families in the Leigh parish did not abandon the Catholic faith after the English Reformation despite penalties levied on papists . Secret Roman Catholic masses were held in private homes , including Morleys Hall , home of the Tyldesleys . On Easter Sunday 1641 , the Catholic priest , Ambrose Barlow was arrested during a service at Morleys Hall at the instigation of the vicar of Leigh . He was taken to Lancaster Castle , tried as a traitor and executed on 10 September 1641 . He was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales . A church and school bear his name . The St Ambrose Barlow parish was formed in 1965 and the church was built in 1981 . St Ambrose Barlow parish is in the Leigh Pastoral Area in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool . 
 There were two Methodist churches but one in Lower Green closed in 2009 . Astley Unitarian Chapel was demolished and the site built on . Gin Pit School doubled as a chapel for Wesleyan Methodists .

 Gilbert Arthur " Gil " Grissom , Ph.D. is a fictional character on the CBS crime drama CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , portrayed by William Petersen .

 = = Creation = = 
 Anthony E. Zuiker , who created the show , loosely based Grissom on real life Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department <unk> Daniel Holstein . Zuiker was " fascinated " by Holstein , who , like Grissom , kept maggots and pig 's blood in his refrigerator . Holstein works as a consultant for the show . Zuiker originally named the character Gil <unk> , but after he became part of the cast , William Petersen requested the name to be changed , Petersen and Zuiker decided to rename the character " Grissom , " after astronaut Gus Grissom , of whom Petersen was a great admirer . The name Gil came from one of the actor 's hobbies , fishing . 
 In 2000 , CBS had bought the pilot script from Zuiker , and Nina Tassler , CBS 's head of drama development , passed it on to Petersen , who had a pay or play contract with the network . Petersen has said that many TV shows were offered to him over the years , but he " didn 't want to get locked down " . However , he was impressed with the complexity of Grissom 's character , and he decided to audition . It was the second time Petersen portrayed a forensic scientist , having portrayed Will Graham in the 1986 film Manhunter . 
 = = Development = = 
 Gil Grissom first appears in CSI : Crime Scene Investigation on the pilot episode . After this he appeared in almost every single episode of the show 's first eight years , except in " Hollywood Brass " , from season five , an episode that turns entirely around Jim Brass ; besides him , only three other regular characters appear . William Petersen did not appear during the season six episode " Gum Drops " . This episode was originally going to be how Grissom was convinced that an abduction victim was still alive . When Petersen 's nephew died , he flew home and was unavailable for the filming of the episode , which was rewritten to be centered on Nick . During 2007 ( CSI 's season seven ) William Petersen took a break from CSI to appear in a five @-@ week run of the Trinity Repertory Company production of Dublin Carol in Providence , Rhode Island , resulting in Grissom taking a sabbatical , being replaced by Liev Schreiber , as Michael Keppler , who developed a small story arc through " Sweet Jane " , " Redrum " and " Meet Market " . Also in 2007 , the character appeared in a two part crossover with another CBS series , Without a Trace . It was the sixth episode of the sixth season entitled Where and Why . The plot of the crossover between CSI and Without a Trace involved a serial killer that had eluded capture in Nevada and had escaped to New York City . Gil Grissom was brought in to assist in the apprehension . 
 = = Character background = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Gilbert Arthur " Gil " Grissom was born on August 17 , 1956 , as an only child to a middle @-@ class family in Santa Monica , California . Grissom 's father taught botany at a local college and passed his enthusiasm for natural sciences onto his son . His father died when Grissom was 9 years old . Grissom recalls the day his father died to Catherine Willows in the episode " Still Life " , " He came home from school , one hot humid day , laid down on the couch . I was watching TV , my mom brought in some cold drinks , but she couldn 't wake him up . No one would tell me why . " Consequently , as a young child , Grissom played doctor by performing <unk> on small , deceased animals in the local area . 
 Gil 's mother , Betty , who became deaf as a result of the genetic disorder Otosclerosis , was responsible for his love of books . As a result of his mother 's deafness , Gil became fluent in American Sign Language in order to be able to communicate with her . In the earlier seasons of CSI , it becomes clear that Gil is also beginning to lose his hearing as well ; however , after seeking medical treatment , the disease was prevented from developing . 
 Grissom earned his Bachelor of Science degree in biology magna cum laude from the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , and his Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Chicago . He became a forensic entomologist . In the episode " Grissom vs. the Volcano " , Catherine tells the story of losing at a science competition as a child against a " kid with some lame red ants " . Later in the episode Nick also reveals that he lost a science competition and Grissom tells him to let it go . In his childhood science competition , Grissom was the kid with the ants . 
 In the season two episode " Bully for You " , he told Warrick that in high school , he was a " ghost " ( meaning that he did not belong to any group in particular ) . When he was in college , Grissom financed his first body farm with his winnings from a high @-@ stakes poker game . At the same time , he also attended boxing matches to learn about the patterns of bruise formations on bodies and eventual blood <unk> from the injuries . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Grissom became a crime scene investigator around 1985 ( Grissom mentioned in " Living Doll " , which first aired on May 17 , 2007 , that he had been a crime scene investigator for 22 years ) . Grissom once mentioned losing a body while in Minneapolis , implying he spent time there before taking a job in Las Vegas . This is mentioned again when he works with his former mentor , Dr. Phillip Gerard , played by Raymond J. Barry , stating that he used to work for him in Hennepin County , whose seat is Minneapolis . 
 He became the night shift team supervisor for the Las Vegas CSI unit on the second episode of the series , after Jim Brass was demoted following the death of co @-@ worker Holly <unk> . In season seven , Grissom took a sabbatical to teach a class at Williams College in Williamstown , Massachusetts for four weeks . Prior to his sabbatical , Grissom had been showing signs of " burnout " . Upon his return , however , he appears reinvigorated and tells Warrick Brown that he " missed " Las Vegas . After the resignation of Sara Sidle , his fiancée , from the lab , and the murder of Warrick Brown , his burnout seems to be resurfacing . This is particularly evident in " Say Uncle " , where , at the end of the episode , he expresses deep regret over solving a particularly depressing case . 
 Grissom announced his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer , a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences , did not act alone , and that his accomplice has begun killing again . Rather than leave in the middle of a case , Grissom stays on to help solve it , and ultimately proves instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer 's latest victim . The case closed , Grissom , having already had a series of one @-@ on @-@ one farewells with his co @-@ workers , silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle , an allusion perhaps to his comments in a season one episode that when he left , people would not throw a party for him because he was not the sort of person who people would get deeply involved with . He also says to Warrick in season two ( " Ellie " ) that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room — he would just pick up and leave . 
 = = = After CSI = = = 
 After reuniting with Sara Sidle , Grissom presumably remains in Costa Rica for a short time , before guest @-@ lecturing at the Sorbonne , as noted in the tenth season . During the series ' eleventh season , Grissom begins consulting for the Peruvian government on the etymology and physicality of the Inca . It is during this time that Sara and Grissom divorce , citing geographical differences . He later joins a group dedicated to protecting fish and wildlife in the Pacific , a role described as a " CSI at sea " . After his activities lead him to the Port of San Diego , Grissom reunites with Willows and the CSI team in order to consult on a series of bombings in Las Vegas . During this case , he reconciles with Sidle , and the two sail off together in order to continue his work as a wildlife advocate . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Early episodes revealed Grissom to be a witty , enthusiastic , and quirky scientist who had some sense of humor . He flirted regularly and seemed to be constantly in a hyperactive state . 
 However , when he began to lose his hearing , Grissom retreated into himself and became easily irritated and unapproachable . After his surgery , he lightened up a bit , but never returned to the whimsical science nerd he once was . 
 Grissom is often regarded as well @-@ educated , but unusual in his approach toward his work and social life . In the series , some of his comments and actions can be seen to <unk> his co @-@ workers and superiors . His relationship with his subordinates in the office is portrayed as being a father figure to the team , but very professional in his work . 
 Despite being calm , Grissom can get very angry or annoyed if interrupted during an interrogation as seen in season one episode " Table Stakes " when he berates Nick Stokes for calling him out of interrogation . 
 In addition to being a genius and somewhat of a polymath beyond his career training , he exhibits Asperger @-@ like traits . In " Caged " , it is hinted that ( in fact ) he has Asperger 's syndrome . Another character on CSI who shares these kind of traits is his subordinate ( and ex @-@ wife ) , Sara Sidle . She once insinuated that Grissom was a misanthrope when he quoted her Thoreau 's Walden . 
 In the season two episode " Alter Boys " , Grissom confides in a priest that he does not believe in the concept of organized religion and is a lapsed Catholic , but does believe in the idea of God . In addition to belief in God , Grissom and Greg would later agree that scientific education should not necessarily preclude belief in occultism and other paranormal concepts . 
 Although he is very dedicated to his job and sometimes goes to extremes in his investigations , his unwillingness to dabble in office politics often alienates his superiors , and sometimes his subordinates . He gets a lot of help in these areas from right @-@ hand woman Catherine Willows , who is always trying to make him " look up from the microscope " . 
 Grissom claims to have never hired a prostitute for sex , stating that sex is intended to create a human emotional connection . He has also expressed distaste for carrying a firearm when in the field , a tendency that has brought several scoldings from co @-@ worker Jim Brass . Despite this , he has proven to have an exceptional accuracy at the firing range . 
 He once listed his hobbies to Lady Heather : " I have outlets . I read . I study bugs . I sometimes even ride roller coasters " . Indeed , he has proven to be a very cultured man on many occasions , having a wide knowledge of history , literature , and art . He often offers quotes from a variety of literary sources , including Shakespeare and Keats . Later in this same season , he reveals himself to be a baseball fan . Sara notes that this is typical of Grissom , saying that he would like " all those stats " . However , Grissom is not too familiar with popular culture . In " Two and a Half Deaths " , Jim Brass was talking about a TV program which he thought had already " jumped the shark , " but Grissom did not know the term . While trying to explain , Brass says , " Remember the Fonz ? " , which Grissom did not know either . 
 Being an entomologist , he has a wide and varied knowledge of insects , which he applies to his investigations . This has led to his nickname , " The Bug Man " . In the beginning of the show , he was referred as " Gruesome Grissom " for his sometimes morbid fascination with the more bizarre aspects of man and nature . Grissom keeps a variety of specimens in his office , including a radiated fetal pig , a tarantula , and a two @-@ headed scorpion . He also has a bulletin board that looks like a fish on which unsolved cases go : " the ones that got away " . Occasionally , he keeps evidence from closed cases ( such as the models created by " The Miniature Killer " ) . In season seven , CSI newcomer Michael Keppler takes a look around Grissom 's office and observes that he must be quite a freak . In " The Grave Shift " , even after his office has been cleared out ( and later reclaimed by a somewhat @-@ reluctant Nick Stokes after Catherine Willows passed on the offer ) , the fetal pig in a jar was placed back in there by Hodges , who stated simply that " [ it ] belongs here . " 
 When asked why he is a CSI , he responds , " Because the dead can 't speak for themselves . " This is one of his favorite quotes , and he uses it frequently . 
 = = = Parallelism with Sherlock Holmes = = = 
 Gil Grissom has a more than passing similarity to Sherlock Holmes . Like Holmes , Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior ; Grissom once smashed mustard jars in a grocery store to illustrate a theory ( " I @-@ 15 Murders " ) , much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon . 
 Grissom possesses a Moriarty @-@ like nemesis , Paul <unk> , whom he pursues in several episodes ( " Pilot " , " Anonymous " and " Identity Crisis " ) . Coincidentally , " Paul <unk> " has the same initials as " Professor Moriarty . " There 's also a woman , Lady Heather , in whom he takes an unusual interest . Their relationship is similar to that of Irene Adler and Holmes . Both Irene and Lady Heather enchant Holmes and Grissom with their beauty , their wit and their resolution . Lady Heather often wears Victorian @-@ style dresses , referencing Holmes 's era ( " Slaves of Las Vegas " , " Lady Heather 's Box , " " Pirates of the Third Reich , " and " The Good , the Bad , and the Dominatrix " ) . 
 = = Relationships with other characters = = 
 In the sixth season episode " Bang @-@ Bang , " Grissom tells Doc Robbins , concerning a woman shot in the mouth , " This was someone who was emotionally close to her . " Doc Robbins asks him if he has ever even been close to getting married . Grissom tells him about " Nicole Daley , " who , like him , was interested in bugs . He goes on a bit about her , then says , " Second grade . " 
 Grissom may not ask to take on the role of mentor , but it seems to happen naturally , going all the way back to Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco , then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas . Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times , he is visibly proud when they succeed , as Greg did by passing his field test and becoming a CSI . He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can , as seen in episode 521 ( " <unk> " ) for example . 
 He also shares a good friendship with Dr. Al Robbins and the two were seen singing together in the autopsy room while processing the body of a murdered rock ' n ' roll star ( season 7 , " Built to Kill , Part 2 " ) . In the season six finale , it was revealed that Jim Brass 's living will gave Grissom power of attorney , showing that Grissom was the one person Brass trusted with his life . He has also been shown to be something of an inadvertent mentor @-@ figure to David Hodges , who looks up to him and often seeks his advice or approval , despite not always receiving it . Upon learning of Grissom 's plans to quit CSI , Hodges becomes visibly upset . 
 His relationship with Warrick Brown had aspects of a mentor / student bond , but out of all the CSIs ( Catherine included ) , Grissom seemed to view Warrick as his successor , the one who would lead when he was gone . 
 Some fans have always expected to see a relationship between Grissom and Catherine Willows , in whom he is shown confiding many times , once even likening her to being his " wife " . The two were never more than very good friends , as the show 's producers see them as more of brother and sister than lovers . Catherine has many times encouraged Grissom to be more open and less self @-@ absorbed , and to pursue something with Sara Sidle . 
 Grissom has been allegedly involved with forensic anthropologist Teri Miller and with S & M parlor operator Lady Heather , whose " safeword " it has been suggested that he knows - however , as all he says is " Heather , stop ! " and " I 'm saying Stop " , he evidently does not use it , as " Stop " is never a " safeword " . Rather , this is a reference to the episode Lady Heather 's Box , in which she reminds Grissom that the submissive is in control ; Grissom tells her when they begin kissing , " You can always say stop , " and she replies , " So can you . " 
 = = = Sara Sidle = = = 
 Since the first season , there were hints that both Sara Sidle and Grissom were interested in each other romantically . In fact , the show 's creators made Sara Sidle while thinking of a future love interest for Grissom , but during the show 's first three seasons , Grissom flirted with all the female characters , and when Sara asked him out to dinner , he rejected her , claiming that he did not know what to do about what is going on between them . 
 In season four , Grissom 's true feelings are revealed in " <unk> " , an episode that centers entirely around him discovering his sentiments for Sara . It was then that he admitted not being able to risk his career to be with her . In season four , Sara apparently develops a drinking problem , which Grissom acknowledges on the season finale ; after this , they would hardly see each other , and Grissom becomes interested in detective Sofia Curtis . 
 In mid @-@ season five , Sara is suspended for insubordination and she reveals to Grissom her tormented childhood . He refuses to fire her and has her working in every case of the next two seasons with him . 
 It was not until the sixth season finale that it is revealed that Grissom and Sara have worked through whatever issues they had , and are , in fact , a couple , and have been for two years . This revelation caused mixed reviews among critics , some of them see this relationship as CSI " jumping the shark " , an attempt to include more drama and romance to the show , so as to be able to compete with the medical drama Grey 's Anatomy , which airs at around the same time . By killing off the sexual tension between the two characters and making them an item , the production crew were seen to be adding more personal drama to the show , increasing the appeal to some of Grey 's Anatomy 's younger audience . This has been denied by the writers , Carol Mendelsohn even said that she has never been able to see Grissom with someone else other than Sara and that this episode was seen by the writers as the right time to reveal the relationship , Jorja Fox and William Petersen have also admitted that the relationship is not new . 
 Throughout season seven , the audience sees Grissom and Sara as a couple , but the relationship is kept secret from the others in the lab until Sara 's abduction by The Miniature Killer in the season finale when Grissom unwittingly refers to his feelings for Sara . During season eight , they have become engaged . When Jorja Fox decided to leave the show , both she and the writers decided not to kill the character , so as to leave the doors open for a possible comeback .

 = George W. Bush = 
 George Walker Bush ( born July 6 , 1946 ) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000 . The eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush , he was born in New Haven , Connecticut . After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975 , he worked in oil businesses . He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter . He later co @-@ owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election . He was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial election against Al Gore , becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than an opponent . He is the second president to have been the son of a former president , the first having been John Quincy Adams . He is also the brother of Jeb Bush , a former Governor of Florida and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election . 
 Eight months into Bush 's first term as president , the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred . Bush responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine : launching a " War on Terror " , an international military campaign which included the war in Afghanistan , in 2001 , and the Iraq War , in 2003 . He also promoted policies on the economy , health care , education , social security reform , and amending the Constitution to prohibit same @-@ sex marriage . He signed into law broad tax cuts , the Patriot Act , the No Child Left Behind Act , the Partial @-@ Birth Abortion Ban Act , Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors , and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR . His tenure saw national debates on immigration , Social Security , electronic surveillance , and torture . 
 Bush successfully ran for re @-@ election against Democratic Senator John Kerry in 2004 , in another relatively close election . After his re @-@ election , Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War , Hurricane Katrina , and other challenges . Amid this criticism , the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections . In December 2007 , the United States entered its longest post @-@ World War II recession , often referred to as the " Great Recession " , prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country 's financial system . Nationally , Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history , having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks , as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis . He was met with public protests during visits to the United Kingdom . 
 Bush left office in 2009 , returning to Texas where he purchased a home in suburban Dallas . He is currently a public speaker , and has written a memoir , Decision Points . His presidential library was opened in 2013 . His presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s .

 George Walker Bush was born on July 6 , 1946 , at Grace @-@ New Haven Hospital ( now Yale – New Haven Hospital ) in New Haven , Connecticut , as the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce . He was raised in Midland and Houston , Texas , with four siblings , Jeb , Neil , Marvin and Dorothy . Another younger sister , Robin , died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953 . His grandfather , Prescott Bush , was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut . His father , George H.W. Bush , was Ronald Reagan 's Vice President from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. President from 1989 to 1993 . Bush has English and some German ancestry , along with more distant Dutch , Welsh , Irish , French , and Scottish roots . 
 Bush attended public schools in Midland , Texas , until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade . He then went to The Kinkaid School , a prep school in Houston for two years . 
 Bush attended high school at the Phillips Academy , a boarding school ( then all @-@ male ) in Andover , Massachusetts , where he played baseball , and during his senior year , was the head cheerleader . He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968 , graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History . During this time , he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon , serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year . Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior . Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale 's 1st XV . He characterized himself as an average student . His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77 , and he had a similar average under a <unk> rating system in his final year . 
 Beginning in the fall of 1973 , Bush attended the Harvard Business School , where he earned an M.B.A. degree . He is the only U.S. President to have earned an M.B.A. 
 = = = Texas Air National Guard = = = 
 In May 1968 , Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard . After two years of active @-@ duty service while training , he was assigned to Houston , flying Convair F @-@ 102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base . Critics , including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe , have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father 's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives , citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance . In June 2005 , the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush 's Texas Air National Guard service , which remain in its official archives . 
 In late 1972 and early 1973 , he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard , having moved to Montgomery , Alabama , to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount . In 1972 , Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam . He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21 , 1974 . 
 = = Marriage , family , and personal life = = 
 At a backyard barbecue in 1977 , friends introduced him to Laura Lane Welch , a school teacher and librarian . Bush proposed to her after a three @-@ month courtship , and they married on November 5 of that year . The couple settled in Midland , Texas . Bush left his family 's Episcopal Church to join his wife 's United Methodist Church . On November 25 , 1981 , Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters , Barbara Pierce Bush and Jenna Welch Bush ; they graduated from high school in 2000 and from Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin , respectively , in 2004 . 
 Prior to his marriage , Bush had multiple episodes of alcohol abuse . In one instance , on September 4 , 1976 , he was arrested near his family 's summer home in Kennebunkport , Maine , for driving under the influence of alcohol . He pleaded guilty , was fined $ 150 , and had his Maine driver 's license briefly suspended . Bush says his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life , and attributes to her influence his 1986 decision to give up alcohol . While Governor of Texas , Bush said of his wife , " I saw an elegant , beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful , but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges , and I must confess has smoothed them off over time . " 
 Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life , preferring biographies and histories . During his time as president , Bush read the Bible daily . He also read 14 Lincoln biographies and , during the last three years of his presidency , he reportedly read 186 books . Walt Harrington , a journalist , recalls seeing " books by John Fowles , F. Scott Fitzgerald , James Joyce , and Gore Vidal lying about , as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria " in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman . Other hobbies include cigar smoking and golf . Since leaving the White House , Bush has also taken up oil painting . 
 His first granddaughter , Margaret Laura " Mila " Hager , was born to his daughter Jenna Bush on April 14 , 2013 . She is named after her two grandmothers . 
 = = Early career = = 
 In 1978 , Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas 's 19th congressional district . His opponent , Kent Hance , portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans . Bush lost the election by 6 @,@ 000 votes ( 6 percent ) of the 103 @,@ 000 votes cast . He returned to the oil industry and began a series of small , independent oil exploration companies . He created <unk> Energy , and later changed the name to Bush Exploration . In 1984 , his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7 , and Bush became chairman . The company was hurt by decreased oil prices , and it folded into HKN , Inc . Bush served on the board of directors for HKN . Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose , but the Securities and Exchange Commission 's ( SEC ) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading . 
 Bush moved his family to Washington , D.C. in 1988 to work on his father 's campaign for the U.S. presidency . He served as a campaign adviser and liaison to the media ; he assisted his father by campaigning across the country . Returning to Texas after the successful campaign , he purchased a share in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise in April 1989 , where he served as managing general partner for five years . He actively led the team 's projects and regularly attended its games , often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans . Bush 's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $ 15 million from his initial $ 800 @,@ 000 investment . 
 In December 1991 , Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father 's 1992 Presidential re @-@ election campaign as " campaign advisor " . The previous month , his father asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu that he should resign . 
 = = Governor of Texas ( 1995 – 2000 ) = = 
 As Bush 's brother , Jeb , sought the governorship of Florida , Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election . His campaign focused on four themes : welfare reform , tort reform , crime reduction , and education improvement . Bush 's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes , Joe <unk> , and Karl Rove . 
 After easily winning the Republican primary , Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards . In the course of the campaign , Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons . Richards had vetoed the bill , but Bush signed it after he became governor . According to The Atlantic Monthly , the race " featured a rumor that she was a lesbian , along with a rare instance of such a tactic 's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself , perhaps inadvertently , to be quoted criticizing Richards for ' appointing avowed homosexual activists ' to state jobs " . The Atlantic , and others , connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove , but Rove denied being involved . Bush won the general election with 53 @.@ 5 percent against Richards ' 45 @.@ 9 percent . 
 Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas 's largest tax @-@ cut , $ 2 billion . He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse , and helping to reduce domestic violence . Critics contended that during his tenure , Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations . Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores . 
 In 1999 , Bush signed a state law obliging electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources ( RPS ) , which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S. 
 In 1998 , Bush won re @-@ election with a record 69 percent of the vote . He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four @-@ year terms . For most of Texas history , governors served two @-@ year terms ; a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975 . In his second term , Bush promoted faith @-@ based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings . He proclaimed June 10 , 2000 to be Jesus Day in Texas , a day on which he " urge [ d ] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need " . 
 Throughout Bush 's first term , national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate . Following his re @-@ election , speculation soared . Within a year , he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination .

 In June 1999 , while Governor of Texas , Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States . With no incumbent running , Bush entered a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination consisting of John McCain , Alan Keyes , Steve Forbes , Gary Bauer , Orrin Hatch , Elizabeth Dole , Dan Quayle , Pat Buchanan , Lamar Alexander , John Kasich , and Bob Smith . 
 Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative , implying he was more centrist than other Republicans . He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House , increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces , cutting taxes , improving education , and aiding minorities . By early 2000 , the race had centered on Bush and McCain . 
 Bush won the Iowa caucuses , but , although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary , he trailed McCain by 19 percent and lost that primary . Despite this , Bush regained momentum and , according to political observers , effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary , which according to The Boston Globe made history for his campaign 's negativity ; The New York Times described it as a smear campaign . 
 = = = = General election = = = = 
 On July 25 , 2000 , Bush surprised some observers by asking Dick Cheney , a former White House Chief of Staff , U.S. Representative , and Secretary of Defense , to be his running mate . Cheney was then serving as head of Bush 's Vice @-@ Presidential search committee . Soon after , Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the 2000 Republican National Convention . 
 Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas . Bush 's campaign criticized his Democratic opponent , incumbent Vice President Al Gore , over gun control and taxation . 
 When the election returns came in on November 7 , Bush won 29 states , including Florida . The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount . The initial recount also went to Bush , but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the U.S. Supreme Court . On December 9 , in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling , the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision ordering a third count , and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida 's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast . Although he received 543 @,@ 895 fewer individual votes than Gore nationwide , Bush won the election , receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore 's 266 ( Gore 's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267 ; however , one of Gore 's pledged electors abstained , rendering the official tally at 266 ) . Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer national votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888 . 
 = = = 2004 presidential candidacy = = = 
 In 2004 , Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge . He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager , with a political strategy devised by Karl Rove . Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , support for the USA PATRIOT Act , a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same @-@ sex marriage , reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts , creation of an ownership society , and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls . Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants , which was criticized by conservatives . 
 The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates , including Bush 's emerging opponent , Massachusetts Senator John Kerry . Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War , and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth . The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government . The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry 's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq , and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror . 
 In the election , Bush carried 31 of 50 states , receiving a total of 286 electoral votes . He won an absolute majority of the popular vote ( 50 @.@ 7 percent to his opponent 's 48 @.@ 3 percent ) . The previous President to win an absolute majority of the popular vote was Bush 's father in the 1988 election . Additionally , it was the first time since Herbert Hoover 's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re @-@ elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress . 
 = = Presidency ( 2001 – 09 ) = = 
 Though Bush originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda , his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 . Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq with significant domestic debates regarding immigration , healthcare , Social Security , economic policy , and treatment of terrorist detainees . Over an eight @-@ year period , Bush 's once @-@ high approval ratings steadily declined , while his disapproval numbers increased significantly . In 2007 , the United States entered the longest post @-@ World War II recession .

 Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the Dot @-@ com bubble . The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy . The Bush administration increased federal government spending from $ 1 @.@ 789 trillion to $ 2 @.@ 983 trillion ( 60 percent ) while revenues increased from $ 2 @.@ 025 trillion to $ 2 @.@ 524 trillion ( from 2000 to 2008 ) . Individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent , corporate tax revenues by 50 percent , customs and duties by 40 percent . Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent , discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent , Medicare spending by 131 percent , social security by 51 percent , and income security spending by 130 percent . Cyclically adjusted , revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent . 
 The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson . The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91 @,@ 196 . 
 The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $ 237 billion — the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever . In 2001 , Bush 's budget estimated that there would be a $ 5 @.@ 6 trillion surplus over the next ten years . Facing congressional opposition , Bush held <unk> style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $ 1 @.@ 35 trillion tax cut program — one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history . Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers , saying " the surplus is not the government 's money . The surplus is the people 's money . " Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs . Treasury Secretary Paul H. O 'Neill , opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security . O 'Neill disputes the claim , made in Bush 's book Decision Points , that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts . By 2003 , the economy showed signs of improvement , though job growth remained stagnant . Another tax cut program was passed that year . 
 During the 2001 to 2008 years , GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2 @.@ 125 percent , less than for past business cycles . 
 Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10 @,@ 587 , and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14 @,@ 000 . When Bush left office , the average was at 7 @,@ 949 , one of the lowest levels of his presidency . 
 Unemployment originally rose from 4 @.@ 2 percent in January 2001 to 6 @.@ 3 percent in June 2003 , but subsequently dropped to 4 @.@ 5 percent as of July 2007 . Adjusted for inflation , median household income dropped by $ 1 @,@ 175 between 2000 and 2007 , while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that " Median real after @-@ tax household income went up 2 % " . The poverty rate increased from 11 @.@ 3 percent in 2000 to 12 @.@ 3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12 @.@ 7 percent in 2004 . By October 2008 , due to increases in spending , the national debt had risen to $ 11 @.@ 3 trillion , an increase of over 100 percent from 2000 when the debt was only $ 5 @.@ 6 trillion . Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the " Bush tax cuts " and increased national security spending . In March 2006 , then @-@ Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling : " The fact that we are here today to debate raising America 's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure . " By the end of Bush 's presidency , unemployment climbed to 7 @.@ 2 percent . 
 In December 2007 , the United States entered the longest post – World War II recession , which included a housing market correction , a subprime mortgage crisis , soaring oil prices , and a declining dollar value . In February , 63 @,@ 000 jobs were lost , a five @-@ year record . To aid with the situation , Bush signed a $ 170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses . The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003 , and after two years , the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate . Many Republican senators , as well as influential members of the Bush Administration , feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector 's risky practices . In September 2008 , the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $ 85 billion . 
 Many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial , according to former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . Bush , meanwhile , proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market . Vince Reinhardt , a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute , said " it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely " , and additionally , that it would have helped " for Congress to have held hearings " . 
 In November 2008 , over 500 @,@ 000 jobs were lost , which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years . The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008 , 1 @.@ 9 million jobs were lost . By the end of 2008 , the U.S. had lost a total of 2 @.@ 6 million jobs . 
 = = = = Education and health = = = = 
 Bush undertook a number of educational priorities , such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office , and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students . Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006 , the first such cut in 36 years , due to rising inflation . 
 One of the administration 's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act , which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance , provide options to parents with students in low @-@ performing schools , and target more federal funding to low @-@ income schools . This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support , including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts . It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002 . Many contend that the initiative has been successful , as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed " No Child Left Behind " into law . Critics argue that it is underfunded and that <unk> 's focus on " high @-@ stakes testing " and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive . 
 After being re @-@ elected , Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that , according to Jan Crawford , resulted in " the greatest expansion in America 's welfare state in forty years ; " the bill 's costs approached $ 7 trillion . In 2007 , Bush opposed and vetoed State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) legislation , which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress . The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low @-@ income families from about six million to ten million children . It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax . Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care , and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $ 83 @,@ 000 per year who did not need the help . 
 = = = = Social services and social security = = = = 
 Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003 , Bush signed the bill , which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs , while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits . The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement . Bush said the law , estimated to cost $ 400 billion over the first ten years , would give the elderly " better choices and more control over their health care " . 
 Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security , which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005 . Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress . In his 2005 State of the Union Address , Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program , which included partial privatization of the system , personal Social Security accounts , and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ( FICA ) into secured investments . Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system . 
 Bush embarked on a 60 @-@ day national tour , campaigning for his initiative in media events known as " Conversations on Social Security " , in an attempt to gain public support . Nevertheless , public support for the proposal declined and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda . The proposal 's legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout from Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005 . After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections , there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office . 
 = = = = Environmental policies = = = = 
 Upon taking office in 2001 , Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol , an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world 's population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year . He also cited that the Senate had voted 95 – 0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol . 
 In May 2001 , Bush signed an executive order to create an inter @-@ agency task force to streamline energy projects , and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues . 
 In 2002 , Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003 , aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs . Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal . The initiative was introduced to Congress , but failed to make it out of committee . 
 Later in 2006 , Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument , creating the largest marine reserve to date . The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres ( 340 @,@ 000 km2 ) and is home to 7 @,@ 000 species of fish , birds , and other marine animals , many of which are specific to only those islands . The move was hailed by conservationists for " its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area " . 
 Bush has said that he believes that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem , but he asserted there is a " debate over whether it 's man @-@ made or naturally caused " . The Bush Administration 's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities . Critics have alleged that the administration misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming . 
 = = = = Energy policies = = = = 
 In his 2006 State of the Union Address , Bush declared , " America is addicted to oil " and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research . 
 In his 2007 State of the Union Address , Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production . Amid high gasoline prices in 2008 , Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling . However , the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling . Bush said , " This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress . " Bush had said in June 2008 , " In the long run , the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies . My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas @-@ saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells ... In the short run , the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil . And that means we need to increase supply , especially here at home . So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production . " 
 In his 2008 State of the Union Address , Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $ 2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change , saying , " Along with contributions from other countries , this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner , more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China , and help leverage substantial private @-@ sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive . " He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States ' commitment to work with major economies , and , through the UN , to complete an international agreement that will slow , stop , and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases ; he stated , " This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride . "

 Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey @-@ Wicker Amendment by Congress and the signature of President Bill Clinton . Bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research . However , Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research . On August 9 , 2001 , Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing " lines " of stem cells , but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned . Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines , and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells , which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines . On July 19 , 2006 , Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act . The bill would have repealed the Dickey @-@ Wicker Amendment , thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo . 
 = = = = Genetic <unk> = = = = 
 On May 21 , 2008 President George W. Bush signed into law the Genetic Information <unk> Act ( <unk> ) . The bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment . The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law . It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research . 
 = = = = Immigration = = = = 
 Nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005 , more than in any other five @-@ year period in the nation 's history . Almost half entered illegally . In 2006 , Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a " temporary guest @-@ worker program " . Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6 @,@ 000 National Guard troops to the Mexico – United States border . From May to June 2007 , Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration . The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants , with an eventual path to citizenship ; establishing a guest worker program ; a series of border and work site enforcement measures ; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point @-@ based " merit " system for green cards ; elimination of " chain migration " and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa ; and other measures . Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation , and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor . Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty . 
 A heated public debate followed , which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party , most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions . The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28 , 2007 , when a cloture motion failed on a 46 – 53 vote . Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives . The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law . 
 On September 19 , 2010 , former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100 @,@ 000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority . 
 = = = = Hurricane Katrina = = = = 
 Hurricane Katrina , one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history , struck early in Bush 's second term . Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north @-@ central Gulf Coast of the United States , particularly New Orleans . 
 Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27 , and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day ; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) to manage the disaster , but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action . The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29 , and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches ; later that day , Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana , officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort . 
 On August 30 , DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it " an incident of national significance " , triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan . Three days later , on September 2 , National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans . The same day , Bush toured parts of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was " not enough " . 
 As the disaster in New Orleans intensified , critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration 's role in what they saw as a flawed response . Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA , notably Michael D. Brown ; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods . Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government 's failures in its handling of the emergency . It has been argued that with Katrina , Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover . 
 = = = = Midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys = = = = 
 During Bush 's second term , a controversy arose over the Justice Department 's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys . The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance . Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue , along with other senior members of the Justice Department . The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter , but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas , invoking his right of executive privilege . Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice . The Justice Department determined that the President 's order was legal . 
 Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage , no official findings have been released . On March 10 , 2008 , the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas . On July 31 , 2008 , a United States district court judge ruled that Bush 's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas . 
 In all , twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress . They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson , Gonzales ' liaison to the White House Monica <unk> , aide to the president Karl Rove and his senior aide Sara Taylor . In addition , legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten were both found in contempt of Congress . 
 In 2010 , the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings , the firings were " inappropriately political " , but not criminal . According to the prosecutors , there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 In July 2001 , Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo . 
 During his Presidential campaign , Bush 's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America , especially Mexico , and a reduction of involvement in " nation @-@ building " and other small @-@ scale military engagements . The administration pursued a national missile defense . Bush was an advocate of China 's entry into the World Trade Organization . 
 In his 2002 State of the Union Address , Bush referred to an axis of evil including Iraq , Iran and North Korea . After the September 11 attacks on New York , Bush launched the War on Terror , in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan . In 2003 , Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq , searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction , which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism . Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq . 
 Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations . He appointed long @-@ time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign . Bush lauded the pro @-@ democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine . 
 In March 2006 , a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries , reversing decades of U.S. policy . The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter @-@ terrorism cooperation , discussions that would lead eventually to the India – United States Civil Nuclear Agreement . 
 This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor , Clinton , whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring . The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush 's tenure . 
 Midway through Bush 's second term , it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda , highlighted in policy changes toward some oil @-@ rich former Soviet republics in central Asia . 
 In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20 , 2001 , Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks . He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show " unity of purpose with America " , and said " America has no truer friend than Great Britain . " 
 = = = = September 11 attacks = = = = 
 The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush 's presidency . That evening , he addressed the nation from the Oval Office , promising a strong response to the attacks . He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims . On September 14 , he visited Ground Zero , meeting with Mayor Rudy Giuliani , firefighters , police officers , and volunteers . Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble , to much applause : " I can hear you . The rest of the world hears you . And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon . " 
 In a September 20 speech , Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al @-@ Qaeda , and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan , where bin Laden was operating , to " hand over the terrorists , or ... share in their fate " . 
 = = = = War on Terrorism = = = = 
 After September 11 , Bush announced a global War on Terror . The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden , so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime . In his January 29 , 2002 State of the Union Address , he asserted that an " axis of evil " consisting of North Korea , Iran , and Iraq was " arming to threaten the peace of the world " and " pose [ d ] a grave and growing danger " . The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war , or preventive war . This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks . 
 Dissent and criticism of Bush 's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued . In 2006 , a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the " cause célèbre for jihadists " . 
 = = = = Afghanistan invasion = = = = 
 On October 7 , 2001 , U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13 . The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban , drive al @-@ Qaeda out of Afghanistan , and capture key al @-@ Qaeda leaders . In December 2001 , the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated , but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al @-@ Qaeda leaders . Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai . In 2002 , based on UNICEF figures , Nicholas Kristof reported that " our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade " as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid . 
 Efforts to kill or capture al @-@ Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora , which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops . It was not until May 2011 , two years after Bush left office , that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces . Bin Laden 's successor , Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri , remains at large . 
 Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul , by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping , amassing new funds and recruits . The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned . In 2006 , the Taliban insurgency appeared larger , fiercer and better organized than expected , with large @-@ scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success . As a result , Bush commissioned 3 @,@ 500 additional troops to the country in March 2007 . 
 = = = = Iraq invasion = = = = 
 Beginning with his January 29 , 2002 State of the Union address , Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq , which he labeled as part of an " axis of evil " allied with terrorists and posing " a grave and growing danger " to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction . 
 In the latter half of 2002 , CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein 's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs , not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons , and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions . <unk> that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president . 
 In late 2002 and early 2003 , Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates , precipitating a diplomatic crisis . In November 2002 , Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq , but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion , despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks . The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries . 
 More than 20 nations ( most notably the United Kingdom ) , designated the " coalition of the willing " joined the United States in invading Iraq . They launched the invasion on March 20 , 2003 . The Iraqi military was quickly defeated . The capital , Baghdad , fell on April 9 , 2003 . On May 1 , Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq . The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity , but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups ; Bush 's " Mission Accomplished " speech was later criticized as premature . From 2004 until 2007 , the situation in Iraq deteriorated further , with some observers arguing that there was a full @-@ scale civil war in Iraq . Bush 's policies met with criticism , including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq . The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group , led by James Baker , concluded that the situation in Iraq was " grave and deteriorating " . While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq , he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy . 
 In January 2005 , free , democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years . According to Iraqi National Security Advisor <unk> al @-@ <unk> , " This is the greatest day in the history of this country . " Bush praised the event as well , saying that the Iraqis " have taken rightful control of their country 's destiny " . This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al @-@ Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq . A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005 , supported by most Shiites and many Kurds . 
 On January 10 , 2007 , Bush announced a surge of 21 @,@ 500 more troops for Iraq , as well as a job program for Iraqis , more reconstruction proposals , and $ 1 @.@ 2 billion for these programs . On May 1 , 2007 , Bush used his second @-@ ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops , saying the debate over the conflict was " understandable " but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial . 
 In March 2008 , Bush praised the Iraqi government 's " bold decision " to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army , calling it " a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq " . He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008 . He also praised the Iraqis ' legislative achievements , including a pension law , a revised de @-@ <unk> law , a new budget , an amnesty law , and a provincial powers measure that , he said , set the stage for the Iraqi elections . By July 2008 , American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began , and due to increased stability in Iraq , Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces . 
 = = = = Surveillance = = = = 
 Following the events of September 11 , Bush issued an executive order authorizing the President 's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . As of 2009 , the other provisions of the program remained highly classified . Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war , the program was subsequently re @-@ authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists . The program proved to be controversial , as critics of the administration , as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association , argued that it was illegal . In August 2006 , a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional , but on July 6 , 2007 , that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing . On January 17 , 2007 , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President , but would be subjected to judicial oversight . Later in 2007 , the NSA launched a replacement for the program , referred to as PRISM , that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013 . 
 = = = = Interrogation policies = = = = 
 Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding as one of several enhanced interrogation techniques . Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques , such as waterboarding , to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions ' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal . The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General , though that memo was later withdrawn . While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert " that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information " , the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations " provided critical information " to preserve American lives . Critics , such as former CIA officer Bob Baer , have stated that information was suspect , " you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture 's bad enough . " 
 On October 17 , 2006 , Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , a law enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court 's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , 548 U.S. 557 ( 2006 ) , which allows the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial . The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees , but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture . 
 On March 8 , 2008 , Bush vetoed H.R. <unk> , a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations , saying that " the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror " . In April 2009 , the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration 's interrogation tactics . One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department . 
 = = = = North Korea condemnation = = = = 
 Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong @-@ il of North Korea , naming North Korea one of three states in an " axis of evil " , and saying that " the United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons . " Within months , " both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S. – DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994 . " North Korea 's October 9 , 2006 , detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush 's foreign policy , which centered for both terms of his presidency on " [ preventing ] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world " . Bush condemned North Korea 's position , reaffirmed his commitment to " a nuclear @-@ free Korean Peninsula " , and stated that " transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non @-@ state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States " , for which North Korea would be held accountable . On May 7 , 2007 , North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account . This was a result of a series of three @-@ way talks initiated by the United States and including China . On September 2 , 2007 , North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007 . By May 2009 , North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea . 
 On June 22 , 2010 , " While South Korea prospers , the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly , " he said , adding that , " communism had resulted in dire poverty , mass starvation and brutal suppression . " In recent years , " he went on to say , " the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea 's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs . "

 Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria . In early 2007 , the Treasury Department , acting on a June 2005 executive order , froze American bank accounts of Syria 's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology , Electronics Institute , and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory . Bush 's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction and being supportive of terrorism . Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007 , the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians , accusing them of activities to " undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon " in November 2007 . Those designated included : <unk> Halim <unk> , a member of Lebanon 's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party ; Wi 'am Wahhab , a former member of Lebanon 's government ( Minister of the Environment ) under Prime Minister Omar Karami ( 2004 – 2005 ) ; Hafiz <unk> , a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad ; and Muhammad Nasif <unk> , identified as a close adviser to Assad .

 Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements , including the Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile Treaty ( ABM ) with Russia . He also signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia . 
 Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians ; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence , but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . Bush supported Sharon 's unilateral disengagement plan , and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat 's death . 
 Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand @-@ off in April 2001 with the People 's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident , when an EP @-@ 3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People 's Liberation Army Air Force jet , leading to the detention of U.S. personnel . From 2003 to 2004 , Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests . Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide . Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur , but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court . 
 In the State of the Union address in January 2003 , Bush outlined a five @-@ year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief , the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief . Bush announced $ 15 billion for this effort which directly supported life @-@ saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3 @.@ 2 million men , women and children worldwide . 
 On June 10 , 2007 , Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania . Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo . Bush opposed South Ossetia 's independence . On August 15 , 2008 , Bush said of Russia 's invasion of the country of Georgia : " Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century . " 
 Bush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utha . Departing from previous practice , he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box , saying : " On behalf of a proud , determined , and grateful nation , I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City , celebrating the Olympic Winter Games . " In 2008 , in the course of a good @-@ will trip to Asia , he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing . 
 Bush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty @-@ fifth Amendment , which allows a President to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the Vice President who then becomes Acting President . On June 29 , 2002 , Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment , making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President . The medical procedure began at 7 : 09 a.m. EDT and ended at 7 : 29 a.m. EDT . Bush woke up twenty minutes later , but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9 : 24 a.m. EDT after the president 's doctor , Richard Tubb , conducted an overall examination . Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects . On July 21 , 2007 , Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy , again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President . Bush invoked Section 3 at 7 : 16 a.m. EDT . He reclaimed his powers at 9 : 21 a.m. EDT . In both cases , Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers .

Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29 , 2005 . 
 On October 3 , 2005 , Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O 'Connor 's position . After facing significant opposition from both parties , who found her to be ill @-@ prepared and uninformed on the law , Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27 . Four days later , on October 31 , Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito . Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31 , 2006 . 
 = = = = Other courts = = = = 
 In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments , Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts . Each of these numbers , along with his total of 324 judicial appointments , is third in American history , behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton . Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies . Debate during one confirmation session lasted " 39 stupefying hours " according to The New York Times . On August 3 , 2001 , the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in status quo , returning 40 judicial nominations , and 164 total nominations . 
 At the outset , Judicature magazine noted that the " Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings " before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate . It then cites The New York Times as saying " Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush 's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny . " 
 The Senate confirmed only 8 out of 60 judicial nominations by October 2001 . In February 2003 , the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada .

 Bush 's upbringing in West Texas , his accent , his vacations on his Texas ranch , and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy , American cowboy image . " I think people look at him and think John Wayne , " said Piers Morgan , editor of the British Daily Mirror . It has been suggested that Bush 's accent was an active choice , as a way of distinguishing himself from Northeastern intellectuals and anchoring himself to his Texas roots . Both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism . 
 Bush has been parodied by the media , comedians , and other politicians . Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches , which are colloquially referred to as <unk> . Some pundits labeled Bush " the worst president ever " . In contrast to his father , who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme , Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks . Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is " ludicrous " and that Bush is " very smart " . In an interview with Playboy , New York Times columnist David Brooks said George W. Bush " was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public . He doesn 't want anybody to think he 's smarter than they are , so puts on a Texas act . "

 Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50 percent . After the September 11 attacks , Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent , maintaining 80 to 90 percent approval for four months after the attacks . It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term . 
 In 2000 and again in 2004 , Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year , a title awarded to someone who the editors believe " has done the most to influence the events of the year " . In May 2004 , Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush . However , the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans ' frustration with him on issues of spending , illegal immigration , and Middle Eastern affairs . 
 Within the United States armed forces , according to an unscientific survey , the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections . While 73 percent of military personnel said that they would vote for Bush , 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival , John Kerry . According to Peter <unk> , a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military , members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq . 
 Bush 's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in AP @-@ Ipsos polling in December 2004 . Thereafter , his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped . Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War , his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse , NSA warrantless surveillance , the Plame affair , and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies . There were calls for Bush 's impeachment , though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action . The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy , the Bush administration 's justification for the war in Iraq , and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions . Representative Dennis Kucinich ( D @-@ OH ) , who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign , introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9 , 2008 , but Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D @-@ CA ) declared that impeachment was " off the table " . 
 Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush , the lowest for any second @-@ term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 ( when Truman 's approval rating was 28 percent ) , which contributed to what Bush called the " thumping " of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid @-@ term elections . Throughout most of 2007 , Bush 's approval rating hovered in the mid @-@ thirties ; the average for his entire second term was 37 percent , according to Gallup . 
 By the beginning of 2008 , his final year in office , Bush 's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent , largely from the loss of support among Republicans . Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being " the worst president , " Bush would say , " I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles . I frankly don 't give a damn about the polls . " 
 In the spring of that year , Bush 's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70 @-@ year history of the Gallup poll , with 69 percent of those polled in April 2008 disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving — although the majority ( 66 percent ) of Republicans still approved of his job performance . 
 In polls conducted in the fall , just before the 2008 election , his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent , while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent . In polling conducted January 9 – 11 , 2009 , his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent , which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman , the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s ( Richard Nixon 's final Gallup approval rating was even lower , at 24 percent ) . According to a CBS News / New York Times poll conducted January 11 – 15 , 2009 , Bush 's final approval rating in office was 22 percent , the lowest in American history . 
 = = = = Foreign perceptions = = = = 
 Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti @-@ war and anti @-@ globalization campaigns for his administration 's foreign policy . Views of him within the international community — even in France , a close ally of the United States — were more negative than those of most previous American presidents in history . 
 Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico , although formal relations were sometimes strained . Other leaders , such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai , Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni , Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez , openly criticized the president . Later in Bush 's presidency , tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin , which led to a cooling of their relationship . 
 In 2006 , most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush . Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security . In 2007 , the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency , attitudes towards the United States , and towards Americans , became less favorable around the world . 
 A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world . 
 The Pew Research Center 's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that out of 47 countries , in only nine countries did most respondents express " a lot of confidence " or " some confidence " in Bush : Ethiopia , Ghana , India , Israel , Ivory Coast , Kenya , Mali , Nigeria , and Uganda . 
 During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim Albania , Bush was greeted enthusiastically . Albania has a population of 2 @.@ 8 million , has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan , and the country 's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy . A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him . A shirt @-@ sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in <unk> @-@ Krujë , a few kilometers northwest of Tirana . The Bush administration 's support for the independence of Albanian @-@ majority Kosovo , while endearing him to the Albanians , has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia , leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade .

 On May 7 , 2005 , during an official state visit to Latvia , Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe @-@ Freiberga . A few places outside the United States bear Bush 's name . In 2005 , the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president . Previously known as <unk> Drive , the street links the Georgian capital 's airport with the city center and was used by Bush 's motorcade during his visit four months earlier . A street in Tirana , formerly known as Rruga <unk> e <unk> , situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament , was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first @-@ ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007 . In Jerusalem , a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush . 
 In 2012 , Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 The Bush Presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s . 
 After his re @-@ election in 2004 , Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War , Hurricane Katrina , and other challenges . Amid this criticism , the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections . In December 2007 , the United States entered its longest post @-@ World War II recession , often referred to as the " Great Recession " , prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country 's financial system . Nationally , Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history , having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks , as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis .

 Following the inauguration of Barack Obama , Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland , Texas , following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford , Texas . They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas , Texas , where they settled down . 
 He makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas / Fort Worth area , most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team 's new stadium in Arlington and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game , where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation . He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and , accompanied by his father , threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31 , 2010 . 
 On August 6 , 2013 , Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent . The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination . 
 In reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers , Bush stated : " Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night . Murdering the innocent is always evil , never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities . " 
 = = = Publications and appearances = = = 
 Since leaving office , Bush has kept a relatively low profile though he has made public appearances , most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011 . In March 2009 , he delivered his first post @-@ presidency speech in Calgary , Alberta , appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a " special place in American history , " and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy . Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the " Get Motivated " seminar in Dallas . In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting that took place on November 5 , 2009 , in Texas , the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and victims ' families the day following the shooting , having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage . 
 Bush released his memoirs , Decision Points , on November 9 , 2010 . During a pre @-@ release appearance promoting the book , Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping " the country safe amid a real danger " , and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform . He also made news defending his administration 's enhanced interrogation techniques , specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , saying , " I 'd do it again to save lives . " 
 In 2012 , he wrote the foreword of The 4 % Solution : Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs , an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center . He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas , Texas . 
 Bush appeared on NBC 's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19 , 2013 , along with the former First Lady , Laura Bush . When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration , Bush said , " I don 't think it 's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor . " Despite this statement , on Saturday , April 25 , 2015 , Bush criticized President Barack Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas . Bush criticized Obama 's handling of Iran , specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal , saying : " You think the Middle East is chaotic now ? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren . That 's how Americans should view the deal . " Bush also attacked Obama 's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 , calling it a " strategic blunder " , borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham . 
 Alongside the 2014 United States – Africa Leaders Summit , Bush , Michelle Obama , the State Department , and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit . Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV / AIDS more difficult . 
 Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries . 
 On November 2 , 2014 , Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. 
 Bush published a biography of his father , George Bush , called 41 : A Portrait of My Father . It was released on November 11 , 2014 . 
 In an interview published by Israel <unk> magazine on June 12 , 2015 , Bush said that " boots on the ground " would be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIS ) . He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq , but he chose the opposite , sending 30 @,@ 000 more troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq , and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated . Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer , stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President Barack Obama . 
 Bush declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump and he didn 't attend the 2016 Republican National Convention that formally nominated Trump . On the eve of Trump 's nomination , it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors , " I 'm worried that I will be the last Republican president . "

 In January 2010 , at President Obama 's request , Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month . 
 On May 2 , 2011 , President Obama called Bush , who was at a restaurant with his wife , to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed . The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . At the Ground Zero memorial , Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War . 
 = = = Visual art = = = 
 After serving as president , Bush began painting as a hobby . Subjects have included dogs and still life . He has also painted self @-@ portraits and portraits of world leaders , including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair . 
 His paintings have been met with a middling reception from art critics . Bill Arning , director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston , called his portraits " thickly painted in what I would call ' high @-@ amateur ' mode " and wrote , " I would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction . You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it [ ... ] I think he 'd be well advised to work from other , multiple photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness going on . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 George W. Bush 's legacy remains a contested one . Supporters credit Bush 's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the US after 9 / 11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR . Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War , specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction , that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion — as well as his handling of tax policy , Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 financial crisis as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president . 
 Several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history . Princeton University scholar Julian <unk> described Bush 's presidency as a " transformative " one , and said that " some people hate him , some people love him , but I do think he 'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on " . Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as " the most noteworthy president since FDR " and said that the Patriot Act " increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable " as evidence . Bush 's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration , and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society . Much of these policies have endured in the administration of Bush 's Democratic successor , Barack Obama . 
 Among the public , his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009 . In February 2012 , Gallup reported that " Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents , though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office . " Gallup had earlier noted that Bush 's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office , from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009 , to 45 percent in July 2010 , a period during which he had remained largely out of the news . Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush 's personal favorability since the end of his presidency . In April 2013 , Bush 's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC , his highest approval rating since December 2005 . Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors , non @-@ college whites , and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office , although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy ( 53 percent ) and the Iraq War ( 57 percent ) . His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama 's in the same polling period . A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush 's presidency had been a failure , with 80 percent of Republican calling it a success , but only 43 percent of independents calling it a success and nearly 90 percent of Democrats calling it a failure . 
 While President Bush 's approval rating among the public has seen an improvement , the most recent survey of the opinions of historians , political scientists , and Presidential scholars , conducted in 2010 by the Siena Research Institute , ranked him 39th out of 43 Presidents . The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy , communication , ability to compromise , foreign policy accomplishments , and intelligence . 
 = CMLL World Welterweight Championship = 
 The CMLL World Welterweight Championship ( Spanish : <unk> Mundial Peso Welter de CMLL ) is a professional wrestling world championship in the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) . The official definition of the welterweight division in Mexico is between 70 kg ( 150 lb ) and 78 kg ( 172 lb ) but the official weight limits are not always adhered to these days . As the championship is a professional wrestling championship , it is not won or lost competitively but instead by the decision of the bookers of a wrestling promotion . The title is awarded after the chosen wrestler " wins " a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport . 
 Overall there have been a total of 32 official championship reigns , shared between 20 different wrestlers . Mephisto is the current and <unk> champion , having won the championship on May 3 , 2016 . Máscara Dorada is the first and only wrestler to hold the championship four times . Mephisto 's first reign was the longest individual reign , 1 @,@ 141 days between 2004 and 2007 . The championship has been defended in Mexico and Japan , including three title changes in Japan . Over the lifetime of the championship was vacated twice and CMLL has held three different tournaments for the championship . 
 = = History = = 
 In the late 1980s CMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) to avoid the politics of the NWA . While they left the NWA they did retain control of the NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the welterweight division . They also promoted the Mexican National Welterweight Championship as a secondary title in the Welterweight division . In 1991 CMLL decided to create a series of CMLL Branded world championships , one of which was for the welterweight division . CMLL held a four @-@ man tournament on February 15 , 1992 to crown the first welterweight <unk> the participants were Fuerza Guerrera , El Felino , América and El Khalifa , the finals saw Fuerza Guerrera defeat El Khalifa to become the first Welterweight champion . On July 16 , 1992 then Mexican National Welterweight Champion defeated CMLL Welterweight Champion América , which led to the Mexican National Welterweight Championship being vacated . In 1993 control of the Mexican National Welterweight Championship was transferred from CMLL to rival promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) . 
 In 1996 the championship was vacated after then @-@ champion El Pantera lost the Championship to Super Delfin while on tour in Japan . Pantera left CMLL for AAA after the tour , and he decided to give Super Delfin the championship by losing a match to him while in Japan . CMLL knew that Pantera was leaving and nullified the championship change , choosing to not recognize the title change at all , instead announcing that they had <unk> : vacated the championship . Subsequently CMLL put together a 16 @-@ man tournament crown a new champion , the tournament saw Máscara Mágica defeat El Felino in the tournament final to become the seventh official CMLL World Welterweight Champion . Máscara Mágica would later defeat Super Delfin to put an end to any questions about the lineage of the championship . In 1998 the Mexican National Welterweight Championship was returned to CMLL , making it a tertiary title behind the CMLL and NWA branded world championships . In 2010 CMLL returned the NWA World Welterweight Championship to the NWA , but immediately replaced it with the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship . 
 From the unrecognized title change on March 15 , 1996 , until January 2011 , when Ryusuke Taguchi won the Championship in Tokyo , all championship matches took place in Mexico . In early 2015 it was announced that then @-@ champion Máscara Dorada had signed a contract to work for New Japan Pro Wrestling ( NJPW ) for a year , taking the championship with him to Japan . During his tour of Japan Máscara Dorada lost the championship to Bushi , which was officially acknowledged by CMLL .

 The Championship is designated as a welterweight title , which means that the championship can officially only be competed for by wrestlers weighing between 70 kg ( 150 lb ) and 78 kg ( 172 lb ) . In the 20th century Mexican wrestling enforced the weight divisions more strictly , but in the 21st century the rules have occasionally been ignored for the some weight divisions . The heaviest welterweight champion on record is Olímpico who was announced as weighing 92 kg ( 203 lb ) , 14 kg ( 31 lb ) above the maximum weight limit . While the heavyweight championship is traditionally considered the most prestigious weight division in professional wrestling , CMLL places more emphasis on the lower weight divisions . All title matches promoted in Mexico take place under best two @-@ out @-@ of @-@ three falls rules , while championship matches promoted in Japan followed the local custom and were only one fall matches . 
 Mephisto is the current and two @-@ time after defeating Máscara Dorada at a CMLL show in Arena Mexico May 3 , 2016 . He is the 32nd overall champion . El Felino has the longest combined reigns overall with 1 @,@ 186 days , divided over three separate reigns . Mephisto has the longest individual reign of all champions at 1 @,@ 141 days from 2004 to 2007 . The first champion , Fuerza Guerrera is also the person who 's held the title the shortest time , 22 days but the possibility exists that Mascara Magica 's second reign was shorter as no specific date for the start of the reign has be confirmed , which means his reign lasted between 6 days and 36 days .

 = Solar power = 
 Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity , either directly using photovoltaics ( PV ) , or indirectly using concentrated solar power ( CSP ) . Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam . Photovoltaics convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect . 
 The International Energy Agency projected in 2014 that under its " high renewables " scenario , by 2050 , solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent , respectively , of the worldwide electricity consumption , and solar would be the world 's largest source of electricity . Most solar installations would be in China and India . 
 Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium @-@ sized applications , from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off @-@ grid rooftop PV system . As the cost of solar electricity has fallen , the number of grid @-@ connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility @-@ scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built . Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive , low @-@ carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun . 
 Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s . The 392 MW Ivanpah installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world , located in the Mojave Desert of California . The 579 MW Solar Star , near Rosamond , California , is the world 's largest PV power station . 
 = = Mainstream technologies = = 
 Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels ( see solar power by country ) . Long distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to displace fossil fuel consumption . Solar power plants use one of two technologies : 
 Photovoltaic ( PV ) systems use solar panels , either on rooftops or in ground @-@ mounted solar farms , converting sunlight directly into electric power . 
 Concentrated solar power ( CSP , also known as " concentrated solar thermal " ) plants use solar thermal energy to make steam , that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine . 
 = = = Photovoltaics = = = 
 A solar cell , or photovoltaic cell ( PV ) , is a device that converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect . The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s . The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery . In 1931 , the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide , although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 % of incident light into electricity . Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s , researchers Gerald Pearson , Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954 . These early solar cells cost 286 USD / watt and reached efficiencies of 4 @.@ 5 – 6 % . 
 = = = = Conventional PV systems = = = = 
 The array of a photovoltaic power system , or PV system , produces direct current ( DC ) power which fluctuates with the sunlight 's intensity . For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current ( AC ) , through the use of inverters . Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules . Modules are wired together to form arrays , then tied to an inverter , which produces power at the desired voltage , and for AC , the desired frequency / phase . 
 Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available , especially in developed countries with large markets . In these grid @-@ connected PV systems , use of energy storage is optional . In certain applications such as satellites , lighthouses , or in developing countries , batteries or additional power generators are often added as back @-@ ups . Such stand @-@ alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight . 
 = = = Concentrated solar power = = = 
 Concentrated solar power ( CSP ) , also called " concentrated solar thermal " , uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam . Contrary to photovoltaics – which converts light directly into electricity – CSP uses the heat of the sun 's radiation to generate electricity from conventional steam @-@ driven turbines . 
 A wide range of concentrating technologies exists : among the best known are the parabolic trough , the compact linear Fresnel reflector , the Stirling dish and the solar power tower . Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light . In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight , and is then used for power generation or energy storage . Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24 @-@ hour electricity generation . 
 A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector 's focal line . The receiver is a tube positioned right above the middle of the parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid . The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis . <unk> trough systems provide the best land @-@ use factor of any solar technology . The SEGS plants in California and Acciona 's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City , Nevada are representatives of this technology . 
 Compact Linear Fresnel <unk> are CSP @-@ plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid . This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors , and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space , allowing more of the available sunlight to be used . Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants . 
 The Stirling solar dish combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a Stirling engine which normally drives an electric generator . The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime . <unk> dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies . The 50 kW Big Dish in Canberra , Australia is an example of this technology . 
 A solar power tower uses an array of tracking reflectors ( <unk> ) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower . Power towers are more cost effective , offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies . The <unk> Solar Power Plant and <unk> solar power plant are examples of this technology . 
 = = = = Hybrid systems = = = = 
 A hybrid system combines ( C ) PV and CSP with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel , wind and biogas . The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel . Hybrid systems are most often found on islands . 
 CPV / CSP system 
 A novel solar CPV / CSP hybrid system has been proposed , combining <unk> photovoltaics with the non @-@ PV technology of concentrated solar power , or also known as concentrated solar thermal . 
 <unk> system 
 The Hassi R <unk> power station in Algeria , is an example of combining CSP with a gas turbine , where a 25 @-@ megawatt CSP @-@ parabolic trough array supplements a much larger 130 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant . Another example is the Yazd power station in Iran . 
 PVT system 
 Hybrid PV / T ) , also known as photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy . Such a system combines a solar ( PV ) module with a solar thermal collector in an complementary way . 
 <unk> system 
 A concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid ( <unk> ) system is similar to a PVT system . It uses concentrated photovoltaics ( CPV ) instead of conventional PV technology , and combines it with a solar thermal collector . 
 PV diesel system 
 It combines a photovoltaic system with a diesel generator . Combinations with other renewables are possible and include wind turbines . 
 PV @-@ thermoelectric system 
 Thermoelectric , or " <unk> " devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current . Solar cells use only the high frequency part of the radiation , while the low frequency heat energy is wasted . Several patents about the use of thermoelectric devices in tandem with solar cells have been filed . The idea is to increase the efficiency of the combined solar / thermoelectric system to convert the solar radiation into useful electricity .

 The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce . However , development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th century in the face of the increasing availability , economy , and utility of coal and petroleum . In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems . The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies . Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan . Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States ( <unk> , now NREL ) , Japan ( <unk> ) , and Germany ( Fraunhofer – ISE ) . Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly , but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from 1984 to 1996 . 
 = = = Mid @-@ 1990s to early 2010s = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1990s , development of both , residential and commercial rooftop solar as well as utility @-@ scale photovoltaic power stations , began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas , global warming concerns , and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies . In the early 2000s , the adoption of feed @-@ in tariffs — a policy mechanism , that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity — lead to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe . 
 = = = Current status = = = 
 For several years , worldwide growth of solar PV was driven by European deployment , but has since shifted to Asia , especially China and Japan , and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world , including , but not limited to , Australia , Canada , Chile , India , Israel , Mexico , South Africa , South Korea , Thailand , and the United States . 
 Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40 % per year since 2000 and total installed capacity reached 139 GW at the end of 2013 with Germany having the most cumulative installations ( 35 @.@ 7 GW ) and Italy having the highest percentage of electricity generated by solar PV ( 7 @.@ 0 % ) . 
 Concentrated solar power ( CSP ) also started to grow rapidly , increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013 , albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar PV . As of the end of 2013 , worldwide cumulative CSP @-@ capacity reached 3 @,@ 425 MW . 
 = = = Forecasts = = = 
 In 2010 , the International Energy Agency predicted that global solar PV capacity could reach 3 @,@ 000 GW or 11 % of projected global electricity generation by 2050 — enough to generate 4 @,@ 500 TWh of electricity . Four years later , in 2014 , the agency projected that , under its " high renewables " scenario , solar power could supply 27 % of global electricity generation by 2050 ( 16 % from PV and 11 % from CSP ) . In 2015 , analysts predicted that one million homes in the U.S. will have solar power by the end of 2016 .

 The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 MW power plant in Riverside County , California , that uses thin @-@ film CdTe @-@ modules made by First Solar . As of November 2014 , the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world . This has now been surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex .

 Commercial concentrating solar power ( CSP ) plants , also called " solar thermal power stations " , were first developed in the 1980s . The 377 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility , located in California 's Mojave Desert , is the world ’ s largest solar thermal power plant project . Other large CSP plants include the Solnova Solar Power Station ( 150 MW ) , the Andasol solar power station ( 150 MW ) , and <unk> Solar Power Station ( 150 MW ) , all in Spain . The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage , allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24 @-@ hour period . Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5 pm , many CSP power plants use 3 to 5 hours of thermal storage .

 = = = Cost = = = 
 Adjusting for inflation , it cost $ 96 per watt for a solar module in the mid @-@ 1970s . Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down 99 percent , to 68 ¢ per watt in February 2016 , according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance . Palo Alto California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3 @.@ 7 cents per kilowatt @-@ hour . And in sunny Dubai large @-@ scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just $ 0 @.@ <unk> per kWh -- " competitive with any form of fossil @-@ based electricity — and cheaper than most . " 
 Photovoltaic systems use no fuel , and modules typically last 25 to 40 years . Thus , capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power . Operations and maintenance costs for new utility @-@ scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity , and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity . Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power , such as feed @-@ in tariff programs . Also , Renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs . In most states , RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar , wind , biomass , landfill gas , ocean , geothermal , municipal solid waste , hydroelectric , hydrogen , or fuel cell technologies . 
 = = = = <unk> cost of electricity = = = = 
 The PV industry is beginning to adopt levelized cost of electricity ( LCOE ) as the unit of cost . The electrical energy generated is sold in units of kilowatt @-@ hours ( kWh ) . As a rule of thumb , and depending on the local insolation , 1 watt @-@ peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2 kWh of electricity per year . This corresponds to a capacity factor of around 10 – 20 % . The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power . The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments , organized by <unk> , has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years . As a result , since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term power purchase agreement . Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90 % by 2009 . 
 Shi <unk> has said that , as of 2012 , <unk> solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India , Hawaii , Italy and Spain . He said " We are at a tipping point . No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich . They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies " . " Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015 " .

 In its 2014 edition of the Technology Roadmap : Solar Photovoltaic Energy report , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) published prices for residential , commercial and utility @-@ scale PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 ( see table below ) . However , DOE 's <unk> Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices . In 2014 , prices continued to decline . The <unk> Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of $ 1 @.@ 80 to $ 3 @.@ 29 per watt . Other sources identify similar price ranges of $ 1 @.@ 70 to $ 3 @.@ 50 for the different market segments in the U.S. , and in the highly penetrated German market , prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100 kW declined to $ 1 @.@ 36 per watt ( € 1 @.@ 24 / W ) by the end of 2014 . In 2015 , Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $ 2 @.@ 90 per watt . Costs for utility @-@ scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $ 1 @.@ 00 per watt . 
 = = = Grid parity = = = 
 Grid parity , the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power , is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan . In 2008 , The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $ 0 @.@ 25 / kWh or less in most of the OECD countries . By late 2011 , the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $ 0 @.@ 15 / kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $ 0 @.@ 10 / kWh in sunnier regions . These cost levels are driving three emerging trends : vertical integration of the supply chain , origination of power purchase agreements ( <unk> ) by solar power companies , and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies , grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers . 
 Grid parity was first reached in Spain in 2013 , Hawaii and other islands that otherwise use fossil fuel ( diesel fuel ) to produce electricity , and most of the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015 . 
 In 2007 , General Electric 's Chief Engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015 ; other companies predicted an earlier date : the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10 % of commercial customers in the OECD , as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010 . 
 = = = Self consumption = = = 
 In cases of self consumption of the solar energy , the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid . For example , in Germany , with electricity prices of 0 @.@ 25 Euro / KWh and insolation of 900 KWh / KW , one <unk> will save 225 Euro per year , and with an installation cost of 1700 Euro / <unk> the system cost will be returned in less than 7 years . However , in many cases , the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide , and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid . The electricity is sold , and at other times when energy is taken from the grid , electricity is bought . The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics . 
 = = = Energy pricing and incentives = = = 
 The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small @-@ scale deployment to begin to grow the industry , even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity , to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity . The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence , high tech job creation and reduction of CO2 emissions . Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies : the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system , the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate ( ) , and Solar Renewable Energy Certificates ( SRECs ) 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 With investment subsidies , the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer , while with feed @-@ in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities ' customer bases . While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer , the main argument in favour of feed @-@ in tariffs is the encouragement of quality . Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time , thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance . Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers , such as Austin Energy in Texas , which offers $ 2 @.@ 50 / watt installed up to $ 15 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = = Net metering = = = = 
 In net metering the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer , and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption . Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters , which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference , and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption , effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery . With net metering , deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month . Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits . Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost , or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above , as can be excess annual credits . In New Jersey , annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate , as are left over credits when a customer terminates service . 
 = = = = Feed @-@ in tariffs ( FIT ) = = = = 
 With feed @-@ in tariffs , the financial burden falls upon the consumer . They reward the number of kilowatt @-@ hours produced over a long period of time , but because the rate is set by the authorities , it may result in perceived <unk> . The price paid per kilowatt @-@ hour under a feed @-@ in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity . Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged . 
 The complexity of approvals in California , Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better . In some countries , additional incentives are offered for <unk> compared to stand alone PV . 
 France + EUR 0 @.@ 16 / kWh ( compared to semi @-@ integrated ) or + EUR 0 @.@ 27 / kWh ( compared to stand alone ) 
 Italy + EUR 0 @.@ 04 @-@ 0 @.@ 09 kWh 
 Germany + EUR 0 @.@ 05 / kWh ( facades only ) 
 = = = = Solar Renewable Energy Credits ( SRECs ) = = = = 
 Alternatively , SRECs allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity <unk> . In this mechanism , a renewable energy production or consumption target is set , and the utility ( more technically the Load Serving Entity ) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine ( Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP ) . The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1 @,@ 000 kWh of electricity produced . If the utility buys this SREC and retires it , they avoid paying the ACP . In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy , since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations . Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long @-@ term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre @-@ sell and hedge their credits . 
 Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries , including Australia , China , Germany , Israel , Japan , and the United States and even across states within the US . 
 The Japanese government through its Ministry of International Trade and Industry ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003 . By the end of 2004 , Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1 @.@ 1 GW . 
 In 2004 , the German government introduced the first large @-@ scale feed @-@ in tariff system , under the German Renewable Energy Act , which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany . At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price . The principle behind the German system is a 20 @-@ year flat rate contract . The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year , in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users . The programme has been more successful than expected with over <unk> installed in 2006 , and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers . 
 Subsequently , Spain , Italy , Greece — that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar @-@ thermal installations for hot water needs — and France introduced feed @-@ in tariffs . None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though , making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries . The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium ( EUR 0 @.@ 55 / kWh ) for building integrated systems . California , Greece , France and Italy have 30 @-@ 50 % more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive . The Greek domestic " solar roof " programme ( adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10 kW ) has internal rates of return of 10 @-@ 15 % at current commercial installation costs , which , furthermore , is tax free . 
 In 2006 California approved the ' California Solar Initiative ' , offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems . The small @-@ system FIT of $ 0 @.@ 39 per kWh ( far less than EU countries ) expires in just 5 years , and the alternate " <unk> " residential investment incentive is modest , averaging perhaps 20 % of cost . All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed . 
 At the end of 2006 , the Ontario Power Authority ( OPA , Canada ) began its Standard Offer Program , a precursor to the Green Energy Act , and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10 MW . The feed @-@ in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $ 0 @.@ 42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years . Unlike net metering , all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate .

 Unlike fossil fuel based technologies , solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation , but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution . 
 = = = Greenhouse gases = = = 
 The Life @-@ cycle greenhouse @-@ gas emissions of solar power are in the range of 22 to 46 gram ( g ) per kilowatt @-@ hour ( kWh ) depending on if solar thermal or solar PV is being analyzed , respectively . With this potentially being decreased to 15 g / kWh in the future . For comparison ( of weighted averages ) , a combined cycle gas @-@ fired power plant emits some 400 – 599 g / kWh , an oil @-@ fired power plant 893 g / kWh , a coal @-@ fired power plant 915 – 994 g / kWh or with carbon capture and storage some 200 g / kWh , and a geothermal high @-@ <unk> power plant 91 – 122 g / kWh . The life cycle emission intensity of hydro , wind and nuclear power are lower than solar 's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC , and discussed in the article Life @-@ cycle greenhouse @-@ gas emissions of energy sources . Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase , the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions . BP Solar owns two factories built by <unk> ( one in Maryland , the other in Virginia ) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels . A 1 @-@ kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal , 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere , and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly . 
 The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) , in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life @-@ cycle GHG emissions for solar PV , found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site : GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation . For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh / m2 / year , typical of southern Europe , NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45 <unk> / kWh . Using the same assumptions , at Phoenix , USA , with insolation of 2400 kWh / m2 / year , the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32 g of <unk> / kWh . 
 The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment found that the solar PV would have little impact on the country 's greenhouse gas emissions . The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources ( primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal ) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons , meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil @-@ fueled power plants . 
 = = = Energy payback = = = 
 The energy payback time ( <unk> ) of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system . Due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market . In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 5 years for crystalline silicon silicon PV systems and 1 – 1 @.@ 5 years for thin film technologies ( S. Europe ) . These figures fell to 0 @.@ 75 – 3 @.@ 5 years in 2013 , with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems . 
 Another economic measure , closely related to the energy payback time , is the energy returned on energy invested ( EROEI ) or energy return on investment ( <unk> ) , which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment . ( This is not the same as the economic return on investment ( ROI ) , which varies according to local energy prices , subsidies available and metering techniques . ) With expected lifetimes of 30 years , the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30 , thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times ( 6 @-@ 31 reproductions ) depending on what type of material , balance of system ( BOS ) , and the geographic location of the system .

 One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of cadmium ( Cd ) , a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains . It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS . The amount of cadmium used in thin @-@ film PV modules is relatively small ( 5 – 10 g / m ² ) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero . Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 9 microgram / kWh over the whole life @-@ cycle . Most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules , and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium . Life @-@ cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3 @.@ 1 microgram / kWh , lignite 6 @.@ 2 , and natural gas 0 @.@ 2 microgram / kWh . 
 In a life @-@ cycle analysis it has been noted , that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal , cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated . 
 In the case of crystalline silicon modules , the solder material , that joins together the copper strings of the cells , contains about 36 percent of lead ( Pb ) . Moreover , the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well . It is estimated , that about 1 @,@ 000 metric tonnes of Pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c @-@ Si solar modules . However , there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy . 
 Some media sources have reported that concentrated solar power plants have injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat from the concentrated sunrays . This adverse effect does not apply to PV solar power plants , and some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated .

 Concentrator photovoltaics ( CPV ) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electrical power production . Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems , it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small , but highly efficient , multi @-@ junction solar cells . Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used , and these are often mounted on a solar tracker in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky . <unk> solar concentrators ( when combined with a PV @-@ solar cell ) can also be regarded as a CPV system . Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV @-@ solar panels drastically . 
 In addition , most solar panels on spacecraft are also made of high efficient multi @-@ junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in the inner Solar System .

 <unk> are an emerging form of PV systems that float on the surface of irrigation canals , water reservoirs , quarry lakes , and tailing ponds . Several systems exist in France , India , Japan , Korea , the United Kingdom and the United States . These systems reduce the need of valuable land area , save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation , and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion , as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land . 
 = = Grid integration = = 
 Since solar energy is not available at night , storing its energy is an important issue in order to have continuous energy availability . Both wind power and solar power are variable renewable energy , meaning that all available output must be taken when it is available , and either stored for when it can be used later , or transported over transmission lines to where it can be used now . Concentrated solar power plants typically use thermal energy storage to store the solar energy , such as in high @-@ temperature molten salts . These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low @-@ cost , have a high specific heat capacity , and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems . This method of energy storage is used , for example , by the Solar Two power station , allowing it to store 1 @.@ 44 TJ in its 68 m ³ storage tank , enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours , with an efficiency of about 99 % . 
 <unk> batteries have been traditionally used to store excess electricity in stand alone PV systems . With grid @-@ connected photovoltaic power system , excess electricity can be sent to the electrical grid . Net metering and feed @-@ in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce . This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand , effectively using the grid as a storage mechanism . Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually . When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power , other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately , but as these forms of variable power grow , this becomes less practical . As prices are rapidly declining , PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night . Batteries used for grid @-@ storage also stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads , and play an important role in a smart grid , as they can charge during periods of low demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is high . 
 Common battery technologies used in today 's PV systems include , the valve regulated lead @-@ acid battery – a modified version of the conventional lead – acid battery , nickel – cadmium and lithium @-@ ion batteries . Lead @-@ acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small @-@ scale , residential PV systems , due to their high reliability , low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs , despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density . However , lithium @-@ ion batteries have the potential to replace lead @-@ acid batteries in the near future , as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the <unk> 1 . In addition , the Li @-@ ion batteries of plug @-@ in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle @-@ to @-@ grid system . Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time , their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back . Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include , sodium – sulfur and vanadium redox batteries , two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery , respectively . 
 Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with variable electricity sources such as solar and wind , the water can be held back and allowed to flow as required with virtually no energy loss . Where a suitable river is not available , pumped @-@ storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when surplus electricity is available , from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one . The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water : the pump becomes a turbine , and the motor a hydroelectric power generator . However , this loses some of the energy to <unk> losses . 
 The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year . The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems . Solar power is seasonal , particularly in northern / southern climates , away from the equator , suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen . The storage requirements vary and in some cases can be met with biomass . The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot @-@ tested a combined power plant linking solar , wind , biogas and <unk> to provide load @-@ following power around the clock , entirely from renewable sources . 
 Research is also undertaken in this field of artificial photosynthesis . It involves the use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds , by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol . Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture , quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions . Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues .

 Different parts of the world experience different amounts of sunshine , depending on latitude and weather . Locations nearer the equator receive many more hours of sunshine than those further north or south , thus photovoltaic panels can be more economically desirable in some places more than others .

 LACM 149371 ( Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County specimen 149371 ) is an enigmatic fossil mammalian tooth from the Paleogene ( 66 to 23 million years ago , mya ) of Peru . It is from the Santa Rosa fossil site , which is of uncertain age but possibly late Eocene ( 55 to 34 mya ) or Oligocene ( 34 to 23 mya ) . The tooth is poorly preserved and may have been degraded by acidic water or because it passed through a predator 's digestive tract . Its largest dimension is 2 @.@ 65 mm . It is triangular in shape and bears six cusps that surround the middle of the tooth , where there are three basins ( fossae ) . Crests connects the cusps and separate the fossae . The microscopic structure of the enamel is poorly preserved . 
 LACM 149371 was described in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues , who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar . Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates , some early rodents , and multituberculates , they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere . Among gondwanatheres — a small and poorly known group otherwise known from the Cretaceous through Eocene of some of the southern continents ( Gondwana ) — they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar . 
 = = Discovery and context = = 
 LACM 149371 was discovered in 1998 at the Santa Rosa fossil site in the Ucayali Region of Peru . The Santa Rosa fauna also contains fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents , a possible bat , and some <unk> . The fauna was published in a volume of the Science Series of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in 2004 , which included a paper by Francisco Goin and colleagues that described and discussed LACM 149371 . 
 The age of the Santa Rosa fauna remains highly uncertain , as the outcrop where the fossils were found cannot easily be placed in a known <unk> unit , and the fossils are so distinct from other known fossil faunas that biostratigraphy cannot provide a precise estimate . In a summary of the 2004 volume , Kenneth Campbell tentatively referred Santa Rosa to the <unk> South American Land Mammal Age ( <unk> ) , which he placed near the Eocene – Oligocene boundary , around 35 million years ago . However , Mario <unk> and colleagues suggested in 2010 that the Santa Rosa fauna may be substantially later — perhaps as young as the <unk> <unk> ( late Oligocene , around 25 million years ago ) . According to Campbell , the Santa Rosa mammals likely lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers .

This suggests the tooth may have been chemically degraded , perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator . The roots are broken off , but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots , which are partially joined into two pairs . A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root . 
 The crown of the tooth is triangular and contains six cusps , connected by low crests , that surround two prominent , low @-@ lying fossae ( basins ) and a third , smaller fossa . Because of the complexity of the crown , Goin and colleagues interpreted it as a molar ; because of the number of roots , the arrangement of the cusps , and the shape of the tooth , as an upper molar ; and because it tapers towards the end , as a last molar . One side , the longest , is flat and low compared to the others , suggesting it is the labial ( outer ) face . This would imply that the tooth is from the left jaw . Under this interpretation , the length of the tooth is 2 @.@ 65 mm , width is 2 @.@ 20 mm , height at the labial side is 1 @.@ 05 mm , and height at the lingual side is 1 @.@ 30 mm . 
 For convenience , Goin and colleagues designated the six cusps as A through F : A on the front labial corner of the tooth ; B on the labial face ; C on the back corner ; D on the lingual ( inner ) face ; E on the front lingual corner ; and F on the front face . The large front fossa is located between cusps A , B , D , E , and F ; the smaller intermediate fossa is between cusps B and D ; and the much smaller back fossa is just in front of cusp C. All three are nearly round . Cusp A , the largest cusp , is triangular in shape and is separated from the smaller , rounded B by a deep valley ; a low crest connects the two cusps further lingually , separating the valley from the front fossa . At its back , B connects to a long crest that reaches the back fossa and behind it the small cusp C , which has a groove on its labial side . A valley separates it from cusp D. D itself is crest @-@ shaped and forms the lingual wall of the intermediate fossa ; it is described as " very odd " , and may in fact consist of two fused , triangular cusps . A crest issuing from D separates the back from the intermediate fossa , and another , larger crest separates the front from the back fossa and nearly reaches cusp B. Cusp E is triangular and separated from cusps F and D by valleys , which are bordered internally by crests connecting the cusps . F is rounded . The microstructure of the tooth enamel is not clearly recognizable , evidently because the tooth is degraded , though structures resembling enamel prisms ( bundles of hydroxyapatite <unk> ) and Hunter @-@ Schreger bands are recognizable . 
 = = Identity = = 
 Because of the complexity of the crown , Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal ; although some non @-@ mammalian groups , like crocodylians , may have complex teeth , none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371 . They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes , metatherians including marsupials , xenarthrans , and some related groups . They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates , but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate . There are also some resemblances to the early rodents <unk> from Asia and <unk> from North America , but <unk> has a central groove and lacks fossae , and <unk> has a prominent cingulum ( shelf ) at the edges of the tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371 . 
 The tooth resembles multituberculates — a large group of extinct mammals with many @-@ cusped teeth — in the shapes of the valleys and crests , but multituberculates lack fossae and usually have quadrangular teeth with two longitudinal rows of cusps separated by a central valley . In the same features , LACM 149371 resembles gondwanatheres , a small and enigmatic group of mammals from the Cretaceous through Eocene of the southern ( Gondwanan ) continents that may be related to multituberculates . In particular , Ferugliotherium from the late Cretaceous of Argentina has similarly formed cusps and also has crests that connect the cusps to the center of the tooth . However , the upper molars are unknown , and the low @-@ crowned teeth of Ferugliotherium lack deep fossae . Members of the higher @-@ crowned gondwanathere family Sudamericidae do have fossae . Goin and colleagues conclude that LACM 149371 most likely represents a member of the gondwanathere family Ferugliotheriidae ; if so , it would be among the youngest known gondwanatheres . 
 = Disappearance of Natalee Holloway = 
 Natalee Ann Holloway ( born October 21 , 1986 ) was an American teenager who disappeared on May 30 , 2005 , while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba , a Dutch island in the Caribbean . Holloway lived in Mountain Brook , Alabama , at the time of her disappearance , and graduated from Mountain Brook High School on May 24 , 2005 , shortly before the trip . Her disappearance caused a media sensation in the United States and remains unsolved . 
 Holloway was scheduled to fly home on May 30 , but failed to appear for her flight . She was last seen by her classmates outside Carlos 'n Charlie 's , a chain restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad , in a car with locals Joran van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe . When questioned , the three men said they dropped Holloway off at her hotel and denied knowing what became of her . Upon further investigation by authorities , Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times . Due to lack of evidence the three men were released without charge each time . 
 With the help of hundreds of volunteers , Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search for Holloway . Special Agents from the FBI , fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially equipped Dutch Air Force F @-@ 16 aircraft participated in the search . In addition to the ground search , divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway 's body . It was never found . On December 18 , 2007 , Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made against the former suspects . The Aruban prosecutor 's office reopened the case on February 1 , 2008 , after receiving video footage of Joran van der Sloot , under the influence of marijuana , saying that Holloway died on the morning of May 30 , 2005 , and that a friend had disposed of her body . Van der Sloot later denied that what he said was true , and in an interview with Greta Van Susteren ( the contents of which he later retracted ) said that he sold Holloway into slavery . 
 Holloway 's parents criticized Aruban police for a lack of rigor in the investigation and questioning of the three men last seen with her . The family also called for a boycott of Aruba , which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley 's support but failed to gain widespread backing . On January 12 , 2012 , an Alabama judge declared Holloway legally dead . 
 = = Background = = 
 Natalee Ann Holloway was the first of two children born to David Edward ( " Dave " ) and Elizabeth Ann Reynolds ( " Beth " ) Holloway in Clinton , Mississippi . Her parents divorced in 1993 , and she and her younger brother Matthew were raised by their mother . In 2000 , Elizabeth Holloway married George " Jug " Twitty , a prominent Alabama businessman , and Natalee moved to Mountain Brook , Alabama . Natalee Holloway graduated with honors from Mountain Brook High School . She was a member of the National Honor Society , her school dance squad , and was a participant in other extracurricular activities . Holloway was to attend the University of Alabama on a full scholarship , where she planned to pursue a pre @-@ med track . At the time of the disappearance , Dave Holloway was an insurance agent for State Farm Insurance in Meridian , Mississippi , while Beth Twitty was employed by the Mountain Brook School System .

 On Thursday , May 26 , 2005 , Holloway and 124 fellow graduates of Mountain Brook High School , located in a wealthy suburb of Birmingham , Alabama , arrived in Aruba for a five @-@ day , unofficial graduation trip . The graduates were accompanied by seven chaperones . According to teacher and chaperone Bob Plummer , the chaperones met with the students each day to ensure nothing was wrong . Jodi Bearman , who organized the trip , stated , " the chaperones were not supposed to keep up with their every move " . Police Commissioner Gerold Dompig , who headed the investigation from mid @-@ 2005 until 2006 , described the behavior of the Mountain Brook students , stating there was " wild partying , a lot of drinking , lots of room switching every night . We know the Holiday Inn told them they weren 't welcome next year . Natalee , we know , she drank all day every day . We have statements she started every morning with cocktails — so much drinking that Natalee didn 't show up for breakfast two mornings " . Two of Holloway 's classmates , Liz Cain and Claire Fierman , " agreed that the drinking was kind of excessive " . 
 Holloway was last seen by her classmates leaving the Aruban bar and night club Carlos 'n Charlie 's around 1 : 30 a.m. on Monday , May 30 . Holloway left with 17 @-@ year @-@ old Joran van der Sloot , a Dutch honors student living in Aruba and attending the International School of Aruba , and his two Surinamese friends , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Deepak Kalpoe and 18 @-@ year @-@ old Satish Kalpoe , in Deepak Kalpoe 's car . Holloway , who had been scheduled to fly home later on May 30 , did not appear for her return flight , and her packed luggage and passport were found in her Holiday Inn room . Aruban authorities initiated searches for Holloway throughout the island and surrounding waters but did not find her .

 On May 30 , 2005 , immediately following Holloway 's missed flight , Jug and Beth Twitty traveled to Aruba with friends by private jet . Within four hours of landing in Aruba , the Twittys presented the Aruban police with the name and address of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub . Beth Twitty has stated that Van der Sloot 's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn , who supposedly recognized him on a videotape . The Twittys and their friends , with two Aruban policemen , went to the Van der Sloot home looking for Holloway . Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway 's name , but he then told the following story , with which Deepak Kalpoe , who was present , agreed : Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because Holloway wanted to see sharks , before dropping Holloway off at her hotel around 2 : 00 a.m. According to Van der Sloot , Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused Van der Sloot 's help . He stated that she was then approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards as the young men drove away . 
 Searches for Holloway began immediately afterwards . Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined the search . During the first days of the search , the Aruban government gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the search . Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline . Aruban banks raised $ 20 @,@ 000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams . Beth Twitty was provided with housing , initially at the Holiday Inn where she stayed in her daughter 's former room . She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel 's presidential suite . 
 Reports indicate Holloway did not appear on any security camera footage from her hotel 's lobby during the course of the night ; however , Beth Twitty has made varying statements as to whether the cameras were actually working that night . According to an April 19 , 2006 , statement made by her , the security cameras at the Holiday Inn were not working the night Holloway vanished . Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working , and has stated so in her book . In any event , according to Police Commissioner Jan van der Straten , initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement , Holloway did not have to go through the lobby to return to her room . 
 The search for physical evidence was extensive and , on occasion , subject to false leads ; for example , a possible blood sample taken from Deepak Kalpoe 's car was tested but determined not to be blood . 
 There was heavy involvement by American law enforcement from the early days of the investigation . United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated to reporters that the United States was in constant contact with Aruban authorities . Another State Department official indicated , " Substantial resources are being applied to this as they [ Aruba officials ] continue to ask for more " . 
 = = = 2005 arrests = = = 
 On June 5 , Aruban police detained Nick John and Abraham Jones , former security guards from the nearby Allegro Hotel which was then closed for renovation , on suspicion of murder and kidnapping . The initial reason for their arrests has never been officially disclosed ; however , according to news accounts , the Van der Sloot and Kalpoe statements may have been a factor in the arrests . Reports also indicate that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women , and at least one of them had a prior incident with law enforcement . John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged . 
 On June 9 , 2005 , Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Holloway . Aruban law allows for arrest on serious suspicion from investigators ; to continue holding the suspect in custody , an increasing evidential burden must be met at periodic reviews . According to Dompig , the focus was on these three suspects from the " get @-@ go " . Aruba police corps chief Gerald Dompig stated that surveillance of the three began three days after Holloway was reported missing , and included surveillance , telephone wire taps , and even monitoring of their e @-@ mail . Dompig indicated pressure from Holloway 's family caused them to stop their surveillance prematurely and to detain the three suspects . 
 As the investigation continued , on June 11 , David Cruz , spokesman for the Aruban Minister of Justice , indicated that Natalee Holloway was dead and authorities knew the location of her body . Cruz later retracted the statement , saying he was a victim of a " misinformation campaign " . That evening , Dompig alleged to the Associated Press that one of the detained young men admitted " something bad happened " to Holloway after the suspects took her to the beach , and that the suspect was leading police to the scene . The next morning prosecution spokeswoman Vivian van der Biezen refused to confirm or deny the allegation , simply stating that the investigation was at a " very crucial , very important moment " . 
 On Friday , June 17 , a fourth person , later identified as disc jockey Steve Gregory Croes , was also arrested . Van der Straten told the media that " Croes was detained based on information from one of the other three detainees " . On June 22 Aruban police detained Paulus van der Sloot , Joran van der Sloot 's father , for questioning ; Paulus van der Sloot was arrested that same day . Both Paulus van der Sloot and Croes were ordered to be released on June 26 . 
 During this period the remaining detained suspects ' stories changed . All three suspects indicated that Van der Sloot and Holloway were dropped off at the Marriott Hotel beach near the fishermen 's huts . Van der Sloot stated that he did not harm Holloway , but left her on the beach . According to Satish Kalpoe 's attorney , David Kock , Van der Sloot called Deepak Kalpoe to tell the latter that he was walking home , and sent him a text message forty minutes later . 
 At some time during the interrogation Van der Sloot detailed a third account , that he was dropped off at home and Holloway was driven off by the Kalpoe brothers . Dompig discounted the story , stating : 
 This latest story [ came ] when [ Van der Sloot ] saw the other guys , the Kalpoes , were kind of finger @-@ pointing in his direction , and he wanted to screw them also , by saying he was dropped off . But that story doesn 't check out at all . He just wanted to screw Deepak . They had great arguments about this in front of the judge . Because their stories didn 't match . This girl , she was from Alabama , she 's not going to stay in the car with two black kids . We believe the second story , that they were dropped off by the Marriott . 
 On Monday , July 4 , following hearings before a judge , Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released , but Joran van der Sloot was detained for an additional sixty days . 
 = = = Continued search , suspects rearrested and released again = = = 
 On July 4 , the Royal Netherlands Air Force deployed three F @-@ 16 aircraft equipped with infrared sensors to aid in the search , without initial result . In March 2006 it was reported that satellite photos were being compared with photographs taken more recently ( presumably from the F @-@ 16s ) in an attempt to find unexpected shifts of ground that might be Holloway 's grave . 
 A small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between July 27 and 30 , 2005 , after an individual ( " the gardener " ) came forward . According to Jug Twitty , the gardener claimed to have seen Joran van der Sloot attempting to hide his face , driving into the Racquet Club with the two Kalpoes on the morning of May 30 between 2 : 30 a.m. and 3 : 00 a.m. Nancy Grace described the gardener as " the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open " . Another person , " the jogger " , claimed to have seen men burying a blonde @-@ haired woman in a landfill during the afternoon of May 30 . The police had searched the landfill in the days following Holloway 's disappearance . The landfill was searched three times after the jogger 's statements , including a search by the FBI with cadaver dogs . The searches were fruitless . 
 On July 25 , 2005 , the reward for Holloway 's safe return was increased from $ 200 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , with a $ 100 @,@ 000 reward for information leading to the location of her remains . Following Holloway 's disappearance , a reward of $ 50 @,@ 000 had been established for her return . In August 2005 , the reward for information as to her remains was increased from $ 100 @,@ 000 to $ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 The FBI announced that Aruban authorities had provided it with documents , suspect interviews , and other evidence . A group from the Aruban police and prosecutor 's office traveled to the FBI central laboratory at Quantico , Virginia , to consult with American investigators . After a piece of duct tape was found with strands of blond hair attached to it , samples were tested both at a Dutch lab and at Quantico . The FBI announced that the hair was not Holloway 's . 
 The Kalpoe brothers were rearrested on August 26 along with another new suspect . According to his lawyer , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Freddy <unk> was suspected of taking photographs of and having physical contact with an underage girl , an incident which allegedly occurred before the Holloway disappearance and in which <unk> 's friends Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were supposedly involved . Van der Sloot 's mother , Anita van der Sloot , stated , " It 's a desperate attempt to get the boys to talk . But there is nothing to talk about " . While no public explanation was then made for the Kalpoe rearrests , Dompig later said that it was an unsuccessful attempt to pressure the Kalpoe brothers into confessing . 
 On September 3 , 2005 , all four of the detained suspects were released by a judge despite the attempts of the prosecution to keep them in custody , on the condition that they remain available to police . On September 14 , all restrictions on them were removed by the Combined Appeals Court of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba . 
 In the months following his release , Joran van der Sloot gave several interviews , expanding upon his version of events , most notably a lengthy interview for Fox News , which aired over three nights in March 2006 . During the interview , Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted to have sex with him , but he did not because he did not have a condom . Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach , but that he had to go to school in the morning . According to Van der Sloot , he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3 : 00 am , leaving Holloway sitting on the beach . In August 2005 , David Kock , Satish Kalpoe 's attorney , stated that his client had gone to sleep , and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home . Van der Sloot stated he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach , albeit by her own request , and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced Holloway would soon turn up . 
 The FBI and Aruban authorities interviewed ( or in some cases , re @-@ interviewed ) several of Holloway 's fellow graduates in the United States in January 2006 . On January 17 , 2006 , Aruban police searched sand dunes on the northwest coast of Aruba in search of Holloway 's body , as well as areas close by the Marriott beach . Additional searches took place in March and April 2006 , without result . 
 Shortly before leaving the case , Dompig gave an interview to CBS correspondent Troy Roberts , which was broadcast on March 25 , 2006 . In that interview , Dompig stated that he believes Holloway probably died from self @-@ consumed alcohol and / or drug poisoning , was not murdered , and that someone later hid her body . Dompig also stated that Aruba had spent about $ 3 million on the investigation , about 40 % of the police operational budget . Dompig indicated that there is evidence that points to possession ( though not necessarily use ) of drugs by Holloway . Members of her family have denied drug use by Holloway . 
 On April 11 , 2006 , Dave Holloway published his book recounting the search for his daughter , co @-@ authored with R. Stephanie Good and Larry Garrison , Aruba : The Tragic Untold Story of Natalee Holloway and Corruption in Paradise .

 On April 15 , 2006 , Geoffrey von <unk> was arrested by Aruban authorities on suspicion of criminal offenses related to dealing in illegal narcotics that , according to the prosecutor , might have been related to the disappearance of Holloway . At his first court appearance , his detention was extended for eight days . However , Von <unk> was released on April 25 , 2006 . In addition , another individual with initials " A.B. " was arrested on April 22 , 2006 , but was released the same day .
