 The Naroda Patiya massacre took place on 28 February 2002 at Naroda , in Ahmedabad , India , during the 2002 Gujarat riots . 97 Muslims were killed by a mob of approximately 5 @,@ 000 people , organised by the Bajrang Dal , a militant wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad , and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party which was in power in the Gujarat State Government . The massacre at Naroda occurred during the bandh ( strike protest ) called by Vishwa Hindu Parishad ; a day after the Godhra train burning . During the post @-@ Godhra rioting , which lasted over 10 hours , during which the mob looted , stabbed , sexually assaulted , gang @-@ raped and burnt people individually and in groups . After the conflict , a curfew was imposed in the state and army troops were called in to contain further violence . 
 The communal violence at Naroda was deemed " the largest single case of mass murder " during the 2002 Gujarat riots ; it accounted for the greatest number of deaths during a single event . Survivors faced socio @-@ economic problems ; many were left homeless , orphaned and injured . A number of shrines were destroyed and many schools were adversely affected , cancelled exams or closed entirely . The surviving victims were given shelter in relief camps provided by both the state and central government , and efforts were begun to restore destroyed properties and shrines . The state government formed a " Gujarat state commission of inquiry " for citizens to have a forum in which to make recommendations and suggest reforms . Mainstream media criticised the Gujarat government 's handling of the riots ; it was remarked that a number of reports were exaggerated , and " inflammatory headlines , stories and pictures " were published , resulting in anti @-@ Muslim prejudice among the Hindu readership . 
 Allegations were made against the state police , state government and the chief minister Narendra Modi , citing that government authorities were involved and various police personnel played a role in the massacre : a number of eyewitnesses reported police officers favouring the mob by allegedly injuring or killing Muslims and damaging public and private property . All allegations were proved to be false and the government and police were cleared of wrongdoing by a Special Investigation Team . The initial report on the case was filed by the Gujarat police , accusing 46 people , all of whom the Special Court deemed unreliable . In 2008 , the Supreme Court of India formed a Special Investigation Team to investigate the case . In 2009 , the team submitted its report , which accused 70 people of wrongdoing , 61 of whom were charged . On 29 August 2012 , the Special Court convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 due to insufficient evidence . Among those convicted were Maya Kodnani – former Cabinet Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat and former Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Naroda – who was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment , and Bajrang Dal 's Babu Bajrangi , who received a life sentence . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 27 February 2002 , the Godhra train burning incident initiated a series of riots in Gujarat . Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya on the Sabarmati Express train were attacked and the train , which had stopped at Godhra station , was set on fire causing the death of 58 Hindus including 25 women and 15 children – activists of Vishva Hindu Parishad and Kar <unk> . Following the attack , false rumours were spread by a senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader that Muslims had kidnapped three Hindu girls during the incident . Retaliatory attacks on Muslims began the same evening ; a number of incidents in which Muslims were attacked and killed were reported in various cities in Gujarat before the Naroda incident . The first attacks on the Muslim community occurred at Ahmedabad , where Hindu mobs began throwing stones and later burnt <unk> Society , a Muslim housing complex . The initial violence was believed to be instigated by the unsubstantiated rumours about Muslims kidnapping three Hindu girls . Violence spread to the largely rural districts of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Junagadh , <unk> , Patan , Anand and Narmada the next day . 
 = = The massacre = = 
 At the time of the riots Naroda Patiya and Naroda Gam – a suburb 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) from Naroda Patiya ; both of which constitute the municipality of Naroda – located in Gujarat 's largest city , Ahmedabad , had around 2 @,@ 000 daily wage @-@ earning Muslim inhabitants , and many immigrants from Karnataka and Maharashtra . On the evening of 27 February 2002 , Vishwa Hindu Parishad declared a statewide strike in response to the Godhra train burning incident , starting from 28 February . On the first day of the strike , a mob of approximately 5 @,@ 000 people , allegedly led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Bajrang Dal , attacked and attempted to burn the entire Muslim community of Naroda Patiya . The rioting began at 9 am when the Noorani Mosque was destroyed by exploding liquified petroleum gas ( LPG ) cylinders . 
 Cases of hacking , looting , stabbing and sexual assaults including public gang @-@ rapes in which the victims were burnt , were reported . Many people were burnt alive , individually or in groups by " chasing them into huge pits " and setting fire to them using LPG cylinders . Burnt bodies were also thrown in a dry well . Women and girls were sexually assaulted , raped and killed by burning or by stabbing . Maya Kodnani , Babu Bajrangi and a few others supplied weapons to the crowd , and Suresh Chara and others raped and killed women . LPG cylinders were used to destroy a number of buildings in the residential and working areas . The massacre lasted for over 10 hours and finally a curfew was imposed in 27 towns and cities across Gujarat . 
 Most of the homes of Muslims in Naroda were burnt while Hindu homes remained undamaged . As the riots ended , it was estimated that around 125 people had been killed in the violence . After the rioting , 94 bodies were recovered ; three more people were reported missing and were later declared dead . More than 30 people were found injured . The dead – all Muslims – comprised 36 women , 35 children and 26 men . The incident is considered to be the " most gruesome of all post @-@ Godhra violent incidents " and " the largest single case of mass murders " , and claimed the highest number of lives of all the events during the Gujarat riots . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By the evening of 28 February , a curfew was imposed in 27 towns and cities of the state in an attempt to curb the violence . Over the next two days , Bharuch , Rajkot and later Surat were hit . Approximately 151 towns and 993 villages in 16 of the state 's 25 districts were affected by the post @-@ Godhra violence , which was particularly severe in six districts . The violence raged heavily between 28 February and 3 March 2002 , slowed briefly , then restarted on 15 March and continued until mid @-@ June . Northern and central Gujarat and the north @-@ eastern tribal belt – which are closer to Godhra City – were the worst affected while Saurashtra and Kutch remained relatively peaceful . 1 @,@ 000 army troops were flown in by the evening of 1 March to restore order . Intelligence officials alleged that the state government deliberately delayed the deployment . On 3 May , former Punjab police chief Kanwar Pal Singh Gill was appointed as security adviser to Modi . The Gujarat government transferred several senior police officers , who had taken steps to contain and investigate violent attacks , to administrative positions . 
 According to an official estimate , 1 @,@ 044 people were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots – 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus . Another 223 people were reported missing , 2 @,@ 548 were injured , 919 women were widowed and 606 children were orphaned . When people missing after the riots were declared dead after seven years , total deaths rose from 1 @,@ 044 to 1 @,@ 267 Unofficial estimates put the death toll closer to 5 @,@ 000 , with Muslims forming the majority . Police records say that 298 <unk> , 205 mosques , 17 temples and three churches were damaged during the riots . 
 Opposition parties and three coalition partners of the Bharatiya Janata Party @-@ led central government demanded the dismissal of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for failing to contain the violence , with some calling for the removal of Union Home Minister L. K. Advani as well . On 18 July 2002 , Modi asked the governor of Gujarat , Sunder Singh Bhandari , to dissolve the state assembly and call fresh elections . The Indian Election Commission ruled out early elections , citing the prevailing law and order situation , a decision the union government unsuccessfully appealed against in the Supreme Court . Elections were held in December and Modi returned to power .

 Residents left homeless by the massacre were given shelter in relief camps constructed by the state government . On 16 March 2002 , the state government formed an all @-@ party committee consisting of 13 member and chaired by Bhandari to provide relief and rehabilitation to the victims of the riots . Modi proposed to close the camps by the end of March but later decided not to close them . Under pressure from the opposition party , the Indian National Congress , the all @-@ party committee reached a consensus to implement rehabilitation measures suggested by various non @-@ governmental organisations which were to aid people to build houses .

 A number of children were killed , injured or orphaned by the violence . Organisations such as Citizens ' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the disturbance of children 's studies and that there was a lack of counselling . Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations , which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption . While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams , it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection . It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income @-@ earning members of their families . 
 = = = Restoration of shrines = = = 
 A number of <unk> , including a 500 @-@ year @-@ old heritage masjid in <unk> , and many mosques in Naroda were destroyed in the rioting . In 2003 , a petition was filed in Gujarat High Court by advocate Yusuf <unk> on behalf of the Islamic Relief Committee , asking the court to direct the state to restore the religious shrines destroyed during the violence . In response to the petition , the Gujarat government stated that , " as a secular state , they cannot aid any community to re @-@ build shrines " . On 8 February 2012 , the High Court directed the state government to rebuild the shrines , and said it was the state 's " constitutional responsibility to restore the shrines " . The matter went to the Supreme Court , which refused to stay the order . 
 = = Response by the government of Gujarat = = 
 The state government stated that the massacre was " a spontaneous reaction to the Godhra train carnage and the state government and ruling party had nothing to do with it " . On 1 March 2002 , Modi , talking about the violence , said that he tried everything to control the " riots resulting from the natural and justified anger of people " , " . Referring to the massacre , Modi said , " The five crore ( 50 million ) people of Gujarat have shown remarkable restraint under grave provocation " . 
 The state government appointed a " Gujarat state commission of inquiry " to investigate the case and give recommendations . The committee was chaired by retired Gujarat High Court judge K.G. Shah . The formation of the committee raised concerns about delays in implementing recommendations because two similar reports about reforms , by the Reddy and Dave commissions , had been pending implementation since 1969 and 1985 respectively . The government of Gujarat presented its report to National Human Rights Commission of India , justifying its role and stating its findings about the massacre . The state government 's report did not mention the involvement of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal activists , despite statements by numerous eyewitnesses . The report also included , according to Human Rights Watch , a " grossly under @-@ counted " total of the shrines destroyed in the violence . 
 = = Role played by media = = 
 Television and newspaper reports , particularly local Gujarati @-@ language media , carried graphic and at times sensationalised images and accounts of the Godhra train fire and Naroda Patiya massacre . This was the first major communal violence after the advent of satellite television in India . Television news channels identified the community of those involved in the violence , breaking a long @-@ standing practice and setting a precedent . Critical reporting on the Gujarat government 's handling of the situation helped bring about the Indian government 's intervention in controlling the violence . The Gujarat government banned television news channels that were critical of its response ; STAR News , Zee News , Aaj Tak , CNN and local stations were blocked . The Editorial Guild of India rejected the charge that graphic news coverage aggravated the situation , saying that the coverage exposed the horrors of the riots and the " supine if not complicit " attitude of the state , helping propel remedial action . The team also faulted Gujarati @-@ language newspapers Gujarat Samachar and the pro @-@ Hindutva Sandesh for distorted and provocative reporting . Rather than Naroda Patiya , the Godhra train fire was extensively covered until the subsequent violence and the presentation of the Union budget overtook it . 
 Modi said that the media had exaggerated while covering the extent of violence and criticised the media for " provoking the violence by naming the religion of victims " . Newspapers , particularly Sandesh , were reported by various organisations to have published " inflammatory headlines , stories and pictures " . A headline in Sandesh on 28 February 2002 read , " Avenge Blood With Blood " . After the massacre , when Muslims had returned from Hajj , Sandesh had published the headline , " Hindus Beware : Hajj pilgrims return with deadly conspiracy " , which caused terror among the returning Muslim community , and they were escorted by Army officials to their homes and were given protection to avoid attacks . A report by the People 's Union for Civil Liberties stated , " Major effect of media under long period has been to feed on the prevalent anti @-@ Muslim prejudices of its Hindu readership and provoke it further by sensationalizing , twisting , mangling and distorting news or what passes for it . " 
 In its 2007 expose The Truth : Gujarat 2002 - Tehelka report , the political weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of several members of the Bharatiya Janata Party , Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots . While the report was criticised for being politically motivated , some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge . Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on the sting operation . Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them , but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya . The Gujarat government blocked cable news channels from broadcasting the expose , an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India . 
 = = Attacks against women = = 
 A number of women and girls were raped , sexually assaulted and killed during the incident . Reports presented by Citizen 's Initiative , and Human Rights Watch stated that out of the 36 women killed in the Naroda Patiya massacre , most were sexually assaulted before their deaths ; surviving women also reported being assaulted . According to Human Rights Watch , women and girls were " brutally raped before being killed " . Most of the rapes took place in public , and the victims were then killed and their bodies burnt . Among the women surviving in the relief camp , many suffered the most bestial forms of sexual violence – including rape , gang rape , mass rape , stripping , insertion of objects into their bodies and molestation . Citizens ' initiative 's report stated that " A majority of rape victims have been burnt alive . There is evidence of State and Police complicity in perpetuating crimes against women . No effort was made to protect women . No Mahila women police was deployed . State and Police complicity is continuing as , women survivors continue to be denied the right to file FIRs . There is no existing institutional mechanism in Gujarat through which women can seek justice " . 
 According to Human Rights Watch , the abdomens of three pregnant women were cut open and the foetus removed and thrown into a fire . In an incident that came to light in 2007 , Suresh <unk> ( Richard ) alias Langado was caught on camera in a Tehelka sting operation talking to <unk> about slitting the belly of pregnant Muslim <unk> Banu , removing her foetus and killing it with a sword . 
 = = Alleged involvement of police and SRP in the massacre = = 
 It was alleged that the police helped the mob against the Muslim community on the day of massacre . Evidence included complaints filed by victims ' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob , resulting in the killings . It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents ' hiding places . According to Human Rights Watch , the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and , on the day of the violence , did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended . Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at , and firing upon , Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others . There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted . In the violence , the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) was reported , which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it . 
 A report based on eyewitness statements submitted by the Citizens ' Initiative to the National Human Rights Commission of India states that the State Reserve Police ( SRP ) , a force of specially trained emergency police , were seen chasing the victims and helping the rioters rather than calming the situation . According to Human Rights Watch , some victims said that they were able to handle the crowd but when police and SRP joined in , it became difficult as the police sided with the rioters and fired on Muslim residents . The state government denied these allegations ; Modi said that police fired to " contain outbreaks of violence " and added that they had " mowed down people to quell the violence " . The Special Investigation Team also defended the role played by officials and said that everything was done to stop the violence . 
 = = Allegations against the state government and Narendra Modi = = 
 Human Rights Watch and other Indian human rights groups alleged that the Gujarat government authorities and police helped the mob on the day of violence in Naroda . Human Rights Watch found evidence that the state government helped the mob in the attacks because action by police and other officials was delayed and " less effective " . A Bharatiya Janata Party insider alleged to Human Rights Watch that Narendra Modi and state government were involved in the riots , stating ; " Insiders in the Bharatiya <unk> Party admit that the police were under instructions of Narendra Modi administration not to act firmly " . Celia <unk> of the New York Times reported that witnesses were " dismayed by the lack of intervention from local police " , who often " watched the events taking place and took no action against the attacks on Muslims and their property " . 
 Babu Bajrangi , the Bajrang Dal leader that was one of the main organisers of the massacre , has stated that he called the State 's Home minister <unk> <unk> at the end of the day and told him everything that had happened . <unk> is said to have advised him to leave the State and go into hiding . He also stated that a State Reserve Police officer that made a statement against him was promoted by Narendra Modi , which " silenced him . " Maya Kodnani , a BJP legislator described as the " kingpin of the violence " by Judge Yagnik , was later appointed as a Minister for Women and Child Welfare in Narendra Modi 's government . Cell phone records showed that she was in touch with the Chief Minister 's Office , the Home Minister as well as top police officials during the massacres . The Chief Minister 's office was also in touch with other rioters <unk> Mehta , Sanjay <unk> and Anil <unk> . 
 Modi and the state government denied any involvement in the riots . On 10 April 2012 , the Special Investigation Team cleared Modi and the government in the riot cases , stating that , " Law and order review meetings were held by Modi and all the things was done to control the situation ... the Army was called on time to contain the communal violence . Modi was busy with steps to control the situation , establishment of relief camps for riot victims and also with efforts to restore peace and normalcy . " 
 An affidavit was filed in the Supreme Court on the basis of a report on testimony of suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt that Modi ordered top police officers not to take active actions in the riots . Bhatt said that on the night of 27 February 2002 , Modi said that " Hindus must be allowed to carry out retaliatory violence against Muslims . " The report filed by Raju Ramachandran , a Supreme Court lawyer and an amicus curiae , alleged that Modi " gave instructions to top police officers to go slow on rioters " . On 7 May 2012 , Ramachandran said that Modi can be prosecuted under sections 153 A ( 1 ) ( a ) & ( b ) , 153 B ( 1 ) , 166 and 505 ( 2 ) of the Indian Penal Code for promoting enmity among different groups during the 2002 Gujarat riots , including the Naroda incident . The Special Investigation Team criticised the amicus report for relying heavily on Bhatt 's testimony , who according to the Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) was an " unreliable witness " as he remained silent for nine years . The report was rejected by the team and according to the SIT , " No case can be made out against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the 2002 communal riots under any of the Sections of the Indian Penal Code mentioned by him [ Ramachandran ] " .

 As the investigations began , some victims reported that the Gujarat Police " didn 't cooperate well " and declined to lodge a First Information Report against some people . Later the police filed all complaints and presented their first report .

" 
 = = = Special Investigation Team report = = = 
 In 2008 , the Supreme Court of India directed that the case be transferred from police investigation to a committee appointed by the court , the Special Investigation Team , because the police had become one of the riot cases . The team was led by ex @-@ Central Bureau of Investigation director R. K. Raghavan , and the case was the sixth Gujarat riots case assigned to them for investigation . Taking into account the findings about telephone records of various activists , Kodnani and other major leaders were included in the report for the first time . The Special Investigation Team 's findings added 24 more names to the 46 people arrested by the police . Before the trial began , 6 of the accused died . In 2009 the trial started , during which three of the accused died , thus the final report covered 61 people . 
 The report said that Kodnani , Bajrangi and other leaders had led violence as well as " instigating the mob " . Kodnani 's telephone records revealed that she had made calls to the Chief Minister 's Office ( CMO ) on the day of the massacre and that her telephone was located at places where the violence occurred . She had also contacted numerous police officials , especially K.K. Mysorewala , the police inspector in charge of Naroda at the time of the massacre . Her logs also revealed that she had received calls from the CMO and other police officers , the reasons for which are unknown .

 The first verdict in the case was handed down on 29 August 2012 by Judge <unk> Yagnik . The special trial court convicted Maya Kodnani , the sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Naroda and former Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat , and Bajrang Dal politician Babu Bajrangi under Indian Penal Code Section 120 B ( criminal conspiracy ) and 302 ( murder ) . It also convicted 30 other people of murder , criminal conspiracy and other criminal charges , and acquitted 29 accused , giving them the benefit of the doubt as there was lack of evidence against them . <unk> was the first woman , MLA and minister to be convicted in the Gujarat riot case . Suresh <unk> ( Richard ) alias Langado and accomplices were convicted of rape and murder along with accomplices . 
 The prosecution requested the death penalty for all the convicts . Sentencing took place on 31 August : Kodani was given a 28 @-@ year prison term , and received two sentences ; the first for 10 years under Indian Penal Code Section 326 ( voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means ) and the second for 18 years under Section 302 ( murder ) and others . Her sentences are set to run consecutively , making a total of 28 years . Bajrangi received life imprisonment . Of the rest of the 30 convicted , 22 were sentenced to a minimum of 14 years and 7 to a minimum of 21 years in prison ; they included Naresh Chara , <unk> Sindhi , <unk> Rathod , Suresh Langado , Premchand Tiwari , <unk> Sindhi <unk> and <unk> Panchal . One of the convicted , Suresh alias <unk> <unk> , absconded and his sentencing was deferred . 
 = = = Comments about Kodnani and the initial investigation = = = 
 Kodnani said that she had never been to Naroda and had become a " victim of politics " . Judge Yagnik described her as the " kingpin of the violence " , and as the 37 months of trials ended , the court said in a statement that Kodnani had received help from the state government , and efforts had been made to avoid her name appearing on the list of accused . The statement said , " Kodnani was tremendously favoured by the then investigating agencies ( before the Supreme Court @-@ appointed Special Investigation Team took over ) . All care , at the cost of the duty of the investigating officer and even the interest of the victims , was taken to see to it that Kodnani 's involvement does not come on the books . This , in fact , comes in the way to believe that Kodnani was ever a victim of any politics . " 
 In the verdict , the special court criticised the initial investigation and the police for " not doing any policing during the 2002 riots and then deliberately conducting poor investigations . " The verdict said that statements of witnesses recorded by the Gujarat police were " unreliable as the investigator 's propriety in recording the statements had itself been rebutted . " The special court judge also criticised Mysorewala 's actions in investigation , and said that " Mysorewala and his force were totally inactive on all fronts and in every aspect . " The court added that : " No doubt , it was an elephantine task to investigate the kind of crimes , but then it cannot be believed that the senior Investigating Officers , having experience , do not know what should be the priorities in such kind of investigation . But , it seems that they must have been over @-@ shadowed by some element "

 Residents in the city , including the victims , appreciated the judgement and celebrated . <unk> Singh of the Indian National Indian National Congress welcomed the verdict and statement of Modi 's role in the riots and said , " Now it is proved that ministers and officials of BJP were involved in Gujarat riots and all this happened under the guidance of Modi ... can any minister ( take part in riots ) do this without the support of the Chief Minister ? " The president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee , Arjun <unk> , said on Twitter : " Naroda Patiya : justice delayed not <unk> thousands behind the bars , more <unk> but will the law be able to touch the ' beneficiary ' ? " Modi , in response to the sentencing of Kodnani – who was a minister in his cabinet – refused to apologise . Modi said his government had played no role in the riots , and that , " If Modi has sinned , then Modi should be hanged . But even after trying sincerely to save many lives , some people want to bad @-@ mouth me due to political reasons , then I can 't answer them . " <unk> Vyas , spokesman for the cabinet of the Gujarat government , said that it was not involved and was not responsible for the actions of Kodnani : " Ms. Kodnani , a practising gynaecologist , was not a Minister at the time of the massacre and was only an MLA , and her individual action could not be construed as a ' cumulative responsibility of the Cabinet ' .

 Dave Gallaher ( born David Gallagher , 30 October 1873 – 4 October 1917 ) was a New Zealand rugby union footballer best remembered as the captain of the " Original All Blacks " — the 1905 – 06 New Zealand national team , the first representative New Zealand side to tour the British Isles . Under Gallaher 's leadership the Originals won 34 out of 35 matches over the course of tour , including legs in France and North America ; the New Zealanders scored 976 points and conceded only 59 . Before returning home he co @-@ wrote the classic rugby text The Complete Rugby Footballer with his vice @-@ captain Billy Stead . Gallaher retired as a player after the 1905 – 06 tour and took up coaching and selecting ; he was a selector for both Auckland and New Zealand for most of the following decade . 
 Born in Ramelton , Ireland , Gallaher migrated to New Zealand with his family as a small child . After moving to Auckland , in 1895 he joined Ponsonby RFC and was selected for his province in 1896 . In 1901 – 02 he served with the New Zealand Contingent in the Anglo @-@ Boer War . He first appeared on the New Zealand national team for their unbeaten tour of Australia in 1903 , and played in New Zealand 's first ever Test match , against Australia in Sydney . The Originals Gallaher captained during 1905 – 06 helped to cement rugby as New Zealand 's national sport , but he was relentlessly pilloried by the British press for his role as wing @-@ forward . The use of a wing @-@ forward , which critics felt was a tactic to deliberately obstruct opponents , contributed to decades of strain between the rugby authorities of New Zealand and the Home Nations ; the International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB ) effectively outlawed the position in 1931 . 
 During the First World War , Gallaher enlisted in the New Zealand Division to fight in Europe . He was killed in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium . He has since been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame , International Rugby Hall of Fame , and the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame . A number of memorials exist in Gallaher 's honour , including the Gallaher Shield for the winner of Auckland 's club championship , and the Dave Gallaher Trophy contested between the national teams of France and New Zealand .

James was a widower who had married Maria in 1866 , a year after the death of his first wife . James had two children from his first marriage , and David was the seventh from his marriage to Maria . The couple had three more children after David , but of their ten offspring , three died in infancy . The couple 's other offspring were : Joseph ( born 1867 ) , Isabella ( 1868 ) , James ( 1869 ) , Maria ( called Molly , 1870 ) , Jane ( 1871 ) , Thomas ( 1872 ) , William ( 1875 ) , Oswald ( 1876 ) , and James Patrick ( 1878 ) . David was baptised as a Presbyterian in the First Ramelton Meeting House on 8 January 1874 . 
 After the struggling in his drapery business in Ramelton , James decided to emigrate with his family to New Zealand as part of George Vesey Stewart 's Katikati Special Settlement scheme . In May 1878 the Gallaghers – minus the sick James Patrick who at eight weeks old was too weak to make the trip – sailed from Belfast on the Lady Jocelyn for Katikati in the Bay of Plenty . On arriving in New Zealand , the family altered their surname to " Gallaher " in an effort to reduce confusion over its spelling and pronunciation . 
 The Gallaher couple and their six children arrived in Auckland after a three @-@ month voyage , and from there sailed to Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty , before their final voyage to Katikati . On arrival they found the settlement scheme was not what they had envisaged or been promised : the land allocated to the family required enormous work to be broken in before being suitable for farming , there was no easy access to water , and the settlement was very hilly . It had been hoped that James would be employed as the agent for the Donegal Knitting Company in New Zealand , which was to be established by Lord George Augusta Hill . But Hill died unexpectedly and his successor did not support the initiative . As the family 's poor quality land was insufficient to make a living , the children 's mother Maria soon became the chief breadwinner after she obtained a position teaching for £ 2 a week at the new No. 2 School . 
 In January 1886 David spent a week in Auckland hospital undergoing surgery to treat stunted muscles in his left leg which had led to curvature of his spine . His mother became sick that same year , and in 1887 lost her teaching position . His mother 's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9 September 1887 . With a father in his seventies , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old David was compelled to leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family . He took a job with a local stock and station agent . 
 The older Gallaher children had to work to prevent the local authorities from putting their younger siblings up for adoption . In 1889 , with the exception of William who remained in Katikati , the family joined Joseph in Auckland , where he had found work . David – who was by now 17 years old – was able to obtain work at the Northern Roller Mills Company , and was soon a member of the firm 's junior cricket team . In the late 1890s Gallaher took employment at the Auckland Farmers ' Freezing Company as a labourer ; by the time of his deployment for the First World War two decades later he had risen to the position of foreman . His work required the constant handling of heavy animal carcasses , which helped him build upper body strength and kept him fit .

 Gallaher first gained attention for his talents as a rugby player while living in Katikati . After moving to Auckland , he played junior rugby for the Parnell club from 1890 . He joined the Ponsonby District Rugby Football Club in 1895 , after the family moved to Freemans Bay following Joseph 's marriage to Nell Burchell . Gallaher , who played at hooker , was selected for an Auckland " B " side that year , and made his debut for the Auckland provincial side against the touring Queensland team on 8 August 1896 . The Aucklanders won 15 – 6 . Gallaher was retained for Auckland 's remaining fixtures that season : defeats to Wellington , Taranaki and Otago . 
 In 1897 , Gallaher 's Ponsonby club won eight of their nine matches en route to the Auckland club championship . He was selected to play for Auckland against the New Zealand representative side that had just completed a tour of Australia . The Aucklanders won 11 – 10 after scoring a late try ; it was only New Zealand 's second loss of their eleven @-@ match tour . Later that year Gallaher was selected for Auckland 's three @-@ match tour where they defeated Taranaki , Wellington and Wanganui . Wellington 's defeat was their first loss at home since the formation of the Wellington Rugby Football Union in 1879 . The following season was less eventful for Gallaher – he played much of the season for Ponsonby , but injury prevented his selection for Auckland . 
 After missing the 1898 season for Auckland , Gallaher continued to be selected for the province throughout 1899 and 1900 . The side was undefeated over this time ; he played for them twice in 1899 , and in all four matches in 1900 . He represented Auckland province a total of 26 times over his career . 
 = = Anglo @-@ Boer War = = 
 In January 1901 Gallaher joined the Sixth New Zealand Contingent of Mounted Rifles for service in the Anglo @-@ Boer War . When enlisting he gave his date of birth as 31 October 1876 , three years later than the actual date . It is unknown why he did this but the later date continued to be used in official records for the rest of his life . Gallaher was given a send @-@ off dinner by his Ponsonby club before the contingent departed from Auckland on 31 January . After disembarking in South Africa at East London on 14 March 1901 , Gallaher 's contingent immediately embarked for Pretoria , and it was there that , as part of forces under the command of General Herbert Plumer , they set about their task of " rid [ ding ] the Northern Transvaal of Boer guerrillas and sympathizers . " 
 A member of the contingent 's 16th ( Auckland ) Company , he served in the advanced guard , who scouted ahead of the main force . In October 1901 Gallaher contracted malaria , and was hospitalised in Charlestown , Natal . In a letter he composed to his sister while recovering he wrote : 
 .. we have been all over S [ <unk> ] Africa pretty well I believe , on the trek the whole time and it looks as if we will be trekking till the end of the Chapter . We have a fair share of the fighting all the time and I am still alive and kicking although I have had a couple of pretty close calls , one day I thought I would have to say good bye to old New Zealand but I had my usual luck and so came out all right 
 Between late December 1901 and early January 1902 Gallaher and his contingent were involved in a number of skirmishes . He described one incident where he had several Boer fighters in his sights , but did not have " the heart " to fire at them while they rescued one of their comrades . Describing a later encounter to his sister , Gallaher wrote : " We had a total of 22 killed and 36 injured and a few taken prisoners [ ; ] it was a pretty mournful sight to see the Red Cross bearers cruising around the field fetching all the dead and wounded who were laying all over the place " . By March 1902 Gallaher had reached the rank of squadron sergeant @-@ major , and his contingent was on its way to Durban . There the unit boarded ship for New Zealand , but Gallaher stayed behind , transferring to the Tenth New Zealand Contingent . His new unit did not see active service in South Africa , and he returned with them to New Zealand in August 1902 . For his service Gallaher received the Queen 's South Africa Medal ( Cape Colony , Orange Free State , and Transvaal <unk> ) , and King 's South Africa Medal ( South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902 <unk> ) . 
 = = Resumption of his rugby career = = 
 During his time in South Africa Gallaher did play some rugby , including captaining the New Zealand military team that played ten games and won the rugby championship among the British forces . But he was not fit enough to play immediately upon his return to New Zealand , and so did not resume playing rugby for Ponsonby until the 1903 season . When he did return for his club , for the first match of the year , he was described as " the outstanding forward " in a comprehensive defeat of Parnell . 
 Despite having missed two seasons of provincial rugby , Gallaher was included in the 22 @-@ man New Zealand representative squad to tour Australia during 1903 . He was the first Ponsonby player ever to play for the New Zealand team , commonly known as the " All Blacks " . The 1903 team to Australia was , according to Winston McCarthy 's 1968 history of the All Blacks , " still regarded by old @-@ timers as the greatest team to ever leave New Zealand . " The tour did not start well – a preliminary match in New Zealand , against Wellington , was lost 14 – 5 , though Gallaher did score his first try for his country . 
 Gallaher played eight matches – the first four as hooker and the remainder as wing @-@ forward – out of eleven during the six @-@ week tour . The party was captained by the veteran Otago player Jimmy Duncan , who was widely recognised as a master tactician . The first match in Australia , against New South Wales , was won 12 – 0 by the New Zealanders , despite their having a man sent off . After playing a Combined Western Districts side , New Zealand played a second match against New South Wales . New Zealand won again , but only 3 – 0 on a flooded pitch at Sydney Cricket Ground . The side continued touring the state before making their way north to Queensland , where they twice played the state side . The New Zealanders then returned to New South Wales , where the first @-@ ever Australia – New Zealand rugby union Test match took place in Sydney . 
 Since the selection of the first New Zealand team in 1884 , inter @-@ colonial games had been played against New South Wales ( ten New Zealand wins from thirteen matches ) , and Queensland ( seven New Zealand wins from seven ) , but none had been contested against a combined Australian side . The match – won 22 – 3 by the New Zealanders , who scored three tries to nil – marked Gallaher 's first international cap . The last match of the tour was against New South Wales Country ; New Zealand won 32 – 0 . On their ten @-@ match tour of Australia , New Zealand had scored 276 points and conceded only 13 . 
 Back in New Zealand , Gallaher was selected for the North Island in his first ever Inter @-@ Island match ; the South won 12 – 5 . He then continued playing for Auckland , who were conducting a tour of both islands . Gallaher appeared in six of their seven matches , against Taranaki , Wellington , Southland , Otago , Canterbury , and South Canterbury . Auckland lost the first two matches , but won the others . 
 In 1904 the first Ranfurly Shield match was played . The shield , a provincial challenge trophy won by defeating the holder , was to become the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby . Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield . The first shield challenge was played against Wellington , who were not expected to pose much of a threat . Auckland had not lost at home in six years , but , with Gallaher in the side , were upset 6 – 3 by the <unk> . Gallaher was then selected for the New Zealand team that faced the touring British Isles in what was New Zealand 's first Test match on home soil . The British team were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand , and had finished their Australian leg unbeaten . 
 Jimmy Duncan , who was coaching New Zealand after retiring as a player , said before the historic match : " I have given them directions . It 's man for man all the time , and I have bet Gallaher a new hat that he can 't catch [ Percy ] Bush . Bush has never been collared in Australia but he 'll get it today . " The match was tied 3 – 3 at half @-@ time , but New Zealand were the stronger side in the second half and eventually won 9 – 3 . Gallaher was praised by press for his all @-@ round display at wing @-@ forward , but in particular for his successful harassment of the British Isles ' half @-@ back Tommy Vile . 
 The New Zealand defeat was the first tour loss for the British side , who then drew with a combined Taranaki @-@ Wanganui @-@ Manawatu side before travelling to Auckland . Gallaher played for Auckland against the tourists and scored one of the tries in their 13 – 0 victory . He was part of a forward pack that dominated their opponents , and again he troubled Vile ; his tackling of Vile and Bush killed many British attacks . The rugby historian Terry McLean would write in 1987 that " his display could be ranked with the finest exhibitions of wing @-@ forward play " . Gallaher represented Auckland once in 1904 , a 3 – 0 loss to Taranaki .

 = = = Background and preparations = = = 
 At the end of the 1904 season the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( NZRFU ) suspended Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles . Eventually the matter was resolved when , under protest , Gallaher repaid the disputed amount . This settlement , coupled with his performance in 26 – 0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre @-@ tour trial , allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand 's 1905 – 06 tour of Europe and North America . The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time , and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905 . This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour , though a privately organised team , the New Zealand Natives , had preceded them in 1888 – 89 . 
 The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour , with Billy Stead as vice @-@ captain . A week into the voyage to Britain aboard the SS <unk> , rumours circulated that some of the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher , and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad . The dissidents contended that the captain and vice @-@ captain should have been elected by the players , as they had been on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia . Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might do to the team and offered to resign , as did the vice @-@ captain Stead . Although the teams ' manager refused to accept the resignations , the players still took a vote — 17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU 's selections . 
 During the voyage to England the team conducted training drills on the ship 's deck ; for this the forwards were coached by Gallaher and fellow player Bill Cunningham , while Stead was in charge of the backs . Consequently , the services of the NZRFU @-@ appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used ; his appointment had caused opposition from many in the squad who believed his expertise was not required , and that an extra player should have been taken on tour instead . After a six @-@ week voyage , the team arrived in Plymouth , England on 8 September 1905 . 
 = = = Early tour matches = = = 
 The New Zealanders ' first match was against the Devon county side at Exeter . A close contest was expected , but New Zealand ran out 55 – 4 winners , scoring twelve tries and conceding only a drop @-@ goal . Reaction to the match was mixed – the team were accompanied by a cheering crowd and marching band following the win , but Gallaher 's play at wing @-@ forward provoked some criticism in the press . 
 The use of a wing @-@ forward was a distinctive feature of New Zealand play . Instead of having eight men in the scrum as was normal elsewhere , seven men were used – the missing man , the wing @-@ forward , instead fed the ball into the scrum then held onto one of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half @-@ back . With the wing @-@ forward bound to the side of the scrum , the opposing half @-@ back would then have to manoeuvre past him to tackle the player with the ball . This increased the amount of time the half @-@ back would have in possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him . 
 The use of this new tactic by New Zealand meant that Gallaher , the team 's wing @-@ forward , was repeatedly accused by the English of obstruction , though the referee Percy Coles , an official of the English Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) , rarely penalised him in the Devon match . The Originals ' fullback Billy Wallace posited that New Zealand 's superior scrum made Gallaher 's style of play more prominent . Unlike British and Irish teams of the time , New Zealand employed specialist positions for their forwards . Despite often facing an extra man in the scrum , the New Zealanders " drove like a cleaver through British forward packs " . Gallaher later said : " I think my play is fair – I sincerely trust so – and surely the fact that both Mr Percy Coles and Mr D. H. Bowen – two of the referees of our matches , and fairly representative of English and Welsh ideas , have taken no exception so it ought to have some weight . " The British press , looking to find fault in New Zealand 's play , continued to criticise Gallaher throughout the tour . Gallaher believed the key to his side 's success was a difference in playing styles , while Winston McCarthy believed the unique backline formation to be a major factor . 
 Following the opening match the " All Blacks " – as the New Zealand team came to be known – defeated Cornwall and then Bristol , both 41 – 0 . They then defeated Northampton 32 – 0 . The tour continued in much the same way , with the All Blacks defeating Leicester , Middlesex , Durham , Hartlepool Clubs and Northumberland ; in nearly all cases the defeats were inflicted without conceding any points ( the one exception being Durham , who scored a try against New Zealand ) . The New Zealanders then comfortably defeated Gloucester and Somerset before facing Devonport Albion , the incumbent English club champions , who had not lost at home in 18 months . New Zealand beat them 21 – 3 in front of a crowd of 20 @,@ 000 . Gallaher scored the All Blacks ' final try , an effort described by the Plymouth Herald as , " ... a gem . It was a tearing rush for about fifty yards with clockwork @-@ like passing all the way . " 
 New Zealand won their next seven matches , including victories over Blackheath , Oxford University and Cambridge University . Billy Wallace contended that the New Zealanders ' form peaked with the win over Blackheath ; he recalled that " after this game injuries began to take their toll and prevented us ever putting in so fine a team again on the tour . " By the time the All Blacks played their first Test match , against Scotland , the team had played and won nineteen matches , and scored 612 points while conceding only 15 . 
 = = = Scotland , Ireland and England internationals = = = 
 The Scottish Football Union ( SFU ) , the governing body for rugby union in Scotland , did not give the New Zealanders an official welcome , and sent only one official to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh . In addition , the SFU refused a financial guarantee for the match , promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead ; this meant that the NZRFU had to take on all monetary responsibilities for the match . One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell @-@ Sivright , who was Scotland 's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand . Bedell @-@ Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year , especially regarding the wing @-@ forward play of Gallaher . 
 When time for the Scotland Test did arrive , it was discovered that as the ground had not been covered for protection from the elements , and had frozen over . The SFU wanted to abandon the match , but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw , and the match was eventually allowed to proceed . The Test was closely contested , with Scotland leading 7 – 6 at half @-@ time , but the All Blacks scored two late tries to win 12 – 7 ; despite the close score @-@ line , the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides . 
 Four days later the tourists played a West of Scotland selection , where they received a much warmer reception than for the Scotland match , then travelled via Belfast to Dublin where they faced Ireland . Gallaher did not play in either match due to a leg injury suffered during the Scotland Test . New Zealand won the Ireland match 15 – 0 , then defeated a team representing Munster province . 
 By the time of New Zealand 's next game , against England in London , Gallaher had recovered from his injury enough to play . Between 40 @,@ 000 and 80 @,@ 000 saw the match . The All Blacks scored five tries ( four by Duncan McGregor , playing at wing ) to win 15 – 0 . According to the England player Dai Gent , the victory would have been even greater had the match conditions been dry . " One cannot help thinking that England might have picked a stronger side , " said Gallaher . " From our experience , we did not think that this side was fully representative of the best men to be found in the country . " Observers noted that Gallaher still seemed to be suffering from his leg injury during the match . New Zealand played three more matches in England – wins over Cheltenham , Cheshire , and Yorkshire – before travelling on to Wales . 
 = = = Wales = = = 
 Wales were the dominant rugby country of the four Home Nations , and in the middle of a " golden age " at the time . Gallaher and his team faced them three days after the Yorkshire match . The All Blacks had thus far played 27 matches on tour , scoring 801 points while conceding only 22 , and all in only 88 days . They were struggling to field fifteen fit players ; a number of their best players , including Stead , were unavailable due to injury . 
 The match was preceded by an All Black haka , to which the crowd responded with the Welsh national song " Land of my Fathers " . Wales had developed tactics to negate the seven @-@ man New Zealand scrum , and removed a man from their scrum to play as a " rover " , equivalent to Gallaher 's wing @-@ forward position . Gallaher was consistently penalised by the Scottish referee , John Dallas , who held that the New Zealander was feeding the ball into the scrum incorrectly . This eventually compelled Gallaher to instruct his team not to contest the scrums , and therefore give Wales possession following each scrum . Bob Deans , playing at wing for New Zealand that day , later said that Dallas had gone " out to penalise Gallaher – there is no doubt about that " . Teddy Morgan scored an unconverted try for Wales shortly before half @-@ time to give the home side a 3 – 0 lead . 
 The New Zealand backs had been poor in the first half , and the side 's general form was well below that of earlier in the tour . However New Zealand were generally perceived to be the better side in the second half , with the performance of the Welsh fullback Bert Winfield keeping his team in the game . The most controversial moment of the tour happened late in the second half . Wallace recovered a Welsh kick and cut across the field , and with only Winfield to beat , passed to the New Zealand wing Deans . What happened next has provoked intense debate : Deans was tackled by the Welsh and either fell short of the try @-@ line , or placed the ball over it before being dragged back . Dallas , who had dressed in heavy clothing and was struggling to keep up with the pace of the game , was 30 yards ( 27 m ) behind play . When he arrived he ruled that Deans was short of the try @-@ line , and so did not award New Zealand a try . Play continued , but the All Blacks could not score , and Wales won 3 – 0 . This was New Zealand 's first loss of the tour . 
 Following the match Gallaher was asked if he was unhappy with any aspect of the game ; he replied that " the better team won and I am content . " When asked about Dallas 's refereeing , he said : " I have always made it a point never to express a view regarding the referee in any match in which I have played " . Gallaher was gracious in defeat , but Dixon was highly critical of both Dallas and the Welsh newspapers , who he accused of " violently and unjustly " attacking New Zealand 's captain . Gallaher would later admit that he had been annoyed by this criticism , which he found unfair ; he also pointed out that though the Welsh condemned the wing @-@ forward position , they had themselves adopted some elements of it . Later during the tour , when discussing the issue of his feeding the ball into the scrum , he said : 
 No referee could accuse me throughout the tour of putting the ball in unfairly or of putting ‘ bias ’ on it . I would be quite content to accept the verdict on such referees as Mr. Gil Evans or Mr. Percy Coles on the point . There were times when the scrum work was done so neatly that as soon as the ball had left my hands the forwards shoved over the top of it , and it was heeled out , and Roberts was off with it before you could say ‘ knife ’ . It was all over so quickly that almost everyone – the referee sometimes included – thought there was something unfair about it , some ‘ trickery ’ and that the ball had not only been put in but passed out unfairly . People here have been accustomed when the ball was put into the scrum to see it wobbling about and frequently never coming out in a proper way . How can a man possibly put ‘ bias ’ on a ball if he rolls it into the scrum ? The only way to put my screw on a ball would be , I would say , to throw it straight down , shoulder high , on to its end , so that it may possibly bounce in the desired direction . I have never done that – in fact , it can ’ t be done in the scrum and if I had ever attempted it I should have expected to be penalised immediately . 
 Four more matches were contested in Wales , with Gallaher appearing in three . He played in the match against Glamorgan , won by New Zealand 9 – 0 , but had his finger bitten , which was serious enough for him to miss the fixture against Newport . He returned to face Cardiff , the Welsh champions , on Boxing Day . Gallaher was again booed by the Welsh crowd , and once more the All Blacks were troubled in the scrum , this time after losing a player to injury . The New Zealanders won , but narrowly ; Gallaher asserted after the match that Cardiff were the strongest club side they had met during the tour . New Zealand then faced Swansea in their last match in the British Isles . Gallaher again struggled to field a fit side , and at 3 – 0 down late in the match they were heading for their second defeat on tour . Wallace kicked a drop @-@ goal – then worth four points – late in the game to give the All Blacks a narrow 4 – 3 victory . 
 = = = France , North America , and return = = = 
 The side departed Wales and travelled to Paris , where they faced France on 1 January 1906 , in the home side 's first ever Test match . The All Blacks led 18 – 3 at half time . After the French scored their second try , giving them 8 points – the most any team had scored against the All Blacks – the New Zealanders responded with six unanswered tries to win 38 – 8 . They then returned to London , where they learned that New Zealand 's Prime Minister , Richard Seddon , had arranged for them to return home via North America . Not all of the players were keen on the idea , and four did not make the trip , but the new plans did give the team over two weeks to spend in England before their departure . 
 Before the New Zealand squad left Britain for North America , the English publisher Henry Leach asked Stead and Gallaher to author a book on rugby tactics and play . They finished the task in under a fortnight and were each paid £ 50 . Entitled The Complete Rugby Footballer , the book was 322 pages long and included chapters on tactics and play , as well as a summary of rugby 's history in New Zealand including the 1905 tour . It was mainly authored by Stead , a <unk> , with Gallaher contributing most of the diagrams . Gallaher almost certainly made some contributions to the text , including sections on Auckland club rugby , and on forward play . The book showed the All Blacks ' tactics and planning to be superior to others of the time , and according to Matt Elliott is " marvellously astute " ; it received universal acclaim on its publication . According to a 2011 assessment by ESPN 's Graham Jenkins , it " remains one of the most influential books produced in the realms of rugby literature " . 
 The New Zealanders travelled to New York , where they played an exhibition game , then on to San Francisco . There they played two official matches against British Columbia , and won both easily . The tour programme thus ended ; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once . Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches , including four Tests . Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39 ; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59 . On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6 March 1906 , the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland . Invited to speak at the reception , Gallaher said : " We did not go behind our back to talk about the Welshman , but candidly said that on that day the better team had won . I have one recommendation to make to the New Zealand [ Rugby ] Union , if it was to undertake such a tour again , and that is to play the Welsh matches first . " 
 = = = Aftermath and impact = = = 
 The 1905 – 06 Originals are remembered as perhaps the greatest of All Black sides , and set the standard for all their successors . They introduced a number of innovations to Britain and Ireland , including specialised forward positions and unfamiliar variations in attacking plays . But while their success helped establish rugby as New Zealand 's national sport and fed a growing sporting nationalism , the controversial wing @-@ forward position contributed to strained ties with the Home Nations ' rugby authorities . British and Irish administrators were also wary of New Zealand 's commitment to the amateur ethos , and questioned their sportsmanship . According to the historian Geoffrey Vincent , many in the traditional rugby establishment believed that : " Excessive striving for victory introduced an unhealthy spirit of competition , transforming a character @-@ building ' mock fight ' into ' serious fighting ' . Training and specialization degraded sport to the level of work . " 
 The success of the Originals provoked plans for a professional team of players to tour England and play Northern Union clubs in what is now known as rugby league . Unlike rugby league , which was professional , rugby union was strictly amateur at the time , and in 1907 a professional team from New Zealand known as the " All Golds " ( originally a play on " All Blacks " ) toured England and Wales before introducing rugby league to both New Zealand and Australia . According to historian Greg Ryan , the All Golds tour " confirmed many British suspicions about the rugby culture that had shaped the 1905 team . " 
 These factors may have contributed to the gap between All Black tours of the British Isles – they next toured in 1924 . The NZRFU was denied representation on the International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB ) – composed exclusively of English , Irish , Scottish and Welsh members – until 1948 . After complaining about the wing @-@ forward for years , the Home Nations @-@ administered IRFB made a series of law changes that effectively outlawed the position in 1931 . 
 = = Auckland and All Black selector = = 
 Gallaher retired from playing after the All Blacks ' tour , but remained involved in the sport as a coach and selector . He coached at age group level for Ponsonby and in 1906 succeeded Fred Murray as sole selector of the Auckland provincial team . He was Auckland selector until 1916 ; over this time Auckland played 65 games , won 48 , lost 11 and drew 6 . Gallaher did make a brief comeback as a player – travelling as the selector of an injury depleted Auckland team , he turned out against Marlborough at Blenheim in 1909 ; Marlborough won 8 – 3 . He also played against the Maniapoto sub @-@ union just over a week later . Auckland held the Ranfurly Shield from 1905 to 1913 , successfully defending it 23 times . The team struggled to retain the shield during 1912 and 1913 and eventually lost it to Taranaki in a 14 – 11 defeat . During Gallaher 's tenure as selector Auckland inflicted a 11 – 0 defeat of the touring 1908 Anglo @-@ Welsh side , defeated the New Zealand Māori in 1910 , and beat Australia 15 – 11 in 1913 . 
 Gallaher was also a national selector from 1907 to 1914 , and with George Nicholson co @-@ coached the All Blacks against the 1908 Anglo @-@ Welsh team . A number of Gallaher 's team @-@ mates from the 1905 – 06 tour were included in the New Zealand squad for the series ; of three Tests , the All Blacks won two and drew the other . During Gallaher 's incumbency as a national selector , New Zealand played 50 matches , won 44 , lost four and drew two . This included 16 Tests , of which only one was lost and two drawn .

 Although exempt from conscription due to his age , Gallaher enlisted in May 1916 . While awaiting for his call @-@ up to begin training he learnt that his younger brother Company Sergeant @-@ Major Douglas Wallace Gallaher had been killed while serving with the 11th Australian Battalion at Laventie near Fromelles on 3 June 1916 . Douglas had been living in Perth , Australia prior to the war and had previously been wounded at Gallipoli . Biographer Matt Elliott describes it as a " myth " that Gallaher enlisted to avenge his younger brother ; rather he claims that it was most likely due to " loyalty and duty " . 
 After enlisting and completing his basic training at Trentham he was posted to 22nd Reinforcements , 2nd Battalion , Auckland Regiment within the New Zealand Division . Gallaher left New Zealand aboard the <unk> in February 1917 and reached Britain on 2 May . Gallaher was a member of the ship 's Sports Committee and spent time organising and practising for a planned rugby match at the Cape of Good Hope – it is unknown if the match ever took place . After arriving in England he was promoted to the rank of temporary sergeant and dispatched to Sling Camp for further training . His rank was confirmed as sergeant on 6 June 1917 . 
 Gallaher 's unit fought in the Battle of Messines , near La Basse Ville , and in August and September 1917 they trained for the upcoming Passchendaele offensive . In the attack on Gravenstafel Spur on 4 October 1917 Gallaher was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that penetrated through his helmet , and he died later that day at the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station , Gravenstafel Spur . He was 43 years old . 
 Dave Gallaher is buried in grave No. <unk> at Nine Elms British Cemetery , which is west of <unk> on the <unk> , a road leading from the R33 <unk> ring road in Belgium . His regulation gravestone , bearing the silver fern of New Zealand , incorrectly gives his age as 41 . New Zealand sides touring Europe have since regularly visited his grave site . For his war service Gallaher was posthumously awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal . His brother Henry , who was a miner , served with the Australian 51st Battalion and was killed on 24 April 1917 . Henry 's twin brother , Charles , also served in the war and survived being badly wounded at Gallipoli . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 On 10 October 1906 Gallaher married " Nellie " Ellen Ivy May Francis at All Saints Anglican Church , Ponsonby , Auckland . Eleven years younger than Gallaher , Nellie was the daughter of Nora Francis and the sister of Arthur ( ' Bolla ' ) Francis – a fellow rugby player . For many years prior to the marriage Gallaher had boarded at the Francis family home where he had come to know Nellie . Both had also attended the All Saints Anglican Church where Nellie sang in the choir . With his limited income , and frequent absences from work playing rugby , Gallaher found boarding his best accommodation option . On 28 September 1908 their daughter Nora <unk> ( later Nora Simpson ) was born . Nellie Gallaher died in January 1969 . 
 Gallaher 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Bolla Francis played for Ponsonby , Auckland and New Zealand sides for a number of years , including when Gallaher was a selector . In 1911 , at age 29 , and in the twilight of his All Blacks ' career , he decided to switch to the professional sport of rugby league . Francis went on to represent New Zealand in rugby league , making him a dual @-@ code international . It is unlikely his switch to rugby league was done without Gallaher 's knowledge . Francis did eventually return to rugby union as a coach . 
 Gallaher was also a member of the fraternal organisation the United Ancient Order of the Druids , and attended meetings fortnightly in Newton , not far from Ponsonby . He also played several sports in addition to rugby , including cricket , yachting and athletics . 
 = = Memorial and legacy = = 
 In 1922 the Auckland Rugby Football Union introduced the Gallaher Shield in his honour ; it has since been awarded to the winner of the union 's premier men 's club competition . Ponsonby – Gallaher 's old club – have won the title more than any other club . At international level New Zealand and France contest the Dave Gallaher Trophy , which was first awarded when New Zealand defeated France on Armistice Day in 2000 . In 2011 New Zealand 's then oldest living All Black , Sir Fred Allen , unveiled a 2 @.@ 7 @-@ metre ( 8 ft 10 in ) high bronze statue of Gallaher beside one of the entrances at Eden Park in Auckland . The statue was created by Malcolm Evans . Gallaher has been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame , the World Rugby Hall of Fame , and the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame . 
 In 2005 members of the All Blacks witnessed the unveiling of a plaque at Gallaher 's birthplace in Ramelton , which was presented in conjunction with the renaming of Letterkenny RFC 's home ground to Dave Gallaher Memorial Park . Gallaher 's name is also incorporated into the club 's crest . The ground was upgraded following its renaming , and in 2012 the Letterkenny section of the ground was opened by former All Black , and Ponsonby stalwart , Bryan Williams . An Ireland @-@ produced documentary about Gallaher 's life , The Donegal All Black , was aired in 2015 . Later that year , a jersey worn by Gallaher during the 1905 British Isles tour was sold at auction in Cardiff for £ 180 @,@ 000 — nearly 10 times the previous record auction price for a rugby jersey . 
 = = Leadership and personality = = 
 " Gallaher played many dashing games , " the British newspaper The Sportsman reported after his death , " and led his side from one success to another until they were deemed invincible . He was a veritable artist , who never deserved all the hard things said about him , especially in South Wales . A great player , a great judge of the game " . Gallaher 's military experience gave him an appreciation for " discipline , cohesion and steadiness under pressure . " He was however quiet , even dour , and preferred to lead by example . He insisted players spend an hour " contemplating the game ahead " on match days , and also that they pay attention to detail . Original All Black Ernie Booth wrote of Gallaher : " To us All Blacks his words would often be , ‘ Give nothing away ; take no chance . ’ As a skipper he was somewhat a disciplinarian , doubtless imbibed from his previous military experience in South Africa . Still , he treated us all like men , not kids , who were out to ‘ play the game ’ for good old New Zealand . " Another contemporary said he was " perhaps not the greatest of wing @-@ forwards , as such ; but he was acutely skilled as a judge of men and moves " . 
 Paul Verdon , in his history of All Black captains , Born to Lead , writes : " The overwhelming evidence suggests Gallaher 's leadership style , honed from time spent in the Boer War , was very effective . " Gallaher 's biographer Matt Elliott asserts that in the century since his playing retirement " his reputation as a player and leader have only enhanced " . According to historian Terry McLean : " In a long experience of reading and hearing about the man , one has never encountered , from the New Zealand angle , or from his fellow players , criticism of his qualities as a leader . " In the view of the English rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell , writing soon after Gallaher 's death , the New Zealand captain was " a very quiet , taciturn sort of cove , who spoke rarely about football or his own achievements ... I never heard a soul who met him on that famous trip , say a disparaging word about him . "

The song is registered as " Did You Forget " with the Broadcast Music , Inc . Lovato has stated that " Don 't Forget " is one of the songs on Don 't Forget that she relates to the most , and that she felt " a lot of emotion while recording it " . In an interview with PopEater , she elaborated , " Everyone goes through the experience of falling in love , but then the other person just walks away , and goes somewhere else . I went through an experience like that and wanted to write about it . I got over it , and now a year later I don 't have those feelings about that person anymore . " The song and " La La Land " were included as bonus tracks on European editions of her sophomore album Here We Go Again . 
 " Don 't Forget " is a midtempo glam rock ballad sung with vulnerable and breathy vocals in a falsetto tone .

It is composed in the key of E major and Lovato 's vocal range spans from the note of C ♯ 4 to the note of E5 . The song includes a " rocking " instrumental and a heavy guitar break . Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the track to songs by Green Day . Lyrically , " Don 't Forget " is about one of Lovato 's old love interests who left her just as she was falling in love with him .

" The video premiered on March 16 , 2009 on Lovato 's MySpace account and was made available for digital download on the iTunes Store on April 7 , 2009 . In an interview with PopEater , Lovato said of the video , 
 " It was actually really freezing cold [ in the rain ] . You could see your breath . And I was in the rain for only a short time – my whole band was out there for an hour @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half . It was one of the hardest things I 've ever had to do on a shoot . But it went by so quickly . I had a body suit on underneath my clothes , so there 's a little fun fact for you .

" 
 Steve Helling of People magazine wrote that Lovato shows her mature side in the video , saying that " it 's hard not to notice that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Camp Rock star is growing up . " The video begins in a tour bus with Lovato 's band . She is seen sitting next to a window in the back of the bus , where she precedes to sing the first lines .

She walks out of the parking lot and into an amusement park , where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing . After the second chorus , Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background . As the last verse approaches , she is back on the tour bus .

 = Carnivàle = 
 Carnivàle / <unk> / is an American television series set in the United States during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl . In tracing the lives of two disparate groups of people , its story depicts the battle between good and evil and the struggle between free will and destiny ; the storyline mixes Christian theology with gnosticism and Masonic lore , particularly that of the Knights Templar . The show was filmed in Santa Clarita , California , and other Southern Californian locations . 
 Carnivàle was produced by HBO and ran for two seasons between September 14 , 2003 and March 27 , 2005 . The show was created by Daniel Knauf , who also served as executive producer with Ronald D. Moore and Howard Klein . The incidental music was composed by Jeff Beal . Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown starred as Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe , respectively . 
 Early reviews praised the style of Carnivàle but questioned the approach and execution of the story . Carnivàle 's first episode set a new audience record for an HBO original series , but the show was unable to retain its ratings in its second season . Carnivàle was canceled after 24 episodes , cutting its intended six @-@ season run short by four seasons . The show won five Emmys in 2004 , was nominated for 10 further Emmy awards , and received numerous other nominations and industry awards between 2004 and 2006 . 
 = = Plot introduction = = 
 The two seasons of Carnivàle take place in the Depression @-@ era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935 , and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge . The first involves a young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins ( Nick Stahl ) , who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay , Oklahoma . Soon thereafter , Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions , which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder , a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before , and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben 's own . 
 The second plotline revolves around a Father Coughlin @-@ esque Methodist preacher , Brother Justin Crowe ( Clancy Brown ) , who lives with his sister Iris in California . He shares Ben 's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers the extent of his own unearthly powers , which include bending human beings to his will and making their sins and greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions . Certain that he is doing God 's work , Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties , not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 Daniel Knauf conceived the initial script for the show between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with his job as a Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter . He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film . The resulting story and its treatment of freaks was strongly informed by Knauf 's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being . 
 Knauf named the intended feature film script Carnivàle , using an unusual spelling for a more outlandish look . Knauf had plotted the story 's broad strokes as well as several plot details from early on and knew the story destination until the final scene . However , the resulting 180 @-@ page long script was twice the length of a typical feature film script , and Knauf still felt that it was too short to do his story justice . He therefore shelved the screenplay as a learning experience . In the meantime , all but one of Knauf 's other scripts were rejected by Hollywood studios , often for being " too weird . " 
 In the mid @-@ 1990s , Knauf met a few Writers Guild TV writers who encouraged him to revise Carnivàle as a TV series . Knauf turned the script 's first act into a pilot episode , but , having no contacts in the television business , he was forced to shelve the project again and return to his regular job . A few years later , after realizing that his insurance career was not working out , he decided to give his screenwriting efforts a last chance by offering the Carnivàle pilot on his website . The script was subsequently forwarded to Howard Klein by Scott Winant , a mutual friend of the two men . After several meetings and conversations , Klein felt confident that Carnivàle would make a good episodic television series that could last for many years . Klein brought it to the attention of Chris Albrecht and Carolyn Strauss of HBO , who were immediately receptive . The network deemed Knauf too inexperienced in the television business to give him full control over the budget , and appointed Ronald D. Moore as showrunner . ( Knauf would replace Moore after one season when Moore left for the reimagined Battlestar Galactica . ) 
 The pilot episode , which was filmed over a period of 21 days , served as the basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines . Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network , leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months . One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin 's side of the story . Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well @-@ established preacher , and as a recurring character rather than a regular one . However , after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot , Knauf and the producers realized that there was no room for Justin to grow in a television series . Hence , it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town , setting him back in his career by about one or two years . Expanding Brother Justin 's role opened new possibilities , and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character . Little was changed on Ben Hawkins ' side except for the addition of the cootch ( striptease ) family ; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s . 
 = = = Format = = = 
 The Carnivàle story was originally intended to be a trilogy of " books " , consisting of two seasons each . This plan did not come to fruition , as HBO canceled the show after the first two seasons . Each season consists of twelve episodes . 
 Airing on HBO benefited Carnivàle in several ways . Because HBO does not rely on commercial breaks , Carnivàle had the artistic freedom to vary in episode length . Although the episodes averaged a runtime of 54 minutes , the episodes " Insomnia " and " Old Cherry Blossom Road " were 46 minutes and 59 minutes , respectively . HBO budgeted approximately US $ 4 million for each episode , considerably more than most television series receive . 
 = = = Historical production design = = = 
 Carnivàle 's 1930s ' Dust Bowl setting required significant research and historical consultants to be convincing , which was made possible with HBO 's strong financial backing . As a result , reviews praised the look and production design of the show as " impeccable , " " spectacular " and as " an absolute visual stunner . " In 2004 , Carnivàle won four Emmys for art direction , cinematography , costumes , and hairstyling . 
 To give a sense of the dry and dusty environment of the Dust Bowl , smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set . The actors ' clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt , and Carnivàle had approximately 5 @,@ 000 people costumed in the show 's first season alone . The creative team listened to 1930s ' music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period 's sound , language , and slang right . The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs , among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog , which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores . The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin 's story were incorporated into the show . Aside from the show 's supernatural elements , a historical consultant deemed Carnivàle 's historic accuracy to be excellent regarding the characters ' lives and clothes , their food and accommodations , their cars and all the material culture . 
 = = = Filming locations = = = 
 Carnivàle 's interiors were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita , California , while the show 's many exterior scenes were filmed on Southern California locations . The scenes of fictional California town of Mintern , where the stories about Brother Justin and Iris in Season 1 were based , were shot at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills . The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area , to movie ranches and to Lancaster , which were to replicate the states of Oklahoma , Texas , and New Mexico . The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season 2 was Big Sky Ranch , which was also used for Brother Justin 's new home in fictional New Canaan . 
 = = = Opening title sequence = = = 
 Carnivàle 's opening title sequence was created by A52 , a visual effects and design company based in Los Angeles , and featured music composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman . The opening title sequence won an Emmy for " Outstanding Main Title Design " in 2004 . 
 The production team of A52 had intended to " create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid @-@ 1930s , but that also allowed people to feel a larger presence of good and evil over all of time . " A52 then pitched their idea to Carnivàle executives in early 2003 , who felt that the company 's proposal was the most creative for the series ' concept . The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork , each scanned transparency being up to 300 MB in size . The resulting images were photoshopped and digitally rendered . A last step involved stock footage clips being compiled and digitally incorporated into the sequence . 
 The opening title sequence itself begins with a deck of Tarot cards falling into the sand , while the camera moves in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the American Depression era ; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times . The sequence ends with the camera shifting from the " Judgement " Tarot card to the " Moon " and the " Sun " , identifying the Devil and God respectively , until the wind blows away all cards and the underlying sand to reveal the Carnivàle title artwork . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Carnivàle features instrumental music composed by Jeff Beal , as well as many popular and obscure songs from the 1920s and 1930s , the time when Carnivàle 's story takes place . The main title was written by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman , and was released with selected themes by Jeff Beal on a Carnivàle television soundtrack by the record label Varèse Sarabande on December 7 , 2004 . Beal released tracks of Season 2 on his personal website . A complete list of music credits is available on the official HBO website . 
 Jeff Beal 's score is primarily acoustic sounding electronics , but mixes themes of bluegrass as well as atmospheric rhythmic sounds . Bigger groups of strings support smaller ensembles of guitars , pianos , violins , cellos , and trumpets . The music sometimes uses ethnic instruments such as banjos , harmonicas , ukuleles , and <unk> . 
 Because HBO does not break individual episodes with commercials , Carnivàle 's music is paced similar to a movie , with character @-@ specific leitmotifs from as early as the first episode . Characters get musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character 's ethnic background or nature . Some characters whose connections would only be disclosed later in the series have intentionally similar themes . 
 Different music is consciously used to represent the two different worlds of the story . Brother Justin 's world features music of constructed orchestral sound with religious music and instruments . On the other hand , the score of the carnival side is more deconstructed and mystical , especially when the carnival travels through the Dust Bowl and remote towns . For carnival scenes taking place in the cootch ( striptease ) show or in cities , however , contemporary pop music , blues , folk , and ethnic music is played . One of the most defining songs of Carnivàle is the 1920s song " Love Me or Leave Me " sung by Ruth <unk> , which is used in several episodes to tie characters in the two worlds thematically . 
 = = Cast = = 
 The plot of Carnivàle takes place in the 1930s Dust Bowl and revolves around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher . Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season , 15 were part of the carnival storyline . The second season amounted to 13 main cast members , supplemented by several actors in recurring roles . Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce , the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions . The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but were not part of the show 's visible structure . The audience would therefore only learn more about the characters as a natural aspect in the story . 
 Season 1 's first storyline is led by Nick Stahl portraying the protagonist Ben Hawkins , a young Okie farmer who joins a traveling carnival . Michael J. Anderson played Samson , the diminutive manager of the carnival . Tim DeKay portrayed Clayton " Jonesy " Jones , the crippled chief roustabout . Patrick Bauchau acted as the carnival 's blind mentalist Lodz , while Debra Christofferson played his lover , Lila the Bearded Lady . Diane Salinger portrayed the catatonic fortune teller Apollonia , and Clea DuVall acted as her tarot @-@ card @-@ reading daughter , Sofie . Adrienne Barbeau portrayed the snake charmer Ruthie , with Brian Turk as her son Gabriel , a strongman . John Fleck played Gecko the Lizard Man , and Karyne and Sarah Steben appeared as the conjoined twins Alexandria and Caladonia . The cootch show Dreifuss family was played by Toby Huss and Cynthia Ettinger as Felix " Stumpy " and Rita Sue , and Carla Gallo as their daughter Libby . Amanda Aday portrayed their other daughter , Dora Mae Dreifuss , in a recurring role . John Savage played the mysterious Henry Scudder in several episodes , while Linda Hunt lent her voice to the mysterious Management . The second storyline is led by Clancy Brown portraying the primary antagonist , the Methodist minister Brother Justin Crowe . Amy Madigan played his sister Iris . Robert Knepper supported them as the successful radio host Tommy Dolan later in the first season , while Ralph Waite had a recurring role as Reverend Norman Balthus , Brother Justin 's mentor . K Callan performed in a recurring role as Eleanor McGill , a parishioner who became devoted to Brother Justin after seeing his power firsthand . 
 Several cast changes took place in Season 2 , some of them planned from the beginning . John Fleck , Karyne Steben and her sister Sarah had made their last appearance in the first season 's finale , while Patrick Bauchau 's and Diane Salinger 's status was reduced to guest @-@ starring . Ralph Waite joined the regular cast . Several new characters were introduced in recurring roles , most notably John Carroll Lynch as the escaped convict Varlyn Stroud and Bree Walker as Sabina the Scorpion Lady . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The casting approach for Carnivàle was to cast the best available actors and to show the characters ' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much . Carnivàle 's casting directors John <unk> and Wendy O 'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects . The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects , but were willing to make exceptions such as for Adrienne Barbeau as Ruthie . 
 The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure , with little indication where the show would go afterwards . This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers , especially for leading characters such as Ben , Brother Justin and Sofie . The character of Ben was always intended to be the leading man and hero of the series , yet he was also desired to display a youthful , innocent and anti @-@ hero quality ; Nick Stahl had the strongest consensus among the producers . The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic gypsy girl , but Clea DuVall , a movie actor like Stahl , got the part after four auditions . Tim DeKay was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a " very American " looking baseball player of that period . One of the few actors who never had any real competition was Michael J. Anderson as Samson , whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial meeting . 
 = = Mythology = = 
 Although almost every Carnivàle episode has a distinctive story with a new carnival setting , all episodes are part of an overarching good @-@ versus @-@ evil story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2 . The pilot episode begins with a prologue talking of " a creature of light and a creature of darkness " ( also known as Avatars ) being born " to each generation " preparing for a final battle . Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation , and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question . Reviewers believed Ben to be a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness . 
 Other than through the characters , the show 's good @-@ and @-@ evil theme manifests in the series ' contemporary religion , the Christian military order Knights Templar , tarot divination , and in historical events like the Dust Bowl and humankind 's first nuclear test . The writers had established a groundwork for story arcs , character biographies and genealogical character links before filming of the seasons began , but many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers . While Ronald D. Moore was confident that Carnivàle was one of the most complicated shows on television , Daniel Knauf reassured critics that Carnivàle was intended to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext and admitted that " you may not understand everything that goes on but it does make a certain sense " . Knauf provided hints about the show 's mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two @-@ season run of Carnivàle , and left fans a production summary of Carnivàle 's first season two years after cancellation . 
 Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle " the perfect show for those who thought Twin Peaks was too accessible " . The Australian stated that Carnivàle " seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms " which " can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen , let alone a small one . It 's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television . " A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as " too artsy and esoteric " because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding " what the heck was going on , [ which ] can be a problem for a dramatic television series . " TV Zone however considered Carnivàle " a series like no other and [ ... ] the fact that it is so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths . " Carnivàle was lauded for bringing " the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life " and for being among the first TV shows to show " unmitigated pain and disappointment " , but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the " slowly unfolding sadness " appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show .

 At the time , HBO made their commitments for only one year at a time , a third season would have meant opening up a new two @-@ season book in Daniel Knauf 's six @-@ year plan , including the introduction of new storylines for current and new characters , and further clarification and elaboration on the show 's mythology . HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11 , 2005 . HBO 's president Chris Albrecht stated that the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US $ 2 million ; but the running costs for the sizable cast , the all @-@ on @-@ location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them . 
 The cancellation resulted in several story plot lines being unfinished , and outraged loyal viewers organized petitions and mailing drives to get the show renewed . This generated more than 50 @,@ 000 emails to the network in a single weekend . Show creator Daniel Knauf was unconvinced of the success of such measures , but explained that proposed alternatives like selling Carnivàle to a competing network or spinning off the story were not possible because of HBO owning Carnivàle 's plot and characters . At the same time , Knauf was hopeful that , given a strong enough fan base , HBO might reconsider the show 's future and allow the continuation of the show in another medium ; but because of the amount of unused story material he still had , Knauf did not favor finishing the Carnivàle story with a three @-@ hour movie . 
 Knauf would not release a detailed run @-@ down of intended future plots to fans , explaining that his stories are a collaboration of writers , directors and actors alike . He and the producers did , however , answer a few basic details about the immediate fate of major characters who were left in near @-@ fatal situations in the final episode of Season 2 . Knauf additionally provided in @-@ depth information regarding the underlying fictional laws of nature that the writers had not been able to fully explore in the first two seasons . June 2007 however marked the first time that a comprehensive work of detailed character backgrounds was made public . Following a fundraising auction , Knauf offered fans a so @-@ called " Pitch Document , " a summary of Carnivàle 's first season . This document was originally written in 2002 and 2003 to give the writers and the studio an idea about the series ' intended plot , and answered many of the show 's mysteries .

 HBO reportedly invested in Carnivàle 's promotion as much as for any of its primetime series launches . The series ' unconventional and complex narrative made the network deviate from its traditional marketing strategies . Teaser trailers were inserted on CD @-@ ROMs into Entertainment Weekly issues to draw attention to the show 's visual quality . 30 @-@ second TV spots were aired in national syndication , cable and local avails for four weeks before the show 's premiere instead of the usual seven days . The historical context of Carnivàle was deliberately emphasized in the show 's print art , which depicted the 17 @-@ member cast surrounding a carnival truck . This image was accompanied by a tagline of the show 's good versus evil theme : " Into each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness . " These measures were hoped to be backed up by positive critical reviews . To give ratings an initial boost , HBO placed the premiere of Carnivàle directly after the series finale of the successful Sex and the City . The series continued to receive extensive online advertisement for almost its entire run .

 Carnivàle aired on HBO on a Sunday 9 : 00 pm timeslot during its two @-@ season run between 2003 and 2005 . " Milfay " , Carnivàle 's pilot episode , drew 5 @.@ 3 million viewers for its premiere on September 14 , 2003 . This marked the best ever debut for an HBO original series at the time , caused in part by the established HBO series Sex and the City being Carnivàle 's lead @-@ in .

 = = = Critical reviews = = = 
 Many early reviews gave Carnivàle good marks but also stated that its unique characters and story might prevent it from becoming a huge mainstream audience success . Daily Variety TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that " it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be put off by the general weirdness of the show . " Phil Gallo of Variety described Carnivàle as " an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters — but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point , " and Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times suggested that " it 's as if executives at the premium cable network want to see how far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen " . James Poniewozik of Time called the first three episodes " frustrating " as well as " spellbinding . " Amanda Murray of BBC said " With so little revealed , it 's almost impossible to pass judgment on the show — it 's hard to tell if this is just good , or going to be great . " 
 Later reviews were able to judge the series based on full seasons . While the acting , set design , costuming , art direction and cinematography continued to be praised , some reviewers disfavored the writing , especially of Season 1 , saying " the plot momentum is often virtually non @-@ existent " or as " sometimes gripping but mostly boring . " Other reviewers pointed out that Carnivàle may " demand more from its audience than many are willing to invest . [ ... ] Without paying close attention , it 's tempting to assume that the show is unnecessarily cryptic and misleading . " Carnivàle 's story was surveyed as long and complex , " and if you don 't start from the beginning , you 'll be completely lost . " IGN DVD 's Matt Casamassina , however , praised the show in two reviews , writing that the " gorgeously surreal " first season " dazzles with unpredictable plot twists and scares " , and that the " extraordinary " second season was " better fantasy – better entertainment , period – than any show that dares to call itself a competitor . " 
 A significant portion of reviews drew parallels between Carnivàle and David Lynch 's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks , a show in which Carnivàle actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared . Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck 's novel The Grapes of Wrath . When Lost began to receive major critical attention , Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to Lost 's story approach in several instances . 
 Critical opinion remained divided about Carnivàle in the years after the show 's cancellation . Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper The Age remembers Carnivàle as a " smart , ambitious series that move [ s ] unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively and even with grace , but that never quite quit the surly bonds of serial drama . " Variety 's Brian Lowry remembers the show as " largely a macabre fantasy " that eventually suffered from " its own bleakness and eccentricities " . The A.V. Club dwelled on Carnivàle 's cliffhanger ending in a piece on unanswered TV questions and called the show " a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology " .

 Like other cult television shows , Carnivàle gained a respectable following of dedicated viewers . Carnivàle fans referred to themselves as " <unk> " or " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , terms adopted from the show . Carnivàle 's complexity and subliminal mythology spawned dedicated fansites , although most discussion took place on independent internet forums . Show creator Daniel Knauf actively participated in online fandom and offered <unk> and mythology @-@ related clues . He also gave insight into reasons for Carnivàle 's cancellation on a messageboard before speaking to the press . 
 One year after Carnivàle 's cancellation , a major Carnivàle convention called <unk> 2006 Live ! was organized by fans . It took place in Woodland Hills , California on August 21 – 23 , 2006 . Many of the show 's cast and crew attended the event and participated in discussion panels , which were recorded and made available on DVD afterwards .

 HBO president Chris Albrecht stated that Carnivàle was " not a big show for foreign [ distribution ] , " but did not go into more detail . Reviews however indicate that the show 's cryptic mythology and inaccessibility to the casual viewer were major factors . Nevertheless , Carnivàle was sold to several foreign networks and was distributed to HBO channels abroad . The DVD releases of Carnivàle extended the availability of the show further .

 On June 9 , 2005 , a lawsuit was filed in United States district court by Los Angeles writer Jeff Bergquist . He claimed that the creators of Carnivàle did not originate the idea for the show , but rather stole it from his unpublished novel Beulah , a quirky drama set amid a traveling carnival during the Depression that Bergquist had been working on since the 1980s . Bergquist sought both recognition and punitive damages by arguing that HBO and Carnivàle creator Daniel Knauf violated his copyright on Beulah , but HBO and Knauf denied any claims as having " absolutely no merit .

 = Lafayette dollar = 
 The Lafayette dollar was a silver coin issued as part of the United States participation in the Paris World 's Fair of 1900 . Depicting Lafayette with George Washington and designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber , it was the only U.S. silver dollar commemorative prior to 1983 , and the first U.S. coin to depict American citizens . 
 Beginning in 1898 , prominent Americans sought to erect in Paris a monument to Lafayette , a Frenchman who fought in the American Revolutionary War . Among these supporters was Chicago businessman Ferdinand Peck , whom President William McKinley chose as commissioner @-@ general to the exposition . Peck made the monument proposal a part of the American plans for Paris , and appointed the Lafayette Memorial Commission to raise funds for it . A part of this fundraising was the one @-@ dollar commemorative coin , approved by Congress on March 3 , 1899 . 
 <unk> busts of Washington and Lafayette appear on the obverse . Barber stated that the bases for his work were a sculpture of Washington by Jean @-@ Antoine Houdon , and an 1824 medal of Lafayette by François @-@ Augustin Caunois . For the reverse , he used an early sketch of the planned monument , designed by Paul Wayland Bartlett , whose last name appears on the base of the statue on the reverse . The coins did not sell out , and 14 @,@ 000 were later melted by the United States Treasury . The Lafayette dollar is valued from several hundred dollars to tens of thousands , depending on condition . 
 = = Background = = 
 Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette was born on September 6 , 1757 to a noble French family . When the boy was less than two years old , his father was killed at the Battle of Minden , making the toddler a wealthy nobleman . The young marquis married in 1774 . 
 In 1775 , while on military duty in Metz , Lafayette heard of the rebellion against British rule in North America . The young officer quickly came to believe that the American cause was noble . On learning that the Second Continental Congress lacked funds , Lafayette hired a ship at his own expense and in 1777 sailed for America , though he initially received a cold reception from the Congress . So many foreign officers had sought to be a part of the Continental Army that its commanding general , George Washington , asked that no more be engaged . Lafayette 's application , which sought no pay , met with eventual success . Congress had received a letter from the American envoy to France , Benjamin Franklin , stating that Lafayette 's family was wealthy and influential . Franklin urged Congress to accommodate Lafayette , and also keep him safe and out of the action lest his death harm the American cause . 
 Congress dutifully voted in July 1777 to commission Lafayette as a major general , and sent him to meet Washington . The two men formed a very close relationship despite a quarter @-@ century difference in age . Franklin 's wish to keep Lafayette safe was frustrated by the young man 's desire to be where battles raged , and he was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777 . France soon entered the war on the American side , and was instrumental in the victory . Lafayette helped lead the decisive Yorktown campaign , leading to the surrender of British Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis . 
 Lafayette returned to France after 1781 , a national hero in both countries . He returned to the United States in 1784 , his last visit for 40 years . In France , he involved himself in politics , favoring a constitutional monarchy . He was given office and commands after the French Revolution , but was captured by the Austrians in 1792 , remaining in captivity for five years . After Napoleon arranged his release , Lafayette remained on his estates and away from politics during the Emperor 's rule . After the restoration of the monarchy in 1815 , he again engaged himself in politics , sitting in the Chamber of Deputies . 
 In 1824 , the American Congress voted unanimously to have President James Monroe invite Lafayette to return as the guest of the nation . The marquis and his son , George Washington Lafayette , arrived in New York City to mammoth celebrations . Over the next year and a half , Lafayette visited all 24 states . He was given innumerable honors and gifts , including land in Florida . The marquis returned to France in 1825 , and died in 1834 . One of only eight people to be made an honorary citizen of the United States , according to Arnie Slabaugh in his book on commemorative coins , " Lafayette became so popular and respected in both countries that the friendship he helped cement between the two nations has extended to this day " . 
 = = Inception = = 
 In March 1898 , a resolution was introduced in Congress for a commission to erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris on behalf of the United States . The bill passed the Senate , and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs . Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill , which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish – American War . 
 Later in 1898 , President William McKinley appointed Peck as United States Commissioner @-@ General to the 1900 Exposition Universelle , a World 's Fair to be held in Paris , France . Peck revived the Lafayette proposal as part of the American participation in the fair , and created a Lafayette Memorial Commission to supervise the monument project . The commission was to ensure that the monument was unveiled on July 4 , 1900 — both Independence Day and also United States Day at the exposition . On September 1 , 1898 , Peck appointed a number of prominent Americans to the commission , including Iowa Senator William B. Allison , Secretary of State William R. Day , Archbishop John Ireland , and Reverend Edward Everett Hale . The commission 's officers included the treasurer , Comptroller of the Currency ( and future Vice President of the United States ) Charles G. Dawes , and the secretary , Robert J. Thompson . 
 Fundraising to build the Lafayette monument was a major component of the commission 's work , and it sought to involve American schools and schoolchildren in the project . October 19 , 1898 — the 117th anniversary of Cornwallis 's surrender at Yorktown — was proclaimed the first " Lafayette Day " by 42 governors or commissioners of education of the states or territories . Although President McKinley did not issue a similar proclamation , he did praise the plan in a letter printed in the press . Special ceremonies in honor of Lafayette ( along with appropriate lesson plans ) were observed in many schools , and pupils were called upon to donate cents in honor of the French patriot . A total of $ 45 @,@ 858 @.@ 30 was obtained from the events at the schools ; those institutions were furnished , on the next Lafayette Day ( intended to be annual ) , with ornate receipts , signed by Dawes and meant as <unk> to descend to posterity . 
 Another proposed means of paying for the statue was a commemorative coin . In early 1899 , the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $ 50 @,@ 000 in the form of 100 @,@ 000 commemorative half dollars , that could be sold to the public at a premium . Such a method had helped to finance ( though with mixed success ) the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . Instead , Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3 , 1899 , a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50 @,@ 000 silver one @-@ dollar pieces to be granted to the commission . The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint 's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act , though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904 . Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $ 25 @,@ 000 . In the event , the United States Treasury bought 38 @,@ 675 @.@ 875 troy ounces of silver for $ 23 @,@ 032 @.@ 80 . The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director , with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Once the bill passed , Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber took personal charge of the project , seeking to avoid the delays and disputes that had marked the two previous commemoratives , the Columbian half dollar and the Isabella quarter . On March 24 , 1899 , Mint Director George E. Roberts wrote in a letter that the Lafayette Memorial Commission was contemplating having , on one side of the coin , a representation of the new monument . Barber responded the following day to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Henry Boyer , referencing that letter and asking for a sketch of the monument . 
 By April 12 , 1899 , the chief engraver had obtained from commission secretary Thompson a preliminary sketch of the monument — an equestrian statue by Paul Bartlett . Barber sketched other designs , including one with Lafayette 's 1784 prayer for the prosperity of the United States . He also created one showing a standing figure of Lafayette , based on a statement by Thompson that they might omit the horse . Barber 's concepts showing an equestrian statue for one side , and jugate heads of Lafayette and Washington for the other , would form the basis for the eventual coin . Roberts quickly approved Barber 's sketch of the two heads , and without consulting the commission leaked the information to the American Journal of Numismatics , which printed it in its April 1899 issue . 
 On May 23 , 1899 , Barber wrote to Roberts that he planned to base the Washington bust ( on the obverse ) on the well @-@ known 1785 bust of the first president by Jean @-@ Antoine Houdon , and upon an early <unk> use of the Houdon bust , the 1786 " Washington Before Boston " medal by Pierre @-@ Simon @-@ Benjamin Duvivier . The Lafayette bust ( also on the obverse ) was to be based on a 1824 medal of Lafayette by François @-@ Augustin Caunois . 
 Peck and other commission members were not satisfied with the design proposals , and suggested some of their own . Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8 . Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown , with no depiction of the rest of the head . Barber stated , " I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor 's standpoint , and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation 's history , which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon . " At the instructions of Roberts , Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15 . Afterwards , Barber reported to the Mint Director , " I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer " and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design , even on a silver dollar ( the largest US coin ) was limited , " and as it is the desire of the Committee [ commission ] to have the monument displayed , the prayer will have to find some other place " . Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies , " I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument , and the sculptor 's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen ... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900 . " 
 On June 20 , 1899 , Barber submitted the final designs for the coin . They were approved by Director Roberts on July 1 . This did not put an end to the wrangles over what should be on the coin : the commission wished to have the coins dated 1900 , but have them to sell as early as possible in 1899 . Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage insisted on the provision of the Coinage Act of 1873 that required the date of production to appear on the coins . In the end , the matter was compromised : the pieces were struck in December 1899 , not distributed until the following month , and the inscription " Paris 1900 " appears on the coins . 
 = = Design = = 
 The obverse of the Lafayette dollar features jugate , or conjoined , heads of Washington and Lafayette . Slabaugh noted Barber 's account that the busts were based on the sculpture by Houdon and the medal by Caunois , but , " possibly these did have some effect on the design but it has always been my belief that the immediate source or idea for the design was the Yorktown Centennial medal of 1881 . " Swiatek and Breen contended that although the ultimate ancestor of Barber 's depiction of Washington was the Houdon bust , the source of the Lafayette bust and the format of the obverse " was beyond doubt Peter L. Krider 's Yorktown Centennial Medal ( 1881 ) " . Krider , a Philadelphia engraver not employed by the Mint , issued a number of tokens and medals in the 1870s and 1880s . " United States of America " and " Lafayette Dollar " appear at the top and bottom of the obverse of the coin . 
 The reverse is based on an early sketch of the statue of Lafayette by Bartlett . It depicts a mounted statue of Lafayette , riding left . Barber 's monogram does not appear on the coin , but the name " Bartlett " is inscribed on the base of the statue . Also on the base , and extending below it , is a palm branch . The reverse inscription , " Erected by the youth of the United States in honor of Gen Lafayette / Paris 1900 " is a tribute to the school fundraising efforts that took place in 1898 . Swiatek and Breen pointed out that even if one grants that the 1900 date was intended to be that of the exposition and the erection of the statue , the coins would still violate the 1873 act , that required the date of mintage to appear on the coins , and thus " the Lafayette dollars are technically undated and therefore illegal ! " 
 On the reverse , Lafayette holds a sword , extended upwards . Bartlett described the version of the statue that Barber worked from : " Lafayette is represented in the statue as a fact and a symbol , offering his sword and services to the American colonists in the cause of liberty . He appears as the emblem of the aristocratic and enthusiastic sympathy shown by France to our forefathers . " Swiatek and Breen noted , " We may take Lafayette 's pose on the statue , as depicted on the coin , to represent him in triumphal procession rather than charging against the enemy — note his sheathed sword , like a Highland pipe major 's baton , serving as a standard rather than brandished unsheathed as a weapon . " 
 Barber 's design for the Lafayette dollar has often been criticized . Swiatek and Breen complained about the " lifeless head of the President [ Washington ] " . Q. David Bowers stated that " the shallow relief of Barber 's work is but a travesty of Krider 's extremely detailed high @-@ relief artistry " . According to Don Taxay , " When one compares Barber 's portraits to those by Du Vivier [ sic ] and Caunois , it is clear why [ sculptor and Barber enemy ] Saint @-@ Gaudens used to refer contemptuously to the " commercial medalists of the Mint " . The difference here is not merely in the relief , but in elementary modeling skill . " Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that , " the Lafayette dollar lacks the quaint , dated appeal of the Isabella quarter or the amusing originality of the Columbian half @-@ dollar . Despite the necessity for low relief the jugate busts are too linear . The reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size . The words ' Paris 1900 ' might have been enough ; at most , the addition of ' From the Youth of the United States ' would have conveyed the matter . " 
 = = Production and aftermath = = 
 All Lafayette dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on December 14 , 1899 , the centennial of the death of George Washington . The Philadelphia Public Ledger reported , 
 Present at this small Lafayette dollar ceremony were several Mint officials , members of the Lafayette Memorial Commission and a few members of the press . After Miss <unk> [ the coining press operator ] removed the first Lafayette dollar struck , she presented it to Mint Superintendent Henry Boyer . Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber then inspected it . It was then shown to Robert J. Thompson , secretary of the Memorial Commission , and then given to Director of the Mint George E. Roberts . It was placed in a coin or medal case and brought back to Washington , D.C. , by Mr. Roberts , to be given to President William McKinley . The coin was then to be sent in an elaborate $ 1 @,@ 000 presentation case , to be given to the president of the French Republic . 
 Once the ceremony at the Philadelphia Mint had concluded , striking of the Lafayette dollar continued on an older coinage press capable of minting eighty pieces per minute , or 4 @,@ 800 per hour . A total of 50 @,@ 026 pieces were struck , including 26 coins laid aside for inspection and testing at the 1900 meeting of the United States Assay Commission . 
 The first Columbian half dollar had been sold for $ 10 @,@ 000 . An offer of $ 5 @,@ 000 was made but declined for the first Lafayette dollar to be struck , which was designated for presentation to the French president . Thompson , designated a special commissioner of the United States for the purpose , took the casket to France aboard the S.S. La Champagne . The ceremony was originally scheduled for February 22 , 1900 ( Washington 's Birthday ) , but was not held until March 3 , when Thompson presented the casket and coin to French President Émile Loubet . The two objects are now in the Louvre . 
 The commission was plagued by a number of financial difficulties . In January 1900 , sculptor Charles Henry Niehaus questioned why $ 150 @,@ 000 was the fundraising target of the commission , as no equestrian statue had ever cost more than half that . The commission was sued by architect Henry Hornbostel , demanding fees for designing a pedestal for Bartlett 's statue . The out @-@ of @-@ court settlement reimbursed him for his expenses . 
 The commission was tardy in giving the final order for the statue to Bartlett , so late that it was impossible to have the final bronze piece ready in time ; a one @-@ third model was only completed in May . According to Q. David Bowers , " the French are at home in such problems . " The commission was able to have a full @-@ sized plaster model ready by July 4 by sawing the scale model in pieces and distributing them to various workshops , that made enlargements in plaster . Brought together , the plaster pieces fitted perfectly . This assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in the Place du Carrousel on July 4 , 1900 . Afterwards , Bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the design , and changed them . His bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from the statue depicted on the coin . Changes made included the elimination of Lafayette 's three @-@ cornered hat , and the position of the raised arm and sword . The statue stood there for almost eighty years , but was displaced in the 1980s during the excavations for I. M. Pei 's glass pyramid at the Louvre . It now stands on Cours @-@ la @-@ Reine in Paris , along the River Seine . 
 Once the coins were minted , the commission began sales at $ 2 each . After February 1900 , when the commission moved its offices from Chicago to Paris , sales were handled by the American Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago . Only small numbers were sold to coin collectors . Sales , conducted through the bank , continued for several years . Prices initially dropped on the secondary market — the pieces could be purchased for $ 1 @.@ 10 in 1903 — and thousands may have been released into circulation , or were spent by purchasers in hard times . By 1920 , the market price passed the original issue price , and thereafter prices rose steadily , reaching $ 3 @.@ 50 by 1930 , $ 5 at the height of the commemorative coin boom in July 1936 , $ 13 by 1950 , $ 55 by 1960 , and $ 650 by 1975 .

 In 1925 , numismatist George H. Clapp discovered a Lafayette dollar that slightly differed from published descriptions . He researched the matter further over the following decade , and discovered two additional varieties . These exist because multiple dies , for both obverse and reverse , were used in striking the Lafayette piece , and the dies were not identical . Swiatek , writing in 2012 , noted a fifth die combination he had discovered , and examined images of hundreds of Lafayette dollars he owned or that were on the Internet . He reported that two varieties combined for more than 90 % of the specimens , with the remaining ones much rarer . Because of this , he speculated that the dollars were struck on at least two machines , not one as usually reported , with the rarer varieties the result of replacement dies being inserted as the original ones wore out . The differences are minor ( for example , whether the M in " America " is raised or even with the A that precedes it on the obverse , and details of the palm branch on the reverse ) and the coin is rarely collected by die type , meaning that little premium value attaches to the less common varieties . 
 R.S. Yeoman 's 2014 edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $ 650 in Almost Uncirculated ( AU @-@ 50 ) ranging upwards to $ 19 @,@ 000 in near @-@ pristine MS @-@ 66 . One in MS @-@ 67 condition , tied with multiple others for the best condition known , sold in 2004 for $ 66 @,@ 700 . Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no attempt was made to preserve their appearance for collectors . Although whether the specimen is well @-@ struck or not rarely affects value , clearly struck specimens will show the engraving line separating Lafayette 's boot from the rest of his uniform , and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct . The highest points on the coin , at which wear should be most apparent , are Washington 's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse . 
 The coin has been counterfeited from time to time . Various techniques have also been used to make genuine specimens shinier to deceive collectors , including polishing , a process that damages their surfaces and patina . 
 = Solaris ( 1972 film ) = 
 Solaris ( Russian : <unk> , tr . <unk> ) is a 1972 Soviet science fiction art film adaptation of Polish author Stanisław Lem 's novel Solaris ( 1961 ) . The film was co @-@ written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky . The film is a meditative psychological drama occurring mostly aboard a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris . The scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into separate emotional crises . Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the Solaris space station to evaluate the situation only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others . 
 The original science fiction novel is about the ultimate inadequacy of communication between humans and other species . Tarkovsky 's adaptation is a " drama of grief and partial recovery " concentrated upon the thoughts and the consciences of the cosmonaut scientists studying Solaris ' mysterious ocean . In loyalty to the novel 's complex and slow @-@ paced narrative , Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre , viewing most of western science fiction as shallow . The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker ( 1979 ) . 
 The critically successful Solaris features Natalya Bondarchuk ( Hari ) , Donatas Banionis ( Kris Kelvin ) , Jüri Järvet ( Dr Snaut ) , Vladislav Dvorzhetsky ( Henri Berton ) , Nikolai Grinko ( Kris Kelvin 's Father ) , Olga Barnet ( Kris Kelvin 's Mother ) , Anatoli Solonitsyn ( Dr Sartorius ) , and Sos Sargsyan ( Dr Gibarian ) ; the music is by Johann Sebastian Bach and Eduard Artemyev . At the 1972 Cannes Film Festival , it won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury , the FIPRESCI prize and was nominated for the Palme d 'Or . The film is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Psychologist Kris Kelvin ( Donatas Banionis ) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides . Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris . After decades of study , the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed . The crew is sending confusing messages . Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue . 
 Henri Berton ( Vladislav Dvorzhetsky ) , a former space pilot , visits Kelvin . They watch film footage of Berton 's own testimony years before of seeing a four @-@ meter @-@ tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists . However , the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface ; Berton 's report was dismissed as hallucinations . After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience , Berton angrily departs , only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car . He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission , and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris . 
 Before departing Earth for Solaris , Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire , noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated . In Kelvin 's last conversation with his father ( Nikolai Grinko ) , they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return . Although he readily accepted the mission , it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin 's conscience . 
 Upon his arrival at Solaris Station , a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris , none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin , who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected . He soon learns that his friend among the scientists , Dr. Gibarian ( Sos Sargsyan ) , had killed himself . The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive . Kelvin soon glimpses other people aboard the station , not supposed to be there . Upon entering the late Gibarian 's room , Kelvin finds a rambling cryptic farewell video message from Gibarian addressed to him . 
 Waking exhausted from a restless sleep , Kelvin finds a woman with him in his quarters despite the barricaded door . To his surprise , it is Hari ( Natalya Bondarchuk ) , his late wife who committed suicide some years before . She is unaware of what has happened or how she got there . Terrified by her presence , he lures her into a space capsule and launches the replica of his wife into outer space . In his haste to be rid of her he is scorched by the rocket 's blast . Dr. Snaut tends to his burns and explains that the " visitors " began appearing after the scientists attracted the attention of Solaris , seemingly a sentient entity . 
 That evening , Hari reappears in his quarters . This time Kelvin calmly accepts her presence and embraces Hari throughout the night . Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him . She hysterically tears her way through the room 's metal door , severely cutting herself . Before he can give first aid , her injuries heal before his eyes . Dr. Sartorius ( Anatoli Solonitsyn ) calls for a meeting , and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife . In their symposium , the scientists begin to understand that Solaris created Hari from Kelvin 's memories of his dead wife . The Hari present among them , though not human , thinks and feels as though she were . Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of " neutrino systems " but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as " the <unk> " . 
 Kelvin shows Hari films of himself and his parents when he was a boy and , later , of his wife . While she is asleep , Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin 's brainwave patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions as communication . However , Sartorius suggests a radical attack of heavy radiation bombardment . In time , Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin 's presence . She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier , and Kelvin is forced to tell her the entire story . Sartorius , Snaut , Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument during which Sartorius tells Hari that she is not human , but a mere copy . Distressed , Hari kills herself again by drinking liquid oxygen , only to painfully , <unk> resurrect a few minutes later . On the surface of Solaris , the ocean is moving even faster . 
 Kelvin goes to sleep only to wake up agitated and running a fever and gives a monologue to Snaut on the subject of suffering and universal love , then falls asleep again . He dreams of his mother as a young woman , caring for him and expressing her worry concerning Kelvin 's emotional state . When he awakens , Hari is gone , and Snaut reads him the farewell note she left behind . The note indicates that Hari petitioned the two scientists to destroy her . Snaut tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin 's brainwaves at Solaris , the visitors stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet 's surface . Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to descend to Solaris in hopes of reconnecting with everything he has loved and lost . 
 Again at the shore of the frozen lake , Kelvin finds himself at his father 's house . His dog runs to him , and he happily walks towards it . He realizes something is peculiar , however , when he sees that his father seems oblivious to the fact that it 's raining inside the house . Father and son embrace on the front step of the lakeside house which the camera zooms out to reveal is located on an island in the middle of an ocean on the planet Solaris .

 In 1968 , the director Andrei Tarkovsky had two motives for cinematically adapting the Polish science fiction novel , Solaris ( 1961 ) , by Stanisław Lem : firstly , he admired Lem 's work . Secondly , he needed work and money , because his previous film , Andrei Rublev ( 1966 ) had gone unreleased , and his screenplay , A White , White Day , had been rejected ( even though in 1975 it would be realised as The Mirror ) . A film of a novel by Stanisław Lem , a popular and critically respected writer in the USSR , was a logical commercial and artistic choice . Tarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the cinematic adaptation of the novel Solaris . With <unk> <unk> , Tarkovsky co @-@ wrote the first screenplay in the Summer of 1969 ; two @-@ thirds of it occurred on Earth . The Mosfilm committee disliked it and Lem got furious over this unacceptably drastic alteration of his novel . The final screenplay yielded the shooting script which has less action on Earth , and Kelvin 's marriage to his second wife , Maria , was deleted from the story . 
 In the literary Solaris , Lem describes science 's inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form , because certain forms , at least , of sentient extra @-@ terrestrial life may operate well outside of human experience and understanding . In the cinematic Solaris , Tarkovsky concentrates upon Kelvin 's feelings for his wife , Hari , and the impact of outer space exploration upon the human condition . Dr. Gibarian 's monologue [ from the novel 's sixth chapter ] is the highlight of the final library scene , wherein Snaut says , " We don 't need other worlds . We need mirrors " . Unlike the novel , which begins with psychologist Kris Kelvin 's spaceflight , and occurs entirely on Solaris , the film shows Kelvin 's visit to his parents ' house in the country before leaving Earth for Solaris . The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives – a vibrantly living Earth versus an austere , closed @-@ in space station orbiting the planet Solaris – demonstrating and questioning space exploration 's impact upon the human psyche . 
 The set design of Solaris features paintings by the Old Masters . The interior of the space station is decorated with full reproductions of the 1565 painting cycle of The Months ( The Hunters in the Snow , The Gloomy Day , The Hay Harvest , The Harvesters , and The Return of the Herd ) , by Pieter Brueghel the Elder , and details of Landscape with the Fall of Icarus and The Hunters in the Snow ( 1565 ) . The scene of Kelvin kneeling before his father and the father embracing him alludes to The Return of the Prodigal Son ( 1669 ) , by Rembrandt . The references and allusions are Tarkovsky 's efforts to give the young art of cinema a historic perspective of centuries , to evoke the viewer 's feeling that cinema is a mature art . 
 The film references Tarkovsky 's earlier 1966 film Andrei Rublev by having an icon by Andrei Rublev being placed in Kelvin 's room . It thus forms the second part , together with Tarkovsky 's next film The Mirror which was made in 1975 and which references Andrei Rublev by having a poster of the film being hanged on a wall , in a series of three films by Tarkovsky referencing Andrei Rublev . 
 = = = The cast = = = 
 Initially , Tarkovsky wanted his ex @-@ wife , Irma Raush , as Hari . After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970 , however , he decided that she was a better actress for the role . Wishing to work with Tarkovsky , Andersson accepted her salary in rubles . Nevertheless , Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari . Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography . It was she who had introduced the novel , Solaris to him . Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part . He instead recommended her to director Larisa <unk> who cast her in You and I. Half @-@ a @-@ year later , Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all . 
 Tarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis as Kris Kelvin , the Estonian actor Jüri Järvet as Dr. Snaut , the Russian actor Anatoly Solonitsyn as Dr. Sartorius , the Ukrainian actor Nikolai Grinko as Kelvin 's father , and Olga Barnet as Kelvin 's mother . Earlier , the director had worked with Solonitsyn , who had played Andrei Rublev ( 1966 ) , and with Nikolai Grinko , who appeared in Andrei Rublev and Ivan 's Childhood ( 1962 ) . Tarkovsky thought Solonitsyn and Grinko would need extra directorial assistance . After filming was almost completed , Tarkovsky rated actors and performances thus : Bondarchuk , Järvet , Solonitsyn , Banionis , Dvorzhetsky , and Grinko ; yet wrote in his diary that “ Natalya B. has outshone everybody ” .

 In the summer of 1970 , the USSR State Committee for Cinematography ( Goskino SSSR ) authorized the production of Solaris , with a length of 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 13 @,@ 123 ft ) , equivalent to a two @-@ hour @-@ twenty @-@ minute running time . The exteriors were photographed at Zvenigorod , near Moscow ; the interiors were photographed at the Mosfilm studios . The scenes of space pilot Berton driving through a city were photographed in Japan , in September and October 1971 , at Akasaka and <unk> in Tokyo . The original plan was to film futuristic structures at the World Expo ' 70 but the trip was delayed . The shooting began in March 1971 with cinematographer Vadim <unk> who also photographed <unk> 's previous films . They quarreled so much on this film that they ended up never working together again . The first version of Solaris was completed in December 1971 . 
 The Earth , the sensual source of life , and the sterile space station orbiting the planet Solaris , are contrasted with lively images of underwater plants , fire , snow , rain and other natural phenomena . A similar contrast appears at story 's end on Solaris with Kelvin 's " Winter " visit to his father 's house , featuring a frozen pond surrounded by bare trees . The dead scenery of this island on Solaris contrasts with the earlier , Summer pond scenes of long @-@ bladed green grasses or ferns gently floating in the water current underneath blooming trees . The Solaris ocean was created with acetone , aluminium powder , and dyes . Mikhail <unk> designed the space station as lived @-@ in , beat @-@ up and decrepit rather than shiny , neat and futuristic . The designer and director consulted with scientist and aerospace engineer <unk> , who lent them a 1960s @-@ era mainframe computer for set decoration . For some of the sequences , <unk> designed a mirror room which enabled the cameraman , <unk> , to hide within a mirrored sphere so as to be invisible in the finished film . Akira Kurosawa , who was visiting the Mosfilm studios just then , expressed admiration for the space station design . 
 In January 1972 , the State Committee for Cinematography requested editorial changes before releasing Solaris . These included a more realistic film with a clearer image of the future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity . Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes , and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The soundtrack of Solaris features the chorale prelude for organ , Ich ruf ' zu dir , Herr Jesu Christ ( BWV 639 ) , by Johann Sebastian Bach , and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev . The prelude is the central musical theme of Solaris . Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score . The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music . In counterpoint to classical music as Earth 's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris . The character of Hari has her own <unk> , a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach 's music featuring Artemyev 's composition atop it ; it is heard at Hari 's death and at story 's end . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Solaris premiered at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and was nominated for the Palme d 'Or . In the USSR , the film premiered in the Mir film theater in Moscow on February 5 , 1973 . Tarkovsky did not consider the Mir cinema the best projection venue . Despite the film 's narrow release in only five film theaters in the USSR , the film nevertheless sold 10 @.@ 5 million tickets . Unlike the vast majority of commercial and ideological films in the 1970s , Solaris was screened in the USSR in limited runs for 15 years without any breaks , giving it cult status . In the Eastern Bloc and in the West , Solaris premiered later . In the United States , a version of Solaris that was truncated by 30 minutes premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on October 6 , 1976 . 
 Although Stanisław Lem worked with Tarkovsky and Friedrich <unk> in developing the screenplay , Lem maintained that he " never really liked Tarkovsky 's version " of his novel . Tarkovsky wanted a film story based on the novel but artistically independent of its origin . However , Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel . Lem went as far as to say that Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris , omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book . Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and that he expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece . Tarkovsky 's film is about the inner lives of its scientists as human beings . Lem 's novel is about the conflicts of man 's condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe . For Tarkovsky , Lem 's exposition of that existential conflict was the starting point for describing the inner lives of the characters . 
 In the autobiographical documentary Voyage in Time ( 1983 ) , Tarkovsky says he viewed Solaris as an artistic failure because his film did not transcend genre as he believed his film Stalker ( 1979 ) did due to the required technological dialogue and special effects . M. Galina in the 1997 article Identifying Fears called this film " one of the biggest events in the Soviet science fiction cinema " and one of the few works that does not seem anachronistic nowadays . 
 A list of " The 100 Best Films of World Cinema " compiled by Empire magazine in 2010 ranked Tarkovsky 's Solaris at No. 68 . In 2002 , Steven Soderbergh wrote and directed an American adaptation of Solaris , which starred George Clooney . 
 Salman Rushdie calls Solaris " a sci @-@ fi masterpiece " , and has urged that : " This exploration of the unreliability of reality and the power of the human unconscious , this great examination of the limits of rationalism and the perverse power of even the most ill @-@ fated love , needs to be seen as widely as possible before it 's transformed by Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron into what they ludicrously threaten will be 2001 meets Last Tango in Paris . ' What , sex in space with floating butter ? Tarkovsky must be turning over in his grave . " 
 Film critic Roger Ebert compared the 2011 film Another Earth with Solaris by noting that Another Earth " is as thought @-@ provoking , in a less profound way , than Tarkovsky 's Solaris , another film about a sort of parallel Earth . " 
 In an example of life imitating art , Natalya Bondarchuk ( Hari ) revealed in a 2010 interview that she fell in love with Tarkovsky during the filming of Solaris and , after their relationship ended , became suicidal . She claims her decision was partly influenced by her role as such a woman in the film " Solaris " . 
 The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival .

 = Leonard W. Murray = 
 Rear Admiral Leonard Warren Murray , CB , CBE ( 22 June 1896 – 25 November 1971 ) was an officer of the Royal Canadian Navy who played a significant role in the Battle of the Atlantic . He commanded the Newfoundland Escort Force from 1941 – 1943 , and from 1943 to the end of the war was Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Canadian Northwest Atlantic . He was the only Canadian to command an Allied theatre of operations during World War I or World War II . 
 = = Early years to the end of World War I = = 
 Leonard Warren Murray was born at Granton , Nova Scotia on 22 June 1896 . His father Simon Dickson Murray ( 1859 – 1936 ) was a direct descendant of the Scottish immigrants who travelled to Pictou County on the Hector in 1773 , and his mother was Jane Falconer ( 1868 – 1968 ) . Simon was mid @-@ level manager in various enterprises in Pictou Landing , and Leonard grew up close to the water . At 14 years of age , Murray left Pictou Academy to join the first intake of 21 recruits into the Royal Naval College of Canada in Halifax , which had just been created by the Naval Service Act of 4 May 1910 . 
 " The first winter at the naval college was absolute hell , we had no uniforms , we arrived in what we stood up in and had to send home for further clothing . A case of measles broke out very shortly and we were quarantined , and the only time we got out of the college was when we went to the skating rink to play hockey ; and that was a great relief . " - Admiral Murray . 
 Immediately after graduating in January 1913 , he served as a Midshipman on the Royal Navy vessel HMS Berwick on duty protecting British interests in the Mexican Revolution , and then aboard HMS Essex . At the outbreak of World War I he was assigned to the protected cruiser HMCS Niobe , the largest ship in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War I. Four of his classmates were sent to the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Good Hope and were killed off the coast of South America on 1 November 1914 at the Battle of Coronel – thereby becoming the first Canadian @-@ service casualties of World War I. Murray served briefly as Flotilla Gunnery Officer on HMCS Margaret and then in February 1916 was promoted to Sub @-@ Lieutenant while aboard HMCS Rainbow . He spent the last two years of World War I as Assistant Navigating Officer on HMS Leviathan from January 1917 as Lieutenant , where he set up troop convoys across the Atlantic to outwit German U @-@ boats – invaluable experience for the Battle of the Atlantic more than 20 years later . Murray ended the war in the North Sea aboard HMS Agincourt , and witnessed the surrender of the German fleet at Scapa Flow . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 After World War I , Murray served briefly on HMS Ithuriel , and then on the newly commissioned HMS Calcutta under the distinguished British Captain Percy Noble , from whom Murray learned the basic skills of command , and who eighteen years later served opposite Murray on the receiving end of the convoys as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Western Approaches Command . Following a short tour aboard HMS Crescent , Murray was assigned to HMS Aurora as Navigation Officer , until Aurora was paid off in 1921 due to naval budget cuts . Leonard married Jean Chaplin Scott in Westmount , Quebec on 10 October 1921 , and with the Royal Canadian Navy depleted of ships on which he could serve , at this point he considered a civilian career , in 1924 qualifying as master of a foreign @-@ going vessel . Deciding to remain with the armed forces , Murray joined many of his colleagues and spent the inter @-@ war years alternating between shore assignments as a training officer with the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve , and serving aboard Royal Navy vessels , which in Murray 's case included HMS Revenge ( during a tour in 1923 in Turkey where he befriended Lord Louis Mountbatten ) , and HMS Queen Elizabeth . Understandably , this provided Murray and his peers , including Percy W. Nelles , with a distinct anglophile and , in matters military , Royal Navy bias . In January 1925 , Murray was promoted to Lieutenant @-@ Commander and spent two years at the Royal Canadian Navy 's main training base at HMCS Stadacona . In 1927 , Murray returned to the UK where he did a tour aboard HMS Tiger and then spent 1928 studying at the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich . During a simulation exercise at the College , Murray broke new ground by planning large convoys - convoys that were regarded at the time as " almost suicidal " , but which had become normal by the time of the Battle of the Atlantic . Upon return to Canada in January 1929 , Murray was promoted to Commander and became the senior naval officer at CFB Esquimalt . In notes for a lecture to RMC Kingston in 1932 , his continuing interest in the offensive merit of convoys over patrols is evident : 
 " The institution of a system of convoy requires a reorientation of the protective forces . Instead of patrolling the focal areas [ where vessels congregate near ports or narrow passages ] , the group of ships forming the convoy is escorted by an armed escort capable of dealing with any possible scale of attack . This may mean that an increase in the protective force is necessary , but ... the protective force is more definite and concrete than in the patrolling method . In the convoy method ... it is not possible for an enemy to attack without laying herself open to attack and possible destruction " - Admiral Murray . 
 From June 1932 Murray was assigned for a year to Naval Service Headquarters in Ottawa as a Naval Staff Officer before setting back to sea for two years , leading the small fleet of East Coast destroyers from the bridge of his first operational command HMCS Saguenay . At this point , in mid @-@ 1934 , Murray was appointed to a new position of Senior Naval Officer , Halifax , a position that combined the Commander of the East Coast with the Command of the Naval Dockyard in Halifax . In June 1936 Murray was sent back to the UK to work in the Admiralty Operations Division , and in December 1936 he started his final tour with the Royal Navy serving as Executive Officer aboard the former battleship HMS Iron Duke , where he participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review . In August 1938 , in the middle of a final year at the Imperial Defence College , Murray was promoted to Captain , and so it was that , on the eve of World War II when the Royal Navy was mobilized , Murray returned to Ottawa as a Captain , and Director Naval Operations and Training .

 At the outbreak of World War II , he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff . From this <unk> position Murray played a key role in the build @-@ up of the Navy to its eventual wartime strength of approximately 332 vessels , including crossing Canada to recruit retired Royal Navy officers back into the Royal Canadian Navy , and advocating for the " small @-@ ship anti @-@ submarine " investment strategy that was eventually so successful . In March 1940 he made a secret visit to the UK to negotiate the construction of destroyers in the UK for the Royal Canadian Navy , and subsequently was a founding member of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence . It was while he was working for the <unk> that he renewed his friendship with Commander James " <unk> " Prentice , who was shortly thereafter assigned the position of Senior Officer , Canadian Corvettes under Murray . Both men would work closely together until the spring of 1944 . In October 1940 , he went back to sea briefly as Captain of HMCS Assiniboine and Commodore Commanding Halifax Force , effectively in command of the five Canadian warships that were dispatched to the UK in January 1941 to serve convoy duty . Back ashore in the UK , Murray was given the unusual title of Commodore Commanding Canadian Ships , and liaised closely with the Admiralty in the planning of an Atlantic strategy , including the resolution of jurisdictional matters relating to the Dominion of Newfoundland . 
 On return to Canada he was promoted to full Commodore on 31 May 1941 , and on 13 June 1941 he was put in charge of the Newfoundland Escort Force ( <unk> ) based out of St John 's . This was the most important operational mandate given to a Royal Canadian Navy officer until that point , in full command of 6 Canadian destroyers , 7 British destroyers , and 21 corvettes , and with responsibility for convoy escort from New York out as far as the transfer point to UK escorts south of Iceland . In recognition of this increased role , Murray was subsequently appointed Rear Admiral on 2 December 1941 . 
 " Conditions were terrible that winter . Groups worked on a 35 day cycle which entailed 29 days away from St John ’ s , 27 days away from fresh bread , 25 days away from fresh meat , added to which at the northern end of their beat there was no sunlight to speak of in the winter . We had to revert to the old rations of Nelson ’ s time , barreled salt beef with lime juice or tomato juice to scare away scurvy " - Admiral Murray . 
 = = = The Saint Pierre and Miquelon " incident " = = = 
 While based in Newfoundland , Admiral Murray hosted a visit from the Free French Admiral Muselier . Acting on orders from the Admiralty , Murray gave Muselier temporary command of three French corvettes and a submarine that were assigned to Murray 's fleet , for passage to Halifax . On return from Halifax , Muselier took the vessels to Vichy @-@ controlled Saint Pierre and Miquelon , and on 24 December 1941 raised the Free French flag on the islands . This was interpreted as a territorial claim on behalf of General Charles de Gaulle , thereby creating a diplomatic incident between France , Canada and the United States . De Gaulle 's seizure of the archipelago was over the opposition of Canada , Great Britain , and the United States , which were concerned about pushing the Vichy government into an openly pro @-@ German stance . 
 Murray was later asked to account for his role in this adventure - but steadfastly claimed ( as did Muselier ) that he had no part in it . Nevertheless , in 1946 Murray was awarded the Legion d 'Honneur by the Government of France , for " eminent services rendered to the cause of Free France at the time of the rallying of the inhabitants of St Pierre and Miquelon " .

 The <unk> was reorganized in February 1942 as the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force ( <unk> ) . On 9 September 1942 , Murray was appointed to Commanding Officer Atlantic Coast , with his Headquarters in Halifax , and effective command over 322 armed ships . As a direct result of the Atlantic Convoy Conference of 1 – 12 March 1943 , where it was agreed that the US Navy would concentrate on the South Atlantic leaving Canada and the UK to cover the North Atlantic , on 1 April 1943 Murray was made Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Canadian Northwest Atlantic . Still headquartered in Halifax , thereafter he commanded all Allied air and naval forces involved in convoy protection between Canada and the coast of Ireland until the end of the war with Germany in 1945 . 
 In order to encourage the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K. , I made it a point to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure . During the winter of ' <unk> ' 43 , when sinkings were at their worst , I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety ; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew in spite of my brave words , that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships , and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all . But there was never a waver in their resolve - Admiral Murray . 
 A personal highlight of this period occurred on 14 September 1943 , when Murray gave an impromptu guided tour of Halifax to the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Churchill and his family , together with the First Sea Lord , boarded HMS Renown in Halifax harbour for their return voyage to the United Kingdom following consultations with US President Roosevelt . Murray was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 King 's Birthday Honours , and Companion of the Order of the Bath the following year . 
 As the Allies gained the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic throughout 1943 and 1944 , attacks on convoys diminished and the amount of escort cover was reduced , but the hard work of planning and organizing convoys never ceased . By May 1944 , British participation in convoy escorts was withdrawn entirely , and Canada was left with sole responsibility until September 1944 . Murray 's moment of singular pride came in this period , when the largest convoy of World War II , HX 300 sailed for the UK via New York on 17 July 1944 , with 167 merchant ships ( 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 t ) ) . It arrived in the UK , without incident , on 3 August 1944 . 
 = = VE Day and early retirement = = 
 Admiral Murray was controversially blamed for allowing sailors shore leave in Halifax on VE Day , a decision that is generally considered to have contributed to the Halifax Riot of 7 – 8 May 1945 . James Lorimer Ilsley , the Acting Prime Minister of Canada , responded quickly to the situation and on 10 May appointed Justice Kellock to chair a Royal Commission into the disorders . On 12 May , Murray was abruptly removed from his command ; and the next day a separate Naval Board of Inquiry under Admiral Brodeur was appointed to investigate naval participation in the disorders . The Kellock Commission placed considerable blame upon the Navy and in particular upon the Admiral , for not having exercised better control over the sailors ' celebrations ashore . The Naval Inquiry 's findings were more balanced , finding that the riot was caused by several factors , including a failure in the naval command . Murray himself felt that responsibility lay mainly with the civil authorities of Halifax , and he was frustrated that the Kellock Commission effectively placed the Navy on trial without providing him or his officers with an opportunity to defend themselves . He asked for a court martial to clear his name , but this was never agreed . The Government made an attempt to leave the Admiral with his honour intact : 
 " It would be a regrettable thing if , resultant upon the Halifax disturbances , the truly great services of this officer and those under his command were to be forgotten by the people of Canada . " 
 But the Admiral was never assigned another command . Concluding that he was being held up as a scapegoat , and feeling bitter that the country and the Navy had abandoned him suddenly at the moment of the Navy 's greatest accomplishment , Murray left Canada for the United Kingdom in September 1945 , and officially retired from the Navy on 14 March 1946 . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Murray remained active in his retirement , qualifying as a lawyer on 17 November 1949 , and with his specialty in maritime law he represented the British government at the 1950 enquiry into the accidental sinking of SS <unk> . He was involved with his local church , and served as a rural councillor as well as on school boards . His love of the sea was kept alive by keen membership in the Bar Yacht Club where he was racing Captain for ten years , and a leadership role with the Sea Scouts — coincidentally carried back to Canada where a Canadian Sea Cadet Corps in New Glasgow , near his home town , is named in his honour ( <unk> 87 Admiral Murray ) . Murray stopped practising law in 1960 to care better for his ailing wife , who died in 1962 . Following a chance meeting on a Greek cruise , Leonard remarried on 23 August 1963 , in Buxton to an ophthalmic surgeon Antonina <unk> — who quickly came to be known as Nina Murray . He dabbled in British politics , becoming a member of the Conservative Party and ran unsuccessfully as a candidate in municipal council elections in Buxton in 1965 , before turning his attention to a spirited debate with the Canadian military establishment , the media and Prime Minister Pearson wherein he opposed the 1966 integration of the Canadian Armed Forces . Although clearly feeling that Canada had abandoned him following the Halifax Riot , Murray maintained his ties to Canada and last visited in 1970 , when he participated in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of the Atlantic .

 Leonard died peacefully in Buxton on 25 November 1971 , and his ashes were placed in St Paul 's Church in Halifax on 17 September 1972 . His memory lived on in the Royal Canadian Navy , where the Admiral L.W. Murray Trophy for Gunnery Proficiency was awarded annually at least until the early 1970s . Since his death , a number of commemorative steps have been taken , including the placing of a memorial in his honour in Pictou , a collection of his medals and related naval artifacts in the Canadian Naval Operations School ( <unk> ) in Halifax , the naming of a Maritimes Branch of the Royal Canadian Naval Association , the renaming of Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps NEW <unk> in New Glasgow , Nova Scotia to Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps <unk> <unk> , and the naming of several naval buildings , including <unk> building at CFB Halifax .

 " Except for the few months at sea in Assiniboine , my war work was a solid slog , mostly at a desk , averaging 15 hours a day with frequently a full 24 . My job was to obtain the greatest possible result from relatively inexperienced personnel . There was little opportunity for anyone to step on another ’ s toes . They were spread too thinly and there was a more responsible job for each as soon as he felt confident of his ability to take it on . In the autumn of 1941 young volunteer reserve officers who had never seen salt water before the war took command of corvettes manned by 88 men — the number of white and black keys on a piano and each with his own peculiar note — and took their full part in the Battle of the Atlantic . Experience had taught me this : to find out what you ’ re capable of , it is only necessary to get a chance to do it — and someone else must have enough confidence in you to provide that chance . In my dealings with the young RCNVR captains I did my best to give them the opportunity to find their own feet and they did it . Once having tasted success they never looked back . What a blessing that we had the bright young peoples to accept this kind of responsibility " - Admiral Murray .

 Lunar : The Silver Star ( <unk> ザ ・ <unk> , Runa Za <unk> Sutā ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed by Game Arts and Studio Alex for the Sega / Mega @-@ CD , originally published by Game Arts and released in Japan in 1992 . After a successful release , the game was translated and localized by Working Designs for release in North America the following year . 
 Designed as a " different kind of RPG " , Lunar : The Silver Star made use of the up @-@ and @-@ coming CD @-@ ROM format by featuring high quality audio , full motion video , and voice acting to narrate a fantasy story set in a magical world . The game centers on the exploits of Alex , a young boy from a small town who dreams of one day becoming a great hero like his idol , Dragonmaster Dyne . When a childish adventure later turns to discovering an ancient dragon , Alex and his friends must journey across the world to gather the necessary power to become the next Dragonmaster , and save the world in the process . 
 Lunar : The Silver Star was critically and commercially successful , becoming the number one selling Mega @-@ CD title in Japan and the second highest @-@ selling Mega @-@ CD title of all time . As the first game in the Lunar series , it set the standard for other follow @-@ up titles including the direct sequel Lunar : Eternal Blue in 1994 . Since the game 's original release , three enhanced remakes have been produced for various systems : Lunar : Silver Star Story Complete in 1996 , Lunar Legend in 2002 , and Lunar : Silver Star Harmony in 2009 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Lunar : The Silver Star is a traditional , top @-@ down role @-@ playing video game featuring two @-@ dimensional characters and environments . The player must navigate towns , fields , and harsh environments to complete story @-@ based objectives that move the plot forward , as well as interact with non @-@ player characters to expand the script and gain various rewards . Making use of the Sega CD 's disc hardware capabilities , short video and audio interludes accompany the game 's narrative , including full or quarter @-@ screen animated images and CD @-@ DA sound files . Players record their progress by saving to either the Sega CD 's internal RAM , or a separately purchased RAM cartridge that fit into the accompanying Mega Drive / Genesis . 
 While traveling in the game 's world , players randomly encounter enemy monsters that must be defeated or avoided to progress . Battle sequences utilize a turn @-@ based approach , with the player and enemies acting in accordance with their " speed " rating . The player issues commands to each controlled character in their party , which are then carried out in sequence until the battle ends . While on the battlefield , players may choose to move their characters to attack the enemy , retreat into a corner , stand their ground , or flee the battle entirely , with characters only able to strike enemies if they are close enough to their target or use a ranged attack . Nall , a supporting character not directly involved in combat , is present throughout the game to analyze enemies before battles begin , gauging their relative strength to the player 's group . Players may find weapons , equipment , and assorted items during gameplay that increase the effectiveness of characters in battle , such as causing more damage to opponents and increasing their stamina . Winning battles grant experience points that go towards making characters stronger and able to battle progressively more difficult enemies . Upon defeat , a player may choose to load a previous save file , or restart their game at an automatically saved checkpoint . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 The game takes place in the fantasy land of Lunar , a small habitable world orbiting the massive , barren blue planet ( known as the Blue Star ) , forming a loose parallel between the game 's world and the Earth and its moon . Centuries before the start of the game , the Blue Star was rendered unlivable by years of war .. The powerful and benevolent goddess Althena relocated humanity to the Silver Star , the world of Lunar , and entrusted four dragons to safeguard the elements of the new world . From this point on , those who would use the power of the dragons to serve the goddess and protect the world were known as " <unk> " , and no such Dragonmaster was more revered than Dyne , a legendary hero who defended the goddess and succumbed to an unknown fate . The stories surrounding Dyne 's exploits would form the life model for a young boy named Alex , the game 's protagonist and central character , who also aspires to become a Dragonmaster himself . Many of the locations of Lunar : The Silver Star were given a deliberate " northern " feel to present an environment that was cooler than the settings of most role @-@ playing games , if only to allow the characters to wear more clothing . Many towns and locations were based on areas of Russia and Medieval Europe . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The characters of Lunar : The Silver Star were designed by anime and manga artist Toshiyuki Kubooka . The main characters include Alex and his companions , each of which have their own reasons for joining his quest : 
 Alex - a 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy from a small town with dreams of becoming an adventurer . Alex is a silent protagonist , typical for a Japanese RPG he never speaks in the game . 
 Nall - a small , winged creature resembling a white cat who has been with him since birth . 
 Luna - Alex 's childhood friend and love interest who has the unique ability to heal with music . 
 Ramus - son of the town mayor who dreams of one day opening his own shop , and begins Alex 's adventuring career by having him fetch a priceless diamond from a dragon 's cave . 
 Nash - a junior premier of the floating city of Vane , often prone to rash decisions and occasionally despair . 
 Mia - another junior premier of Vane , though much more reserved than Nash . 
 Kyle - a headstrong and womanizing bandit . 
 Jessica - a tomboyish daughter of a famous hero who is training to be a priestess . 
 Major supporting characters include the three surviving members of the Four Heroes , a legendary band of adventurers who aided Dragonmaster Dyne in protecting the Goddess Althena years before the game 's story , whose ranks include : 
 " Deadly " Mel D <unk> , father of Jessica and mayor of the bustling city of Meribia . 
 <unk> <unk> , mother of Mia and head of Vane . 
 Ghaleon , powerful sorcerer and teacher of Nash who becomes the primary antagonist after assuming his alter ego , the Magic Emperor . 
 The party is aided by : 
 Laike , a powerful swordsman and expert adventurer who acts as a mentor to Alex and is later revealed to be Dragonmaster Dyne after losing his powers . 
 Tempest and Fresca , plains @-@ dwelling fighters who have their own reasons for helping Alex and his group . 
 Many of the character 's original Japanese names were altered for the game 's North American release , such as Killy to Kyle , <unk> to Quark , <unk> to Tempest , and <unk> to Fresca ; Mel 's original epithet , " Hell " Mel , was changed to " Deadly " for censorship reasons . A witch named Xenobia serves as a secondary antagonist and Ghaleon 's right hand servant . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Much of the plot of Lunar : The Silver Star was written by novelist Kei Shigema , and involves a world of high fantasy and with emphasis on folklore and legend . The game begins in the small mountain town of Burg , where a young Alex frequently visits the monument to the fallen hero Dyne , his idol . At the behest of Ramus , eager son of the town mayor , Ramus and Alex embark on their first real adventure , with Alex 's adopted sister Luna and their talking flying pet Nall , to the mysterious Dragon 's Cave in search of a valuable diamond . Making their way through the cavern , the group meets Quark , an aged dragon who senses great potential in Alex , and urges him to complete the trials of other dragons to become the next Dragonmaster , champion of the Goddess Althena , and protector of the world . Quark shows an interest in Luna as well , remarking that she has a familiar aura about her . Obtaining the diamond from Quark , Ramus finds he cannot sell it in Burg , and must travel to the major trade city of Meribia to claim his fortune . The group then makes their way to Saith , a small port town to the south , where Luna leaves the group to stay with Alex 's family . 
 Across the ocean , Alex , Nall , and Ramus enter Meribia , where they meet one of the legendary Four Heroes , Mel . Attempting to sell his diamond , Ramus is swindled by a jewel dealer who flees into the sewers . After reclaiming it , Ramus slyly bargains the owner 's life for his entire shop , and leaves the group to pursue his dream of becoming rich . Alex and Nash depart for the city of Vane where they meet Mia , daughter of the city 's ruler and Nash 's love interest , who informs them of Ghaleon , head of the guild and former great hero who fought with Dyne years ago . Seemingly intrigued by Alex 's quest , Ghaleon sends Alex on a mission to investigate the appearance of a false Dragonmaster in a faraway town . Upon arrival , Alex meets Jessica , daughter of Mel and aspiring priestess , who helps him locate the imposter before returning to Vane . Pleased with his success , Ghaleon accompanies Alex back to his hometown to meet Quark and discuss Alex 's future , when he suddenly attacks , revealing himself as the Magic Emperor and seemingly kills Quark in a fit of rage . Citing the loss of his friend Dyne , who died protecting the Goddess , Ghaleon swears revenge on both she and her dragons and departs after kidnapping Luna . Distraught , Alex and Nall return to Meribia to find it under attack by a band of monsters under Ghaleon 's command . Regrouping with Jessica , the group fights back a wave of invaders before witnessing Mel turn to stone from a dark spell of Xenobia , Ghaleon 's top general . Wanting revenge , Jessica accompanies Alex to Vane , also under siege , and assists Nash and Mia with a similar invasion before they too join the group . 
 Realizing they must make Alex a Dragonmaster to confront Ghaleon and save Luna , the team heads to the border town of <unk> to enlist Kyle , Jessica 's boyfriend , in letting them cross into foreign land . After traveling to a town of inventors , the group obtains a floating device that leads them to the lair of the Red Dragon , who is seemingly destroyed by Ghaleon just before they arrive . The dragon 's spirit grants Alex her power before disappearing , and the group departs for the Blue Dragon 's cave behind a musical town . Again , the dragon is defeated before their arrival , and the team must travel to the distant and barren Frontier to seek the final trial . The party finds the black dragon , which attacks the team in a mad rage induced by Ghaleon but is defeated . With the final dragon 's blessing , Alex and his companions approach the construction site of Ghaleon 's mobile mechanical castle , the <unk> , but are unable to stop its advance before it destroys Vane using the power of Luna , who is revealed to be the human form of the Goddess Althena and who is under the Magic Emperor 's control . After obtaining Althena 's Sword and learning the truth about Luna , the party attacks the <unk> defeats both Xenobia and the Magic Emperor . Knowing what he must do to bring Luna back , Alex climbs the path to Luna , who , as Althena , continuously blasts him with lightning ; he plays his harp as he advances , and hearing their song allows Luna 's personality to return . She awakens in Alex 's arms , surrounded by their friends . 
 = = Development = = 
 Lunar : The Silver Star was developed by Game Arts in an attempt to create a role @-@ playing game that would both primarily focus on animation and storytelling . The team turned to scenario writer and novelist Kei Shigema to craft a story that would break away from " hum @-@ drum ' model ' " games that " had stories , but had no story @-@ telling " . Using the Sega CD 's video playback capabilities , animator and artist Toshiyuki Kubooka oversaw the planning of several video sequences that would be coupled with voice @-@ overs to better tell the story of the Lunar world . Settling on an overall fantasy approach as opposed to the popular role @-@ playing alternative of science fiction , the team wanted to explore the mythos and history of a fictional world that would gradually reveal itself to the player over time . Having mostly developed side @-@ <unk> and scrolling shooters for the Mega Drive and PC Engine , Game Arts formed its subsidiary company , Studio Alex , named for the main character of this title , to oversee most of the game 's development . Due to time constraints , nearly one @-@ third of the Lunar project was scrapped by the game 's release . 
 Lunar 's English version was handled by Working Designs , a small California @-@ based publisher who had previously localized smaller games for the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 and <unk> . Their biggest project yet , the team , headed by company vice president and chief writer Victor Ireland , took to the project seriously , often collaborating with the original Japanese team themselves . New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland 's request , including new sequences such as playing Alex 's harp to awaken Luna near the end of the game . Working Designs also put extra effort into the game 's packaging , giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering , and having seven separate stamps , each with different artwork , produced for the front of the game discs to increase collection value . 
 The English script was nearly four megabytes in size , yet Working Designs completed the translation in only eight weeks after a marathon programming session . During translation , the developers did find time to inject some of their own humor in to the game 's text , dropping in sentences such as Have you ever tried swimming in lemon jello ? , and numerous light @-@ hearted pop culture references not seen in the original version , including allusions to American commercials , celebrities , colloquialisms , products , and role @-@ playing game clichés . 
 = = Audio = = 
 The music for Lunar : The Silver Star was composed by Noriyuki Iwadare , Hiroshi Fujioka , Isao Mizoguchi , and Yoshiaki <unk> , who utilized the Sega CD 's sound capabilities to create CD @-@ quality CD @-@ DA . The game features the opening theme " Lunar " , performed by Mayumi Sudou in the original Japanese version . The untitled English version is a slightly arranged piece performed by vocalist <unk> <unk> which features new lyrics by Victor Ireland , who intended the song to sound less " lovey @-@ <unk> " with a greater " sense of urgency " . 
 The Lunar : The Silver Star Original Soundtrack was released exclusively in Japan by Toshiba @-@ EMI Records on April 22 , 1992 , two months before the actual release of the game . The album features full versions of the Japanese opening and ending themes , as well as karaoke arrangements . Most of the game 's background themes are presented as multi @-@ song medleys rather than separate tracks . Although an official North American version was never released , many of the songs present on the album were featured as special arrangements on the bonus soundtrack found in the Lunar : Silver Star Story Complete collector 's edition , including the English opening theme . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Both the Japanese and English adaptations of Lunar : The Silver Star contain roughly fifteen minutes of spoken dialogue from a number of prominent voice actors . Though the game has a number of main and supporting characters , only five are actually voiced during specific story sequences . The Japanese version features Kikuko Inoue as both Alex and Luna , Rei Sakuma as Nall , Kōichi Kitamura as the white dragon Quark , and <unk> Naya as Ghaleon . The English version comprised mostly new talent and associates of Working Designs ' staff , such as a young Ashley Parker Angel as Alex , Rhonda Gibson as Luna , Jackie Powers as Nall , Hal <unk> as Quark , and John Truitt as Ghaleon . While the entire Japanese cast was replaced for the game 's remake on the PlayStation , all of the original English cast would return to reprise their roles . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Lunar : The Silver Star was well received in Japan , selling an estimated 100 @,@ 000 copies , its entire production run , in its first year after release , nearly as much as the Mega CD itself . It is considered the Mega @-@ CD 's first hit game , which Sega credits solely for pushing the system 's sales in that region . The game remains the best @-@ selling Sega CD title of all time in Japan , and second highest selling worldwide behind Sonic the Hedgehog CD . Readers of Japanese magazine Megadrive Beep voted it the number one Mega Drive role @-@ playing game for 17 straight months before being trumped by Shining Force II . 
 The English version released the following year met with a similar response , with Skid of GameFan magazine calling it " far and away the best RPG I have ever played in English " , praising the game 's graphics , sound , and story as " well conceived and executed " . The magazine 's editors would later name it as the greatest role @-@ playing game of 1993 . GamePro similarly reviewed it as " not just the best Sega CD RPG ever , but one of the best on any Sega system " , giving particular merit to the game 's translation . Game Players described it as a " solid RPG , and well worth your time " but found fault in the game 's small character graphics that " look like every other RPG " and the virtually non @-@ existent replay value . Electronic Gaming Monthly had five reviewers , Ed , Dano , Al , Sushi @-@ X , and Mike , give the game scores of 9 , 8 , 7 , 7 , and 7 , respectively , ranging from " worthy " to " virtually flawless " ratings . The magazine commended the game 's background music soundtrack but described its battle sequences as " a bit dull . " EGM 's 1999 Video Game Buyer 's Guide listed four of these scores , 9 , 8 , 7 , and 7 , averaging out to 7 @.@ 75 out of 10 overall , and described the game as " one of the best RPGs ever . " 
 As the number one selling Sega CD title in Japan , the game sold nearly as many copies as the system itself , and remains the second highest @-@ selling Mega @-@ CD title of all time . Mega placed the game at # 8 in their top Mega CD games of all time . In 2006 , Lunar ranked 113th in EGM and 1UP.com 's list of the greatest " videogames of their time , " celebrating the games that were considered the best during their original release . Retro Gamer included The Silver Star among top ten Mega CD games , noting its " astounding soundtrack " and " fantastic " localization .

 As the first game in the Lunar series , The Silver Star established many of the themes and characters that would be seen in later installments .

 = 1999 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1999 Pacific hurricane season was one of the least active Pacific hurricane seasons on record . The season officially began on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific , and on June 1 in the Central Pacific ; in both basins , it ended on November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . The first tropical cyclone of the season , Hurricane Adrian , developed on June 18 , while the final storm of the season , Tropical Storm Irwin , dissipated on October 11 . No storms developed in the Central Pacific during the season . However , two storms from the Eastern Pacific , Dora and Eugene , entered the basin , with the former entering as a hurricane . 
 The season produced fourteen tropical cyclones and nine named storms , which was well below the average of sixteen named storms per season ; this was largely due to a strong La Niña taking over much of the Pacific . However , the total of six hurricanes and two major hurricanes during the season was near the averages of eight and three , respectively . Although it remained offshore , Hurricane Adrian caused 6 deaths from flooding and rough surf in Mexico . Hurricane Dora was a long @-@ lived and intense cyclone , which had the second longest track of a Pacific hurricane on record . The storm brought minor impacts to the island of Hawaii ; however , no deaths or damage was reported . The deadliest tropical cyclone , Hurricane Greg , killed 10 people from flooding in Mexico .

 The 1999 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15 , 1999 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1999 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1999 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . The 1999 Pacific hurricane season was well below average , due to the strong La Niña that was occurring at the time , which causes wind shear to be increased and water temperatures to decrease , resulting in conditions less conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific . There were 14 cyclones in total , including 5 unnamed tropical depressions . Of these , 9 became a tropical storm , while 6 reached hurricane status . Further , 2 of these became major hurricanes , which is Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis began with Hurricane Adrian , which developed on June 18 . Although it remained offshore , Adrian brought rough surf and flooding to Mexico , which resulted in 6 fatalities . The storm peaked as a Category 2 before dissipating on June 22 . No other tropical cyclones formed in June . Activity halted until July 9 , when Hurricane Beatriz developed . Though it peaked as a Category 3 hurricane before dissipating on July 17 , the storm caused no damage on land because it remained well offshore . The next system , a short @-@ lived Tropical Depression Three @-@ E , did not result in impact as a tropical cyclone , though the precursor brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to Central America . Tropical Depression Four @-@ E , was the first of three cyclones to cross into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , which is between 140 ° W and the International Date Line . Two other short @-@ lived system in July , Tropical Storm Calvin and Tropical Depression Six @-@ E , caused no damage . 
 In August , Hurricane Dora , the strongest storm of the 1999 Pacific hurricane season , produced gusty winds and large waves on Johnston Atoll and the island of Hawaii , though minimal damage was left in its wake . After crossing the International Date Line on August 20 , Dora became the first tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the North Pacific – Eastern , Central , and Western – since Hurricane John in 1994 . Hurricane Eugene also existed in the Eastern and Central Pacific , but dissipated on August 15 while south of the main Hawaiian Islands , well before reaching the International Date Line . Nonetheless , it produced up to 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of rainfall on the Big Island of Hawaii . In the remainder of August , there was a series of short @-@ lived tropical cyclones that did not effect land , including Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E , Tropical Storm Fernanda , and Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E. 
 During the month of September , the deadliest tropical cyclone of the season , Hurricane Greg , was spawned near the Pacific coast of Mexico . Greg which killed 10 people when it made landfall on southern Baja California . The hurricane and its precursor produced heavy rainfall across much of Mexico , with the highest total reaching 22 @.@ 23 in ( 566 @.@ 9 mm ) . The heavy rains damaged or destroyed more than 2 @,@ 000 homes . The remnant moisture from the system , combined with an area of low pressure , resulted in strong thunderstorms across California , which led to numerous power outages , damage to homes and vehicles , and started many wildfires . The other in the month of September was Hurricane Hilary , a storm that approached Baja California , but dissipated offshore on September 21 , resulting in no impact . The final system , Tropical Storm Irwin , produced scattered areas of heavy rainfall over Mexico in October , but caused no significant flooding . It dissipated on October 11 , over a month and a half before the official end of the season on November 30 .

 A broad area of low pressure developed into Tropical Depression One at 0600 UTC on June 18 , while situated 290 miles ( 465 km ) southeast of Acapulco , Guerrero . Moving towards west @-@ northwestward , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adrian about 12 hours later . Favorable levels of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures ( SST 's ) caused the storm to strengthen further . Early on June 20 Adrian intensified into a hurricane , while located about 420 miles ( 680 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of Baja California . About 24 hours later , Adrian reached its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 973 mbar ( 28 @.@ 73 inHg ) . 
 After reaching peak intensity on June 21 , Adrian began weakening due to colder SST 's and higher wind shear . Adrian fell to tropical storm status late on June 21 , and further weakened to a tropical depression on June 22 . Six hours later at 1800 UTC , Adrian degenerated into a swirl of low clouds while situated 300 mi ( 480 km ) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California . Heavy rainfall produced from the storm caused minor flooding throughout Mexico . Two fatalities were directly attributed to the floods , while another person was listed as missing . Four other people were killed when they drowned in rough seas produced offshore the Mexican coastline . There is no damage estimate from the heavy rainfall or rough seas associated with the hurricane .

 A tropical wave developed into by 0600 UTC on July 9 , while situated roughly 300 mi ( 480 km ) south of Lázaro Cárdenas , Mexico . At this time , the depression was in an environment of strong upper @-@ tropospheric outflow , resulting in gradual intensification . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beatriz at 1200 UTC on July 9 . Steady strengthened continued and about 48 hours later , Beatriz became a Category 1 while situated roughly 560 miles ( 900 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Moving westward around the southern periphery of a ridge to the north , it continued to intensify . A well @-@ defined eye became visible on satellite imagery early on July 12 . Microwave imagery a few hours later revealed that Beatriz was likely undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and was complete by 1700 UTC . 
 Further intensification occurred , and Beatriz became the first major hurricane of the season at 1800 UTC on July 12 . At 0600 UTC the following day , the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph ( 195 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 955 mbar ( 28 @.@ 20 inHg ) while situated roughly 800 miles ( 1300 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Curving towards the west @-@ northwest , Beatriz began to encounter an area of cooler sea surface temperatures , which led to gradual weakening . The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 16 , and further to a tropical depression by 1800 UTC that day . At 0600 UTC on July 17 , Beatriz degenerated into a swirl of clouds .

It initially headed west @-@ northwestward until July 15 , when it curved west @-@ southwestward . The depression failed to strengthen further and dissipated at 1800 UTC on July 15 , while located about 460 miles ( 740 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Four @-@ E = = = 
 On July 15 , a tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean . Over the following days , slow organization occurred , and it is estimated that the system became developed into Tropical Depression Four @-@ E at 0000 UTC on July 23 . Later that day , the depression reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1007 mbar ( 29 @.@ 74 inHg ) , having failed to reach tropical storm status . While moving westward , the depression entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on July 24 . By this time , however , the depression was already becoming disorganized and dissipated early on the following day . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Calvin = = = 
 A tropical wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea between early and mid @-@ July . Later in the month , the wave acquired a low @-@ level circulation . Thus , Tropical Depression Five @-@ E developed at 0600 UTC on July 25 , while situated about 645 miles ( 1 @,@ 038 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Due to further organization on satellite imagery , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Calvin six hours later . However , wind shear exposed the low @-@ level circulation and halted intensification . Calvin continued west @-@ northwestward as a sheared cyclone . 
 According to satellite classifications , it is estimated that Calvin weakened back to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on July 26 . There was a convective burst late on July 26 , though the storm did not re @-@ strengthen . Around that time , Calvin turned northwestward in response to a mid @-@ tropospheric trough . The burst in convection did not persist and the depression dissipated by 1200 UTC on July 27 , while located well west @-@ southwest of Baja California . A low @-@ cloud swirl remained and subsequently continued on a west @-@ northwesterly course for a few days . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Six @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical wave that previously crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea reached the eastern Pacific basin until late July . The system developed a surface circulation on July 26 , while microwave imagery data indicated wind speeds of 37 mph ( 60 km / h ) . As a result , it is estimated that Tropical Depression Six @-@ E developed at 1800 UTC , while located nearly 1 @,@ 150 miles ( 1 @,@ 850 km ) west @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Baja California and about 415 miles ( 668 km ) southwest of Tropical Depression Calvin . The depression moved toward the west @-@ northwest and encountered strong vertical wind @-@ shear . Despite a few convective bursts , the depression remained weak and degenerated into a swirl of low clouds at 0000 UTC on July 28 . 
 = = = Hurricane Dora = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off Africa on July 23 and crossed the Atlantic Ocean without development . However , the wave quickly increased in organization after entering the Eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4 , and was designated Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E on August 6 . The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dora later that day . Dora continued to intensify despite upper @-@ level wind shear , and became a hurricane on August 8 . Shortly after , the hurricane moved westward into a more favorable environment and began to intensify more quickly , reaching Category 4 strength on August 10 . It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved almost due west . 
 Dora weakened to Category 1 strength as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on August 14 . However , it briefly restrengthened into a Category 3 as it passed south of Hawaii on August 16 . Dora then began weakening for the final time as it passed south of Johnston Atoll on August 18 . At the atoll , Dora produced large waves and wind gusts between 40 and 45 mph ( 75 and 85 km / h ) . In Hawaii , heavy surf on the Big Island forced the closure of beaches , campsites , and hiking trails in the districts of Kau and Puna . On August 20 , Dora crossed the International Date Line , shortly before weakening to a tropical storm . Due to vertical wind shear , it did not re @-@ strengthen in the western Pacific basin . The storm weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity early on August 22 . Dora dissipated late on the following day , while situated several hundred miles east of Wake Island . 
 = = = Hurricane Eugene = = = 
 A tropical wave crossed Central America between July 28 and July 29 , before entering the Pacific Ocean and slowly organizing . After the cloud pattern consolidated , it is estimated that Tropical Depression Eight @-@ E developed at 0600 UTC on August 6 , while located about 975 miles ( 1 @,@ 569 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . Twelve hours later , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene . It continued to deepen , reaching hurricane status late on August 8 . About 24 hours later , Eugene peaked as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . The storm began to weaken and was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane early on August 11 . 
 Eugene continued westward , and on August 11 , it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility . It continued to weaken and was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 13 . Eugene passed south of the Hawaiian Islands on August 14 , with minimal impact noted . Minor surf occurred along the east and southeast shores of the Big Island . Additionally , 24 ‑ hour rainfall totals over windward sections of Maui and the Big Island were near 2 inches ( 51 mm ) . The storm weakened to a tropical depression by late on August 14 . At 0000 UTC on August 16 , Eugene dissipated while located about 550 miles ( 890 km ) southeast of Johnston Atoll . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the African coast on July 27 and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 6 . The system continued westward without development until August 11 , when convection began to increase . By 1200 UTC on August 13 , the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E. Due easterly wind shear , the depression did not further intensify as it moved on a generally west @-@ northwesterly track . The depression had dissipated by August 15 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Fernanda = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten @-@ E at 0600 UTC on August 17 , while located about 460 miles ( 740 km ) in south @-@ southwest of Socorro Island , Mexico . The depression intensified gradually due to favorable conditions . At 0000 UTC on August 18 , the cyclone was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fernanda while centered about 520 miles ( 840 km ) southwest of Socorro Island . The storm continued to slowly strengthened and 1200 UTC on August 19 , Fernanda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . 
 Around the time of peak intensity on August 19 , Fernanda curved west @-@ southwest track , a motion which persisted for the remainder of its duration . While this track carried the storm over warmer SST 's , increasing easterly wind shear caused Fernanda to weaken . By early on August 21 , Fernanda weakened to a tropical depression . After weakening slightly further , the storm degenerated into a remnant low cloud swirl at 0000 UTC on August 23 . The remnants of Fernanda persisted until finally losing its identity about 290 miles ( 470 km ) west @-@ southwest of Socorro Island on August 28 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific on August 15 and formed a surface low pressure area south of Mexico on August 19 . After consolidating and organizing somewhat , the system became Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E late on August 23 . However , colder SST 's caused convection to diminish almost immediately , while moving parallel to the southern coast of Baja California. as thunderstorm activity slowly decreased due to cool SST 's . By 1200 UTC on August 24 , the depression dissipated just west of the tip of Baja California , having lasted for less than 24 hours . The highest rainfall total reported in Mexico was 8 @.@ 27 inches ( 210 mm ) at Los Cabos , Baja California Sur . 
 = = = Hurricane Greg = = = 
 The northern portion of a tropical wave in the Atlantic spawned Tropical Storm Emily , while the southern portion headed westward and crossed Central America between August 31 and September 1 . Thereafter , the system emerged into the Pacific Ocean and began to organize . By 1200 UTC on September 5 , Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E developed near Manzanillo , Mexico . Six hours later , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Greg . Further intensification occurred , and late on September 6 , Greg was upgraded to a hurricane as winds reached 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . However , Greg weakened to a tropical storm on September 7 , while approaching Baja California . At 2100 UTC that day , it made landfall near Cabo San Lucas . The storm then curved westward and weakened over colder SST 's , until dissipating on late September 9 . 
 Both <unk> and its predecessor disturbance brought heavy rain to much of Mexico . The highest report was of 22 @.@ 23 inches ( 566 @.@ 9 mm ) in Tecomán , Colima . Precipitation from Greg caused flooding in the states of Colima , Michoacán , Sinaloa , Nayarit , and Jalisco . It was most severe along the Los <unk> River . The flooding killed ten people . In addition , 2 @,@ 000 people were rendered homeless and 2 @,@ 000 others were affected in some way . The remnants of Greg produced thunderstorms in California , particularly the San Francisco Bay Area . As a result , there was widespread power outages and isolated damage to houses and vehicles , as well as causing several small wildfires . Overall damage was relatively limited , however . 
 = = = Hurricane Hilary = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of western Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on August 29 . It continued to move westward through the tropical waters of the Atlantic into the Caribbean . It still remained a tropical wave as it moved over Central America and began to acquire more convection and organization , from September 10 through September 11 . Visible satellite imagery showed low level circulation and more organized deep convection as it became a tropical depression on September 17 , while located about 475 miles ( 764 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . 
 The system strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilary at 1200 UTC on September 18 . Due to the development of an eye feature and large increase in deep convection , Hilary was upgraded to hurricane on September 20 , while located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) southwest of the Baja California Peninsula . However , later that day , Hilary weakened back to a tropical storm . The storm fell further to tropical depression status on September 21 . Hours later , the storm degenerated into a swirl of low @-@ level clouds , as it bypassed Baja California on September 21 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Irwin = = = 
 The southern portion of the tropical wave that previously spawned Tropical Depression Eleven in the Gulf of Mexico entered the Pacific Ocean in early October . After becoming better organized , the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E at 1200 UTC on October 8 , while situated about 145 miles ( 233 km ) south @-@ southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . The depression initially moved slowly north @-@ northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Irwin about six hours later . After a strong mid @-@ tropospheric ridge developed over northern Mexico , Irwin moved northwestward and remained offshore Mexico . 
 Early on October 9 , the center of the storm passed within about 85 miles ( 137 km ) of the coastline between Manzanillo and Cabo Corrientes . The storm then curved west @-@ northwestward and at 1800 UTC on October 9 , Irwin attained peaked with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Stable air and increasing wind shear caused Irwin to weaken and fall to tropical depression intensity early on October 11 . About 12 hours later , the storm dissipated while located about 405 miles ( 652 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas . While passing offshore , Irwin brought patches of heavy rainfall to some areas of Mexico , peaking at 9 @.@ 92 inches ( 252 mm ) in <unk> de Guerrero , Guerrero .

 = Indonesian occupation of East Timor = 
 Indonesia occupied East Timor from December 1975 to October 1999 . After centuries of Portuguese colonial rule in East Timor , a 1974 coup in Portugal led to decolonisation among its former colonies , creating instability in East Timor and leaving its future uncertain . After a small @-@ scale civil war , the pro @-@ independence FRETILIN declared victory in the capital city of Dili and declared an independent East Timor on 28 November 1975 . 
 Claiming its assistance had been requested by East Timorese leaders , Indonesian military forces invaded on 7 December and by 1979 had all but destroyed armed resistance to the occupation . Following a controversial " Popular Assembly " which many said was not a genuine act of self @-@ determination , Indonesia declared the territory a province of Indonesia ( Timor Timur ) . 
 For twenty @-@ four years the Indonesian government subjected the people of East Timor to extrajudicial executions , routine and systematic torture , massacres and deliberate starvation . The 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre caused outrage around the world , and reports of other such killings were numerous . Resistance to Indonesian rule remained strong ; in 1996 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two men from East Timor , Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and José Ramos @-@ Horta , for their ongoing efforts to peacefully end the occupation . A 1999 vote to determine East Timor 's future resulted in an overwhelming majority in favour of independence , and in 2002 East Timor became an independent nation . The Commission for Reception , Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor estimated the number of deaths during the occupation from famine and violence to be between 90 @,@ 800 and 202 @,@ 600 including between 17 @,@ 600 and 19 @,@ 600 violent deaths or disappearances , out of a 1999 population of approximately 823 @,@ 386 . The truth commission held Indonesian forces responsible for about 70 % of the violent killings . 
 Immediately after the invasion , the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council passed resolutions condemning Indonesia 's actions and calling for immediate withdrawal . Australia and Indonesia were the only nations in the world to recognise East Timor as a province of Indonesia , and soon afterwards began negotiations to divide resources found in the Timor Gap . Other governments , including Japan , Canada and Malaysia , also supported the Indonesian government . The invasion and suppression of East Timor 's independence movement , however , caused great harm to Indonesia 's reputation and international credibility . 
 After the 1999 vote for independence , paramilitary groups working with the Indonesian military undertook a final wave of violence during which most of the country 's infrastructure was destroyed . The Australian led International Force for East Timor restored order and following the departure of Indonesian forces from East Timor , the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor administered the territory for two years , establishing a Serious Crimes Unit to investigate and prosecute crimes committed during 1999 . Its limited scope and the small number of sentences delivered by Indonesian courts have caused numerous observers to call for an international tribunal for East Timor . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Portuguese first arrived in Timor in the 16th century , and in 1702 East Timor came under Portuguese colonial administration . Portuguese rule was tenuous until the island was divided with the Dutch Empire in 1860 . A significant battleground during the Pacific War , East Timor was occupied by 20 @,@ 000 Japanese troops . The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia , but resulted in 60 @,@ 000 East Timorese deaths . 
 When Indonesia secured its independence after World War II under the leadership of Sukarno , it did not claim control of East Timor , and aside from general anti @-@ colonial rhetoric it did not oppose Portuguese control of the territory . A 1959 revolt in East Timor against the Portuguese was not endorsed by the Indonesian government . A 1962 United Nations document notes : " the government of Indonesia has declared that it maintains friendly relations with Portugal and has no claim to Portuguese Timor ... " . These assurances continued after Suharto took power in 1965 . An Indonesian official declared in December 1974 : " Indonesia has no territorial ambition ... Thus there is no question of Indonesia wishing to annex Portuguese Timor . " 
 In 1974 , a coup in Lisbon caused significant changes in Portugal 's relationship to its colony in Timor . The power shift in Europe invigorated movements for independence in colonies like Mozambique and Angola , and the new Portuguese government began a decolonisation process for East Timor . The first of these was an opening of the political process . 
 = = = FRETILIN , UDT , and APODETI = = = 
 When East Timorese political parties were first legalised in April 1974 , three groupings emerged as major players in the postcolonial landscape . The União Democrática Timorense ( Timorese Democratic Union , or UDT ) , was formed in May by a group of wealthy landowners . Initially dedicated to preserving East Timor as a protectorate of Portugal , in September UDT announced its support for independence . A week later , the Frente <unk> de Timor @-@ Leste Independente ( Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor , or FRETILIN ) appeared . Initially organised as the ASDT ( Associacão Social <unk> Timorense ) , the group endorsed " the universal doctrines of socialism " , as well as " the right to independence " . As the political process grew more tense , however , the group changed its name and declared itself " the only legitimate representative of the people " . The end of May saw the creation of a third party , Associacão Popular <unk> Timorense ( Timorese Popular Democratic Association , or APODETI ) . Advocating East Timor 's integration with Indonesia and originally named Associacão <unk> de Timor Indonesia ( Association for the Integration of Timor into Indonesia ) , APODETI expressed concerns that an independent East Timor would then be economically weak and vulnerable . 
 Indonesian nationalist and military hardliners , particularly leaders of the intelligence agency Kopkamtib and special operations unit , <unk> , saw the Portuguese coup as an opportunity for East Timor 's integration with Indonesia . The central government and military feared that an East Timor governed by leftists could be used as a base for incursions by unfriendly powers into Indonesia , and also that an independent East Timor within the archipelago could inspire secessionist sentiments within Indonesian provinces . The fear of national disintegration were played upon military leaders close to Suharto and remained as one of Indonesia 's strongest justifications for refusing to entertain the prospect of East Timorese independence or even autonomy until the late 1990s . The military intelligence organisations initially sought a non @-@ military annexation strategy , intending to use APODETI as its integration vehicle . 
 In January 1975 , UDT and FRETILIN established a tentative coalition dedicated to achieving independence for East Timor . At the same time , the Australian government reported that the Indonesian military had conducted a " pre @-@ invasion " exercise at Lampung . For months , the Indonesian Special Operations command , <unk> , had been covertly supporting APODETI through Operasi Komodo ( Operation Komodo , named after the lizard ) . By broadcasting accusations of communism among FRETILIN leaders and sowing discord in the UDT coalition , the Indonesian government fostered instability in East Timor and , observers said , created a pretext for invading . By May tensions between the two groups caused UDT to withdraw from the coalition . 
 In an attempt to negotiate a settlement to the dispute over East Timor 's future , the Portuguese Decolonization Commission convened a conference in June 1975 in Macau . FRETILIN boycotted the meeting in protest of APODETI 's presence ; representatives of UDT and APODETI complained that this was an effort to obstruct the decolonisation process . In his 1987 memoir <unk> : The Unfinished Saga of East Timor , FRETILIN leader José Ramos @-@ Horta recalls his " vehement protests " against his party 's refusal to attend the meeting . " This " , he writes , " was one of our tactical political errors for which I could never find an intelligent explanation . " 
 = = = Coup , civil war , and independence declaration = = = 
 The tension reached a boiling point in mid @-@ 1975 , when rumours began circulating of possible power seizures from both independence parties . In August 1975 , UDT staged a coup in the capital city Dili and a small @-@ scale civil war broke out . Ramos @-@ Horta describes the fighting as " bloody " , and details violence committed by both UDT and FRETILIN . He cites the International Committee of the Red Cross , which counted 2 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 people dead after the war . The fighting forced the Portuguese government onto the nearby island of <unk> . FRETILIN defeated UDT 's forces after two weeks , much to the surprise of Portugal and Indonesia . UDT leaders fled to Indonesian @-@ controlled West Timor . There they signed a petition on 7 September calling for East Timor 's integration with Indonesia ; most accounts indicate that UDT 's support for this position was forced by Indonesia . 
 Once they had gained control of East Timor , FRETILIN faced attacks from the west , by Indonesian military forces — then known as Angkatan <unk> Republik Indonesia ( ABRI ) — and by a small group of UDT troops . Indonesia captured the border city of <unk> on 8 October 1975 ; nearby Balibó and <unk> were taken eight days later . During the Balibó raid , members of an Australian television news crew — later dubbed the " <unk> Five " — were killed by Indonesian soldiers . Indonesian military officials say the deaths were accidental , and East Timorese witnesses say the journalists were deliberately killed . The deaths , and subsequent campaigns and investigations , attracted international attention and rallied support for East Timorese independence . 
 At the start of November , the foreign ministers from Indonesia and Portugal met in Rome to discuss a resolution of the conflict . Although no Timorese leaders were invited to the talks , FRETILIN sent a message expressing their desire to work with Portugal . The meeting ended with both parties agreeing that Portugal would meet with political leaders in East Timor , but the talks never took place . In mid @-@ November , Indonesian forces began shelling the city of <unk> from the sea , and captured it by the end of the month . 
 Frustrated by Portugal 's inaction , FRETILIN leaders believed they could ward off Indonesian advances more effectively if they declared an independent East Timor . National Political Commissioner Mari <unk> conducted a diplomatic tour of Africa , gathering support from governments there and elsewhere . According to FRETILIN , this effort yielded assurances from twenty @-@ five countries — including the People 's Republic of China , the Soviet Union , Mozambique , Sweden , and Cuba — to recognise the new nation . Cuba currently shares close relations with East Timor today . On 28 November 1975 , FRETILIN unilaterally declared independence for the Democratic Republic of East Timor . Indonesia announced , UDT and APODETI leaders in and around Balibó would respond the next day by declaring that region independent from East Timor and officially part of Indonesia . But this <unk> Declaration was drafted by Indonesian intelligence and signed on Bali . Later this was described as the ' <unk> Declaration ' , a pun on the Indonesian word for ' lie ' . Portugal rejected both declarations , and the Indonesian government approved military action to begin its annexation of East Timor . 
 = = Invasion = = 
 On 7 December 1975 , Indonesian forces invaded East Timor . Operasi <unk> ( Operation Lotus ) was the largest military operation ever carried out by that nation . Troops from FRETILIN 's military organisation FALINTIL engaged ABRI forces in the streets of Dili , and reported 400 Indonesian paratroopers were killed as they descended into the city . Angkasa Magazine reports 35 dead Indonesian troops , and 122 from the Fretilin side . By the end of the year , 10 @,@ 000 troops occupied Dili and another 20 @,@ 000 had been deployed throughout East Timor . Massively outnumbered , FALINTIL troops fled to the mountains and continued guerrilla combat operations . 
 = = = Indonesian atrocities = = = 
 From the start of the invasion onward , TNI forces engaged in the wholesale massacre of Timorese civilians . At the start of the occupation , FRETILIN radio sent the following broadcast : " The Indonesian forces are killing indiscriminately . Women and children are being shot in the streets . We are all going to be killed .... This is an appeal for international help . Please do something to stop this invasion . " One Timorese refugee told later of " rape [ and ] cold @-@ blooded assassinations of women and children and Chinese shop owners " . Dili 's bishop at the time , Martinho da Costa Lopes , said later : " The soldiers who landed started killing everyone they could find . There were many dead bodies in the streets – all we could see were the soldiers killing , killing , killing . " In one incident , a group of fifty men , women , and children – including Australian freelance reporter Roger East – were lined up on a cliff outside of Dili and shot , their bodies falling into the sea . Many such massacres took place in Dili , where onlookers were ordered to observe and count aloud as each person was executed . It is estimated that at least 2 @,@ 000 Timorese were massacred in the first two days of the invasion in Dili alone . In addition to FRETILIN supporters , Chinese migrants were also singled out for execution ; five hundred were killed in the first day alone . 
 The mass killings continued unabated as Indonesian forces advanced on the Fretilin @-@ held mountain regions of East Timor . A Timorese guide for a senior Indonesian officer told former Australian consul to Portuguese Timor James Dunn that during the early months of the fighting TNI troops " killed most Timorese they encountered . " In February 1976 after capturing the village of <unk> - to the south of Dili - and driving out the remaining Fretilin forces , Indonesian troops machine gunned most of the town 's population , allegedly shooting everyone over the age of three . The young children who were spared were taken back to Dili in trucks . At the time <unk> fell to Indonesian forces , the population was around 5 @,@ 000 ; by the time Indonesian relief workers visited the village in September 1976 only 1 @,@ 000 remained . In June 1976 , TNI troops badly battered by a Fretilin attack exacted retribution against a large refugee camp housing 5 @-@ 6 @,@ 000 Timorese at <unk> near the West Timor border . After setting several houses on fire , Indonesian soldiers massacred as many as 2 @,@ 000 men , women and children . 
 In March 1977 ex @-@ Australian consul James Dunn published a report detailing charges that since December 1975 Indonesian forces had killed between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 civilians in East Timor . This is consistent with a statement made on 13 February 1976 by UDT leader Lopez da Cruz that 60 @,@ 000 Timorese had been killed during the previous six months of civil war , suggesting a death toll of at least 55 @,@ 000 in the first two months of the invasion . A delegation of Indonesian relief workers agreed with this statistic . A late 1976 report by the Catholic Church also estimated the death toll at between 60 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 . These figures were also corroborated by those in the Indonesian government itself . In an interview on 5 April 1977 with the Sydney Morning Herald , Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik said the number of dead was " 50 @,@ 000 people or perhaps 80 @,@ 000 " . 
 The Indonesian government presented its annexation of East Timor as a matter of <unk> unity . A 1977 booklet from the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs , entitled Decolonization in East Timor , paid tribute to the " sacred right of self @-@ determination " and recognised APODETI as the true representatives of the East Timorese majority . It claimed that FRETILIN 's popularity was the result of a " policy of threats , blackmail and terror " . Later , Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas reiterated this position in his 2006 memoir The Pebble in the Shoe : The Diplomatic Struggle for East Timor . The island 's original division into east and west , Indonesia argued after the invasion , was " the result of colonial oppression " enforced by the Portuguese and Dutch imperial powers . Thus , according to the Indonesian government , its annexation of the 27th province was merely another step in the unification of the archipelago which had begun in the 1940s . 
 = = = UN response and international law = = = 
 On the day following the invasion , a committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened to debate the situation . Nations allied with Indonesia — including India , Japan , and Malaysia — wrote a resolution blaming Portugal and the Timorese political parties for the bloodshed ; it was rejected in favour of a draft prepared by Algeria , Cuba , Senegal , and Guyana , among others . This was adopted as GA Resolution <unk> ( XXX ) on 12 December , calling on Indonesia to " withdraw without delay " . Ten days later the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 384 ( 1975 ) , which echoes the GA resolution 's call for an immediate Indonesian withdrawal . One year later the Security Council expressed the same sentiment in Resolution 389 ( 1976 ) , and the General Assembly passed resolutions every year between 1976 and 1982 calling for self @-@ determination in East Timor . Governments of large countries like China and the United States opposed further action ; smaller countries like Costa Rica , Guinea @-@ Bissau , and Iceland were the only delegations calling for strong enforcement of the resolutions . The 1982 resolution calls on the UN Secretary @-@ General to " initiate consultations with all parties directly concerned , with a view to exploring avenues for achieving a comprehensive settlement of the problem " . 
 Legal expert Roger S. Clark notes that Indonesia 's invasion and occupation violated two key elements of international law : the right to self @-@ determination and the prohibition on aggression . Neither the petition of 7 September 1975 calling for integration , nor the later resolution of the " People 's Assembly " in May 1976 , qualify as " informed and democratic processes impartially conducted and based on universal adult suffrage " , as required by UN General Assembly Resolution 1541 ( XV ) , which establishes the guidelines for the norms of self @-@ determination . Other inadequacies existed in the petitions as well . 
 Indonesia 's use of military force in East Timor is cited as a violation of Chapter I of the United Nations Charter , which states : " All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state .... " Some observers have argued that East Timor was not a state at the time of the invasion , and is thus not protected by the UN Charter . This claim mirrors those made against Indonesia by the Dutch during the Indonesian National Revolution . As legal scholar Susan Marks points out , if East Timor was considered a Portuguese colony , then although " there may be some doubt about the application of this provision [ of UN Charter Chapter I ] in the context of an armed conflict between a colonial power and its own colony , there can hardly be doubt that it applies to force by one sovereign state against another state 's colony " . 
 = = Indonesian hegemony = = 
 On 17 December , Indonesia formed the Provisional Government of East Timor ( PGET ) which was headed by Arnaldo dos Reis Araújo of APODETI as president and Lopez da Cruz of UDT . Most sources describe this institution as a creation of the Indonesian military . One of PGET 's first activities was the formation of a " Popular Assembly " consisting of elected representatives and leaders " from various walks of Timorese life " . Like the PGET itself , the Popular Assembly is usually characterised as an instrument of propaganda created by the Indonesian military ; although international journalists were invited to witness the group 's meeting in May 1976 , their movement was tightly constrained . The Assembly drafted a request for formal integration into Indonesia , which Jakarta described as " the act of self @-@ determination " in East Timor . 
 Indonesia kept East Timor shut off from the rest of the world , except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s , claiming that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration . This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by , and was a non @-@ issue for , the majority of Indonesians . East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua , and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia . 
 = = = Indonesian campaigns against the resistance = = = 
 Leaders of Indonesian intelligence influential with Suharto had initially envisaged that invasion , <unk> of Fretilin resistance , and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless . The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese , an enormous drain on Indonesian resources , were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally , and ultimately a failure . The wanton , wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions during the opening months of the invasion had driven a large portion of the population and most of the remaining FALINTIL into the central regions . This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population . The civilian population came to see the FALINTIL as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces , which led to heightened support for the resistance . From 1975 to 1977 , the FRETILIN protected at least 40 % of the population who had fled the coastal regions , in inhospitable conditions , with the active support of rallied communities . Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military 's power base remained barely dented by the mid @-@ 1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures , was a measure of the military 's dominance of Indonesian affairs . 
 By the end of 1976 , a stalemate existed between the FALINTIL and the Indonesian army . Unable to overcome heavy resistance and drained of its resources , the TNI began rearming . Indonesian navy ordered missile @-@ firing patrol @-@ boats from the United States , Australia , the Netherlands , South Korea , and Taiwan , as well as submarines from West Germany . In February 1977 , Indonesia also received thirteen OV @-@ 10 Bronco aircraft from the Rockwell International Corporation with the aid of an official US government foreign military aid sales credit . The Bronco was ideal for the East Timor invasion , as it was specifically designed for counter @-@ insurgency operations in difficult terrain . By the beginning of February 1977 , at least six of the 13 Broncos were operating in East Timor , and helped the Indonesian military pinpoint Fretilin positions . The OV @-@ 10 Broncos dealt a heavy blow to the FALINTIL when the aircraft attacked their forces with conventional weapons and Soviet @-@ supplied Napalm known as ' <unk> . ' Along with the new weaponry , an additional 10 @,@ 000 troops were sent in to begin new campaigns that would become known as the ' final solution ' . 
 TNI strategists implemented a strategy of attrition against the FALINTIL beginning in September 1977 . This was accomplished by rendering the central regions of East Timor unable to sustain human life through napalm attacks , chemical warfare and destruction of crops . This was to be done in order to force the population to surrender into the custody of Indonesian forces and deprive the FALINTIL of food and population . Catholic officials in East Timor called this strategy an " encirclement and annihilation " campaign . 35 @,@ 000 ABRI troops surrounded areas of FRETILIN support and killed of men , women , and children . Air and naval bombardments were followed by ground troops , who destroyed villages and agricultural infrastructure . Thousands of people may have been killed during this period . In early 1978 , the entire civilian population of <unk> village , near the Indonesian border , was killed for supporting Fretilin after being bombarded and starved . The success of the ' encirclement and annihilation ' campaign led to the ' final cleansing campaign ' , in which children and men would be forced to hold hands and march in front of Indonesian units searching for Fretilin members . When Fretilin members were found , the members would be forced to surrender or to fire on their own people . 
 During this period , allegations of Indonesian use of chemical weapons arose , as villagers reported maggots appearing on crops after bombing attacks . FRETILIN radio claimed Indonesian planes dropped chemical agents , and several observers — including the Bishop of Dili — reported seeing napalm dropped on the countryside . The UN 's Commission for Reception , Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor , based on interviews with over 8 @,@ 000 witnesses , as well as Indonesian military papers and intelligence from international sources , confirmed that the Indonesians used chemical weapons and napalm to poison food and water supplies in FRETILIN controlled areas during the " encirclement and annihilation " campaign . 
 While brutal , the Indonesian ' encirclement and annihilation ' campaign of 1977 – 1978 was effective in that it broke the back of the main Fretilin militia . The capable Timorese President and military commander , Nicolau Lobato , was shot and killed by helicopter @-@ borne Indonesian troops on 31 December 1978 . 
 = = = Resettlement and enforced starvation = = = 
 As a result of the destruction of food crops , many civilians were forced to leave the hills and surrender to the TNI . Often , when surviving villagers came down to lower @-@ lying regions to surrender , the military would execute them . Those who were not killed outright by TNI troops were sent to receiving centers which were prepared in advance . These camps were located in close proximity to local military bases where Indonesian forces " screened " the population in order to single out members of the resistance , often with the aid of Timorese collaborators . In these transit camps , the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated . Those who were suspected of being members of the resistance were detained and killed . 
 These centers were often constructed of thatch huts with no toilets . Additionally , the Indonesian military barred the Red Cross from distributing humanitarian aid and no medical care was provided to the detainees . As a result , many of the Timorese - weakened by starvation and surviving on small rations given by their captors - died of malnutrition , cholera , diarrhea and tuberculosis . By late 1979 , between 300 @,@ 000 and 370 @,@ 000 Timorese had passed through these camps . After a period of three months , the detainees were resettled in " strategic hamlets " where they were imprisoned and subjected to enforced starvation . Those in the camps were prevented from traveling and cultivating farmland and were subjected to a curfew . The UN truth commission report confirmed the Indonesian military 's use of enforced starvation as a weapon to exterminate the East Timorese civilian population , and that large numbers of people were " positively denied access to food and its sources " . The report cited testimony from individuals who were denied food , and detailed destruction of crops and livestock by Indonesian soldiers . It concluded that this policy of deliberate starvation resulted in the deaths of 84 @,@ 200 to 183 @,@ 000 Timorese . One church worker reported five hundred East Timorese dying of starvation every month in one district . 
 World Vision Indonesia visited East Timor in October 1978 and claimed that 70 @,@ 000 East Timorese were at risk of starvation . An envoy from the International Committee of the Red Cross reported in 1979 that 80 percent of one camp 's population was malnourished , in a situation that was " as bad as Biafra " . The ICRC warned that " tens of thousands " were at risk of starvation . Indonesia announced that it was working through the government @-@ run Indonesian Red Cross to alleviate the crisis , but the NGO Action for World Development charged that organisation with selling donated aid supplies . 
 = = = Operasi Keamanan : 1981 – 82 = = = 
 In 1981 the Indonesian military launched Operasi Keamanan ( Operation Security ) , which some have named the " fence of legs " program . During this operation , Indonesian forces conscripted 50 @,@ 000 to 80 @,@ 000 Timorese men and boys to march through the mountains ahead of advancing TNI troops as human shields to foreclose a FRETILIN counterattack . The objective was to sweep the guerillas into the central part of the region where they could be eradicated . Many of those conscripted into the " fence of legs " died of starvation , exhaustion or were shot by Indonesian forces for allowing guerillas to slip through . As the " fence " converged on villages , Indonesian forces massacred an unknown number of civilians . At least 400 villagers were massacred in <unk> by Battalion 744 of the Indonesian Army in September 1981 . An eyewitness who testified before the Australian Senate stated that soldiers deliberately killed small children by smashing their heads against a rock . The operation failed to crush the resistance , and popular resentment toward the occupation grew stronger than ever . As FRETILIN troops in the mountains continued their sporadic attacks , Indonesian forces carried out numerous operations to destroy them over the next ten years . In the cities and villages , meanwhile , a non @-@ violent resistance movement began to take shape . 
 = = = ' Operation Clean @-@ Sweep ' : 1983 = = = 
 The failure of successive Indonesian counterinsurgency campaigns led the Indonesian military elite to instruct the commander of the Dili @-@ based Sub regional Military Resort Command , Colonel <unk> to initiate peace talks with FRETILIN commander Xanana Gusmão in a FRETILIN @-@ controlled area in March 1983 . When Xanana sought to invoke Portugal and the UN in the negotiations , ABRI Commander Benny Moerdani broke the ceasefire by announcing a new counterinsurgency offensive called " Operational Clean @-@ Sweep " in August 1983 , <unk> , " This time no fooling around . This time we are going to hit them without mercy . " 
 The breakdown of the ceasefire agreement was followed by a renewed wave of massacres , summary executions and " <unk> " at the hands of Indonesian forces . In August 1983 , 200 people were burned alive in the village of <unk> , with 500 others killed at a nearby river . Between August and December 1983 , Amnesty International documented the arrests and " disappearances " of over 600 people in the capital city alone . Relatives were told by Indonesian forces that the " disappeared " were sent to Bali . 
 Those suspected of opposing integration were often arrested and tortured . In 1983 Amnesty International published an Indonesian manual it had received from East Timor instructing military personnel on how to inflict physical and mental anguish , and cautioning troops to " Avoid taking photographs showing torture ( of someone being given electric shocks , stripped naked and so on ) " . In his 1997 memoir East Timor 's Unfinished Struggle : Inside the Timorese Resistance , <unk> Pinto describes being tortured by Indonesian soldiers : " With each question , I would get two or three punches in the face . When someone punches you so much and so hard , it feels as if your face is broken . People hit me on my back and on my sides with their hands and then kicked me .... [ In another location ] they psychologically tortured me ; they didn 't hit me , but they made strong threats to kill me . They even put a gun on the table . " In Michele Turner 's book Telling East Timor : Personal <unk> 1942 – 1992 , a woman named Fátima describes watching torture take place in a Dili prison : " They make people sit on a chair with the front of the chair on their own toes . It is mad , yes . The soldiers urinate in the food then mix it up for the person to eat . They use electric shock and they use an electric machine .... " 
 = = = Violence against women = = = 
 Indonesian military abuses against women in East Timor were numerous and well @-@ documented . In addition to suffering arbitrary detainment , torture , and extrajudicial execution , women faced rape and sexual abuse — sometimes for the crime of being related to an independence activist . The scope of the problem is difficult to ascertain , owing to the intense military control imposed during the occupation , compounded by the shame felt by victims . In a 1995 report on violence against women in Indonesia and East Timor , Amnesty International USA wrote : " Women are reluctant to pass on information to non @-@ governmental organizations about rape and sexual abuse , let alone to report violations to the military or police authorities . " 
 Other forms of violence against women took the form of harassment , intimidation , and enforced marriage . The Amnesty report cites the case of a woman forced to live with a commander in <unk> , then harassed daily by troops after her release . Such " marriages " took place regularly during the occupation . Women were also encouraged to accept sterilisation procedures , and some were pressured to take the contraceptive Depo Provera , sometimes without full knowledge of its effects . 
 In 1999 researcher Rebecca Winters released the book <unk> : Voice of East Timorese Women , which chronicles many personal stories of violence and abuse dating to the earliest days of the occupation . One woman tells of being interrogated while stripped half @-@ naked , tortured , molested , and threatened with death . Another describes being chained at the hands and feet , raped repeatedly , and interrogated for weeks . A woman who had prepared food for FRETILIN guerrillas was arrested , burned with cigarettes , tortured with electricity , and forced to walk naked past a row of soldiers into a tank filled with urine and feces . 
 = = = Abuses by FRETILIN = = = 
 The Indonesian government reported in 1977 that several mass graves containing " scores " of people killed by FRETILIN had been found near <unk> and <unk> . Amnesty International confirmed these reports in 1985 , and also expressed concern about several extrajudicial killings for which FRETILIN had claimed responsibility . In 1997 Human Rights Watch condemned a series of attacks carried out by FRETILIN , which led to the deaths of nine civilians . 
 = = = Demography and economy = = = 
 The Portuguese language was banned in East Timor and Indonesian was made the language of government , education and public commerce , and the Indonesian school curriculum was implemented . The official Indonesian national ideology , Pancasila , was applied to East Timor and government jobs were restricted to those holding certification in Pancasila training . East Timorese animist belief systems did not fit with Indonesia 's constitutional monotheism , resulting in mass conversions to Christianity . Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass was replaced by Indonesian mass . Before the invasion , less than 30 percent of East Timorese were Roman Catholics , and by the 1980s , 80 percent were registered as Catholics . With a 90 percent Catholic population , East Timor is currently one of the most densely Catholic countries in the world . 
 East Timor was a particular focus for the Indonesian government 's transmigration program , which aimed to resettle Indonesians from densely to less populated regions . Media censorship under the " New Order " meant that the state of conflict in East Timor was unknown to the <unk> , predominantly poor Javanese and Balinese wet @-@ rice farmers . On arrival they found themselves under ongoing threat of attack by East Timorese resistance fighters , and became the object of local resentment , since large tracts of land belonging to East Timorese had been compulsorily appropriated by the Indonesian government for transmigrant settlement . Although many gave up and returned to their island of origin , those migrants that stayed in East Timor contributed to the " <unk> " of East Timor 's integration . 662 transmigrant families ( 2 @,@ 208 people ) settled in East Timor in 1993 , whereas an estimated 150 @,@ 000 free Indonesian settlers lived in East Timor by the mid @-@ 1990s , including those offered jobs in education and administration . Migration increased resentment amongst Timorese who were overtaken by more business savvy immigrants . 
 Following the invasion , Portuguese commercial interests were taken over by Indonesians . The border with West Timor was opened resulting in an influx of West Timorese farmers , and in January 1989 the territory was open to private investment . Economic life in the towns was subsequently brought under the control of entrepreneurial Bugis , Makassarese , and <unk> immigrants from South Sulawesi , while East Timor products were exported under partnerships between army officials and Indonesian businessmen . <unk> , a military @-@ controlled firm , monopolised some of East Timor 's most lucrative commercial activities , including sandal wood export , hotels , and the import of consumer products . The group 's most profitable business , however , was its monopoly on the export of coffee , which was the territory 's most valuable cash crop . Indonesian entrepreneurs came to dominate non @-@ <unk> / military enterprises , and local manufactures from the Portuguese period made way for Indonesian imports . 
 The Indonesian government 's primary response to criticism of its policies was to highlight its funding of development in East Timor 's health , education , communications , transportation , and agriculture . East Timor , however , remained poor following centuries of Portuguese colonial neglect and Indonesian critic George <unk> points out that conflict in the early years of occupation lead to sharp drops in rice and coffee production , and livestock populations . Other critics argue that infrastructure development , such as road construction , is often designed to facilitate Indonesian military and corporate interests . While the military controlled key businesses , private investors , both Indonesian and international , avoided the territory . Despite improvements since 1976 , a 1993 Indonesian government report estimated that in three @-@ quarters of East Timor 's 61 districts , more than half lived in poverty .

 = = = Changing resistance and integration campaigns = = = 
 Major investment by the Indonesian government to improve East Timor 's infrastructure , and health and education facilities since 1975 , did not end East Timorese resistance to Indonesian rule . Although by the 1980s Fretilin forces had dropped to a few hundred armed men , Fretilin increased its contacts with young Timorese especially in Dili , and an un @-@ armed civil resistance seeking self @-@ determination took shape . Many of those in the protest movements were young children at the time of the invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system . They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian , were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development , and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves , stressing their Portuguese heritage . Seeking help from Portugal for self @-@ determination , they considered Indonesia an occupying force . Abroad , Fretilin 's members — most notably former journalist José Ramos @-@ Horta ( later to be Prime Minister and President ) — pushed their cause in diplomatic forums . 
 The reduced armed resistance prompted the Indonesian government in 1988 to open up East Timor to improve its commercial prospects , including a lifting of the travel ban on journalists . The new policy came from foreign minister Ali Alatas against the advice of the military leadership who feared it would lead to loss of control . Alatas and diplomats swayed Suharto of the policy as a response to international concerns . In late 1989 , hardline military commander Brigadier General <unk> was replaced by Brigadier General Rudolph Warouw who promised a more " persuasive " approach to anti @-@ <unk> . Restrictions on travel within the territory were reduced , groups of political prisoners were released , and the use of torture in interrogation became less common . Warouw attempted to increase military discipline ; in February 1990 an Indonesian soldier was prosecuted for unlawful conduct in East Timor , the first such action since the invasion . 
 A reduced fear of persecution encouraged the resistance movements ; anti @-@ integration protests accompanied high @-@ profile visits to East Timor including that of Pope John Paul II in 1989 . The end of the Cold War removed much of the justification for western support of Indonesia 's occupation . The resulting increase in international attention to self @-@ determination and human rights put further pressure on Indonesia . Subsequent events within East Timor in the 1990s helped to dramatically raise the international profile of East Timor , which in turn significantly boosted the momentum of the resistance groups . 
 = = = Santa Cruz massacre = = = 
 During a memorial mass on 12 November 1991 for a pro @-@ independence youth shot by Indonesian troops , demonstrators among the 2 @,@ 500 @-@ strong crowd unfurled the <unk> flag and banners with pro @-@ independence slogans , and chanted boisterously but peacefully . Following a brief confrontation between Indonesian troops and protesters , 200 Indonesian soldiers opened fire on the crowd killing at least 250 Timorese . 
 The testimonies of foreigners at the cemetery were quickly reported to international news organisations , and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage . In response to the massacre , activists around the world organised in solidarity with the East Timorese , and a new urgency was brought to calls for self @-@ determination . <unk> , a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia , increased its work around East Timor . In the United States , the East Timor Action Network ( now the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network ) was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country . Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal , Australia , Japan , Germany , Malaysia , Ireland , and Brazil . Coverage of the massacre was a vivid example of how growth of new media in Indonesia was making it increasingly difficult for the " New Order " to control information flow in and out of Indonesia , and that in the post @-@ Cold War 1990s , the government was coming under increasing international scrutiny . A number of pro @-@ democracy student groups and their magazines began to openly and critically discuss not just East Timor , but also the " New Order " and the broader history and future of Indonesia . 
 Sharp condemnation of the military came not just from the international community , but from within parts of the Indonesian elite . The massacre ended the governments 1989 opening of the territory and a new period of repression began . Warouw was removed from his position and his more accommodating approach to Timorese resistance rebuked by his superiors . Suspected Fretilin sympathisers were arrested , human rights abuses rose , and the ban on foreign journalists was reimposed . Hatred intensified amongst Timorese of the Indonesian military presence . Major General Prabowo 's , Kopassus Group 3 trained militias gangs dressed in black hoods to crush the remaining resistance . 
 = = = Arrest of Xanana Gusmão = = = 
 On 20 November 1992 FRETILIN leader Xanana Gusmão was arrested by Indonesian troops . In May 1993 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for " rebellion " , but his sentence was later commuted to 20 years . The arrest of the universally acknowledged leader of the resistance was a major frustration to the anti @-@ integration movement in East Timor , but Gusmão continued to serve as a symbol of hope from inside the <unk> prison . Nonviolent resistance by East Timorese , meanwhile , continued to show itself . When President Bill Clinton visited Jakarta in 1994 , twenty @-@ nine East Timorese students occupied the US embassy to protest US support for Indonesia . 
 At the same time , human rights observers called attention to continued violations by Indonesian troops and police . A 1995 report by Human Rights Watch noted that " abuses in the territory continue to mount " , including torture , disappearances , and limitations on basic rights . After a series of riots in September and October 1995 , Amnesty International criticised Indonesian authorities for a wave of arbitrary arrests and torture . The report indicates detainees were beaten with iron bars , kicked , lacerated , and threatened with death . 
 = = = Nobel Peace Prize = = = 
 In 1996 East Timor was suddenly brought to world attention when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and José Ramos @-@ Horta " for their work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor " . The Nobel Committee indicated in its press release that it hoped the award would " spur efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in East Timor based on the people 's right to self @-@ determination " . As Nobel scholar Irwin Abrams notes : 
 For Indonesia the prize was a great embarrassment .... In public statements the government tried to put distance between the two laureates , grudgingly recognising the prize for Bishop Belo , over whom it thought it could exercise some control , but accusing Ramos @-@ Horta of responsibility for atrocities during the civil strife in East Timor and declaring that he was a political opportunist . 
 At the award ceremony Chairman <unk> answered these charges , pointing out that during the civil conflict Ramos @-@ Horta was not even in the country and on his return he tried to reconcile the two parties . 
 Diplomats from Indonesia and Portugal , meanwhile , continued the consultations required by the 1982 General Assembly resolution , in a series of meetings intended to resolve the problem of what Foreign Minister Ali Alatas called the " pebble in the Indonesian shoe " .

 = = = Transition in Indonesia = = = 
 Independence for East Timor , or even limited regional autonomy , was never going to be allowed under Suharto 's New Order . Notwithstanding Indonesian public opinion in the 1990s occasionally showing begrudging appreciation of the Timorese position , it was widely feared that an independent East Timor would destabilise Indonesian unity . The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis , however , caused tremendous upheaval in Indonesia and led to Suharto 's resignation in May 1998 , ending his thirty @-@ year presidency . Prabowo , by then in command of the powerful Indonesian Strategic Reserve , went into exile in Jordan and military operations in East Timor were costing the bankrupt Indonesian government a million dollars a day . The subsequent " <unk> " period of relative political openness and transition , included unprecedented debate about Indonesia 's relationship with East Timor . For the remainder of 1998 , discussion forums took place throughout Dili working towards a referendum . Foreign Minister Alatas , described plans for phased autonomy leading to possible independence as " all pain , no gain " for Indonesia . On 8 June 1998 , three weeks after taking office , Suharto 's successor B. J. Habibie announced that Indonesia would soon offer East Timor a special plan for autonomy . 
 In late 1998 , the Australian Government of John Howard drafted a letter to Indonesia advising of a change in Australian policy , and advocating for the staging of referendum on independence within a decade . President Habibie saw such an arrangement as implying " colonial rule " by Indonesia and he decided to call a snap referendum on the issue . 
 Indonesia and Portugal announced on 5 May 1999 that it had agreed to hold a vote allowing the people of East Timor to choose between the autonomy plan or independence . The vote , to be administered by the United Nations Mission in East Timor ( UNAMET ) , was originally scheduled for 8 August but later postponed until 30 August . Indonesia also took responsibility for security ; this arrangement caused worry in East Timor , but many observers believe that Indonesia would have refused to allow foreign peacekeepers during the vote . 
 = = = 1999 referendum = = = 
 As groups supporting autonomy and independence began campaigning , a series of pro @-@ integration paramilitary groups of East Timorese began threatening violence — and indeed committing violence — around the country . Alleging pro @-@ independence bias on the part of UNAMET , the groups were seen working with and receiving training from Indonesian soldiers . Before the May agreement was announced , an April paramilitary attack in <unk> left dozens of East Timorese dead . On 16 May 1999 , a gang accompanied by Indonesian troops attacked suspected independence activists in the village of Atara ; in June another group attacked a UNAMET office in <unk> . Indonesian authorities claimed to be helpless to stop the violence between rival factions among the East Timorese , but Ramos @-@ Horta joined many others in scoffing at such notions . In February 1999 he said : " Before [ Indonesia ] withdraws it wants to wreak major havoc and destabilization , as it has always promised . We have consistently heard that over the years from the Indonesian military in Timor . " 
 As militia leaders warned of a " bloodbath " , Indonesian " roving ambassador " Francisco Lopes da Cruz declared : " If people reject autonomy there is the possibility blood will flow in East Timor . " One paramilitary announced that a vote for independence would result in a " sea of fire " , an expression referring to the Bandung Sea of Fire during Indonesia 's own war of independence from the Dutch . As the date of the vote drew near , reports of anti @-@ independence violence continued to accumulate . 
 The day of the vote , 30 August 1999 , was generally calm and orderly . 98 @.@ 6 percent of registered voters cast ballots , and on 4 September UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan announced that 78 @.@ 5 percent of the votes had been cast for independence . Brought up on the " New Order " ' s insistence that the East Timorese supported integration , Indonesians were either shocked by , or disbelieved that the East Timorese had voted against being part of Indonesia . Many accepted media stories blaming the supervising United Nations and Australia who had pressured Habibie for a resolution . 
 Within hours of the results , paramilitary groups had begun attacking people and setting fires around the capital Dili . Foreign journalists and election observers fled , and tens of thousands of East Timorese took to the mountains . Islamic gangs attacked Dili 's Catholic Diocese building , killing two dozen people ; the next day , the headquarters of the ICRC was attacked and burned to the ground . Almost one hundred people were killed later in <unk> , and reports of similar massacres poured in from around East Timor . The UN withdrew most of its personnel , but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees . Four UN workers refused to evacuate unless the refugees were withdrawn as well , insisting they would rather die at the hands of the paramilitary groups . At the same time , Indonesian troops and paramilitary gangs forced over 200 @,@ 000 people into West Timor , into camps described by Human Rights Watch as " deplorable conditions " . 
 When a UN delegation arrived in Jakarta on 8 September , they were told by Indonesian President Habibie that reports of bloodshed in East Timor were " fantasies " and " lies " . General Wiranto of the Indonesian military insisted that his soldiers had the situation under control , and later expressed his emotion for East Timor by singing the 1975 hit song " Feelings " at an event for military wives . 
 = = = Indonesian withdrawal and peacekeeping force = = = 
 The violence was met with widespread public anger in Australia , Portugal and elsewhere and activists in Portugal , Australia , the United States and other nations pressured their governments to take action . Australian Prime Minister John Howard consulted United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and lobbied US President Bill Clinton to support an Australian led international peace keeper force to enter East Timor to end the violence . The United States offered crucial logistical and intelligence resources and an " over @-@ horizon " deterrent presence , but did not commit forces to the operation . Finally , on 11 September , Bill Clinton announced : 
 Indonesia , in dire economic straits relented . President BJ Habibie announced on 12 September that Indonesia would withdraw Indonesian soldiers and allow an Australian @-@ led international peacekeeping force to enter East Timor . 
 On 15 September 1999 , the United Nations Security Council expressed concern at the deteriorating situation in East Timor , and issued UNSC Resolution 1264 calling for a multinational force to restore peace and security to East Timor , to protect and support the United Nations mission there , and to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations until such time as a United Nations peacekeeping force could be approved and deployed in the area . 
 The International Force for East Timor , or INTERFET , under the command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove , entered Dili on 20 September and by 31 October the last Indonesian troops had left East Timor . The arrival of thousands of international troops in East Timor caused the militia to flee across the border into Indonesia , from whence sporadic cross @-@ border raids by the militia against INTERFET forces were conducted . 
 The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) was established at the end of October and administered the region for two years . Control of the nation was turned over to the Government of East Timor and independence was declared on 20 May 2002 . On 27 September of the same year , East Timor joined the United Nations as its 191st member state . 
 The bulk of the military forces of INTERFET were Australian — more than 5 @,@ 500 troops at its peak , including an infantry brigade , with armoured and aviation support — while eventually 22 nations contributed to the force which at its height numbered over 11 @,@ 000 troops . The United States provided crucial logistic and diplomatic support throughout the crisis , while the cruiser USS Mobile Bay protected the INTERFET naval fleet and a US Marine infantry battalion of 1 @,@ 000 men — plus organic armour and artillery — was also stationed off the coast aboard the USS Belleau Wood to provide a strategic reserve in the event of significant armed opposition . 
 = = International response = = 
 Indonesia used fear of communism to garner varying degrees of support among western countries , including the United States and Australia , for its East Timor invasion and occupation . The invasion and suppression of East Timor 's independence movement caused great harm to Indonesia 's reputation and international credibility . Criticism from the developing world undermined efforts in the 1980s to secure the Non @-@ Aligned Movement chair which Suharto strongly desired for Indonesia and condemnation of Indonesia continued through the 1990s .

 See main article Australian Involvement in the East Timor Invasion 
 In September 1974 , Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam met with Suharto and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor . On 11 November 1975 , the Whitlam government was dismissed . This placed restrictions on the caretaker government of Fraser . Until the results of the 13 December election were known any action required approval from both political parties and the Governor General . On 4 December 1975 Australia unsuccessfully sought a UN resolution to determine the independence of East Timor , the Australian Government evacuated Australians and other foreign nationals from Dili . José Ramos @-@ Horta arrived in Darwin on 5 December saying that aid agencies the Australian Red Cross and Australian Society for <unk> Aid Timor ( <unk> ) had been banned from East Timor . In the same news conference Horta said that East Timor , <unk> Government would not accept any UN assistance that included Australia . 
 After winning the December elections , the Fraser government took the approach that trade with Southeast Asia and political ties with Southeast Asia were too important to be put at risk for what was seen as a lost cause . Australia abstained from the 1976 and 1977 UN General Assembly Resolutions , and by 1978 became the only government to officially recognise East Timor as a province of Indonesia . 
 One year later , Australia and Indonesia began drafting a treaty to share resources in the Timor Gap . The treaty was signed in December 1989 , with estimates ranging from one to seven billion barrels of oil to be secured . This agreement , along with general economic partnership with Indonesia , is frequently cited as a crucial factor for the Australian government 's position . And yet given that nearly 60 @,@ 000 East Timorese had died during the fighting between Australian and Japanese forces that followed the invasion of Timor by the Japanese during the Pacific War some Australians believed their government owed a special debt to the former Portuguese colony . James Dunn , a senior Foreign Affairs adviser to the Australian Parliament before and during the occupation , condemned the government 's position , saying later : " What had been of vital strategic value in 1941 was , in 1974 , irrelevant and dispensable . " Some Australian World War II veterans protested the occupation for similar reasons . 
 Successive Australian governments saw good relations and stability in Indonesia ( Australia 's largest neighbour ) as providing an important security buffer to Australia 's north , but the East Timor issue complicated co @-@ operation between the two nations . Australia provided important sanctuary to East Timorese independence advocates like José Ramos @-@ Horta ( who based himself in Australia during his exile ) . Australia 's trade with Indonesia grew through the 1980s and the Keating Labor Government signed a security pact with Indonesia in 1995 and gave relations with Jakarta a high priority . The fall of Indonesian President Suharto and a shift in Australian policy by the Howard Government in 1998 helped precipitate a proposal for a referendum on the question of independence for East Timor . In late 1998 , Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer drafted a letter to Indonesia setting out a change in Australian policy , suggesting that East Timor be given a chance to vote on independence within a decade . The letter upset Indonesian President B. J. Habibie , who saw it as implying Indonesia was a " colonial power " and he decided to announce a snap referendum . A UN sponsored referendum held in 1999 showed overwhelming approval for independence , but was followed by violent clashes and a security crisis , instigated by anti @-@ independence militia . Australia then led a United Nations backed International Force for East Timor to end the violence and order was restored . While the intervention was ultimately successful , Australian @-@ Indonesian relations would take several years to recover . 
 The Australian Labor Party altered its East Timor policy in 1999 and adopted a policy of support for East Timorese independence and opposition to the Indonesian presence there , through its Foreign Affairs spokesperson Laurie Brereton . <unk> ' credibility was attacked by the governing Liberal @-@ National Coalition government and its Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer , and Prime Minister Howard . They were assisted in their campaign by the then @-@ Labor @-@ backbencher Kevin Rudd ( who would later lead the Labor Party to victory in the 2007 Australian federal election ) .

 Owing to its strong relation with Indonesia , the Philippines initially was cold on the issue . In fact , not only that it denied José Ramos @-@ Horta entry in 1997 ( when he was supposed to give a lecture to the University of the Philippines Diliman ) , then President @-@ Fidel V. Ramos even included him in the immigration blacklist . 
 However , with the widespread support from various countries , the Philippines finally changed its policy . After Timorese Independence , the Philippines contributed medical and logistics personnel to <unk> , rather than ground troops . The UN named a Filipino , Lieutenant General Jaime <unk> Santos , to command the full @-@ fledged UN peacekeeping force which takes over from <unk> on Tuesday . 
 Sharing the same Roman Catholic heritage , the Philippines became a natural ally and has maintained a good relationship with East Timor until now . It has since removed José Ramos @-@ Horta from the blacklist ; he frequently gives lectures in various universities in the Philippines , most notably in the University of the Philippines Diliman , Polytechnic University of the Philippines , De La Salle University and Ateneo de Davao University .

 The day after the invasion , Portugal cut diplomatic ties with Indonesia and went on to support UN resolutions condemning the invasion . However , in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the Portuguese government appeared reluctant to push the issue ; American Indonesia specialist , Benedict Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its application to the European Community . Portugal 's criticism mounted sharply from the mid @-@ 1980s , and due to public pressure , the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for East Timorese self @-@ determination . Throughout the 1990s , Portugal took part in UN @-@ brokered mediations with Indonesia . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 In 1975 , the United States was completing a retreat from Vietnam . A staunchly anti @-@ communist Indonesia was considered by the United States to be an essential counterweight , and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered more important than a decolonisation process in East Timor . The United States also wanted to maintain its access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans . 
 On the day before the invasion , US President Gerald R. Ford and US Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger met with Indonesian president Suharto and reportedly gave their approval for the invasion . In response to Suharto saying " We want your understanding if it was deemed necessary to take rapid or drastic action [ in East Timor ] . " Ford replied , " We will understand and not press you on the issue . We understand the problem and the intentions you have . " Kissinger similarly agreed , though he had fears that the use of US @-@ made arms in the invasion would be exposed to public scrutiny , talking of their desire to " influence the reaction in America " so that " there would be less chance of people talking in an unauthorised way . " The US also hoped the invasion would be swift and not involve protracted resistance . " It is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly , " Kissinger said to Suharto . Kissinger 's main fear appears to have been that a violent take @-@ over by the partly communist FRETILIN party might inspire similar Communist victories throughout Asia and possibly even lead to secessionist revolts threatening the very survival of Indonesia as a state . 
 The US supplied weapons to Indonesia during the invasion and the subsequent occupation . A week after the invasion of East Timor , the National Security Council prepared a detailed analysis which found that the vast majority of the military equipment was US supplied . While the US government said they had suspended military assistance from December 1975 to June 1976 , military aid was actually above what the US Department of State proposed and the US Congress continued to increase it , nearly doubling it . Between 1975 and 1980 , when the violence in East Timor was at its climax , the United States furnished approximately $ 340 million in weaponry to the Indonesian government . US military aid and arms sales to Indonesia increased from 1974 and continued through to the Bush and Clinton years until it was stopped in 1999 . US arms provisions to Indonesia between 1975 and 1995 amounted to approximately $ 1 @.@ 1 billion . 
 The UN 's Commission for Reception , Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor ( CAVR ) stated in the " Responsibility " chapter of its final report that US " political and military support were fundamental to the Indonesian invasion and occupation " of East Timor between 1975 and 1999 . The report ( p . 92 ) also stated that " U.S. supplied weaponry was crucial to Indonesia 's capacity to intensify military operations from 1977 in its massive campaigns to destroy the Resistance in which aircraft supplied by the United States played a crucial role . " 
 Fretilin has claimed that the degree of US support for the Indonesian government 's efforts in East Timor may have extended beyond that of diplomatic support and material assistance . A UPI report from Sydney , Australia dated 19 June 1978 , quoted a Fretilin press release , which stated : " American military advisers and mercenaries fought alongside Indonesian soldiers against FRETILIN in two battles ... In the meantime , American pilots are flying OV @-@ 10 Bronco aircraft for the Indonesian Air Force in bombing raids against the liberated areas under FRETILIN control . " 
 The United States abstained from most of the UN resolutions censuring the Indonesian invasion . Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the US Ambassador to the UN at the time , wrote later in his memoirs : " The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook . This task was given to me , and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success . " 
 = = = Other countries = = = 
 Britain , Canada , Japan , and other nations supported Indonesia during the occupation of East Timor . Britain abstained from all of the UN General Assembly resolutions relating to East Timor , and sold arms throughout the occupation . In 1978 Indonesia purchased eight BAE Hawk jet trainers , which were used during the " encirclement and annihilation " campaign . Britain sold dozens of additional jets to Indonesia in the 1990s . Canada abstained from early General Assembly resolutions about East Timor , and opposed three . The Canadian government regularly sold weapons to Indonesia during the occupation , and in the 1990s approved over CDN $ 400 million in exports for spare weapons parts . Japan voted against all eight General Assembly resolutions regarding East Timor . 
 The Indian government also supported Indonesia , likening the occupation to its own seizure of Goa in 1961 . Some analysts remarked that Indonesia 's delayed action also prevented peaceful transfer of East Timor to it , similar to the manner in which the French transferred Pondicherry to India in 1962 . 
 Member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , consistently voted against the General Assembly resolutions calling for self @-@ determination in East Timor .

 = = = Number of deaths = = = 
 Precise estimates of the death toll are difficult to determine . The 2005 report of the UN 's Commission for Reception , Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor ( CAVR ) reports an estimated minimum number of conflict @-@ related deaths of 102 @,@ 800 ( + / - 12 @,@ 000 ) . Of these , the report says that approximately 18 @,@ 600 ( + / <unk> ) were either killed or disappeared , and that approximately 84 @,@ 000 ( + / <unk> ) died from hunger or illness in excess of what would have been expected due to peacetime mortality . These figures represent a minimum conservative estimate that CAVR says is its scientifically @-@ based principal finding . The report did not provide an upper bound , however , CAVR speculated that the total number of deaths due to conflict @-@ related hunger and illness could have been as high as 183 @,@ 000 . The truth commission held Indonesian forces responsible for about 70 % of the violent killings . 
 Researcher Ben Kiernan says that " a toll of 150 @,@ 000 is likely close to the truth , " although one can throw out an estimate of 200 @,@ 000 or higher . The Center for Defense Information also estimated a total close to 150 @,@ 000 . A 1974 Catholic church estimate of the population of East Timor was 688 @,@ 711 people ; in 1982 the church reported only 425 @,@ 000 . This led to an estimate of 200 @,@ 000 people killed during the occupation , which was widely reported around the world . Other sources such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also support an estimate of over 200 @,@ 000 killed . 
 According to specialist Gabriel <unk> on the basis of statistical data available from the Portuguese and Indonesian authorities , and from the Catholic Church , between December 1975 and December 1981 , approximately 308 @,@ 000 Timorese lost their lives ; this constituted about 44 % of the pre @-@ invasion population . Similarly Indonesian Professor George <unk> , formerly of Salatiga University in Java , concluded from his study of Indonesian Army data that in fact 300 @,@ 000 Timorese had been killed in the early years of the occupation . 
 Robert Cribb of the Australian National University argues that the toll was significantly exaggerated . He argues that the 1980 census that counted 555 @,@ 350 Timorese , although " the most reliable source of all , " was probably a minimum rather than a maximum estimate for the total population . " It is worth recalling that hundreds of thousands of East Timorese disappeared during the violence of September 1999 , only to reappear later , " he writes . The 1980 census becomes more improbable in the face of the 1987 census that counted 657 @,@ 411 Timorese – this would require a growth rate of 2 @.@ 5 % per year , nearly identical to the very high growth rate in East Timor from 1970 to 1975 , and a highly unlikely one given the conditions of the brutal occupation , including Indonesian efforts to discourage reproduction . Noting the relative lack of personal accounts of atrocities or of traumatised Indonesian soldiers , he further adds that East Timor " does not appear — on the basis of news reports and academic accounts — to be a society traumatized by mass death ... the circumstance leading up to the Dili massacre of 1991 ... indicate a society which retained its vigor and indignation in a way which would probably not have been possible if it had been treated as Cambodia was treated under Pol Pot . " Even Indonesian military strategy was based on winning the " hearts and minds " of the population , a fact that does not support charges of mass killing . 
 Kiernan , starting from a base population of 700 @,@ 000 Timorese in 1975 ( based on the 1974 Catholic Church census ) calculated an expected 1980 population of 735 @,@ 000 Timorese ( assuming a growth rate of only 1 % per year as a result of the occupation ) . Accepting the 1980 count that Cribb regards as at least 10 % ( 55 @,@ 000 ) too low , Kiernan concluded that as many as 180 @,@ 000 may have died in the war . Cribb argued that the 3 % growth rate suggested by the 1974 census was too high , citing the fact that the church had previously postulated a growth rate of 1 @.@ 8 % , which would have produced a figure in line with the Portuguese population estimate of 635 @,@ 000 for 1974 . 
 Although Cribb maintained that the Portuguese census was almost certainly an underestimate , he believed it to be more likely correct than the church census , due to the fact that any church attempt to extrapolate the size of the total population " must be seen in light of its incomplete access to society " ( less than half of Timorese were Catholic ) . Assuming a growth rate in line with the other nations of South East Asia , then , would yield a more accurate figure of 680 @,@ 000 for 1975 , and an expected 1980 population of slightly over 775 @,@ 000 ( without accounting for the decline in the birth rate resulting from the Indonesian occupation ) . The deficit remaining would be almost exactly 200 @,@ 000 . According to Cribb , Indonesian policies restricted the birth rate by up to 50 % or more , thus around 45 @,@ 000 of these were not born rather than killed ; another 55 @,@ 000 were " missing " as a result of the Timorese evading the Indonesian authorities who conducted the 1980 census . A variety of factors — the exodus of tens of thousands from their homes to escape <unk> in 1974 @-@ 5 ; the deaths of thousands in the civil war ; the deaths of combatants during the occupation ; killings by <unk> ; and natural disasters — diminish further still the civilian toll attributable to Indonesian forces during this time . Considering all this data , Cribb argues for a much lower toll of 100 @,@ 000 or less , with an absolute minimum of 60 @,@ 000 , and a mere tenth of the civilian population dying unnaturally , for the years 1975 – 80 . 
 Kiernan responded , however , by asserting that the influx of migrant workers during the occupation and the increase in the population growth rate typical of a mortality crisis justifies accepting the 1980 census as valid despite the 1987 estimate , and that the 1974 church census — though a " possible maximum " — cannot be discounted because the church 's lack of access to society might well have resulted in an undercount . He concluded that at least 116 @,@ 000 combatants and civilians were killed by all sides or died " unnatural " deaths from 1975 – 80 ( if true , this would yield the result that about 15 % of the civilian population of East Timor was killed from 1975 – 80 ) . F. <unk> separately estimated that 13 % ( 95 @,@ 000 out of an expected 730 @,@ 000 when accounting for the reduction in birth rates ) of the civilian population died during this period . Kiernan believes that the deficit was most probably around 145 @,@ 000 when accounting for the reduction in birth rates , or 20 % of East Timor 's population . The mid @-@ value of the UN report is 146 @,@ 000 deaths ; R.J. Rummel , an analyst of political killings , estimates 150 @,@ 000 . 
 Many observers have called the Indonesian military action in East Timor an example of genocide . In a study of the word 's legal meaning and applicability to the occupation of East Timor , legal scholar Ben Saul concludes that because no group recognised under international law was targeted by the Indonesian authorities , a charge of genocide cannot be applied . However , he also notes : " The conflict in East Timor most accurately qualifies as genocide against a ‘ political group ’ , or alternatively as ‘ cultural genocide ’ , yet neither of these concepts are explicitly recognised in international law . " The occupation has been compared to the killings of the Khmer Rouge , the Yugoslav wars , and the Rwandan Genocide . 
 Accurate numbers of Indonesian casualties are well @-@ documented . The complete names of around 2 @,@ 300 Indonesian soldiers and pro @-@ Indonesian militias who died in action as well as from illness and accidents during the entire occupation is engraved into the <unk> Monument located in Armed Forces Headquarters in <unk> , south of Jakarta . < http : / / <unk> / <unk> ? id = <unk> > 
 = = = Justice = = = 
 Saul goes on to discuss prosecutions of responsible parties for " crimes against humanity , war crimes , and other gross violations of human rights " . In the years after the end of the occupation , a number of proceedings have been carried out to such an end . The 1999 UN Security Council resolution authorising UNTAET described the history of " systematic , widespread and flagrant violations of international and human rights law " and demanded " that those responsible for such violence be brought to justice " . To achieve these ends , UNTAET established a Serious Crimes Unit ( SCU ) , which has attempted to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for such violence . However , the SCU has been criticised for accomplishing relatively little , presumably because it is funded inadequately , limited in mandate to crimes committed only in 1999 , and for other reasons . Indonesian trials purporting to punish those responsible for the violence were described as " manifestly inadequate " by a UN commission . 
 Deficiencies in these processes have led a number of organisations to call for an international tribunal to prosecute individuals responsible for killings in East Timor , similar to those established in Yugoslavia and Rwanda . A 2001 editorial by the East Timor NGO La 'o Hamutuk said : 
 An uncountable number of Crimes Against Humanity were committed during the 1975 – 1999 period in East Timor . Although an international court could not pursue all of them , it ... [ would ] confirm that the invasion , occupation and destruction of East Timor by Indonesia was a long @-@ standing , systematic , criminal conspiracy , planned and ordered at the highest levels of government . Many of the perpetrators continue to wield authority and influence in East Timor ’ s nearest neighbour . The future of peace , justice and democracy in both East Timor and Indonesia depends on holding the highest @-@ level perpetrators accountable . 
 In 2005 , the Indonesia @-@ Timor Leste Commission of Truth and Friendship was set up with the goal of establishing the truth relating to crimes under the occupation , and healing divisions between the countries . It has received criticism from NGOs and was rejected by the United Nations for offering impunity .

 = London Road Fire Station , Manchester = 
 London Road Fire Station is a former fire station in Manchester , England . It was opened in 1906 , on a site bounded by London Road , Whitworth Street , Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street . Designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by Woodhouse , Willoughby and Langham in red brick and terracotta , it cost £ 142 @,@ 000 to build . It has been a Grade II * listed building since 1974 . 
 In addition to a fire station , the building housed a police station , an ambulance station , a bank , a coroner 's court , and a gas @-@ meter testing station . The fire station operated for eighty years , housing the firemen , their families , and the horse @-@ drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles a few years after its opening . It was visited by royalty in 1942 , in recognition of the brigade 's wartime efforts . After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls . However , the fire station became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in . 
 The building was the headquarters of the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974 . The fire station closed in 1986 , since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals . It was placed on English Heritage 's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a compulsory purchase order on the fire station 's owner , Britannia Hotels . Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building opening up the possibility of redevelopment after nearly 30 years of dereliction . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In 1897 the Manchester Watch Committee was considering a replacement for its fire station on Jackson 's Row . A five @-@ man sub @-@ committee was set up and recommended a site on Newton Street . In 1899 , George William Parker who had designed fire stations in Bootle and Belfast , and been referred to as the " architect of the world 's fire service " was appointed Chief of the Manchester Fire Brigade and asked his opinion on the proposal . Parker reported that the site on Newton Street was unsuitable and submitted plans for a fire station on a site bounded by London Road , Whitworth Street , Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street . 
 Parker 's proposal was for a 7 @-@ bay fire station on a site more than double the size of the one proposed on Newton Street . The choice of London Road was influenced by its proximity to a development of warehouses on Whitworth Street and Princess Street . Parker convinced the city council to choose his proposals rather than those on Newton Street . 
 A competition , with prizes of £ 300 , £ 200 and £ 100 ( equivalent to £ 29 @,@ 000 , £ 19 @,@ 000 and £ 10 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) was organised to design the new fire station . The competition drew interest from across the country , attracting 25 entries . The winning entry was by John Henry Woodhouse , George Harry Willoughby and John Langham , a team of local architects . Their design was based closely on Parker 's initial plans . The fire station was described by Fire Call magazine as " the finest fire station in this round world " before construction started . 
 The fire station was built between 1904 and 1906 at a cost of £ 142 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 13 @.@ 8 million in 2016 ) . The building 's substructure and foundations were built by C. H. Normanton of Manchester . The superstructure was built by Gerrard 's of Swinton at a cost of £ 75 @,@ 360 . It was faced with red brick and terracotta by <unk> , a common choice for early 20th @-@ century buildings in Manchester as it was <unk> and resisted the pollution and acid rain caused by local industry . Other notable Manchester buildings from this era making use of terracotta include the Midland Hotel , the Refuge Assurance Building , the University 's The Sackville Street Building ( formerly known as UMIST main building ) and the Victoria Baths . The building 's exterior featured sculptural models by John Jarvis Millson representing the functions of the building such as justice , fire and water . 
 The building had stained glass windows and the interior was decorated with glazed bricks , similar to other public buildings of this era in the city , such as the Victoria Baths . The similarities suggest the influence and adoption of a standard design by Henry Price 's newly created City Architect 's Department . 
 = = Operation = = 
 The building was opened on 27 September 1906 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester James Herbert Thewlis . In addition to the fire station , the building housed a police station on Whitworth Street , an ambulance station on Minshull Street South , a branch of Williams Deacon 's Bank at the corner of London Road and Fairfield Street , < a coroner 's court , and a gas @-@ meter testing station on London Road . The coroner 's court and gas @-@ meter testing station replaced the proposed public library and gym . 
 The fire station contained flats for 32 firemen and their families and 6 single firemen . Facilities included a laundry , gym , billiards room and children 's play @-@ areas . The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances , and a blacksmith 's workshop . There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm , poles to expedite the firemen 's response , suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly , and electric doors . The fire station was also designed with foresight ; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances . The station 's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911 , five years after it opened . 
 The building featured a 130 @-@ foot ( 40 m ) hose tower and a ventilation system designed by Musgrave and Company to prevent the odour from the horses ' stalls entering the <unk> ' living quarters . Fresh air was drawn in through the top of the fire station 's tower , purified and circulated around the building . When the air reached the end of the circuit , in the stalls , it was extracted from the building . The system meant that the air in the building was replaced every 10 minutes . 
 During the Second World War the basement was converted into an air @-@ raid shelter and an extension built in the yard to provide more space in the control room . The fire services were nationalised in 1941 , and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters ' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942 . 
 After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade was again <unk> , and reorganised . London Road Fire Station was restored as the headquarters of the brigade and became the only fire station serving the city centre . A fire service training centre was established in 1948 . At about the same time , the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade 's workshops . The control room was modernised in 1952 , becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls . 
 The interior of the building was refurbished in 1955 . The exterior had been cleaned every year since the fire station opened , and as a result was still in pristine condition when the building celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956 . 
 = = Decline = = 
 By the end of the 1960s maintenance was becoming increasingly expensive , and the building 's design ill @-@ suited to modern fire appliances . Plans to replace the fire station were put on hold pending the formation of the Greater Manchester Fire Service . 
 The building has been Grade II * listed since 1974 , the same year that the replacement of the Manchester Fire Brigade by the Greater Manchester Fire Service precipitated the relocation of the brigade 's headquarters to a new facility in Swinton . As part of the reorganisation , London Road became the headquarters of the brigade 's " E Division " , with the station 's control room responsible for two divisions covering the City of Manchester , the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport and Tameside . 
 The reorganisation meant the number of appliances was reduced , until only three remained at the station . The control room at London Road closed in 1979 , replaced by a single computerised control room at brigade headquarters in Swinton . 
 In the same year , following the establishment of Greater Manchester Police and a reorganisation of policing in the city , the police station in the building also closed . The closure left the ground floor on the Whitworth Street side empty . The last tenants of the bank section , a firm of solicitors , and the fire brigade 's workshops , also vacated the building at about the same time . 
 In 1984 construction work began on a £ 2 @.@ 4 million , 4 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 8 ha ) replacement in Thompson Street and in 1985 the old London Road Fire Station was brought within the Whitworth Street Conservation Area . In 1986 the fire service left London Road for its new fire station , London Road Fire Station closed and the building was sold . 
 = = Dereliction and redevelopment = = 
 After the sale the building was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986 , 1993 , and 2001 , with varying degrees of success . The coroner 's court was the last to vacate the premises , in 1998 . In 2001 , the building was placed on English Heritage 's Buildings at Risk Register . By 2004 it was in steep decline , and momentum was building for the fire station 's owner , Britannia Hotels , to act . 
 In February 2006 , Argent , developers proposed leasing the building from Britannia Hotels to transform it into a music and arts venue . Manchester City Council backed the plans and refused to rule out a compulsory purchase order ( CPO ) if the owner did not act to redevelop the building . Britannia Hotels branded Argent 's plans " unworkable " and proposed turning the building into a company headquarters , 200 @-@ bed hotel , and fire station museum . A planning application was promised by March 2006 , but by May none had been made . Work was carried out by February 2007 to make the building watertight and in autumn 2007 a proposal was made by Britannia to convert the building into a hotel . 
 Britannia Hotels appointed Purcell Miller Tritton to draw up plans to convert the building into a hotel in 2008 but none were produced by May 2009 and the city council lost faith in Britannia Hotels ' commitment to its redevelopment . The city council was concerned that the state of the fire station was limiting regeneration in the area , including a proposed government complex on the former Mayfield Railway Station site . The city council set a deadline of July 2009 for progress on redevelopment . Britannia Hotels ' proposal in July 2009 was to convert the fire station into a hotel with a 15 @-@ storey tower in its courtyard and promised a planning application by October 2009 , but none was made and the city council 's Chief Executive recommended issuing a CPO . A meeting of the city council in January 2010 approved a request for up to £ 5 @.@ 25 million to cover the costs associated with the fire station 's acquisition . Britannia Hotels responded by pledging to make a new proposal by February 2010 , rendering the CPO unnecessary . 
 Britannia submitted an application to turn the fire station into a 227 @-@ bed 4 @-@ star hotel in June 2010 . The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion . Manchester City Council decided to continue with the CPO . The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010 . Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010 , the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011 . Britannia 's objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011 . On 29 November 2011 , the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected . Despite Britannia 's guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development it reconsidered its plans . In a letter to English Heritage , Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future . Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan . English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment . The city council offered to buy the building at market value . 
 In February 2013 after a public meeting the Friends of London Road Fire Station ( FoLRFS ) was formed to pressurise Britannia Hotels and persuade the council to attempt a second CPO . The group organised an online petition , fundraising events , public meetings , an online survey to discover locals ' views , an art exhibition and public engagement with its history , and published the outcome of a Freedom of Information Act request on what the council had done regarding surveying the building and issuing urgent @-@ works notices . In November 2013 , Britannia applied to extend the 2010 planning permissions but despite objections the applications were approved on technical grounds in December 2013 . The council considered applying for a CPO for the second time in September 2014 and confirmed its intention to do so in December 2014 and meet with FoLRFS in early 2015 . FoLRFS received a grant from Locality 's Community Assets in Difficult Ownership ( <unk> ) programme to pay for public outreach work . On 30 April 2015 , FoLRFS met Pat Bartoli , head of the council 's urban regeneration team and Howard Bernstein who praised their campaign . It was announced immediately after the meeting that Britannia Hotels had decided to sell the building . 
 London Road Fire Station was put on the market on 1 May 2015 and expected offers of around £ 10 million while restoration is expected to cost £ 20 – 30 million . Allied London acquired the <unk> on 16 November 2015 .
