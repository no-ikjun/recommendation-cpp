 = Mayer – Vietoris sequence = 
 In mathematics , particularly algebraic topology and homology theory , the Mayer – Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces , known as their homology and cohomology groups . The result is due to two Austrian mathematicians , Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris . The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces , for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute . The sequence relates the ( co ) homology groups of the space to the ( co ) homology groups of the subspaces . It is a natural long exact sequence , whose entries are the ( co ) homology groups of the whole space , the direct sum of the ( co ) homology groups of the subspaces , and the ( co ) homology groups of the intersection of the subspaces . 
 The Mayer – Vietoris sequence holds for a variety of cohomology and homology theories , including singular homology and singular cohomology . In general , the sequence holds for those theories satisfying the Eilenberg – Steenrod axioms , and it has variations for both reduced and relative ( co ) homology . Because the ( co ) homology of most spaces cannot be computed directly from their definitions , one uses tools such as the Mayer – Vietoris sequence in the hope of obtaining partial information . Many spaces encountered in topology are constructed by piecing together very simple patches . Carefully choosing the two covering subspaces so that , together with their intersection , they have simpler ( co ) homology than that of the whole space may allow a complete deduction of the ( co ) homology of the space . In that respect , the Mayer – Vietoris sequence is analogous to the Seifert – van Kampen theorem for the fundamental group , and a precise relation exists for homology of dimension one . 
 = = Background , motivation , and history = = 
 Like the fundamental group or the higher homotopy groups of a space , homology groups are important topological invariants . Although some ( co ) homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra , many other important ( co ) homology theories , especially singular ( co ) homology , are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces . For singular ( co ) homology , the singular ( co ) chains and ( co ) cycles groups are often too big to handle directly . More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary . The Mayer – Vietoris sequence is such an approach , giving partial information about the ( co ) homology groups of any space by relating it to the ( co ) homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection . 
 The most natural and convenient way to express the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences : sequences of objects ( in this case groups ) and morphisms ( in this case group homomorphisms ) between them such that the image of one morphism equals the kernel of the next . In general , this does not allow ( co ) homology groups of a space to be completely computed . However , because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds , simplicial complexes , or CW complexes , which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches , a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability . 
 Mayer was introduced to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna . He was told about the conjectured result and a way to its solution , and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929 . He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders . Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence . The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form . 
 = = Basic versions for singular homology = = 
 Let X be a topological space and A , B be two subspaces whose interiors cover X. ( The interiors of A and B need not be disjoint . ) The Mayer – Vietoris sequence in singular homology for the triad ( X , A , B ) is a long exact sequence relating the singular homology groups ( with coefficient group the integers Z ) of the spaces X , A , B , and the intersection A ∩ B. There is an unreduced and a reduced version . 
 = = = <unk> version = = = 
 For unreduced homology , the Mayer – Vietoris sequence states that the following sequence is exact : 
 <formula> 
 Here the maps i : A ∩ B ↪ A , j : A ∩ B ↪ B , k : A ↪ X , and l : B ↪ X are inclusion maps and <formula> denotes the direct sum of abelian groups . 
 = = = Boundary map = = = 
 The boundary maps ∂ * lowering the dimension may be made explicit as follows . An element in Hn ( X ) is the homology class of an n @-@ cycle x which , by barycentric subdivision for example , can be written as the sum of two n @-@ chains u and v whose images lie wholly in A and B , respectively . Thus ∂ x 
 = ∂ ( u + v ) = 
 0 so that ∂ u 
 = − ∂ v. This implies that the images of both these boundary ( n − 1 ) <unk> are contained in the intersection A ∩ B. Then ∂ * ( [ x ] ) is the class of ∂ u in Hn − 1 ( A ∩ B ) . Choosing another decomposition x = 
 u ′ + v ′ does not affect [ ∂ u ] , since ∂ u + ∂ v 
 = ∂ x = 
 ∂ u ′ + ∂ v ′ , which implies ∂ u − ∂ u ′ 
 = ∂ ( v ′ − v ) , and therefore ∂ u and ∂ u ′ lie in the same Homology class ; nor does choosing a different representative x ′ , since then ∂ x ′ = 
 ∂ x = 0 . Notice that the maps in the Mayer – Vietoris sequence depend on choosing an order for A and B. In particular , the boundary map changes sign if A and B are swapped . 
 = = = Reduced version = = = 
 For reduced homology there is also a Mayer – Vietoris sequence , under the assumption that A and B have non @-@ empty intersection . The sequence is identical for positive dimensions and ends as : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Analogy with the Seifert – van Kampen theorem = = = 
 There is an analogy between the Mayer – Vietoris sequence ( especially for homology groups of dimension 1 ) and the Seifert – van Kampen theorem . Whenever A ∩ B is path @-@ connected the reduced Mayer – Vietoris sequence yields the isomorphism 
 <formula> 
 where , by exactness , 
 <formula> 
 This is precisely the <unk> statement of the Seifert – van Kampen theorem . Compare with the fact that H1 ( X ) is the <unk> of the fundamental group π1 ( X ) when X is path @-@ connected . 
 = = Basic applications = = 
 = = = k @-@ sphere = = = 
 To completely compute the homology of the k @-@ sphere X = Sk , let A and B be two hemispheres of X with intersection homotopy equivalent to a ( k − 1 ) -dimensional equatorial sphere . Since the k @-@ dimensional hemispheres are <unk> to k @-@ discs , which are contractible , the homology groups for A and B are trivial . The Mayer – Vietoris sequence for reduced homology groups then yields 
 <formula> 
 <unk> immediately implies that the map ∂ * is an isomorphism . Using the reduced homology of the 0 @-@ sphere ( two points ) as a base case , it follows 
 <formula> 
 where δ is the Kronecker delta . Such a complete understanding of the homology groups for spheres is in stark contrast with current knowledge of homotopy groups of spheres , especially for the case n > k about which little is known . 
 = = = Klein bottle = = = 
 A slightly more difficult application of the Mayer – Vietoris sequence is the calculation of the homology groups of the Klein bottle X. One uses the decomposition of X as the union of two Möbius strips A and B glued along their boundary circle ( see illustration on the right ) . Then A , B and their intersection A ∩ B are homotopy equivalent to circles , so the nontrivial part of the sequence yields 
 <formula> 
 and the trivial part implies vanishing homology for dimensions greater than 2 . The central map α sends 1 to ( 2 , − 2 ) since the boundary circle of a Möbius band wraps twice around the core circle . In particular α is injective so homology of dimension 2 also vanishes . Finally , choosing ( 1 , 0 ) and ( 1 , − 1 ) as a basis for Z2 , it follows 
 <formula> 
 = = = Wedge sums = = = 
 Let X be the wedge sum of two spaces K and L , and suppose furthermore that the identified <unk> is a deformation retract of open neighborhoods U ⊂ K and V ⊂ L. Letting A 
 = K ∪ V and B = 
 U ∪ L it follows that A ∪ B 
 = X and A ∩ B = 
 U ∪ V , which is contractible by construction . The reduced version of the sequence then yields ( by exactness ) 
 <formula> 
 for all dimensions n . The illustration on the right shows X as the sum of two 2 @-@ spheres K and L. For this specific case , using the result from above for 2 @-@ spheres , one has 
 <formula> 
 = = = Suspensions = = = 
 If X is the suspension SY of a space Y , let A and B be the complements in X of the top and bottom ' vertices ' of the double cone , respectively . Then X is the union A ∪ B , with A and B contractible . Also , the intersection A ∩ B is homotopy equivalent to Y. Hence the Mayer – Vietoris sequence yields , for all n , 
 <formula> 
 The illustration on the right shows the 1 @-@ sphere X as the suspension of the 0 @-@ sphere Y. Noting in general that the k @-@ sphere is the suspension of the ( k − 1 ) <unk> , it is easy to derive the homology groups of the k @-@ sphere by induction , as above . 
 = = Further discussion = = 
 = = = Relative form = = = 
 A relative form of the Mayer – Vietoris sequence also exists . If Y ⊂ X and is the union of C ⊂ A and D ⊂ B , then the exact sequence is : 
 <formula> 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The homology groups are natural in the sense that if ƒ is a continuous map from X1 to X2 , then there is a canonical pushforward map ƒ ∗ of homology groups ƒ ∗ : Hk ( X1 ) → Hk ( X2 ) , such that the composition of <unk> is the pushforward of a composition : that is , <formula> . The Mayer – Vietoris sequence is also natural in the sense that if X1 
 = A1 ∪ B1 to X2 = 
 A2 ∪ B2 and the mapping ƒ satisfies ƒ ( A1 ) ⊂ A2 and ƒ ( B1 ) ⊂ B2 , then the connecting morphism ∂ ∗ of the Mayer – Vietoris sequence commutes with ƒ ∗ . That is , the following diagram commutes ( the horizontal maps are the usual ones ) : 
 <formula> 
 = = = <unk> versions = = = 
 The Mayer – Vietoris long exact sequence for singular cohomology groups with coefficient group G is dual to the homological version . It is the following : 
 <formula> 
 where the dimension preserving maps are restriction maps induced from inclusions , and the ( co- ) boundary maps are defined in a similar fashion to the homological version . There is also a relative formulation . 
 As an important special case when G is the group of real numbers R and the underlying topological space has the additional structure of a smooth manifold , the Mayer – Vietoris sequence for de <unk> cohomology is 
 <formula> 
 where { U , V } is an open cover of X , ρ denotes the restriction map , and Δ is the difference . The map d ∗ is defined similarly as the map ∂ ∗ from above . It can be briefly described as follows . For a cohomology class [ ω ] represented by closed form ω in U ∩ V , express ω as a difference of forms <unk> - <unk> via a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover { U , V } , for example . The exterior derivative <unk> and <unk> agree on U ∩ V and therefore together define an n + 1 form σ on X. One then has d ∗ ( [ ω ] ) = [ σ ] . 
 = = = Derivation = = = 
 Consider the long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequences of chain groups ( constituent groups of chain complexes ) 
 <formula> 
 where α ( x ) 
 = ( x , − x ) , β ( x , y ) = 
 x + y , and Cn ( A + B ) is the chain group consisting of sums of chains in A and chains in B. It is a fact that the singular n @-@ <unk> of X whose images are contained in either A or B generate all of the homology group Hn ( X ) . In other words , Hn ( A + B ) is isomorphic to Hn ( X ) . This gives the Mayer – Vietoris sequence for singular homology . 
 The same computation applied to the short exact sequences of vector spaces of differential forms 
 <formula> 
 yields the Mayer – Vietoris sequence for de <unk> cohomology . 
 From a formal point of view , the Mayer – Vietoris sequence can be derived from the Eilenberg – Steenrod axioms for homology theories using the long exact sequence in homology . 
 = = = Other homology theories = = = 
 The derivation of the Mayer – Vietoris sequence from the Eilenberg – Steenrod axioms does not require the dimension axiom , so in addition to existing in ordinary cohomology theories , it holds in extraordinary cohomology theories ( such as topological K @-@ theory and cobordism ) . 
 = = = Sheaf cohomology = = = 
 From the point of view of sheaf cohomology , the Mayer – Vietoris sequence is related to Čech cohomology . Specifically , it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology ( sometimes called the Mayer – Vietoris spectral sequence ) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets . This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi . 
 = U.S. Route 1 / 9 Truck = 
 U.S. Route 1 @-@ 9 Truck ( US 1 @-@ 9 Truck ) is a United States highway in the northern part of New Jersey that stretches 4 @.@ 11 mi ( 6 @.@ 61 km ) from the eastern edge of Newark to the Tonnele Circle in Jersey City . It is the alternate road for U.S. Route 1 @-@ 9 ( US 1 @-@ 9 ) that trucks must use because they are prohibited from using the Pulaski Skyway , which carries the main routes of US 1 @-@ 9 . It also serves traffic accessing the New Jersey Turnpike , Route 440 , and Route 7 . The route is a four- to six @-@ lane road its entire length , with portions of it being a divided highway , that runs through urban areas . From its south end to about halfway through Kearny , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck is freeway @-@ standard , with access to other roads controlled by interchanges . 
 While the US 1 @-@ 9 Truck designation was first used in 1953 , the roadway comprising the route was originally designated as an extension of pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 in 1922 , a route that in its full length stretched from Trenton to Jersey City . US 1 @-@ 9 was designated along the road in 1926 and one year later , in 1927 , this portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 was replaced with Route 25 as well as with a portion of Route 1 north of the Communipaw Avenue intersection . Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932 , US 1 @-@ 9 and Route 25 were realigned to the new skyway . After trucks were banned from the skyway in 1934 , the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T . In 1953 , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck was designated in favor of Route 25T and Route 1 along this segment of road . The portion of the truck route north of Route 7 is being rebuilt as part of a $ 271 @.@ 9 million project to construct new approach roads to connect Route 1 & <unk> , Route 7 , the Pulaski Skyway , Route 139 , and Route 1 & 9 north of Tonnele Circle and local streets in Jersey City . Construction , which started in late 2008 , is expected to be complete in late 2012 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 1 @-@ 9 Truck begins at an interchange with access to and from the southbound direction US 1 @-@ 9 , the Pulaski Skyway , in the Ironbound section of the city of Newark in Essex County . The truck route is meant to bypass the portion of US 1 @-@ 9 along the Pulaski Skyway , which trucks are restricted from . It merges onto Raymond Boulevard , which continues west from the US 1 @-@ 9 and US 1 @-@ 9 Truck interchange into downtown Newark . The truck restriction on Route 1 @-@ 9 is for the " safety and welfare of the public " according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation , not a specific bridge defect . At this point , the truck route becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway , heading to the east . A short distance later , the road comes to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike ( Interstate 95 ) and Doremus Avenue before crossing over the Passaic River on a vertical lift bridge . Here , the route enters Kearny in Hudson County and continues east into industrial areas as the Lincoln Highway . The road has a right @-@ in / right @-@ out in both directions that provides access to Jacobus Avenue before it comes to an interchange with County Route 659 . From here , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck becomes a six @-@ lane divided highway and comes to an at @-@ grade intersection with Hackensack Avenue . Past this intersection , the road crosses the Hackensack River on a vertical lift bridge and enters Jersey City . Upon entering Jersey City , the road becomes Communipaw Avenue and intersects the northern terminus of Route 440 near the Hudson Mall . 
 At this intersection , Communipaw Avenue continues to the east and US 1 @-@ 9 Truck turns to the north , becoming an unnamed four @-@ lane undivided <unk> bisecting Lincoln Park before coming to an intersection with County Route 605 . Here , the road becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway again , passing some urban business areas before running between wetlands to the west and Holy Name Cemetery to the east . The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences , coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway . Here , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck turns east on Broadway , running through a business district . A short distance later , it turns north onto an unnamed road with County Route 642 continuing east on Broadway . The route passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and PATH 's Newark – World Trade Center Line before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway . Immediately after , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and turns to the east , with County Route 645 continuing north at this intersection . The truck route becomes a four @-@ lane undivided road that runs to the north of the Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors , crossing over a railroad line and County Route 646 , known as St. Paul 's Avenue , on a viaduct . A short distance later , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US 1 @-@ 9 and Route 139 , where it ends . 
 The East Coast Greenway runs along the north side of the highway . 
 = = History = = 
 What is now U.S. 1 @-@ 9 Truck between Newark and Jersey City was originally the Newark Plank Road ; in 1913 this became the first segment of the Lincoln Highway . The current route of US 1 @-@ 9 Truck was designated to be an extension of pre @-@ 1927 Route 1 in 1922 , a route that was to run from Trenton to Jersey City . 
 When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926 , the current truck route became a part of the US 1 @-@ 9 concurrency . A year later , in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 25 was designated to run along the entire length of the route along with US 1 @-@ 9 as part of its journey from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City , while Route 1 was also designated along the portion north of Communipaw Avenue in Jersey City as a part of its routing from Bayonne to Rockleigh . 
 Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932 , US 1 @-@ 9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge . After trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934 , the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , US 1 @-@ 9 Truck was designated to replace all of Route 25T as well as the portion of Route 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle . 
 Beginning in late 2008 the New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the viaduct that carries the route over St. Paul 's Avenue , which was built in 1928 and determined structurally deficient . The $ 271 @.@ 9 million replacement was completed in September 2011 . In addition to replacing the St. Paul 's Avenue viaduct , the approaches to US 1 @-@ 9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved . 
 In anticipation of a general increase of activity in Port of New York and New Jersey and new development on West Side and Hackensack Riverfront studies are being conducted to make the intersection with Route 440 a multi @-@ level traffic circle and northern and southern ( Route 440 ) approaches to it into a multi @-@ use urban boulevard that includes grade separations and additional medians .

 = Sholes and Glidden typewriter = 
 The Sholes and Glidden typewriter ( also known as the Remington No. 1 ) was the first commercially successful typewriter . Principally designed by the American inventor Christopher Latham Sholes , it was developed with the assistance of fellow printer Samuel W. Soule and amateur mechanic Carlos S. Glidden . Work began in 1867 , but Soule left the enterprise shortly thereafter , replaced by James Densmore , who provided financial backing and the driving force behind the machine 's continued development . After several short @-@ lived attempts to manufacture the device , the machine was acquired by E. Remington and Sons in early 1873 . An arms manufacturer seeking to diversify , Remington further refined the typewriter before finally placing it on the market on July 1 , 1874 . 
 During its development , the typewriter evolved from a crude curiosity into a practical device , the basic form of which became the industry standard . The machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design , including a cylindrical platen and a four @-@ rowed QWERTY keyboard . Several design deficiencies remained , however . The Sholes and Glidden could print only upper @-@ case letters — an issue remedied in its successor , the Remington No. 2 — and was a " blind writer " , meaning the typist could not see what was being written as it was entered . 
 Initially , the typewriter received an unenthusiastic reception from the public . Lack of an established market , high cost , and the need for trained operators slowed its adoption . Additionally , recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical , all upper @-@ case writing to be impersonal and even insulting . The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century , however , had created a need for expedient , legible correspondence , and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures . The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace , as many were hired to operate the new devices .

 = = = Early development = = = 
 The Sholes and Glidden typewriter had its origin in a printing machine designed in 1866 by Christopher Latham Sholes to assist in printing page numbers in books , and serial numbers on tickets and other items . Sholes , a Wisconsin printer , formed a partnership with Samuel W. Soule , also a printer , and together they began development work in Charles F. <unk> 's machine shop , a converted mill in northern Milwaukee . Carlos S. Glidden , an inventor who frequented the machine shop , became interested in the device and suggested that it might be adapted to print alphabetical characters as well . In July 1867 , Glidden read an article in Scientific American describing " the <unk> " , a writing machine invented by John Pratt and recently featured in an issue of London Engineering . Glidden showed the article to Sholes , who thought the machine " complicated and liable to get out of order " , and was convinced that a better machine could be designed . To that point , several dozen patents for printing devices had been issued in the United States and abroad . None of the machines , however , had been successful or effective products . 
 In November 1866 , following their successful collaboration on the numbering machine , Sholes asked Soule to join him and Glidden in developing the new device . Mathias Schwalbach , a German clockmaker , was hired to assist with construction . To test the proposed machine 's feasibility , a key was taken from a telegraph machine and modified to print the letter " W " ; by September 1867 , a model with a full alphabet , numbers , and rudimentary punctuation had been completed , and it was used to compose letters to acquaintances in the hope of selling the invention , or procuring funds for its manufacture . One recipient , James Densmore , immediately bought a 25 % interest for $ 600 , the cost of the machine 's development to that date . Densmore saw the machine for the first time in March 1868 , and was unimpressed ; he thought it clumsy and impractical , and declared it " good for nothing except to show that its underlying principles were sound " . Among other deficiencies , the device held paper in a horizontal frame , which limited the thickness of the paper that could be used and made alignment difficult . A patent for the " Type @-@ Writer " was granted on June 23 , 1868 , and , despite the device 's flaws , Densmore rented a building in Chicago in which to begin its manufacture . Fifteen units were produced before a lack of funds forced the venture back to Milwaukee . 
 = = = Refinement = = = 
 During 1869 , an improved model was designed which , unlike the previous version , drew upon work done by other inventors . A machine patented in 1833 by Charles Thurber , for example , used a cylindrical platen . Sholes adapted the idea and implemented a rotating drum to which the paper was clipped , replacing the frame of the previous model . Soule and Glidden did not assist development of the new platen and , as their interest in the venture was waning , sold their rights to the original machine to Sholes and Densmore . Prototypes were sent to professionals in various fields , including James O. <unk> , a stenographer whose heavy use destroyed several machines . <unk> 's feedback , although " caustic " , led to the development of an additional 25 to 30 prototypes , each an improvement on its predecessor . In summer 1870 , Densmore traveled to New York to demonstrate the machine to Western Union , which was looking for a method to record telegrams . Western Union ordered several machines , but declined to purchase the rights , as it believed a superior device could be developed for less than Densmore 's asking price of $ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 To supply the orders and to repay debts , Densmore began to manufacture the machine in summer 1871 . During this time , the machine was revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union , which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll , indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical . The new design , however , infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870 ; Washburn , consequently , received royalties on future production . In 1872 , to manufacture the new machine in earnest , a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees . Although the machines worked well , the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit . In exchange for funding the ventures , Densmore had been acquiring an ever increasing ownership interest . Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $ 12 @,@ 000 . Glidden kept his one @-@ tenth right of the patent . Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost , a manufacturer with whom he had been acquainted , who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons . Remington , an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War , possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine . A typewritten letter was sent to Remington , where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device . 
 = = = Start of an industry = = = 
 Following a demonstration at Remington 's offices in New York , the company contracted on March 1 , 1873 , to manufacture 1 @,@ 000 machines , with the option to produce an additional 24 @,@ 000 . Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $ 10 @,@ 000 and royalty rights , a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed to serve as the exclusive sales agent . Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter , and spent several months retooling and re @-@ engineering the device ; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July 1 , 1874 . Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. <unk> , manager of Remington 's sewing machine division . The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes ' model , but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine , including a <unk> case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return . The typewriter , however , had been rushed into production with insufficient testing , and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair . 
 By December 1874 , only 400 typewriters had been sold , due in part to their high price and poor reliability . As businesses were slow to adopt the machine , authors , clergymen , lawyers and newspaper editors were the targeted customers . Individuals , however , generally did not write enough to justify the machine 's price of about $ 125 , the average annual income per person at the time . There were exceptions , however ; Mark Twain was among the first to purchase the machine , which he termed a " curiosity breeding little joker " . Although the machine was exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 , it was overshadowed by Alexander Graham Bell 's telephone . Several design and manufacturing improvements followed — including replacing the treadle with a hand lever — and 4 @,@ 000 machines had been sold by 1877 . In 1878 , Remington outsourced marketing to E. & T. Fairbanks & Company , a scale manufacturer , as marketing to that point had produced only lackluster sales . 
 An improved model , the Remington No. 2 , was also introduced in 1878 . The new machine was able to type upper and lowercase characters , thus remedying a significant drawback of its predecessor . As the only typewriter manufacturer , Remington maintained a monopoly position until the American Writing Machine Company introduced a typewriter to compete with the Remington machines in 1881 . In response to the new competition , Remington lowered the price of the Sholes and Glidden ( referred to in sales literature as the Remington No. 1 ) to $ 80 , and negotiated an agreement with the marketing firm Wyckoff , Seamans & Benedict to take all the machines produced . The arrangement marked the beginning of the typewriter 's commercial success , as the agency 's marketing prowess led to the sale of 1 @,@ 200 machines in its first year . By 1884 , more competitors had appeared , including the Hammond Typewriter Company , the Crandall Type @-@ Writer Company and the Hall Typewriter Company ; in the decade since the introduction of the Sholes and Glidden , a " thriving typewriter industry " had developed . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Sholes and Glidden typewriter incorporated several components adapted from existing devices , such as escapement ( a mechanism governing carriage movement ) adapted from clockwork , keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers adapted from the piano . In developing the first model , however , Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and , consequently , developed several poor designs which could have been avoided . The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed . Soule , for example , suggested a circular typebar orientation . A circular arrangement had been used more than 30 years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier <unk> in 1833 . 
 In the machine 's original 1868 design , paper was placed horizontally on the top of the machine , held in place by a movable square frame ( to provide line and letter spacing ) . Above the paper and centered on the device , an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate . <unk> a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper , pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character . This method of imprinting required use of very thin , nonstandard paper ( such as tissue paper ) . Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars : one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly " kicked " the typebars upwards . 
 The arm and frame components were replaced with a cylindrical platen in 1869 . Unlike modern typewriters , the revised machine entered letters around the cylinder , with axial rotation providing letter spacing and horizontal shifting providing line spacing . Paper was clipped directly to the cylinder , which limited its length and width to the dimensions of the apparatus . The platen was again redesigned in early 1872 to allow the use of paper of any length . The redesigned platen also introduced the modern spacing functionality ( horizontal and axial movement providing letter and line spacing , respectively ) . The cylindrical platen became " an indispensable part of every standard [ typewriter ] " . 
 By the end of 1872 , the appearance and function of the typewriter had assumed the form that would become standard in the industry and remain largely unchanged for the next century . Although the machine possessed a cylindrical platen and what was essentially a QWERTY keyboard , two design elements that would later become essential were lacking : the ability to write in upper and lowercase letters and " visible " print . Although the former was implemented in the Remington No. 2 , the machine was fundamentally an " <unk> " design , meaning the typebars struck upwards against the underside of the platen . As this occurred inside the machine , the operator could not see what was being entered as it was typed . Although competing brands , such as the Oliver and Underwood , began to market " visible " typewriters in the 1890s , a Remington @-@ branded model did not appear until the Remington No. 10 in 1906 . 
 = = = QWERTY keyboard = = = 
 The QWERTY keyboard , so named for the first six characters of the uppermost alphabetic row , was invented during the course of the typewriter 's development . The first model constructed by Sholes used a piano @-@ like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as follows : 
 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
 2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M 
 Schwalbach later replaced the piano @-@ like keys with " buttons " and positioned them into four banked rows . The mechanics of the machine , however , made the alphabetical arrangement problematic . The typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring , forming a " basket " . When a key was pressed , the corresponding typebar would swing upwards , causing the print head to strike at the center of the ring . Gravity would then return the typebar to its initial position . The implication of this design , however , was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam the machine . To mitigate this problem , keys were reordered using analysis of letter frequency and trial and error . Densmore asked his son @-@ in @-@ law , a Pennsylvania school superintendent , what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in the English language . <unk> corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs , such as S and T , were placed on opposite sides on the ring . The keyboard ultimately presented to Remington was arranged as follows : 
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - , 
 Q W E . T Y I U O P

 After it purchased the device , Remington made several adjustments — including switching the period and " R " keys — which created a keyboard with what is essentially the modern QWERTY layout . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The Sholes and Glidden was the first commercially successful typewriter . Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited . New communications technologies , such as the telegraph and telephone , facilitated geographic expansion and increased the speed with which business was conducted . The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly . Before the typewriter , clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand . The comprehension of these scripts , however , required either special training or close concentration . <unk> was used when legibility was important , but it was a slow and expensive process . The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues . 
 The public was initially skeptical of the typewriter , and reactions included apathy and antagonism . Outside of large companies , letters generally did not need to be composed quickly ; as the device was reliant upon its operator , it offered no automation . In business settings involving customer interaction , the unfamiliar machines were viewed with suspicion ( as there existed the perception that mechanical devices could be rigged by unscrupulous merchants ) and the presence of such a large object between the customer and employee " interrupted the ' personal touch ' " . Individuals receiving typewritten letters often found them insulting ( as type implied they could not read handwriting ) or impersonal , problems exacerbated by the all upper @-@ case writing . The typewriter also precipitated privacy concerns , as recipients of letters of a personal nature believed a third @-@ party operator or typesetter must have been involved in their composition . 
 = = = Women and the typewriter = = = 
 The association of women with the typewriter may be linked to the way in which it was marketed . Before the typewriter was acquired by Remington , Sholes ' daughter was employed to demonstrate the device and to appear in promotional images , which served as the basis for early advertisements . Remington 's sales agents later marketed the machine with tactics including the use of attractive women to demonstrate the device at trade shows and in hotel lobbies . Depictions of female operators suggested the device was " easy enough for a woman " and suited for domestic use . Although also designed to allow Remington to maintain manufacturing efficiencies with its sewing machine division , the typewriter 's aesthetics ( the sewing machine stand and floral ornamentation ) were further intended to facilitate its acceptance into the household . 
 A " major consequence " of the typewriter 's development was the entrance of women into the clerical work force . Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s , the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings . Before the Young Women 's Christian Association ( YWCA ) established the first typing school in 1881 , women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine . The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters , however , also created demand for additional clerical workers . The low wages accepted by women — often 50 % ( or less ) of those paid to a man — made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions . As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories , women were attracted in large numbers to office work . In 1874 , less than 4 % of clerical workers in the United States were women ; by 1900 , the number had increased to approximately 75 % . Before his death , Sholes remarked of the typewriter , " I do feel that I have done something for the women who have always had to work so hard . This will enable them more easily to earn a living .

 = Marrakesh = 
 Marrakesh ( also known by the French spelling Marrakech ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> , <unk> ; Berber : <unk> , <unk> ) is a major city of the Kingdom of Morocco . It is the fourth largest city in the country , after Casablanca , Fes and Tangier . It is the capital city of the mid @-@ southwestern region of Marrakesh @-@ Safi . Located to the north of the foothills of the snow @-@ capped Atlas Mountains , Marrakesh is located 580 km ( 360 mi ) southwest of Tangier , 327 km ( 203 mi ) southwest of the Moroccan capital of Rabat , 239 km ( 149 mi ) south of Casablanca , and 246 km ( 153 mi ) northeast of Agadir . 
 Marrakesh is possibly the most important of Morocco 's four former imperial cities ( cities that were built by Moroccan Berber empires ) . The region has been inhabited by Berber farmers since Neolithic times , but the actual city was founded in 1062 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar , chieftain and cousin of Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin . In the 12th century , the Almoravids built many madrasas ( Koranic schools ) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear Andalusian influences . The red walls of the city , built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122 – 1123 , and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period , have given the city the nickname of the " Red City " or " Ochre City " . Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural , religious , and trading centre for the Maghreb and sub @-@ Saharan Africa ; Jemaa el @-@ Fnaa is the busiest square in Africa . 
 After a period of decline , the city was surpassed by Fes , but in the early 16th century , Marrakesh again became the capital of the kingdom . The city regained its preeminence under wealthy Saadian sultans Abu Abdallah al @-@ Qaim and Ahmad al @-@ Mansur , who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the El Badi Palace ( 1578 ) and restored many ruined monuments . Beginning in the 17th century , the city became popular among Sufi pilgrims for Morocco 's seven patron saints , who are entombed here . In 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and T <unk> El Glaoui became Pasha of Marrakesh and held this position nearly throughout the duration of the protectorate until the role was dissolved upon independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956 . In 2009 , Marrakesh mayor Fatima Zahra Mansouri became the second woman to be elected mayor in Morocco . 
 Like many Moroccan cities , Marrakesh comprises an old fortified city packed with vendors and their stalls ( the medina ) , bordered by modern neighborhoods , the most prominent of which is <unk> . Today it is one of the busiest cities in Africa and serves as a major economic centre and tourist destination . Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch , Mohammed VI , with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020 . Despite the economic recession , real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh has grown dramatically in the 21st century . Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French , and numerous French celebrities own property in the city . Marrakesh has the largest traditional market ( souk ) in Morocco , with some 18 souks selling wares ranging from traditional Berber carpets to modern consumer electronics . Crafts employ a significant percentage of the population , who primarily sell their products to tourists . 
 Marrakesh is served by <unk> International Airport and the Marrakesh railway station , which connects the city to Casablanca and northern Morocco . Marrakesh has several universities and schools , including Cadi Ayyad University . A number of Moroccan football clubs are located here , including Najm de Marrakech , KAC Marrakech , <unk> de Marrakech and Chez Ali Club de Marrakech . The Marrakesh Street Circuit hosts the World Touring Car Championship , Auto GP and FIA Formula Two Championship races . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The exact meaning of the name is debated . The probable origin of the name Marrakesh is from the Berber ( Amazigh ) words <unk> ( n ) <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , which means " Land of God " . According to historian Susan <unk> , however , the town 's name was first documented in an 11th @-@ century manuscript in the <unk> library in Fez , where its meaning was given as " country of the sons of Kush " . The word mur is used now in Berber mostly in the feminine form <unk> . The same word " mur " appears in Mauretania , the North African kingdom from antiquity , although the link remains controversial as this name possibly originates from <unk> <unk> , the ancient Greek word for black . The common English spelling is " Marrakesh " , although " Marrakech " ( the French spelling ) is also widely used . The name is spelled <unk> in the Berber Latin alphabet , <unk> in Spanish , and " Mer @-@ <unk> " in Moroccan Arabic . 
 From medieval times until around the beginning of the 20th century , the entire country of Morocco was known as the " Kingdom of Marrakesh " , as the kingdom 's historic capital city was often Marrakesh . The name for Morocco is still " Marrakesh " to this day in Persian and Urdu ( <unk> ) as well as many other South Asian languages . Various European names for Morocco ( <unk> , <unk> , Maroc , <unk> , etc . ) are directly derived from the Berber word <unk> . Conversely , the city itself was in earlier times simply called <unk> City ( or similar ) by travelers from abroad . The name of the city and the country diverged after the Treaty of Fez made Morocco a French and Spanish protectorate , but the old interchangeable usage lasted widely until about the interregnum of Mohammed Ben <unk> ( 1953 – 1955 ) . The latter episode set in motion the country 's return to independence , when Morocco officially became al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) ( " The Maghreb Kingdom " ) , its name no longer referring to the city of Marrakesh . Marrakesh is known by a variety of nicknames , including the " Red City " , the " Ochre City " and " the Daughter of the Desert " , and has been the focus of poetic analogies such as one comparing the city to " a drum that beats an African identity into the complex soul of Morocco . " 
 = = History = = 
 The Marrakesh area was inhabited by Berber farmers from Neolithic times , and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area . Marrakesh was founded in 1062 ( 454 in the Hijri calendar ) by Abu Bakr ibn Umar , chieftain and second cousin of the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin ( c . 1061 – 1106 ) . Under the Almoravids , pious and learned warriors from the desert , numerous mosques and madrasas ( Koranic schools ) were built , developing the community into a trading center for the Maghreb and sub @-@ Saharan Africa . Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious center , supplanting Aghmat , which had long been the capital of <unk> . Andalusian craftsmen from Cordoba and Seville built and decorated numerous palaces in the city , developing the Umayyad style characterized by carved domes and cusped arches . This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the Sahara and West Africa , creating a unique style of architecture which was fully adapted to the Marrakesh environment . Yusuf ibn Tashfin completed the city 's first mosque ( the Ben Youssef mosque , named after his son ) , built houses , minted coins , and brought gold and silver to the city in caravans . The city became the capital of the Almoravid Emirate , stretching from the shores of Senegal to the center of Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers . 
 Marrakesh is one of the great citadels of the Muslim world . The city was fortified by Tashfin 's son , Ali ibn Yusuf , who in 1122 – 1123 built the ramparts which remain to this day , completed further mosques and palaces , and developed an underground water system in the city known as the <unk> to irrigate his new garden . In 1125 , the preacher Ibn <unk> settled in Tin Mal in the mountains to the south of Marrakesh . He preached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby Aghmat , but stopped short of bringing down Marrakesh following an unsuccessful siege in 1130 . The Almohads , <unk> tribesmen from the High Atlas mountains who practiced orthodox Islam , took the city in 1147 under leader Abd al @-@ Mu 'min . After a long siege and the killing of some 7 @,@ 000 people , the last of the Almoravids were exterminated apart from those who sought exile in the Balearic Islands . As a result , almost all the city 's monuments were destroyed . The Almohads constructed a range of palaces and religious buildings , including the famous Koutoubia Mosque ( 1184 – 1199 ) , and built upon the ruins of an Almoravid palace . It was a twin of the Giralda in Seville and the unfinished Hassan Tower in Rabat , all built by the same designer . The Kasbah housed the residence of the caliph , a title borne by the Almohad rulers from the reign of Abd al @-@ Mu 'min , rivaling the far eastern Abbasid Caliphate . The Kasbah was named after the caliph Yaqub al @-@ Mansur . The irrigation system was perfected to provide water for new palm groves and parks , including the Menara Garden . As a result of its cultural reputation , Marrakesh attracted many writers and artists , especially from Andalusia , including the famous philosopher Averroes of Cordoba . 
 The death of Yusuf II in 1224 began a period of instability . Marrakesh became the stronghold of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and the ahl ad @-@ dar ( descendants of Ibn <unk> ) , who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family . Marrakesh was taken , lost and retaken by force multiple times by a stream of caliphs and pretenders , such as during the brutal seizure of Marrakesh by the <unk> caliph Abd al @-@ Wahid II al @-@ Ma 'mun in 1226 , which was followed by a massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciation of Ibn <unk> 's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the Kasbah mosque . After al @-@ Ma 'mun 's death in 1232 , his widow attempted to forcibly install her son , acquiring the support of the Almohad army chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand Marrakesh over to them for the sack . Hearing of the terms , the people of Marrakesh sought to make an agreement with the military captains and saved the city from destruction with a sizable payoff of 500 @,@ 000 dinars . In 1269 , Marrakesh was conquered by nomadic <unk> tribes who overran the last of the Almohads . The city then fell into a state of decline , which soon led to the loss of its status as capital to rival city Fes . 
 In the early 16th century , Marrakesh again became the capital of the kingdom , after a period when it was the seat of the <unk> emirs . It quickly reestablished its status , especially during the reigns of the Saadian sultans Abu Abdallah al @-@ Qaim and Ahmad al @-@ Mansur . Thanks to the wealth amassed by the Sultans , Marrakesh was embellished with sumptuous palaces while its ruined monuments were restored . El Badi Palace , built by Ahmad al @-@ Mansur in 1578 , was a replica of the Alhambra Palace , made with costly and rare materials including marble from Italy , gold dust from Sudan , porphyry from India and jade from China . The palace was intended primarily for hosting lavish receptions for ambassadors from Spain , England and the Ottoman Empire , showcasing Saadian Morocco as a nation whose power and influence reached as far as the borders of Niger and Mali . Under the Saadian dynasty , Marrakesh regained its former position as a point of contact for caravan routes from the Maghreb , the Mediterranean and sub @-@ Saharan African . 
 For centuries Marrakesh has been known as the location of the tombs of Morocco 's seven patron saints ( <unk> <unk> ) . When <unk> was at the height of its popularity during the late 17th century reign of Moulay Ismail , the festival of these saints was founded by Abu Ali al @-@ Hassan al @-@ <unk> at the request of the sultan . The tombs of several renowned figures were moved to Marrakesh to attract pilgrims , and the pilgrimage associated with the seven saints is now a firmly established institution . Pilgrims visit the tombs of the saints in a specific order , as follows : Sidi Yusuf Ali <unk> ( 1196 – 97 ) , a leper ; Kadi Iyad or Kadi of <unk> ( 1083 – 1149 ) , a theologian and author of Ash @-@ Shifa ( treatises on the virtues of Muhammad ) ; Sidi Bel Abbas ( 1130 – 1204 ) , known as the patron saint of the city and most revered in the region ; Sidi Muhammad al @-@ <unk> ( 1465 ) , a well known Sufi who founded the <unk> brotherhood ; Abdelaziz al @-@ <unk> ( 1508 ) , a student of <unk> ; Abdallah al @-@ <unk> ( 1528 ) , known as <unk> ; and Sidi Abu al @-@ Qasim Al @-@ <unk> , ( 1185 ) , also known as Imam Al <unk> . Until 1867 , European Christians were not authorized to enter the city unless they acquired special permission from the sultan ; east European Jews were permitted . 
 During the early 20th century , Marrakesh underwent several years of unrest . After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vizier Ba Ahmed , who had been designated regent until the designated sultan Abd al @-@ Aziz became of age , the country was plagued by anarchy , tribal revolts , the plotting of feudal lords , and European intrigues . In 1907 , Marrakesh caliph Moulay Abd al @-@ <unk> was proclaimed sultan by the powerful tribes of the High Atlas and by Ulama scholars who denied the legitimacy of his brother , Abd al @-@ Aziz . It was also in 1907 that Dr. <unk> , a French doctor , was murdered in Marrakesh , suspected of spying for his country . France used the event as a pretext for sending its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of <unk> to the major metropolitan center of Casablanca in the west . The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from Ahmed al @-@ Hiba , a son of Sheikh Ma al- ' <unk> , who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic <unk> tribal warriors . On 30 March 1912 , the French Protectorate in Morocco was established . After the Battle of Sidi Bou Othman , which saw the victory of the French Mangin column over the al @-@ Hiba forces in September 1912 , the French seized Marrakesh . The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the <unk> tribes and their leaders from the powerful Glaoui family , leading to a massacre of Marrakesh citizens in the resulting turmoil . 
 T <unk> El Glaoui , known as " Lord of the Atlas " , became Pasha of Marrakesh , a post he held virtually throughout the 44 @-@ year duration of the Protectorate ( 1912 – 1956 ) . Glaoui dominated the city and became famous for his collaboration with the general residence authorities , culminating in a plot to dethrone Mohammed Ben Youssef ( Mohammed V ) and replace him with the Sultan 's cousin , Ben <unk> . Glaoui , already known for his amorous adventures and lavish lifestyle , became a symbol of Morocco 's colonial order . He could not , however , subdue the rise of nationalist sentiment , nor the hostility of a growing proportion of the inhabitants . Nor could he resist pressure from France , who agreed to terminate its Moroccan Protectorate in 1956 due to the launch of the Algerian War ( 1954 – 1962 ) immediately following the end of the war in Indochina ( 1946 – 1954 ) , in which Moroccans had been conscripted to fight in Vietnam on behalf of the French Army . After two successive exiles to Corsica and Madagascar , Mohammed Ben Youssef was allowed to return to Morocco in November 1955 , bringing an end to the despotic rule of Glaoui over Marrakesh and the surrounding region . A protocol giving independence to Morocco was then signed on 2 March 1956 between French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau and M ’ <unk> Ben <unk> . 
 Since the independence of Morocco , Marrakesh has thrived as a tourist destination . In the 1960s and early 1970s the city became a trendy " hippie mecca " . It attracted numerous western rock stars and musicians , artists , film directors and actors , models , and fashion divas , leading tourism revenues to double in Morocco between 1965 and 1970 . Yves Saint Laurent , The Beatles , The Rolling Stones and Jean @-@ Paul Getty all spent significant time in the city ; Laurent bought a property here and renovated the Majorelle Gardens . <unk> , especially those from France , have invested heavily in Marrakesh since the 1960s , and developed many of the <unk> and palaces . Old buildings were renovated in the Old Medina , new residences and commuter villages were built in the suburbs , and new hotels began to spring up . 
 United Nations agencies became active in Marrakesh beginning in the 1970s , and the city 's international political presence has subsequently grown . In 1985 , UNESCO declared the old town area of Marrakesh a UNESCO World Heritage Site , raising international awareness of the cultural heritage of the city . In the 1980s , Patrick Guerand @-@ Hermes purchased the 30 acres ( 12 ha ) Ain el <unk> , built by the family of Leo Tolstoy . On 15 April 1994 , the Marrakesh Agreement was signed here to establish the World Trade Organization , and in March 1997 Marrakesh served as the site of the World Water Council 's first World Water Forum , which was attended by over 500 international participants . 
 In the 21st century , property and real estate development in the city has boomed , with a dramatic increase in new hotels and shopping centres , fuelled by the policies of Mohammed VI of Morocco , who aims to increase the number of tourists annually visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020 . In 2010 , a major gas explosion occurred in the city . On 28 April 2011 , a bomb attack took place in the Jemaa el @-@ Fnaa square , killing 15 people , mainly foreigners . The blast destroyed the nearby <unk> Cafe . Police sources arrested three suspects and claimed the chief suspect was loyal to Al @-@ Qaeda , although Al @-@ Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb denied involvement .

 By road , Marrakesh is located 580 kilometres ( 360 mi ) southwest of Tangier , 327 kilometres ( 203 mi ) southwest of the Moroccan capital of Rabat , 239 kilometres ( 149 mi ) southwest of Casablanca , 196 kilometres ( 122 mi ) southwest of Beni <unk> , 177 kilometres ( 110 mi ) east of Essaouira , and 246 kilometres ( 153 mi ) northeast of Agadir . The city has expanded north from the old centre with suburbs such as <unk> , <unk> El <unk> , <unk> , Sidi Abbad , <unk> , and <unk> , to the southeast with Sidi Youssef Ben Ali , to the west with <unk> , and southwest to Hay <unk> , <unk> and beyond the airport . On the <unk> road leading south out of the city are large villages such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , leading eventually through desert to the town of <unk> at the edge of the High Atlas , the highest mountainous barrier in North Africa . The average elevation of the snow @-@ covered High Atlas lies above 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . It is mainly composed of Jurassic limestone . The mountain range runs along the Atlantic coast , then rises to the east of Agadir and extends northeast into Algeria before disappearing into Tunisia . 
 The Ourika River valley is located about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) south of Marrakesh . The " silvery valley of the Ourika river curving north towards Marrakesh " , and the " red heights of Jebel <unk> still capped with snow " to the south are sights in this area . David Prescott Barrows , who describes Marrakesh as Morocco 's " strangest city " , describes the landscape in the following terms : " The city lies some fifteen or twenty miles from the foot of the Atlas mountains , which here rise to their grandest proportions . The spectacle of the mountains is superb . Through the clear desert air the eye can follow the rugged contours of the range for great distances to the north and eastward . The winter snows mantle them with white , and the turquoise sky gives a setting for their grey rocks and gleaming caps that is of unrivaled beauty . " 
 With 130 @,@ 000 hectares of greenery and over 180 @,@ 000 palm trees in its Palmeraie , Marrakesh is an oasis of rich plant variety . Throughout the seasons , fragrant orange , fig , pomegranate and olive trees display their color and fruits in <unk> Garden , Menara Garden and other gardens in the city . The city 's gardens feature numerous native plants alongside other species that have been imported over the course of the centuries , including giant bamboos , yuccas , papyrus , palm trees , banana trees , cypress , <unk> , rose bushes , <unk> , pines and various kinds of cactus plants .

 A hot semi @-@ arid climate ( Köppen : BSh ) predominates at Marrakesh . Average temperatures range from 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) in the winter to 32 – 45 ° C ( 90 – 113 ° F ) in the summer . The relatively wet winter and dry summer precipitation pattern of Marrakesh mirrors precipitation patterns found in Mediterranean climates . However , the city receives less rain than is typically found in a Mediterranean climate , resulting in a semi @-@ arid climate classification . Between 1961 and 1990 the city averaged 281 @.@ 3 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) of precipitation annually . Barrows says of the climate , " The region of Marrakesh is frequently described as desert in character , but , to one familiar with the southwestern parts of the United States , the locality does not suggest the desert , but rather an area of seasonal rainfall , where moisture moves underground rather than by surface streams , and where low brush takes the place of the forests of more heavily watered regions . The location of Marrakesh on the north side of the Atlas , rather than the south , forbids its from being described as a desert city , but it remains the northern focus of the Saharan lines of communication , and its history , its types of dwellers , and its commerce and arts , are all related to the great south Atlas spaces that reach further into the Sahara desert .

 Marrakesh is a vital component to the economy and culture of Morocco . Improvements to the highways from Marrakesh to Casablanca , Agadir and the local airport have led to a dramatic increase in tourism in the city , which now attracts over two million tourists annually . Because of the importance of tourism to Morocco 's weak economy as a whole , King Mohammed VI has vowed to attract 20 million tourists a year to Morocco by 2020 , doubling the number of tourists from 2012 . The city is popular with the French , and many French celebrities have bought property in the city , including fashion moguls Yves St Laurent and Jean @-@ Paul Gaultier . In the 1990s very few foreigners lived in the city , but real estate developments have dramatically increased in the last 15 years ; by 2005 over 3 @,@ 000 foreigners had purchased properties in the city , lured by its culture and the relatively cheap house prices . It has been cited in French weekly magazine Le Point as the second St Tropez : " No longer simply a destination for a scattering of adventurous elites , bohemians or backpackers seeking Arabian Nights fantasies , Marrakech is becoming a desirable stopover for the European jet set . " However , despite the tourism boom , the majority of the city 's inhabitants are still poor , and as of 2010 , some 20 @,@ 000 households still have no access to water or electricity . Many enterprises in the city are facing colossal debt problems . 
 Despite the global economic crisis that began in 2007 , investments in real estate progressed substantially in 2011 both in the area of tourist accommodation and social housing . The main developments have been in facilities for tourists including hotels and leisure centres such as golf courses and health spas , with investments of 10 @.@ 9 billion dirham ( US $ 1 @.@ 28 billion ) in 2011 . The hotel infrastructure in recent years has experienced rapid growth . In 2012 , alone , 19 new hotels were scheduled to open , a development boom often compared to Dubai . Royal Ranches Marrakech , one of Gulf Finance House 's flagship projects in Morocco , is a 380 hectares ( 940 acres ) resort under development in the suburbs and one of the world 's first five star Equestrian Resorts . The resort is expected to make a significant contribution to the local and national economy , creating many jobs and attracting thousands of visitors annually ; as of April 2012 it was about 45 % complete . The Avenue Mohammed VI , formerly Avenue de France , is a major city thoroughfare . It has seen rapid development of residential complexes and many luxury hotels . Avenue Mohammed VI contains what is claimed to be Africa 's largest nightclub : Pacha Marrakech , a trendy club that plays house and electro house music . It also has two large cinema complexes , Le Colisée à <unk> and Cinéma Rif , and a new shopping precinct , Al Mazar . 
 Trade and crafts are extremely important to the local tourism @-@ fueled economy . There are 18 souks in Marrakesh , employing over 40 @,@ 000 people in pottery , copperware , leather and other crafts . The souks contain a massive range of items from plastic sandals to Palestinian @-@ style scarves imported from India or China . Local boutiques are adept at making western @-@ style clothes using Moroccan materials .

 The Jemaa el @-@ Fnaa is one of the best @-@ known squares in Africa and is the centre of city activity and trade . It has been described as a " world @-@ famous square " , " a metaphorical urban icon , a bridge between the past and the present , the place where ( <unk> ) Moroccan tradition encounters modernity . " It has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985 . The name roughly means " the assembly of trespassers " or malefactors . Jemaa el @-@ Fnaa was renovated along with much of the Marrakech city , whose walls were extended by Abu Yaqub Yusuf and particularly by Yaqub al @-@ Mansur in 1147 – 1158 . The surrounding mosque , palace , hospital , parade ground and gardens around the edges of the marketplace were also overhauled , and the Kasbah was fortified . Subsequently with the fluctuating fortunes of the city , Jemaa el @-@ Fnaa saw periods of decline and renewal . Historically this square was used for public decapitations by rulers who sought to maintain their power by frightening the public . The square attracted dwellers from the surrounding desert and mountains to trade here , and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history . The square attracted tradesmen , snake charmers ( " wild , dark , frenzied men with long disheveled hair falling over their naked shoulders " ) , dancing boys of the <unk> Atlas tribe , and musicians playing pipes , tambourines and African drums . Richard Hamilton said that Jemaa el @-@ Fnaa once " reeked of Berber particularism , of backward @-@ looking , ill @-@ educated countrymen , rather than the reformist , pan @-@ Arab internationalism and command economy that were the imagined future . " Today the square attracts people from a diversity of social and ethnic backgrounds and tourists from all around the world . Snake charmers , acrobats , magicians , mystics , musicians , monkey trainers , herb sellers , story @-@ tellers , dentists , pickpockets , and entertainers in medieval garb still populate the square .

 Marrakesh has the largest traditional Berber market in Morocco and the image of the city is closely associated with its souks . Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city : " A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways , this fundamental section of the old city is a micro @-@ medina in itself , comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from <unk> kiosks no bigger than an elf 's wardrobe to scruffy store @-@ fronts that morph into glittering Aladdin 's Caves once you 're inside . " Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather , carpets , metalwork and pottery . These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap . Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs , traditional Muslim attire , leather bags , and lanterns . <unk> is still a very important part of trade in the souks .

 Marrakesh has long been an important centre for healthcare in Morocco , and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city . The psychiatric hospital installed by the <unk> Caliph Ya 'qub al @-@ Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian ' Abd al @-@ <unk> al- <unk> as one of the greatest in the world at the time . A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital , and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville , Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain . 
 A severe strain has been placed upon the healthcare facilities of the city in the last decade as the city population has grown dramatically . Ibn <unk> University Hospital is one of the major hospitals of the city . In February 2001 , the Moroccan government signed a loan agreement worth eight million U.S. dollars with The OPEC Fund for International Development to help improve medical services in and around Marrakesh , which led to expansions of the Ibn <unk> and Ibn <unk> hospitals . Seven new buildings were constructed , with a total floor area of 43 @,@ 000 square metres ( 460 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . New radiotherapy and medical equipment was provided and 29 @,@ 000 square metres ( 310 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of existing hospital space was rehabilitated . 
 In 2009 , king Mohammed VI inaugurated a regional psychiatric hospital in Marrakesh , built by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity , costing 22 million dirhams ( approximately 2 @.@ 7 million U.S. dollars ) . The hospital has 194 beds , covering an area of 3 hectares ( 7 @.@ 4 acres ) . Mohammed VI has also announced plans for the construction of a 450 million dirham military hospital in Marrakesh .

 = Inocybe cookei = 
 Inocybe cookei , commonly known as the straw fibrecap , is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family . It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola , and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke . The species can be found in Europe , Asia and North America . It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour , with a prominent umbo , fibres on the cap and a distinctive bulb at the base of the stem . It grows from soil in mixed woodland , and is encountered in summer and autumn , though is not common . Ecologically , it feeds through use of ectomycorrhiza . Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and non @-@ toxic , but either way , is not advised for consumption . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Inocybe cookei was first described by Giacomo Bresadola in 1892 ; the specific epithet cookei honours the British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke . Mycologists J. Stangl and J. <unk> described Inocybe <unk> in 1979 , which was later described as a variety of Inocybe cookei ( Inocybe cookei var. <unk> ) by Thom Kuyper in 1986 , but MycoBank now lists both names as synonyms of I. cookei . The mushroom is commonly known as the straw fibrecap . 
 Within Inocybe , it is placed within the subgenus <unk> , and was previously categorised within the section Rimosae . However , phylogenetic analysis has shown that section Rimosae as formerly defined does not form a monophyletic group ( that is , descended from a single exclusive ancestor ) , and former Rimosae species are better grouped into two clades , Maculata and Rimosae . Phylogenetic analysis has placed the species in the clade Maculata . Other species joining I. cookei in the Maculata clade include I. maculata , I. <unk> , I. rhodiola , I. <unk> , and I. erubescens . 
 = = Description = = 
 Inocybe cookei has a conical or bell @-@ shaped cap of between 2 and 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 and 1 @.@ 97 in ) in diameter . As the mushrooms age , the cap becomes flatter , and an umbo becomes prominent . The margin of the cap frequently cracks towards the centre . The cap is an ochre colour , and the upper surface is covered in long fibres . The silky fibres thickly cover the cap , starting and the centre and extending to the cap 's margin . The species has a whitish or ochre stem of 30 to 60 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) in height by 4 to 8 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 to 0 @.@ 31 in ) in thickness . There is a distinctive marginate bulb at the base of the stem , and no ring . The flesh is white , becoming yellow with age . Inocybe cookei mushrooms have closely packed adnexed gills ( gills that are attached to the stem only on part of their depth ) . Gills on young mushrooms are whitish , then become a grey @-@ tinged pale ochre before becoming cinnamon yellow .

 The species can be differentiated from the similar I. praetervisa by its spores ; the latter " has irregular , lumpy spores " . Inocybe <unk> , the split fibrecap , is also similar in appearance ; the rarer I. cookei can be differentiated by the smell of honey and the marginate bulb . The colouration , as well as the thick stem with a bulb , are features shared by two other species of Inocybe ; I. mixtilis and I. <unk> . Another fragrant Inocybe is I. <unk> , which has an odor resembling cinnamon , or ripe pears in mature specimens ; unlike I. cookei , it lacks a bulb at the base of its stem , and bruises a reddish colour when handled or with age . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Inocybe cookei is an occasional to frequent mushroom , found growing in mixed woodland on the ground . It is ectomycorrhizal , and grows from summer to late autumn , solitarily or in " trooping groups " . It has been recorded in Europe , Russia , China , Mexico , and the United States . 
 = = Toxicity and edibility = = 
 Inocybe cookei has been described as both poisonous ( due to the presence of muscarine compounds ) and non @-@ toxic . Consumption of mushrooms containing muscarine compounds could lead to a number of physiological effects , including : excess salivation , lacrimation , uncontrolled urination or defecation , gastrointestinal problems and emesis ( vomiting ) ; this array of symptoms may also be known by the acronym SLUDGE . Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure , sweating and death due to respiratory failure . The flesh of the mushroom has a mild taste and a slight smell of honey . Regardless of its actual toxicity or edibility , it is considered " best avoided " . 
 = Assaf dynasty = 
 The Assaf dynasty ( also called Banu Assaf ) were a Sunni Muslim and ethnic Turkmen dynasty of chieftains based in the Keserwan region of Mount Lebanon . They came to the aforementioned area in 1306 after being assigned by the Bahri Mamluks to guard the coastal region between Beirut and Jbeil and to check the power of the mostly Shia Muslim population at the time . During this period , they established their headquarters in Ghazir , which served as the Assafs ' base throughout their rule . 
 Under the leadership of Emir Assaf , they were confirmed as the rulers of Keserwan by Sultan Selim I following the Ottoman conquest in 1516 . Emir Assaf died two years later and was succeeded by his son Hasan , who was in turn killed by his brother Qa 'itbay . The latter ruled Keserwan until his death without progeny in 1523 , after which he was succeeded by Hasan 's son Mansur . Mansur had a long reign and was accorded by the Ottomans numerous districts in Mount Lebanon and its environs as tax farms . He eliminated many of his Sunni rivals , and his local power relied on a Maronite support base and his Maronite agents , namely members of the Hubaysh clan , who served as a check on the Shia Muslim sheikhs of Keserwan . At the peak of his power , Mansur 's realm stretched from Beirut to Homs . 
 Mansur was dismissed in 1579 and replaced by his son Muhammad , who was imprisoned by the authorities in 1584 for alleged involvement in a looting raid against an Istanbul @-@ bound caravan . He was restored to Keserwan in 1585 and was given tax collection authority over the rural districts of Tripoli Eyalet ; this brought him into conflict with the Sayfa clan , the Assafs ' erstwhile Turkmen clients , one of whose members , Yusuf Pasha Sayfa , was governor of Tripoli . The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in Akkar . Afterward , Yusuf Pasha Sayfa married Muhammad 's widow and inherited the Assaf realm . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Mamluk era = = = 
 The Assafs were Sunni Muslims and ethnic Turkmens . In 1306 , the Mamluks installed the Assaf tribe as the lords of Keserwan after defeating the Shia Muslims who politically dominated Keserwan and were the majority population in the area . The Assafs @-@ based themselves in the <unk> village of Ghazir , which became the tribe 's headquarters . The Assaf were entrusted by the Mamluks of maintaining a 300 @-@ strong cavalry unit to patrol the region between Beirut and Jbeil and to guard entry into the Keserwan from Beirut . Historian Kamal Salibi asserts that Turkmen tribesmen were settled in Keserwan after the Mamluk conquest in 1305 , but does not specify that it was the Assaf tribe that became lords of the region . Under Assaf or Turkmen lordship , Shia influence in Keserwan dwindled ; they remained the majority in the region due to continual immigration from the Beqaa Valley , but were forced out of the coastal areas of Keserwan and their population declined . In addition , the Alawite population in the region largely disappeared under Assaf lordship . 
 In 1382 , the Mamluk emir Barquq usurped the throne in Cairo , establishing the Burji regime . The latter were ethnic Circassians unlike their Turkmen Bahri predecessors , which resulted in frayed relations between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the new rulers . The tensions between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the Burji authorities contrasted with the Turkmens ' principal rivals in Mount Lebanon , the Druze Buhturids , who embraced Sultan Barquq . When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389 , the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in Damascus , while the Turkmen tribesmen assaulted the Druze <unk> tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills . In those engagements and the executions that followed , the Turkmens killed seven of the eight <unk> Abi al @-@ Jaysh Arslan emirs , Druze allies of the Buhturids . 
 Barquq was restored to power in 1390 , after which the Turkmen tribesmen raided the hills around Beirut once more , although they were unable to capture the villages of <unk> and <unk> . Under Barquq 's direction , the Mamluks mobilized their army troops , Druze warriors , and tribesmen from the Beqaa Valley and dealt a heavy blow against the Turkmens of Keserwan . Nonetheless , Barquq decided to keep the Turkmen emirs as the lords of Keserwan , albeit in a weakened state . Barquq likely kept the Turkmens in place to avoid giving the Buhturids too much power in Mount Lebanon or to avoid over @-@ extending <unk> forces . According to Salibi , only four Turkmen emirs have been named in primary sources : a certain Sa 'id who ruled in 1361 , his brother and successor Isa , and a certain Ali ibn al @-@ A 'ma and his brother Umar ibn al @-@ A 'ma . The latter two were the Turkmen emirs involved in the rebellion against Barquq . Ali was killed in Barquq 's punitive expedition , while Umar was imprisoned and released .

 According to historian Muhammad Adnan Bakhit , reliable information about the Assafs in the early 16th century is relatively scarce . A certain Emir Assaf from among the Turkmen tribesmen of Keserwan was appointed by Ottoman sultan Selim I as governor of the Keserwan nahiya ( subdistrict ; pl. nawahi ) of the Safad Sanjak ( Beirut Sanjak ) after the Ottomans took control of the Levant from the Mamluks in 1516 . Sultan Selim I assigned the Assafs as his chief agents in the region between Beirut and Tripoli , confirming their control of Keserwan , and awarding them tax farms in the nawahi of Jbeil and Beirut . While Emir Assaf had lived in Aintoura in the winter and elsewhere along the Nahr al @-@ Kalb ridge prior to the Ottoman conquest , in 1517 , he moved his headquarters to Ghazir . The move to the latter village in Keserwan 's interior and away from the Turkmen @-@ dominated coastal area likely contributed to a steady deterioration of ties between the Assafs and their fellow Turkmens . At the same time , it brought the Assafs closer to the Maronites who lived in the interior areas of Keserwan . <unk> to the Assafs ' relocation to Ghazir , Hubaysh ibn Musa moved to the village from <unk> . The Assaf and Hubaysh clans thereafter developed strong ties , with members of the latter serving as agents of the Assafs and becoming their chief intermediaries with the local Maronites . 
 In Tripoli , the Assafs had their own chief agent , Muhammad Agha Shu 'ayb , who was their subordinate tax collector for the countryside of Tripoli , including the Akkar plains . Meanwhile , the Buhturids were stripped of power in 1518 when their leader was imprisoned by the authorities for failure to submit allegiance to Selim I. Thus , the Ottomans restored the Assafs to their former prominence in Mount Lebanon . In the historical account of the 17th @-@ century Maronite patriarch and historian , <unk> al @-@ Duwayhi , Emir Assaf died in 1518 , and was succeeded by his son Hasan . Hasan and his brother Husayn had previously served as managers of their father 's affairs . 
 = = = = Reign of Qa 'itbay = = = = 
 Assaf 's other son from a different wife , Qa 'itbay , sought to usurp power from his brothers . In the ensuing power struggle , Qa 'itbay was forced to flee and received refuge in Choueifat , before relocating to Beirut ; there , he accrued funds to bribe the governor of Damascus , <unk> al @-@ Ghazali , to replace Hasan as the tax farmer of Keserwan . Hasan and Husayn sought to reconcile with their half @-@ brother , but as they entered Beirut , they were killed in an ambush ordered by Qa 'itbay . In his subsequent assertion of control over Keserwan , Jbeil and Beirut , Qa 'itbay was backed by <unk> al @-@ Ghazali , the ex @-@ Mamluk Ottoman governor of Damascus Eyalet . Despite al @-@ Ghazali 's revolt against the Ottomans and its subsequent suppression in 1521 , the authorities did not punish Qa 'itbay for his alliance with al @-@ Ghazali . However , the death of al @-@ Ghazali represented the loss of a major political patron of the emir . 
 After al @-@ Ghazali 's downfall , the Hubaysh clan , who had since been forced out by Qa 'itbay and settled in Lassa , sought to oust Qa 'itbay . They kidnapped Hasan 's son Mansur , who Qa 'itbay had spared from execution due to Qa 'itbay 's lack of male progeny , and organized a revolt against Qa 'itbay in Mansur 's name . The revolt quickly spread through Qa 'itbay 's territories , but after marshaling financial resources to mobilize military support from the Bedouin Ibn al @-@ <unk> tribe of the Beqaa Valley , he managed to drive his opponents back to Lassa . Qa 'itbay died without a male heir in 1523 , and was succeeded by Hasan 's son Mansur , who Qa 'itbay had spared from execution due to Qa 'itbay 's lack of male progeny . 
 = = = = Reign of Mansur = = = = 
 In Ottoman administrative records , a certain Emir Musa Bey is noted as the local authority in Keserwan between Qa 'itbay 's death in 1523 and 1548 , not Mansur . However , nothing else is written about Emir Musa , prompting Bakhit to suggest that by dint of Musa 's title , " emir " , that Musa was a member of the Assaf clan who led the dynasty as a virtual regent during the years of Mansur 's years as a minor . In Duwayhi 's account , only Mansur is mentioned as leader . 
 Mansur was regularly assigned the tax farms of the nawahi of Keserwan , Jbeil , Batroun , <unk> , Kura and <unk> . Mansur installed members of the Hubaysh clan as his chief agents in Keserwan , particularly investing sheikhs Yusuf and Sulayman Hubaysh as his stewards . Mansur also became the patron of the Turkmen Sayfa clan , who entered the region as Ottoman <unk> ( auxiliary troops ) in 1528 . He installed the Sayfas as his subordinate tax farmers in Akkar , provoking opposition from Muhammad Shu 'ayb , who was killed by Mansur later that year . Mansur subsequently had Shu 'ayb replaced with Yusuf Sayfa as his chief agent in Tripoli . Mansur proceeded to eliminate his Muslim rivals between then and 1541 . Among those killed were the Kurdish Ottoman official in charge of Batroun , a couple of Shia sheikhs from Keserwan , a rival Turkmen clan in Keserwan and the sheikhs of the Bedouin Ibn al @-@ <unk> tribe ; the latter were executed at a reception held by Mansur in Ghazir . 
 Mansur encouraged Maronite settlement in Keserwan , who he viewed as less of a threat to his rule than his Sunni rivals and as a counterweight to the Shia Muslim clans of Keserwan ; the Maronites were the majority population in the nawahi that Mansur tax farmed . In the 1540s , he lowered taxes and reduced property prices in Keserwan , attracting Maronite settlement in that nahiya . With the likely influence of the Hubaysh , who sought to oust the Shia from Keserwan , Maronite families from Jbeil village of <unk> , namely the Khazens , <unk> and <unk> , settled in the <unk> villages of <unk> , <unk> and Ghazir 's ridge , respectively , in 1545 . With Yusuf Hubaysh as his chief deputy , Mansur managed to control a virtual principality between Beirut to Homs , and built palatial residences for himself in Ghazir , Beirut and Jbeil . Historian William Harris asserts that Mansur 's principality was the " precursor of the Druze lordship of Fakhr ad @-@ Din Ma 'n " . 
 Although Mansur timely delivered taxes to the authorities , the Ottomans became wary of his power in Mount Lebanon and importing of arms from Venice . In 1579 , Sultan Murad III established the Tripoli Eyalet , which was centered in Tripoli and included all of the nawahi north of Keserwan that were ostensibly under Assaf lordship . The authorities assigned Mansur 's client Yusuf Sayfa as Tripoli 's governor , making him independent of Mansur . Yusuf Pasha Sayfa 's elevation also gave him tax rights over the Mansur 's former and predominantly Maronite nawahi . 
 = = = = Reign of Muhammad = = = = 
 Complaints lodged to the authorities against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579 . He was replaced with his son Muhammad . Mansur died in 1580 . According to Duwayhi , Muhammad was alleged by the authorities to have participated in the looting of an Istanbul @-@ bound caravan from Egypt while it was passing through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in Istanbul . However , Ottoman sources mention that the caravan arrived safely in Istanbul and that the commander of the caravan , Ibrahim Pasha , backed by a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army , arrested Muhammad and <unk> Ma 'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to Istanbul . About a year later , Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet 's rural districts , not including Tripoli itself , which remained under Yusuf Sayfa . The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad 's rule , but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue . 
 Muhammad 's taxation was considered exploitative by Tripoli Eyalet 's inhabitants . Yusuf Sayfa refused to pay taxes to Muhammad , prompting the latter to attempt collecting them through military means . However , while en route to the Akkar to pressure the Sayfas , Muhammad was shot dead outside of Tripoli on Yusuf Sayfa 's orders in 1591 . Muhammad 's death with no male heirs marked the end of Assaf rule . Following his death , Yusuf Sayfa was transferred control of the Assafs ' nawahi in Tripoli Eyalet , and he expelled the Hubaysh clan , promoting his Shia Muslim <unk> allies from Jbeil at their expense . In 1593 , Yusuf Sayfa wed Muhammad 's widow and thus acquired the Assafs ' wealth . He concurrently took control over Keserwan and Assaf properties in Beirut .

 Love , Inc. is an American television sitcom , created by Andrew Secunda , which originally aired on United Paramount Network ( UPN ) from September 22 , 2005 to May 11 , 2006 , lasting one season . With an ensemble cast led by Busy Philipps , Vince Vieluf , Reagan Gomez @-@ Preston , Ion Overman , and Holly Robinson Peete , the show revolves around five matchmakers working in a dating agency . The series was produced by Chase TV , the Littlefield Company , Burg / Koules Television , and Paramount Television , and distributed by UPN in its original run and later by LivingTV and Nelonen in the United Kingdom and Sweden respectively . The executive producers were Adam Chase , Warren <unk> , Mark Burg , and Oren Koules . 
 Originally developed under the working title <unk> , Love , Inc. was intended to be a vehicle for Shannen Doherty . It would have marked her first role in a sitcom . Though picked up by UPN , Doherty was removed from the project at the request of the network due to her poor reception by preview audiences ; Doherty was replaced by Philipps . It was set in New York , but the filming took place at Paramount Studios in Hollywood , Los Angeles and California . UPN heavily promoted the show to attract an " urban " audience , and to that end , paired it with Everybody Hates Chris and included contemporary hip hop music . 
 The series suffered low viewership despite its high ratings among young Hispanic women ; it was cancelled following UPN 's merger with the WB to launch the CW in 2006 . The cancellation of the series , along with that of other black sitcoms , was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and roles for African American actors on television . Critical response to Love , Inc. was mixed : some critics praised its multiethnic cast , while other cited the storylines and characters as unoriginal and Philipps ' portrayal of her character as unsympathetic . It was never made available on Blu @-@ ray or DVD .

 Set in New York City , the dating agency Love , Inc. features a staff of single friends desperately looking for love . Newly divorced Clea Lavoy , the creator and owner of the company , seeks out the help of her friend and employee Denise Johnson to reignite her romantic life . She continually struggles to find love despite Denise 's best attempts . The future of the agency is put into jeopardy considering that its success and advertising relied on Clea 's " successful " , nearly decade @-@ long marriage . Love , Inc. also includes the receptionist Viviana , the style expert Francine , and the technician and photographer Barry . 
 Episodes typically depict the inner workings of the agency , such as their first experience with a lesbian client , a consultation with a former priest , and marketing strategies to appeal to geeks and <unk> . Hired as wingmen for their clients , the employees act as " guardian angels for the conversationally challenged " . Each of the five characters have various comedic and romantic adventures outside the agency , like Viviana 's search for an eligible United States citizen to marry in order to secure a green card and Denise 's inability to find true love despite her talent in matching her clients with their " seemingly unattainable soulmates " .

 The series features five main characters throughout its run : 
 Busy Philipps as Denise Johnson , a dating consultant and self @-@ described expert at matchmaking , who provides her clients with " come @-@ on lines to use and avoid ; wardrobe and grooming hints , and conversation starters and stoppers " . Despite being characterized as " the Kung Fu master at setting up freaks , " she struggles with finding her own true love . After being contacted by her ex @-@ boyfriend to find the perfect match , she becomes cynical about dating and love , saying " I ’ ve been Wing <unk> my butt off " . Philipps described the character 's love life as a " complete disaster " . 
 Vince Vieluf as Barry , Denise 's roommate and co @-@ worker who serves as the agency 's technician and photographer . Described as an " idiot savant " , he is characterized as a conspiracy theorist who experiences paranoia about everything from dentists to toothpaste companies . He frequently communicates through " head @-@ scratching non sequiturs " , leading to the characters perceiving him as " operat [ ing ] on a whole other level ... and sometimes on a whole other planet " . Vieluf said the character was pitched as " the only guy on the show " and " the luckiest guy in the world " . 
 Reagan Gomez @-@ Preston as Francine , the agency style expert who encourages her clients to use and trust their fashion as a way to find a partner . She is introduced as criticizing Clea 's outfit as belonging to a coach for a women 's basketball team and is characterized as the hip worker at the agency . Francine 's storylines were not fully developed and " remain [ ed ] a bit of a mystery " by the end of the show . According to Vieluf , Francine communicates through a " whole different language " and has a special bond with Barry due to their different approaches to life . 
 Ion Overman as Viviana , an Argentinian receptionist who " solicits personal information in a rather startling way " . She is constantly searching for an eligible American citizen to marry in order to secure a green card . Her heavy accent is written as a source of humor on the show , which led to critics accusing the writers of reducing the character to an ethnic stereotype . 
 Holly Robinson Peete as Clea Lavoy , the founder and owner of the Love , Inc. dating agency . Clea is " thrust into the dating world " following the end of her nearly decade @-@ long marriage , in which her husband has an affair with a younger woman . 
 = = Production = = 
 Love , Inc. was developed under the working title Wing Woman and promoted as a " new ' Hitch ' -esque comedy " . The show 's concept was based on an article from The New York Times that discussed dating services . Production was handled by Chase TV , the Littlefield Company , Burg / Koules Television , and Paramount Television . The Littlefield Company suggested that the show 's creator Andrew Secunda collaborate with executive producer Adam Chase , who had previously worked on Friends . The series was Secunda 's first experience creating a television sitcom . Marta Kauffman , Liz <unk> , and Mark Burg and Oren Koules also contributed to the series as executive producers . On April 12 , 2005 , UPN announced that Doherty was in talks for the lead role while Reagan Gomez @-@ Preston was being considered for the role of the lead character 's " longtime friend , co @-@ worker and roommate " and Ion Overman for an unspecified part . Overman said she was attracted to part since she was searching for a job and viewed the series as a " very cool concept " . On April 18 , Holly Robinson Peete was confirmed to have joined the cast as the boss to Doherty 's character . 
 The series was originally designed as a star vehicle for Doherty , who portrayed Denise Johnson in the unaired pilot . Denise was Doherty 's first role in a television sitcom . Doherty said she immediately loved the script for the pilot , which she described as " hysterical , " but felt intimidated by the role given her inexperience with comedy . The series was initially marketed as featuring Doherty and Peete , before United Paramount Network ( UPN ) announced it would pick it up on the condition Doherty was removed and the character was recast . According to TV Guide , Doherty was poorly received by preview audiences . When queried by an interviewer about the removal of Doherty from the show , executive producer Warren Littlefield said the actress was " fabulous " in the role . According to Littlefield , Doherty actively wanted to change her negative reputation from leaving Beverly Hills , 90210 and Charmed through acting on the show . Peete praised Doherty 's performance on the show , saying " we had so much fun and such a great vibe " . UPN Entertainment president cited the rationale behind Doherty 's departure through the " standard going @-@ in @-@ a @-@ different @-@ direction reason " . Rachel Cericola of TV Fodder listed Love , Inc. as one the " four promising sitcoms for the upcoming TV season " due to the behind the scenes drama involving Doherty 's replacement . 
 UPN announced that Busy Philipps was cast as Denise on July 25 , and later billed as the show 's star . According to Vince Vieluf , the casting change from Doherty to Philipps led to the series being retooled as an ensemble show featuring all the members of the agency rather than focusing on Denise . Vieluf said the alterations in the series ' premise were due to concerns that " people would get tired of a show that was only about the mishaps of one person ’ s love life " . Page Kennedy reported that he was considered for a part on the show , but rejected it for the role of Caleb Applewhite on the second season of the ABC drama Desperate Housewives . Retired Los Angeles Lakers player Rick Fox guest starred in three episodes as David , one of Clea 's love interests . The casting of racially diverse actors was identified with UPN 's position as " the only network to actively program for an African American audience " . Tim Good of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed to the show 's casting as the only way in which it acts as a " positive reference " . Even though the show was set in New York City , filming took place in the Bluhdorn Building at Paramount Studios in Hollywood , Los Angeles , California , and used the multiple @-@ camera format . Transitions between scenes feature images of New York City set to contemporary music , such as The Black Eyed Peas ' single " Don 't Phunk with My Heart " and Kelis ' single " Milkshake " . Todd R. Ramlow of PopMatters described the music as a further attempt to appeal to " an ' urban , ' black @-@ white audience , " and praised the musical choices as a " nice try at crossover for a network whose shows usually target a black demographic " .

 On August 6 , 2005 , UPN officially ordered the series for thirteen episodes . The network later ordered a full season of twenty @-@ two episodes of the show on November 7 , 2005 amid speculation that it would be cancelled . In 2006 , LivingTV broadcast the series in the United Kingdom , and it was broadcast by Nelonen in Sweden in 2008 . UPN paired the series with Everybody Hates Chris , Eve , and Cuts in order to attract an " urban " audience . The network moved WWE SmackDown to Fridays in favor of scheduling Thursdays as focused on sitcoms . This decision was made to establish a " night of scripted programming " and draw more attention from film studios to purchase advertising space for their upcoming releases . Critics questioned the network 's belief that Love , Inc. and Everybody Hates Chris would appeal to the same viewership , and noted the difference in quality between the two , with Love , Inc. frequently cited as the inferior show . While the series initially retained 59 % of the audience from Everybody Hates Chris , the marketing strategy proved unsuccessful when it lost a majority of the viewership in later episodes . 
 Cericola reported that Love , Inc. earned an average of 3 @.@ 6 million viewers per episode and an article in The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series garnered an average of 1 @.@ 0 / 3 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . It ranked 141st among broadcast television networks in the 2005 @-@ 2006 television season . According to the Nielsen Company , the show achieved high ratings among " Latina adolescents Ages 12 @-@ 17 " and earned 3 @.@ 4 million viewers in that demographic for 2005 . It ranked above two other UPN sitcoms : One on One and Half & Half for Latin women in the 12 @-@ 17 age demographic , and in " the top half of all UPN series " for total viewership . The series premiere saw a 6 % increase in the 18 – 49 age range , 53 % in women between 18 and 34 , and 118 % in women between 18 and 49 from the show that aired in the same time period during the last television season . 
 The show , as well as a majority of UPN 's programs , were officially cancelled due to the network 's merger with the WB Television Network ( the WB ) to form the CW in 2006 . Fern Gillespie of The Crisis was critical of UPN 's decision to cancel the series given how the network " in one swoop , wiped out five of its eight African American comedies " for the creation of the CW . Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks by saying : " Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills , it will potentially have a generational impact . " Critic Tim Goodman identified Love , Inc. as one of six shows " geared for an African American audience " and featuring " an African American lead actress " that were cancelled during the merger . He equated these cancellations as a sign of networks " eliminat [ ing ] niche programming " . The series was never made available on Blu @-@ ray or DVD .

 Love , Inc. received mixed critical feedback . Ebony 's Zondra Hughes praised the show as one of the shows " the networks promise will keep you spellbound " and identified Peete and Overman as its primary " star appeal " . While reviewing its broadcast on LivingTV , a reviewer from Daily Record listed the show as its " pick of the day " and suggested it for viewers who would " fancy a giggle " .

 The Futon Critic 's Brian Ford Sullivan praised Vieluf as the standout despite his limited role , but felt the execution of the matchmaking premise was inferior to that done in the 2005 film Hitch . Variety 's Laura Fries wrote that the series had " a quirky vibe , personable cast and snappy writing , " but likened it to the " proverbial old maid " by determining that the storylines and characters required more original material . Jon Bonné and Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of Today commended the series for its multiethnic cast , but wrote that it " struggles to salvage some <unk> bad jokes " . Bonné and Cooper called the show one of the network 's " most vulnerable properties " following the reports of UPN 's closure . 
 Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 28 out of 100 based on 17 reviews , indicating " generally unfavorable reviews " . Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times criticized the writing for being " <unk> and sometimes labored " and relying too much on sitcom conventions . Paul Brownfield of the Los Angeles Times criticized the series for being " unintentionally unfunny " , comparing it to the fictional sitcom " Rom and Bored " featured in the HBO comedy @-@ drama The Comeback . The Sun @-@ Sentinel 's Tom Jicha wrote that Love , Inc. was a " lethal combination of a stupid show and a suicidal time slot " . The Chicago Tribune 's Maureen Ryan called the series a " grating comedy " that is " destined to be a footnote in history as the show that premiered after ' Everybody Hates Chris , ' and most likely faded shortly thereafter " .

 Critics negatively responded to the character of Denise and Philipps ' performance , and cited both as annoying and unsympathetic . Heffernan described Denise as having a " smug fix @-@ it type " personality similar to Cher Horowitz from the 1995 film Clueless without the charm or charisma . USA Today 's Robert Bianco gave the series a half of a point out of four and called it on the " worst and laziest " comedies of 2005 .

Orlando Sentinel 's Hal Boedeker felt that Phillip 's character was an " overbearing know @-@ it @-@ all " . Matthew <unk> of The Boston Globe called the show a " one @-@ joke affair " and wrote the premise behind Denise had the " same irony that failed to make Alicia Silverstone 's Miss Match very interesting " .

 = Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu – Tanambogo = 
 The Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu – Tanambogo was a land battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II , between the forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied ( mainly United States ( U.S. ) Marine ) ground forces . It took place from 7 – 9 August 1942 on the Solomon Islands , during the initial Allied landings in the Guadalcanal campaign . 
 In the battle , U.S. Marines , under the overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift , successfully landed and captured the islands of Tulagi , Gavutu , and Tanambogo among which the Japanese Navy had constructed a naval and seaplane base . The landings were fiercely resisted by the Japanese Navy troops who , outnumbered and outgunned by the Allied forces , fought and died almost to the last man . 
 At the same time that the landings on Tulagi and Gavutu – Tanambogo were taking place , Allied troops were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal , with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces . In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu , the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed . The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined @-@ arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 7 December 1941 , the Japanese attacked the U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , initiating a state of war between the two nations . The attack crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet . The initial goals of Japanese leaders in the war were to neutralize the U.S. fleet , seize possessions rich in natural resources , and establish strategic military bases to defend Japan 's empire in Asia and the Pacific . In support of these goals , Japanese forces attacked and took control of the Philippines , Thailand , Malaya , Singapore , the Dutch East Indies , Wake Island , Gilbert Islands , New Britain , and Guam . 
 Two attempts by the Japanese to extend their defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of Coral Sea ( May 1942 ) and Midway ( June 1942 ) . These two strategic victories for the Allies provided them with an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific . The Allies chose the Solomon Islands , specifically the southern Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida as the location for their first offensive . 
 As part of an operation that resulted in the Coral Sea battle , the Japanese Navy sent troops to occupy Tulagi and nearby islands in the southern Solomons . These troops — mainly members of the 3d Kure Special Naval Landing Force — occupied Tulagi on 3 May 1942 , and constructed a seaplane , ship refueling , and communications base on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Gavutu , Tanambogo and Florida , all of which were soon operational . Aware of the Japanese efforts on Tulagi , the Allies ' concern increased in early July 1942 when the Japanese Navy began constructing a large airfield near Lunga Point on nearby Guadalcanal . By August 1942 , the Japanese had about 900 troops on Tulagi and nearby islands , and 2 @,@ 800 personnel ( many of whom were Korean and Japanese construction specialists and laborers ) on Guadalcanal . The airfield — when complete — would protect Japan 's major base at Rabaul , threaten Allied supply and communication lines , and establish a staging area for possible future offensives against Fiji , New Caledonia , and Samoa ( Operation FS ) . 
 The Allied plan to attack the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral Ernest King , Commander in Chief , United States Fleet . He proposed the offensive to deny the use of the southern Solomon Islands by the Japanese as bases to threaten the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia , and to use them as starting points for a campaign with the objective of capturing or neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign , with the eventual goal of opening the way for the U.S. to retake the Philippines . U.S Admiral Chester Nimitz — Allied commander @-@ in @-@ chief for Pacific forces — created the South Pacific theater — with U.S. Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley in command — to direct the Allied offensive in the Solomons . 
 In preparation for the offensive , in May 1942 , U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the U.S. to New Zealand . Other Allied land , naval , and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji , Samoa , and New Caledonia . Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides was selected as the headquarters and main base for the impending offensive — codenamed Operation Watchtower — with the commencement date set for 7 August 1942 . At first , the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands , omitting Guadalcanal . However , after Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal , capture of that airfield was added to the plan and the Santa Cruz operation was dropped . 
 The Allied Watchtower expeditionary force of 75 warships and transports , which included vessels from both the U.S. and Australia , assembled near Fiji on 26 July , and engaged in one rehearsal landing prior to leaving for Guadalcanal on July 31 . Vandegrift was the overall commander of the 16 @,@ 000 Allied ( primarily U.S. Marine ) ground forces involved in the landings and personally commanded the assault on Guadalcanal . In command of the 3 @,@ 000 U.S. Marines set to land on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Florida , Gavutu , and Tanambogo was U.S. Brigadier General William H. Rupertus on the transport ship USS Neville . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Bad weather allowed the Allied expeditionary force to arrive in the vicinity of Guadalcanal unseen by the Japanese on the morning of 7 August . The Japanese detected the radio traffic from the incoming Allied invasion force and prepared to send scout aircraft aloft at daybreak . The landing force ships split into two groups , with one group assigned for the assault on Guadalcanal and the other tasked with the assault on Tulagi , Florida , and Gavutu – Tanambogo . Aircraft from the aircraft carrier USS Wasp dive @-@ bombed Japanese installations on Tulagi , Gavutu , Tanambogo , and Florida and strafed and destroyed 15 Japanese seaplanes floating in the anchorages near the islands . Several of the seaplanes were warming their engines in preparation for takeoff and were lost with their aircrews and many of their support personnel . 
 The cruiser USS San Juan and destroyers USS Monssen ( DD @-@ 436 ) and Buchanan bombarded planned landing sites on Tulagi and Florida Island . To cover the assaults on Tulagi , Gavutu , and Tanambogo , U.S. Marines from the 1st Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment made an unopposed landing on Florida Island at 07 : 40 . They were guided to their objective by several Australians , such as Lieutenant Frank <unk> ( later Captain , British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force ) , who were familiar with the Tulagi @-@ Florida area from having previously lived and worked in the area .

 = = = Tulagi = = = 
 At 08 : 00 on August 7 , 1942 , two battalions of U.S. Marines , including the 1st Raider Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson ( Edson 's Raiders ) , and the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marines ( 2 / 5 ) made an unopposed landing on the western shore of Tulagi about halfway between the two ends of the oblong @-@ shaped island . Beds of coral near the shore kept the landing craft from reaching the shoreline . The Marines , however , were able to wade the remaining 100 m ( 110 yd ) without hindrance from the Japanese forces , who were apparently taken by surprise by the landings and had yet to begin any organized resistance . At this time , the Japanese forces on Tulagi and Gavutu , a detachment of the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force ( SNLF ) plus members of the Yokohama Air Group — commanded by Captain <unk> Miyazaki — signaled their commander at Rabaul — Captain Sadayoshi Yamada — that they were under attack , were destroying their equipment and papers , and signed off with the message , " Enemy troop strength is overwhelming , We will defend to the last man . " Masaaki Suzuki , commander of the SNLF unit , ordered his troops into pre @-@ prepared defensive positions on Tulagi and Gavutu . 
 Marines of 2 / 5 secured the northwest end of Tulagi without opposition and then joined Edson 's Raiders in their advance towards the southeastern end of the island . The Marines advanced towards the southeast end of the island throughout the day while defeating a few isolated pockets of Japanese resistance . Around noon , Suzuki repositioned his main defenses into a line 9 ° 6 ′ 26 ″ S 160 ° 8 ′ 56 ″ E on a hill — called Hill 281 ( Hill 280 in some sources ) by U.S. forces based on its elevation — and a nearby ravine located at the southeast end of the island . The Japanese defenses included dozens of tunneled caves dug into the hill 's limestone cliffs and machinegun pits protected by sandbags . The Marines reached these defenses near dusk , realized that they did not have enough daylight left for a full @-@ scale attack , and dug in for the night . 
 During the night , the Japanese attacked the Marine lines five times , beginning at 22 : 30 . The attacks consisted of frontal charges along with individual and small group infiltration efforts towards Edson 's command post that at times resulted in hand to hand combat with the Marines . The Japanese temporarily broke through the Marine lines and captured a machine gun , but were thrown back soon after . After taking a few more casualties , the Marine lines held throughout the rest of the night . The Japanese suffered heavy losses in the attacks . During the night , one Marine — Edward H. Ahrens — killed 13 Japanese who assaulted his position before he was killed . Describing the Japanese attacks that took place during the night , eyewitness raider Marine Pete <unk> said : 
 " ... full darkness set in . There was movement to the front ... you could hear them jabbering . Then , the enemy found a gap and began running through the opening . The gap was ( sealed ) when another squad closed the gate . Some Japanese had crawled within 20 yards of ( Frank ) Guidone 's squad . Frank began throwing grenades from a prone position . His grenades were going off 15 yards from our position ( and ) we had to duck as they exploded . The enemy was all around . It was brutal and deadly . We had to be careful not to kill our comrades . We were tired but had to stay awake or be dead . " 
 At daybreak on 8 August , six Japanese infiltrators hiding under the porch of the former British colonial headquarters shot and killed three Marines . Within five minutes , other Marines killed the six Japanese with grenades . Later that morning , the Marines , after landing reinforcements in the form of the 2nd Battalion , 2nd Marines ( 2 / 2 ) , surrounded Hill 281 and the ravine , pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning , and then assaulted the two positions , utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and ravine . Employing the improvised explosives , the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed . Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon , although a few stragglers were found and killed over the next several days . In the battle for Tulagi , 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died . Three Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner . 
 = = = Gavutu – Tanambogo = = = 
 The nearby islets of Gavutu and Tanambogo housed the Japanese seaplane base as well as 536 Japanese naval personnel from the Yokohama Air Group and 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force and Korean and Japanese civilian technicians and laborers from the 14th Construction Unit . The two islets were basically mounds of coral — both about 42 m ( 138 ft ) high — and connected to each other by a 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) -long causeway . The hills on Gavutu and Tanambogo were called Hills 148 and 121 respectively by the Americans because of their height in feet . The Japanese on both islets were well entrenched in bunkers and caves constructed on and in the two hills . Also , the two islets were mutually supportive since each was in machine gun range of the other . The U.S. mistakenly believed that the islets were garrisoned by only 200 naval troops and construction workers . 
 At 12 : 00 on 7 August , Gavutu was assaulted by the U.S. Marine 1st Parachute Battalion consisting of 397 men . The assault was scheduled for noon because there were not enough aircraft to provide air cover for the Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Gavutu landings at the same time . The preceding naval bombardment had damaged the seaplane ramp , forcing the naval landing craft to land the Marines in a more exposed location on a nearby small beach and dock at 9 ° 6 ′ 53 @.@ 30 ″ S 160 ° 11 ′ 19 @.@ 20 ″ E. Japanese machine gun fire began inflicting heavy casualties , killing or wounding one in ten of the landing Marines as they scrambled inland in an attempt to get out of the crossfire coming from the two islets . 
 Surviving Marines were able to deploy two M1919 Browning machine guns to provide suppressing fire on Gavutu 's caves , allowing more Marines to push inland from the landing area . Seeking cover , the Marines became scattered and were quickly pinned down . Captain George Stallings — the battalion operations officer — directed Marines to begin suppressive fire with machine guns and mortars on the Japanese machine gun emplacements on Tanambogo . Shortly thereafter , American dive bombers dropped several bombs on Tanambogo , diminishing some of the volume of fire from that location . 
 After about two hours , Marines reached and climbed Hill 148 . Working from the top , the Marines began clearing the Japanese fighting positions on the hill , most of which still remained , with explosive charges , grenades , and hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . From the top of the hill , the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo . The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo . 
 Most of the 240 Japanese defenders on Tanambogo were aircrew and maintenance personnel from the Yokohama Air Group . Many of these were aircraft maintenance personnel and construction units not equipped for combat . One of the few Japanese soldiers captured recounts fighting armed with only hand sickles and poles . Rupertus detached one company of Marines from the 1st Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment on Florida Island to assist in assaulting Tanambogo , in spite of advice from his staff that one company was not enough . Incorrectly believing that Tanambogo was only lightly defended , this company attempted an amphibious assault directly on Tanambogo shortly after dark on 7 August . Illuminated by fires started during a U.S. naval bombardment of the islet , the five landing craft carrying the Marines were hit by heavy fire as they approached the shore , with many of the U.S. Navy <unk> being killed or wounded , as well as heavily damaging three of the boats . Realizing the position was untenable the Marine company commander ordered the remaining boats to depart with the wounded marines , and he and 12 men who had already landed sprinted across the causeway to cover on Gavutu . The Japanese on Tanambogo suffered 10 killed in the day 's fighting . 
 Throughout the night , as the Japanese staged isolated attacks on the marines on Gavutu under the concealment of heavy thunderstorms , Vandegrift prepared to send reinforcements to assist with the assault on Tanambogo . The 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines ( 3 / 2 ) , still embarked on ships off Guadalcanal , was notified to prepare to assault Tanambogo on August 8 . 
 The 3rd Battalion began landing on Gavutu at 10 : 00 on 8 August and assisted in destroying the remaining Japanese defenses on that islet , which was completed by 12 : 00 . Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo . The Marines on Gavutu provided covering fire for the attack . In preparation for the assault , U.S. carrier @-@ based dive bombers and naval gunfire bombardment were requested . After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu , killing four of them , further carrier aircraft support was canceled . San Juan , however , placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes . The Marine assault began at 16 : 15 , both by landing craft and across the causeway , and , with assistance from two marine Stuart light tanks , began making headway against the Japanese defenses . One of the tanks which became stuck on a stump and isolated from its infantry support was surrounded by a " frenzied mob " of about 50 Japanese airmen . The Japanese set fire to the tank , killing two of its crew and severely beat the other two crewmembers before most of them were killed by Marine rifle fire . The Marines later counted 42 Japanese bodies around the burned @-@ out hulk of the tank , including the corpses of the Yokohama executive officer and several of the seaplane pilots . One of the Japanese survivors of the attack on the tank reported , " I recall seeing my officer , Lieutenant Commander Saburo <unk> of the Yokohama Air Group , on top of the tank . This was the last time I saw him " . The overall commander of troops on Tanambogo was Captain ( naval rank ) Miyazaki @-@ san who blew himself up inside his dugout on the late afternoon of 8 August . 
 Throughout the day , the Marines methodically dynamited the caves , destroying most of them by 21 : 00 . The few surviving Japanese conducted isolated attacks throughout the night , with hand to hand engagements occurring . By noon on 9 August , all Japanese resistance on Tanambogo ended . In the battle for Gavutu and Tanambogo , 476 Japanese defenders and 70 U.S. Marines or naval personnel died . Of the 20 Japanese prisoners taken during the battle , most were not actually Japanese combatants but Korean laborers belonging to the Japanese construction unit . 
 = = = Landings on Guadalcanal = = = 
 In contrast to Tulagi , Gavutu , and Tanambogo , the landings on Guadalcanal encountered much less resistance . At 09 : 10 on 7 August , General Vandegrift and 11 @,@ 000 U.S. Marines came ashore on Guadalcanal between Koli Point and Lunga Point . Advancing towards Lunga Point , they encountered no resistance except for " tangled " rain forest , and halted for the night about 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) from the Lunga Point airfield . The next day , again against little resistance , the Marines advanced all the way to the Lunga River and secured the airfield by 16 : 00 on 8 August . The Japanese naval construction units had abandoned the airfield area , leaving behind food , supplies , and intact construction equipment and vehicles . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 During the battle , about 80 Japanese escaped from Tulagi and Gavutu – Tanambogo by swimming to Florida Island . They were , however , all hunted @-@ down and killed by Marine and British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force patrols over the next two months . 
 The Allies quickly turned the Tulagi anchorage , one of the finest natural harbors in the South Pacific , into a naval base and refueling station . During the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns , Tulagi served as an important base for Allied naval operations . Since the Japanese exerted control over the nearby seas at night throughout the Guadalcanal campaign , any Allied ships in the Guadalcanal area that could not depart by nightfall often took refuge in Tulagi 's harbor . Allied ships damaged in the naval battles that occurred between August and December 1942 in the vicinity of Guadalcanal usually anchored in Tulagi 's harbor for temporary repairs before heading to rear @-@ area ports for permanent repairs . 
 Later in the campaign , Tulagi also became a base for U.S. PT boats that attempted to interdict " Tokyo Express " missions by the Japanese to resupply and reinforce their forces on Guadalcanal . A seaplane base was also established on nearby Florida Island . Except for some troops left to build , garrison , operate , and defend the base at Tulagi , however , the majority of the U.S. Marines that had assaulted Tulagi and the nearby islets were soon relocated to Guadalcanal to help defend the airfield , later called Henderson Field by Allied forces , located at Lunga Point , for it was to be on Guadalcanal where all of the future , crucial , land battles in the Guadalcanal campaign would be fought . 
 The U.S. Navy escort carrier USS Tulagi — in commission from 1943 to 1946 — was named for the fighting on Tulagi . 
 = Typhoon Lee ( 1981 ) = 
 Typhoon Lee , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Dinang , was the second storm to affect the Philippines during December 1981 . Lee originated from an area of thunderstorm activity near the Truk Atoll towards the end of December . Following an increase in organization , the system was classified as a tropical cyclone on December 22 . After becoming a tropical storm , Lee began to slowly strengthen , and attained typhoon status on December 24 . While turning west towards the Philippines , Lee began to intensify more rapidly . It is estimated to have reached peak intensity the next day , with winds of 145 km / h ( 90 mph ) . At peak intensity , the storm moved ashore the central Philippines later on December 25 . Lee emerged into the South China Sea the following day as a tropical storm . Initially , the storm maintained its intensity , but soon began to weaken due to increased wind shear . By December 28 , all of the thunderstorm activity was removed from the center , and on December 29 , Lee dissipated . However , the remnants of the cyclone was last noted a few hundred kilometers south of Hong Kong . 
 Across the Philippines , Typhoon Lee killed 188 people . In addition , 674 @,@ 619 people were directly affected by the typhoon . Furthermore , 76 @,@ 169 dwellings were demolished while 39 @,@ 586 families , or 208 @,@ 336 people , were rendered as homeless . A total of 53 @,@ 314 houses were partially damaged . Also , 548 @,@ 525 people sought refuge in shelters . Additionally , 1 @,@ 586 individuals were injured due to Lee . Overall , damage totaled to $ 74 @.@ 1 million ( 1981 USD ) , $ 46 @.@ 4 million of which was from infrastructure and an additional $ 2 @.@ 2 million came from agriculture . 
 The island of Samar sustained the worst damage caused by the storm . There , 82 fatalities were reported and 56 were injured . A total of 19 @,@ 390 people were displaced ; roughly 8 @,@ 000 families or 48 @,@ 000 people was forced to move to evacuation centers . Elsewhere , in the coastal town of Calapan , 5 @,@ 600 dwellings received damage , and 85 % of the coastal town 's residents were displaced from their homes .

At 1000 UTC on December 22 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) for the system . Two hours later , the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Depression 29 following the discovery of a closed surface circulation by Hurricane Hunters . By that evening , thunderstorm activity had become more concentrated towards the center ; as such , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) first classified the system as a tropical cyclone . Following a further increase in organization , both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the cyclone into Tropical Storm Lee early on December 23 . Meanwhile , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Dinang . 
 Initially , Lee veered west @-@ northwest due to a mid @-@ latitude trough exiting off the Asia mainland . At 0600 UTC on December 23 , the JTWC classified Lee as a typhoon . At 0000 UTC on December 24 , the JMA upgraded Lee into a severe tropical storm . Six hours later , the agency classified Lee as a typhoon . Around this time , the JTWC predicted that Lee would turn north after entering the South China Sea due to the influence of an extratropical cyclone . However , as the storm turned west because the trough had moved away , the JTWC kept prolonging the northward turn . Moving in the general direction of the Philippines , Lee began to rapidly intensify . At 0600 UTC on December 25 , the JTWC reported winds of 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) , equivalent to a high @-@ end Category 2 hurricane on the United States @-@ based Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . According to the JTWC , this would be the storm 's peak intensity . Meanwhile , the JMA estimated peak intensity of 145 km / h ( 90 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar ( 30 inHg ) . That afternoon , the typhoon made landfall along the central portion of the Philippines . 
 After landfall , rapid weakening occurred , and when the storm entered the South China Sea on December 26 , the JTWC reduced the winds of Lee to 70 km / h ( 45 mph ) . Despite this , data from the JMA suggests that system was stronger , with winds of 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Based on additional reports from Hurricane Hunters , the JTWC revised its forecast and now anticipated the tropical cyclone to move on a westerly course and strike central Vietnam . Moving into an area of decreased monsoonal flow , Lee maintained its intensity for 18 hours . Satellite imagery showed a banding @-@ type eye . However , by December 27 , Lee began to feel the effects of an extratropical cyclone located to the north of the storm ; consequently , Lee began to make a gradual turn towards the northwest . Lee began to encounter increased vertical wind shear , and early on December 27 , the JMA lowered the intensity of Lee to 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Later that day , a Hurricane Hunter investigation recorded a pressure of 998 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) as the storm began to turn towards the north , exiting PAGASA 's warning zone . By 0000 UTC on December 28 , all of the deep convection was displaced from the center . Six hours later , the JMA estimated that Lee weakened to winds below tropical storm force . By midday , satellite imagery suggested that Lee was no longer a tropical cyclone ; however , the JTWC continued to issue warnings on the system until 0000 UTC on December 29 . At 1800 UTC , the JMA stopped watching the system . The remnants of Lee were last noted by the JTWC roughly 275 km ( 170 mi ) south of Hong Kong .

 Prior to landfall , twelve provinces , including some in Luzon , were placed on typhoon alert . Upon moving through the central Philippines , Typhoon Lee affected some of the same areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month , which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970 . Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut @-@ producing areas isolated . Railway services to and from Manila was suspended . Even though nine domestic flights were canceled , the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon . Across Manila , some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay . The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon ; 20 casualties happened there because of flooding . In the coastal region of Legaspi , home to a large volcano , 150 houses were demolished due to storm surge , 25 of which were swept out at sea . Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city . Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon , Masbate , and Albay provinces . In the latter , three villages were damaged . 
 Just south of the capital city of Manila , in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island , 5 @,@ 600 houses were damaged , and 20 @,@ 000 persons or 85 % of the town 's residents were left without a home . Two fatalities were reported in the city . In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island , 50 thatched huts were flattened . Elsewhere , four people were killed and three others injured in <unk> , where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed . 
 According to officials , 82 people were killed on the island of Samar . Throughout the island , the system destroyed schools , residences , an airport terminal , the government house in <unk> , and a jail , enabling 11 prisoners to escape . Most of damage to Samar was caused by collapsing houses and uprooted coconut trees hurled by the gusty winds . A total of 19 @,@ 390 people were displaced ; roughly 8 @,@ 000 families or 48 @,@ 000 people of which were forced to move to evacuation centers . An additional 56 people were hurt province @-@ wide . Ten homes were washed away along a coastal village in the Marinduque Province . One person also perished due to electrocution outside of Naga City . 
 One hundred eighty @-@ eight people were killed , primarily due to drownings . Another 674 @,@ 619 people were directly affected by the typhoon . A total of 76 @,@ 169 dwellings were demolished , and 39 @,@ 586 families , or 208 @,@ 336 people , were displaced . This total included approximately 6 @,@ 000 people in the provinces of Romblon , Quezon , and Albay . Overall , a total of 53 @,@ 314 homes were partially damaged . Moreover , 548 @,@ 525 people sought refuge in shelters . Additionally , 1 @,@ 586 persons were injured due to Lee . Overall , damage totaled to $ 74 @.@ 1 million , including $ 46 @.@ 4 million from infrastructure and $ 2 @.@ 2 million from agriculture . Damage was estimated at $ 44 million in Samar .

 Within a few days after the passage of Typhoon Lee , relief agencies were deployed to distribute food and medicines to families temporarily housed in schools , town halls and churches . Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared an emergency and a " state of calamity " in the provinces of Northern Samar , Masbate , Mindoro Oriental , and Romblon . He subsequently released $ 1 @.@ 8 million in order to repair roads , bridges and schools . Several evacuation centers were opened up in schools and town halls . 
 = Inocybe maculata = 
 Inocybe maculata , commonly known as the frosty fibrecap , is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family . First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885 , I. maculata can be found throughout Europe , Asia and North America . It is a medium @-@ sized brown mushroom with a fibrous , brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle . The stem is cream or brown . The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees , including beech . Inocybe maculata is poisonous , containing muscarine . Possible symptoms after consumption of I. maculata mushrooms are salivation , lacrimation , urination , defecation , gastrointestinal problems and vomiting , with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure . 
 = = Taxonomy , phylogeny , and naming = = 
 The species was given its specific epithet , " maculata " ( from the Latin for " spotted " ) , by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885 in an article in the Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France . Within the genus Inocybe , it has placed within the subgenus <unk> and section Rimosae . However , Phylogenetic analysis , has shown that section Rimosae as formerly defined does not form a monophyletic group ( that is , descended from a single exclusive ancestor ) , and former Rimosae species are better grouped into two clades , Maculata and Rimosae . Other species joining I. maculata in the Maculata clade include I. cookei , I. <unk> , I. rhodiola , I. <unk> , and I. erubescens . 
 Inocybe maculata has no generally recognised synonyms . However , there has been some debate about its status as a single species ; due to the wide geographic and morphological variation of the species , some authors have proposed multiple species and varieties . In response , mycologist Thom Kuyper has listed over thirty specific names and varieties as synonyms of Inocybe lacera , which is still generally recognised . It has also been suggested that Inocybe lanatodisca is a synonym , but where the species occur together , they can be distinguished from each other , and so it is still recognised as distinct . The form I. maculata f. fulva was named and described in 1991 by Marcel Bon in France . Inocybe maculata is commonly known as the frosty fibrecap . 
 = = Description = = 
 Inocybe maculata has a conical or bell @-@ shaped cap which is up to 8 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter . As the mushrooms age , the cap becomes flatter , and the broad umbo becomes prominent . The centre of the cap has white remains of the universal veil , especially on younger mushrooms . The cap is covered in fibres which extend from the centre of the cap to the margin ( which is usually split ) . The cap is typically a chestnut brown in colour , though it is paler towards the margin . As well as chestnut , the camp has been described as " Buckthorn brown " , " snuff brown " , " tawny olive " and " Saccardo 's umber " . Both cap colour and the presences of veil remnants are known to be very variable . In appearance , Inocybe maculata f. fulva has a lighter cap colour ( typically more yellow to reddish @-@ brown ) and less ( or even no ) remnants of the veil on the cap . The gill attachment is adnate , meaning that the gills are attached to the stem along their entire depth . The gills are crowded , with white edges that are finely toothed . Younger mushrooms have gills that are greyish @-@ white that eventually mature to an olive @-@ brown colour . The stem is up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) in length , and generally cylindrical in shape , though it is often thicker towards the base . While the stem is initially solid , it later becomes hollow . There is often a small bulb at the base of the stem . The stem has cream colouration , becoming gradually browner with age . The base sometimes white and powdery . The flesh is white . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 Inocybe maculata has thin @-@ walled cheilocystidia , which are clavate ( club @-@ shaped ) , lack encrustation at the apex , and are colourless . The basidia are also clavate , and can be two- , three- or four @-@ spored , and measure from 15 to 30 micrometres ( μm ) by 5 to 9 μm . The sterigmata ( the narrow horns on the end of the basidia which hold the spores ) are 4 to 5 μm long . It lacks pleurocystidia . The species leaves a snuff @-@ brown spore print . The spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped ; they have a yellow @-@ brown to rusty brown colouration , and measure from 9 to 11 μm by 4 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 5 μm . The hyphae can have clamp connections , but can also lack them . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Inocybe maculata is similar to the variable Inocybe lacera , the split fibrecap , but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap , and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap . The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca , but can be readily distinguished by odour ( I. lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet , green @-@ corn smell ) and the colour of the cap ( I. lanatodisca has a fulvous cap ) . It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata , but can again be distinguished by colour ; I. fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species , with a wide ecological range . It can be found in all biomes from low @-@ lying deciduous woodland to arctic @-@ alpine areas . It typically grows on the ground in deciduous ( or mixed ) woodland , favouring beech . It grows best on chalky soil , among leaf litter . In North America , it favours sandy soil , clay or moss . It is also encountered on <unk> . As well as beech , the species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam , hazel , oak and lime . Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch , spruce , pine , Populus , willow , ( as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions ) . Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups . Though widespread in the areas it is found , it is not a common species . It can be found from western Europe to eastern Asia ; and in North America , from where it was first collected in the 1960s . Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France , and has since been found elsewhere in Europe . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 The flesh has a mild taste , and a strong , pungent , fruity smell . The mushroom is poisonous , containing muscarine compounds . Consumption of the mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects , including : salivation , lacrimation , urination , defecation , gastrointestinal problems and emesis ( vomiting ) ; this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE . Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure , sweating and death due to respiratory failure .

 " The Food Wife " is the fifth episode of the twenty @-@ third season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 13 , 2011 , and was seen by around 7 @.@ 5 million people during this broadcast . In the episode , Homer feels left out when Marge , Bart , and Lisa join a group of foodies . Their personal blog quickly becomes popular and the trio is invited to a molecular gastronomy restaurant . Feeling pity toward Homer , Marge invites him along . However , after beginning to worry that he will reclaim his position as the parent perceived as the most fun by the children , she sends him to the wrong address . Homer unknowingly arrives at a meth lab , where a gunfight starts as the police burst in . 
 The episode was written by Matt Selman . It contains several references to different foods and famous chefs , and is largely devoted to the foodie culture , which Selman has said that he " always thought was funny and fascinating . The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating , but as something that you are so passionate about that you 're kind of bragging about it . " Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim , the stars and creators of Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! , guest starred in the episode as two foodies and performed a hip hop song that makes fun of foodies . Chefs and media personalities Anthony Bourdain , Gordon Ramsay , and Mario Batali also guest starred in the episode , but as themselves in a dream sequence . Although " The Food Wife " has received generally positive reviews from television critics , particularly for the hip hop song , it has also attracted criticism from certain food critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer takes Bart and Lisa to a video game convention for another fun Saturday . Upon their return home , Marge feels upset that Homer gets to be the " fun dad " , while she is stuck doing unexciting things with the children , not helped by Homer being a sexist stating that 's how it should be . The next Saturday , she decides to take Bart and Lisa to an " X @-@ Games " convention , thinking it will be something fun . However , when they arrive , they are disappointed to find out that it is a Christian event , and the actual name of the convention is " † ( Cross ) Games " . The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia , where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food . Although initially averse to the exotic delicacies , Marge is reminded of the fact that she wants to be a fun mom and therefore asks for the most authentic dish on the menu for her and her children . All three of them enjoy the food . At the restaurant , Marge , Bart , and Lisa bump into a group of foodies , who encourage them to start their own food blog , " The Three <unk> " . The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and writing about it . A jealous Homer makes a quick announcement of his dislike for trying new foods and dishes over dining on such pedestrian , reliable fare as fast food and leftovers , causing the kids to call him narrow minded and boring . 
 When the trio gets an invitation to an exclusive molecular gastronomy restaurant called El Chemistri , Homer learns the truth and confronts Marge . Realizing that the kids would rather spend time with Marge and having no one respect him , Homer sadly retreats in the garage making baseball bats . Marge invites Homer out of pity , which makes him happy . After announcing this to Bart and Lisa , he reclaims his " fun dad " title , leaving Marge worried about losing her new bond with the children . In one of her dreams that night , she and the children are trying out new food together with chef Anthony Bourdain when Homer jumps in on a hop ball and eats up everything , taking away the children 's attention from Marge . Homer , Bart , Lisa , Bourdain , and other famous chefs that have shown up ( like Mario Batali and Swedish Chef ) then jump away from Marge on hop balls , leaving her by herself . Afterwards , Gordon Ramsay appears next to her , using profanity while telling her that she should not have invited Homer . Before removing her from his dream , Gordon tells Marge to find a way to keep Homer from stealing her thunder by misleading him away from El Chemistri . The next day , she deliberately gives Homer the wrong address to the restaurant . Bart and Lisa learn the truth and confront Marge about her actions . 
 When Marge and the children arrive at El Chemistri , Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant . While the trio eat their meal ( deconstructed Caesar salad ) with the other foodies clearly enjoying themselves , Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer . Meanwhile , Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts , whom he believes to be food hipsters . Just as he is about to have a taste of the meth ( which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy ) , the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts . Homer realizes that he had been duped by Marge and is caught up in the fracas . At El Chemistri , Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help , and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband . They refuse , so she and the kids run off the meth lab . After arriving , Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer . This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie . With the help of this distraction , the police subdue him . Marge apologizes to Homer and though angry with her for leaving him out , he is grateful and promises to let her be the fun parent once in a while . The Simpsons have a family fun day at Krustyland . There , Homer keeps his promise to Marge and giving the kids $ 50 to enjoy themselves , while he spends quality time with her .

 " The Food Wife " was written by executive producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman . The writing process began around September 2010 . According to Selman , the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa , a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real @-@ life . The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs . Selman said in an interview with New York magazine 's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is " just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating . The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating , but as something that you are so passionate about that you 're kind of bragging about it . ' I 'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork @-@ neck soup restaurant , ' and you can kind of claim that as yours . The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny . And when I write Simpsons episodes , I try to start with a world I think is funny , and think , ' What 's a good story we can tell in that world , using the characters that we have ? ' " 
 Describing himself as " sort of a foodie " , Selman has said that food is constantly on his mind and that he particularly likes reading food critic Jonathan Gold 's reviews in LA Weekly . He told LA Weekly 's Squid Ink food blog that he likes foodies , despite making fun of them in " The Food Wife " . He commented that on the show , he has often " taken something that I love , found the one little weird , bad thing about it and harped on that " , giving foodies as an example and writing : " You can make fun of them for being pretentious or snobby or taking the fun out of eating . That you 'd rather photograph something than taste it is a funny nuance of the phenomenon . That it 's more about sticking your flag in something than actually enjoying it . We kind of make fun of foodies , but in real life we actually love them . " 
 Selman was pleased with the finished result of the episode . He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food " does not sound inherently exciting , but the episode itself is actually very exciting , and I 'm super thrilled with the way it 's turned out . " Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that , despite Homer 's love for food , Homer is not the one that becomes a foodie as one might expect . He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating , " he 's kind of a blue @-@ collar kind of guy who doesn 't like foreign food , weird food , savoring food , <unk> food , blogging about it , photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time . " 
 = = = Cultural references = = = 
 Selman wanted to include things in the episode that " only really hard @-@ core foodies would have any idea what we were talking about . This was like a love letter to foodie culture . " Food references featured in the episode include jokes about <unk> sauce and sous @-@ vide cooking , referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne , Frank Bruni , and Ruth <unk> , a mention of the soup <unk> from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly , and the inclusion of the El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés ( known for using molecular gastronomy ) . Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy " lends itself to comedy quite nicely . There ’ s a dish [ at El Chemistri ] , for instance , called Regret . The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it . The human tear is the final ingredient . " The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode , and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille , which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird . 
 In addition to the foodie culture , " The Food Wife " parodies the video game industry and references games such as Assassin 's Creed , God of War , Half @-@ Life , BioShock , Call of Duty , Medal of Honor , Madden NFL , and Angry Birds . In the episode , Homer , Bart , and Lisa visit a video game convention called the Expensive Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E4 ) , which is a reference to the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) that is presented annually in the United States by the Entertainment Software Association . This marked the first time that the family visited a video game convention in The Simpsons . Selman and other staff members on the show had previously visited E3 during the release of The Simpsons video games such as The Simpsons Game . While appearing on GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley on November 11 , 2011 , Selman commented that " We 've been to so many [ <unk> ] and we 've been pushed around , and knocked around , and seen so many PR guys [ talk ] about how hard it was working on their game . We 've seen how expensive the food is , and how nuts it is , and the bloggers , and the photos , and just the noises [ ... ] We had to do it on the show . " 
 In the episode , Homer and his children want to see the unveiling of a new Funtendo console called Zii Zu , which is a reference to Nintendo 's Wii U console . As he and the children make their way through the crowded convention to get to the unveiling , the screen turns into a first @-@ person shooter game through the eyes of Homer . He uses <unk> and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward . According to Selman , the inspiration for this came from the fact that " if you 've been to E3 , you know it 's insane , it 's super @-@ crowded , it 's super @-@ loud , and walking through it feels like a video game , like a nightmarish first @-@ person video game of bloggers and nerds . You just want to get the thing that you want to get to . " 
 = = = Guest appearances = = = 
 Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim , the stars and creators of the American sketch comedy television series Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! , guest starred in the episode as foodies <unk> <unk> and <unk> Garth , respectively . These two characters are among the foodies that Marge , Bart , and Lisa meet at the Ethiopian restaurant . In the episode , they rhyme a hip hop song that according to Selman is " all bragging about how awesome and cool you are as a foodie . " It was co @-@ written by the duo , and was inspired by the song " Empire State of Mind " . Selman has commented that " In animated TV shows , whenever you 're trying to show people having fun doing their new thing [ in this case , Marge and the children creating content for their blog ] , it just kind of becomes a boring montage . And we 've done so many montages on The Simpsons over 25 years , it 's like , oh , God , no more montages . [ ... ] So we were like , ' Why not do a silly rap song ? ' Rapping is sort of inherently boastful , and there 's something about being a foodie that 's inherently boastful . It 's like the boastfulness links those things . So Tim and Eric perform a food rap song in the show — an extremely silly rap song , and the name is intentionally silly : ' Blogging a Food Blog . ' " 
 American chef Anthony Bourdain guest starred in the episode as himself . Selman wanted him on the show because he is a big fan and he thinks Marge would have a liking for him . Bourdain 's appearance was cut short because the episode ended up being too long , and as a result , his " bad boy persona is not fully explored , " Selman told Squid Ink . In addition to Bourdain , guest stars in the episode include chefs and media personalities Gordon Ramsay and Mario Batali as themselves . These three all appear in Marge 's dream . When asked by Digital Spy about his appearance , Ramsay said that " I grew up watching The Simpsons and love that they 're foodies , " and joked that " For God 's sake , I had to promise Marge a spot on MasterChef to get on the bloody show ! " Selman wishes that he could have given Batali more than one line , but has admitted that " You just can 't fit everything into a 21 @-@ minute show . "

" He concluded that the episode is " a definite swing for the fences , and I think it hits its mark completely . " The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well . He commented that the writers " nailed it . Everything from the massive displays , long lines , and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on . The best was how they portrayed people with ' VIP passes ' , you know those things that we journalists get , as <unk> who think they 're better than the regulars . " 
 In his review of " The Food Wife " , HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall commended it for " stay [ ing ] true to the characters . Of course the kids would consider Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he 's actually making an effort , and of course Marge would feel jealous of this . And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing , she also recognizes it immediately , feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day , complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille . " Sepinwall also praised the episode for being " packed with great jokes " , such as Heidecker and Wareheim 's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first @-@ person shooter game . Similarly , <unk> Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as " funny and well @-@ observed " , giving it a B + grade , and cited the hip hop song as the highlight of the episode . He also praised Bourdain , Batali , and Ramsay , and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode . Childs further wrote that " The best thing about this episode is that it doesn ’ t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out @-@ of @-@ character character moments down the viewers ’ throats . It sticks to the basics : the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still @-@ current fad . I say ' still @-@ current ' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities , I don ’ t think that it has been overdone everywhere . " 
 = = = Response from food critics = = = 
 Reception of " The Food Wife " from food critics has been mixed . Before the episode aired , Robert <unk> of The Village Voice disapproved of it for being outdated . He commented that " this show should have been done , say , two or three years ago , when food blogging was hot . By now , many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out @-@ migrated to paying gigs , and the concept of the food blog has been co @-@ opted by every major media outlet , rendering real food blogs – the old @-@ fashioned kind , where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things , or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete . " <unk> also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date , since molecular gastronomy is , " by now , long past its prime " . Chris <unk> , a food critic for Washington City Paper 's Young & Hungry column and blog , wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés . He commented that " For one thing , the character seems far more subdued than the kooky , wild @-@ eyed power drill @-@ wielding cook we saw on Conan recently . The satire here , involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams , gels and airs , is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send @-@ up of Andrés ' over @-@ the @-@ top personality . " 
 Food critic Katharine Shilcutt of the Houston Press ' criticized the episode for giving what she thought was an inaccurate depiction of foodies , as people that are " tacky , snotty , slightly racist , hoarders of food experiences that you gather like rare gems and patronizingly hold over other people 's heads . " Shilcutt added that she found it upsetting that what she believes to be the moral of the episode is that " Educated , passionate people are elitists . It reduces all the hard work that people put into creating good , honest food into a joke , and not a terribly funny one . There was no balance in the episode between smug , arrogant , obnoxious foodies and those who have a genuine , guileless interest in food and all its important permutations in our lives . " 
 Other food critics have written positively about " The Food Wife " . Lesley <unk> of LA Weekly 's Squid Ink blog listed her ten favorite quotes from the episode , placing the entire hip hop song about foodies and food blogging at the top . She commented that " Plenty of insider jokes at foodies ' expense season the episode .

 Ickenham is a suburban area centred on an old village in Greater London , part of the London Borough of Hillingdon . 
 While no major historical events have taken place in Ickenham , settlements dating back to the Roman occupation of Britain have been discovered during archaeological surveys , and the area appears in the Domesday Book . Buildings from the 14th , 15th and 16th centuries remain standing and have been restored in recent years . 
 The village was originally split into four manors , which became two : Ickenham and Swakeleys . The old manorial home of Swakeleys , a 17th @-@ century Jacobean mansion Swakeleys House still stands , and much of the Swakeleys estate was sold for housing in the 1920s . Ickenham 's manorial home , Manor Farm , now forms part of Long Lane Farm . A military station , RAF West Ruislip , was opened in 1917 . Its final use was for the Navy Exchange of the U.S. Naval Activities , United Kingdom command between 1975 and 2006 . 
 According to the 1901 Census , Ickenham at that time had a population of 329 , which by the 2001 Census had reached 9 @,@ 933 , although census figures show a marked population decline during the 1960s and 1970s . By the 2011 Census , the population had reached 10 @,@ 387 . When Ickenham obtained a railway station on the Metropolitan Railway 's line between Harrow and Uxbridge , it brought with it a rail link to London . A great deal of residential development commenced in the village and it gradually became part of the London commuter belt . Ickenham expanded with the sale and development of much of the Swakeleys estate in 1922 and became part of what was later termed " Metro @-@ land " .

 Ickenham appears in the Domesday Book three times under the name " <unk> " . Translated from Latin , the second entry reads : 
 Manor Ickenham answers for 9 ½ hides . 3 men @-@ at @-@ arms and 1 Englishman hold it from Earl Roger . Land for 6 ploughs ; 4 ploughs there ; a further 2 possible . 6 villagers with 1 hide ; 2 others with 1 hide and 1 virgate ; 2 others with 2 virgates ; 4 smallholders with 20 acres ; 3 cottages . Meadow for 4 ploughs ; pasture for the village livestock ; woodland , 200 pigs . Total value £ 4 ; when acquired the same ; before 1066 £ 6 . 
 The Domesday Book describes the land as being predominantly flat and composed of London clay with the exception of alluvium along the banks of the River Pinn . Of the few archaeological surveys of Ickenham carried out , one in 1994 by the Museum of London found a system of Roman fields , dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries along with pottery fragments . Research suggest that the area may have been abandoned for a period following the departure of the Romans from Britain around AD 410 .

 Ickenham was originally divided into the four manors of Ickenham , <unk> , <unk> ( Swakeleys ) and Herses ( <unk> ) . <unk> and Herses were within the parish of Hillingdon , though Herses subsequently became part of the manor of <unk> . These manors were eventually merged to form the main manors of Ickenham and Swakeleys . The original lord of the manor of Ickenham was Geoffrey de Mandeville , from whom it passed to William de Brock and then , in 1334 , to John Charlton whose son John owned Swakeleys from 1350 . By the mid @-@ 14th century , Ickenham was owned by the Shorediche family who retained possession until 1819 . 
 The Crosier family , major landowners in north @-@ west Middlesex , moved to Ickenham in the 16th century . They established their manorial home as <unk> , and owned Home Farm and Sears house in 1624 . After the Shorediche family Milton Farm was bought by William Crosier in 1685 . Edward Hilliard become the direct descendent of the final member of the Crosier family , John Crosier . Under the <unk> , Milton Farm was sold to become part of the Swakeleys estate in 1816 , and Hill Farm become Northolt Aerodrome in 1916 . The Shorediche family built their manor house on a track off Long Lane . Originally called Ickenham Hall , it was let out to farmers in 1818 and renamed Manor Farm , at which point the Crosier family renamed their manorial home from <unk> to Ickenham Hall . 
 Swakeleys manor , subordinate to Ickenham , was named after Robert <unk> , who owned the manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century . He appears in records as Robert de <unk> and Robert de Wykeham , reflecting his ownership of Swakeleys and Wickham Park in Oxfordshire . In 1347 , he owed £ 40 to a money lender , Roger <unk> , which he was unable to pay , and so his land in Ickenham was passed by <unk> in 1350 to John de Charlton . 
 A descendent of John de Charlton , the first Sir Thomas de Charlton , died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son , also named Sir Thomas , who became Speaker of the House of Commons and Member of Parliament for Middlesex . He died in 1465 , at which point his son Sir Richard became owner of the manor . Sir Richard was killed fighting on the side of Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 . The victor of the battle , Henry VII , named him in his Act of Attainder , though he granted Sir Richard 's wife Elizabeth a life interest in the manor . However , Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and <unk> ( Cowley ) . Upon Sir Thomas ' death in 1510 , the manor passed to Sir John <unk> as his executor . Sir John had no children , so Swakeleys passed to the Earl of Devon , Henry Courteney in 1521 . The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531 , who was acting as trustee for Ralph <unk> . 
 The lords of the manor of Swakeleys resided at Swakeleys House , though the house that stands today was not the first on the site . The original dated to around the 14th century and was probably constructed of wattle and timber . It was subject to extensive remedial work , much lamented at the time , while under the ownership of John Bingley . Bingley later sold the estate to Sir Edmund Wright , a future Lord Mayor of London , in 1629 , and the current house was built of brick in 1638 . 
 A church in Ickenham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book and it is likely that residents travelled to nearby Harefield for services . The original nave and chancel of St Giles ' church have been dated to 1335 while the nave was extended west in 1959 . The bell turret was built in the 15th century and a brick aisle added in 1575 . 
 'The Pump ' is a significant local landmark . Donated to the village by Charlotte Gell , this water pump stands close to the village pond at the intersection of Swakeleys Road and Long Lane . After Gell 's death in 1863 , under the provisions of her will a water pump was sunk for the benefit for the community in 1866 . The village pond next to the pump was dug at the same time as the 144 @-@ foot ( 44 m ) well for the pump was sunk to accommodate waste from the construction . An older pond on the other side of the village was filled in with the excavated earth from the new one . In 1857 Gell had also donated some of her land near St Giles 's Church for five almshouses to be built for longstanding servants of the Gell household or Ickenham residents who were members of the Church of England . No more than three people were allowed to live in the houses at one time . The cottages remain and are maintained by the local church . Next to the pump stands the Coach & Horses public house , first licensed for the sale of alcohol in 1759 but of 16th @-@ century origin . The house was used for manorial courts throughout the 19th century until the last was held in 1878 .

 On 25 September 1905 , following lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council , the Metropolitan Railway opened a small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge . The railway company had been reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand , and so a compromise was reached with the construction of the halt . The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings . Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors . The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms , which were built in December 1905 , followed by a booking hut in 1910 . The original platforms , too short to align with all train carriages , were extended in 1922 . Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s . 
 The marathon event of the 1908 Summer Olympics in London passed through Ickenham and Uxbridge on its way to the White City Stadium . 
 As a result of the railway , more commuters gradually moved to Ickenham and travelled to work in London . On 5 July 1922 , 1 @,@ 382 acres ( 559 ha ) of the Swakeleys estate was auctioned for development , thereby significantly reducing its size . Roads laid out for the new development were Warren Road , Swakeleys Drive , Court Road , Milton Road , Ivy House Road , The Avenue and Thornhill Road ( originally named Park Road ) . Other land bordering the River Pinn was designated as public open land . Shops were built around Swakeleys Road , while houses were constructed along its length . The road was widened to become a dual carriageway in 1937 . Milton Farm , one of the farms on the former Swakeleys estate was demolished in 1939 . The farm 's pond and listed barn were cleared to make way for housing in what became Milton Road and Milton Court , though marketed as " Ickenham Garden City " . 
 A military station , operated by the Royal Air Force and later the United States Navy , was opened on part of Home Farm close to the parish boundary with Ruislip in 1917 , later becoming known as RAF West Ruislip . The site was used originally for the British No. 4 Maintenance Unit , together with the RAF Records division . It became involved in the repair of aircraft equipment and later in the servicing of American vehicles from RAF South Ruislip . Between 1955 and 1975 the United States Air Force was based at the Ruislip station , before the U.S. Naval Activities , United Kingdom command leased the site from the Ministry of Defence for the American Naval Exchange . 
 The original village school was built on Ickenham High Road in 1866 , although by 1920 it had become overcrowded . Older children were moved to the village hall in 1928 under the name Ickenham Temporary Council School . In 1929 the village school closed and its infant pupils also moved to the village hall . The road was widened in 1934 necessitating demolition of the school building along with the original Fox & Geese public house . 
 The village pump remained in use until December 1914 , while the handle was removed in 1921 by the local council for safe keeping but was never returned . The pump was restored in 2004 in partnership with a local building company , and a similar handle was fitted during the works . 
 Breakspear Primary School was built in 1937 , followed by Glebe Primary in 1952 on the other side of the railway line . The Roman Catholic secondary school <unk> Martyrs was built in 1962 and later expanded onto the former site of Swakeleys School nearby . Swakeleys School had opened in 1929 for older children from the village school . In 1952 the boys moved to the newly opened Abbotsfield School and Swakeleys became a girls ' secondary modern school . The girls ' school moved from Ickenham to share the site of Abbotsfield School for Boys in Hillingdon in 1973 . Vyners School opened as a grammar school on 12 January 1960 and later became a comprehensive . Delays in building work meant the first intake of pupils were taught at St Mary 's Grammar School in Northwood Hills from 9 September 1959 . 
 The village hall , designed by Clifton Davy , was built on part of Church Farm in 1926 . Opened by Princess Victoria , as well as becoming the temporary village school the hall also became a restaurant during the Second World War and went on to be used as a bank and a polling station . A police telephone box was constructed next to the Pump in February 1936 , and became operational on 4 May 1936 . Church Farm opposite St Giles ' church was demolished after the Second World War and replaced with shops , while new roads were built in the area . By 1951 the population of Ickenham had reached 7 @,@ 107 , and this had risen to 10 @,@ 370 by 1961 and 11 @,@ 214 by 1971 . The ford over the River Pinn on Swakeleys Drive , nicknamed " The Splash " , was replaced in 1957 by a road bridge . 
 Middlesex County Council bought Ickenham Hall and its grounds in 1948 in order to convert it into a youth centre . In 1968 a theatre was built behind the hall , later named the Compass Theatre by the Theatre Director John Sherratt . A new building connecting the two was built in 1976 . 
 During the Second World War Swakeleys House was requisitioned by the military and a searchlight battery established in the grounds . The house was Grade I listed in 1956 , and the head gardener 's cottage on the junction of Swakeleys Road and The Avenue was Grade II listed in 1959 . 
 The village library opened in 1962 on the site of the 16th century cottage and tea garden , The Orchard . Uxbridge Borough Council installed a three @-@ sided clock commemorating the 1953 coronation of Elizabeth II in the library 's tower , having been persuaded not to add it to the eight @-@ sided village pump . 
 In the 1980s , St Giles ' church celebrated its 650th anniversary and formed a covenant with the neighbouring United Reformed Church . The United Reformed Church moved to its current building in 1936 after the previous chapel building proved too small for the growing congregation . It is now used by a local company as a wood and scrap metal yard . Nearby , many buildings on the RAF station were demolished to make way for a new housing estate named Brackenbury Village . The US Navy eventually left in 2006 and the base was permanently closed . The site was cleared in 2007 and is currently undergoing redevelopment as residential housing under the " Ickenham Park " name . 
 The local library was closed for a complete refurbishment in 2009 and reopened in March 2010 . 
 A garden commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II was opened in September 2012 in Swakeleys Park . The garden , featuring a landscaped area and benches around a stone obelisk , was designed by the local council 's Green Spaces Team . The opening had been scheduled for 26 May 2012 , although this was postponed after vandals destroyed the stone obelisk overnight shortly after it had been installed .

 Ickenham had a parish council but came within the Uxbridge Rural District until 1925 , when this was absorbed into the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge . This remained until 1965 , when the borough was included in the newly established London Borough of Hillingdon . Within the borough of Hillingdon , Ickenham has its own ward , with Conservative Councillors John Hensley , Raymond <unk> and David Simmons representing it . 
 Ickenham was within the Uxbridge constituency until boundary changes at the 2010 general election meant it became part of the new Ruislip , Northwood and Pinner constituency , represented by Nick Hurd MP .

 The Ickenham and District Society of Model Engineers was formed in September 1948 and originally met in the old ARP huts , before moving to Ickenham Hall . On 14 May 1949 , the society held their first exhibition of miniature locomotives in a field off Swakeleys Road . A new society clubhouse opened on 18 June 1955 on a site near the Coach & Horses public house where it remains . The miniature railway is open to the public on the first Saturday of each month . 
 Ickenham 's residents ' association was established in 1924 , and it plays an active role within the community ; in recent years the association has been involved in preventing developments by Tesco and IKEA , which in the association 's view would have adversely affected the town .

Excavations of the site between 1966 and 1969 found pottery and an oven dating back to the 14th or 15th century . It is believed the manor house at the centre of the moat was " Pynchester " , a building owned by the Hastings family in the 16th century .

 = 2004 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was the costliest Atlantic hurricane season on record until surpassed by the following year . More than half of the 16 tropical cyclones brushed or struck the United States . The season officially began on June 1 , and ended on November 30 . Due to a Modoki El Niño – a rare type of El Niño in which unfavorable conditions are produced over the eastern Pacific instead of the Atlantic basin due to warmer sea surface temperatures farther west along the equatorial Pacific – activity was above average . The first storm , Alex , developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on July 31 . It brushed the Carolinas and the Mid @-@ Atlantic , causing one death and $ 7 @.@ 5 million ( 2004 USD ) in damage . Several storms caused only minor damage , including tropical storms Bonnie , Earl , Hermine , and Matthew . In addition , hurricanes Danielle , Karl , and Lisa , Tropical Depression Ten , Subtropical Storm Nicole and Tropical Storm Otto had no effect on land while tropical cyclones . 
 Hurricane Charley made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) , causing $ 15 @.@ 1 billion in damage in the United States alone . Later in August , Hurricane Frances struck the Bahamas and Florida , causing at least 49 deaths and $ 9 @.@ 5 billion in damage . The most intense storm , and the one that caused the most damage , was Hurricane Ivan . It was a Category 5 hurricane that devastated multiple countries adjacent to the Caribbean Sea , before entering the Gulf of Mexico and causing catastrophic destruction on the Gulf Coast of the United States , especially Alabama and Florida . Throughout the countries it passed through , Ivan left 129 fatalities and over $ 23 @.@ 33 billion in damage . The most significant tropical cyclone in terms of deaths was Hurricane Jeanne . In Haiti , torrential rainfall in the mountainous areas resulted in mudslides and severe flooding , causing at least 3 @,@ 006 fatalities . Jeanne also struck Florida , inflicting extensive destruction . Overall , the storm caused at least $ 8 @.@ 1 billion in damage and 3 @,@ 042 deaths . 
 Collectively , the storms of this season caused at least 3 @,@ 270 deaths and about $ 57 @.@ 37 billion in damage , making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane season at the time , until the following season . With six hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 intensity , 2004 also had the most major hurricanes since 1996 . However , that record would also be surpassed in 2005 , with seven major hurricanes that year . In the spring of 2005 , four names were retired : Charley , Frances , Ivan , and Jeanne . This tied the then @-@ record most names retired with 1955 and 1995 , while five were retired in 2005 . 
 = = Seasonal forecasts = = 
 Since 1984 , forecasts of hurricane activity have been issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University ( CSU ) , and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . According to CSU , the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9 @.@ 6 tropical storms , 5 @.@ 9 hurricanes , and 2 @.@ 3 major hurricanes , which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . A normal season , as defined by NOAA , has 12 @.@ 1 named storms , of which 6 @.@ 4 reach hurricane strength and 2 @.@ 7 become major hurricanes . 
 CSU released its first prediction on December 5 , 2003 , which projected an above average season , with 13 named storms , seven hurricanes , and three major hurricanes . This forecast was adjusted upward slightly on April 2 . On May 17 , prior to the start of the season , NOAA forecasters predicted a 50 % probability of activity above the normal range , with twelve to fifteen tropical storms , six to eight of those becoming hurricanes , and two to four those hurricanes reaching major intensity . Dr. Gray released a prediction on May 28 that was similar , with 14 named storms , eight reaching hurricane strength , and three becoming major hurricanes . 
 After the season began , Dr. Gray announced he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August 6 , citing mild El Niño conditions . His new forecast was thirteen named storms , seven hurricanes , and three reaching major hurricane intensity . On August 10 , NOAA released an updated prediction as well , with a 90 % probability of above @-@ to @-@ near normal activity , but the same number of storms forecast . CSU issued another forecast on September 3 , indicating sixteen tropical storms , eight hurricanes , and five major hurricanes . The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions , fifteen named storms , nine hurricanes , and six major hurricanes , which matched CSU 's final prediction on October 1 .

 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , 2004 . However , the first system , Hurricane Alex , did not develop until July 31 . It was an above average season in which 16 tropical cyclones formed . All but one tropical depression attained tropical storm status , and nine of these became hurricanes . Six hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes . Due to a Modoki El Niño – a rare type of El Niño in which unfavorable conditions are produced over the eastern Pacific instead of the Atlantic basin due to warmer sea surface temperatures farther west along the equatorial Pacific – activity was above average . Five hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 3 @,@ 270 deaths and about $ 57 @.@ 37 billion in damage . Additionally , Hurricanes Alex and Tropical Storm Earl also caused losses and fatalities , though neither struck land . The season officially ended on November 30 , 2004 . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis began at the end of July , with the development of Hurricane Alex on July 31 . However , it did not become a named storm until the following day , which was the fifth @-@ latest start since the 1952 season . August was an unusually active month , with eight named storms , including Alex , Bonnie , Charley , Danielle , Earl , Frances , Gaston , and Hermine . This broke the record for the most named storms in the month of August set in 1933 and 1995 . This new record was tied in 2012 . On average , there are only three tropical storms and one to two hurricanes in August . Of the eight systems that month , five became hurricanes and three strengthened further into major hurricanes . A total of five tropical cyclones developed in September , including the most intense system of the season , Hurricane Ivan . Activity decreased further in October , with the formation of only two systems , Tropical Storm Matthew and Subtropical Storm Nicole . The season then went dormant for over a month and a half , until Tropical Storm Otto developed on November 29 . Otto was the final tropical cyclone of the season and degenerated into a remnant low pressure on December 3 .

 The 2004 season was very deadly , with about 3 @,@ 270 fatalities overall . Nearly all of the deaths were reported in Haiti following the floods and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Jeanne . The other tropical cyclones that caused fatalities include Hurricane Alex , Charley , Frances , Gaston , and Ivan , and Tropical Storms Bonnie and Earl . Because four out of the six major hurricanes made several landfalls , the season was also extremely damaging , with losses estimated at about $ 36 @.@ 1 billion , over half of which was caused by Hurricanes Charley and Ivan . A few other tropical cyclones caused light to moderate damage , including Hurricanes Alex and Gaston and Tropical Storms Bonnie and Matthew . In addition to the 16 tropical cyclones of the season , a tropical low in May brought torrential flooding to Haiti and the Dominican Republic , killing 2 @,@ 000 people and causing extensive damage . Though the system was not officially classified as a tropical storm , it did have a circulation with loosely organized convection , resembling a subtropical cyclone .

 The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences . With six hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 intensity , 2004 also had the most major hurricanes since 1964 , a record which would be surpassed in 2005 . Florida was severely impacted by four hurricanes during the season – Hurricane Charley , Frances , Ivan , and Jeanne . This was the first time four tropical cyclones produced hurricane @-@ force winds in one state during a single season since four hurricanes made landfall in Texas in 1886 . There were many other hurricanes in the season that were individually unusual . Hurricane Alex was the strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38 ° N latitude . Hurricane Ivan was the most unusual storm of the season . Ivan became the first major hurricane in the Atlantic on record to form as low as 10 ° N latitude . A 91 ft ( 28 m ) wave , possibly the largest ever recorded , was attributed to Ivan ; this wave may have been as high as 131 ft ( 40 m ) . Additionally , hurricanes Charley and Ivan ranked as the third and second costliest hurricanes in the United States at the time , respectively , behind only Hurricane Andrew . With $ 57 @.@ 37 billion in damage , this was the costliest season at the time , until 2005 . 
 = = = Accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) = = = 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 227 , one of the highest values on record in the Atlantic basin . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 The interaction between a trough and tropical wave resulted in the development of a tropical depression on July 31 , while centered about 200 mi ( 320 km ) east of Jacksonville , Florida . After initially being poorly organized , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Alex late on August 1 . The storm tracked northeastward and became a hurricane on August 3 . As Alex moved out to sea , it intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and peaked with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . Alex reached major hurricane status second farthest north in the Atlantic , after Hurricane Ellen in 1973 . Eventually , Alex weakened due to cooler sea surface temperatures . The hurricane fell to tropical storm intensity around 12 : 00 UTC on August 6 . Six hours later , it became extratropical while located about 955 mi ( 1 @,@ 540 km ) east of Cape Race , Newfoundland , and was soon absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone . 
 Rough seas and a storm surge up to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) on the Outer Banks of North Carolina caused minor beach erosion and washed out portions of a highway in Cape Fear . A man drowned near Nags Head due to these conditions . Strong winds also pelted the area , with sustained winds reaching 77 mph ( 124 km / h ) and gusts up to 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) in Hatteras . As a result , 10 @,@ 000 buildings and houses were left without electricity . The combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged more than 100 buildings and houses . At Ocracoke , coastal flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Gloria in 1985 . Additionally , rainfall up to 7 @.@ 55 in ( 192 mm ) on the Outer Banks flooded nearly 500 cars . Damage in North Carolina reached about $ 7 @.@ 5 million . In Rehoboth Beach , Delaware , three people were injured by rip currents , while five others were hospitalized in New Jersey . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Bonnie = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 , while located about 315 mi ( 505 km ) east of Barbados . The depression crossed the Lesser Antilles on August 4 , before degenerating back into a tropical wave . The remnants traversed the Caribbean Sea , and re @-@ developed into Tropical Depression Two on August 8 . The depression strengthened further upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9 . A break in a mid @-@ level ridge re @-@ curved Bonnie northward on August 10 and then northeastward on August 11 . Later that day , the storm peaked with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , before wind shear began weakening it . At 14 : 00 UTC on August 12 , Bonnie made landfall near Apalachicola , Florida with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . The storm rapidly weakened inland and degenerated as a remnant low offshore of New Jersey on August 14 . 
 In the Lesser Antilles , the storm brought light winds and mostly localized flooding to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines . The regenerated system brought light rainfall to the Yucatan Peninsula .

 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 9 to the south @-@ southeast of Barbados . Early on August 10 , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley , before reaching hurricane intensity south of Jamaica on August 11 . Charley continued to strengthen after curving northwestward and was a 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall near Alquízar , Cuba on August 13 . After emerging into the Straits of Florida , Charley weakened to a Category 2 hurricane . However , the storm abruptly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane later on August 13 , with winds peaking at 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . At 19 : 45 UTC on August 13 , Charley made landfall at Cayo Costa , Florida , followed by another landfall in Punta Gorda about an hour later . Charley rapidly weakened over Florida , falling to Category 1 by early on August 14 . Later that day , the storm emerged into the Atlantic , before making two more landfalls in Cape Romain and Myrtle Beach , South Carolina as a minimal hurricane . Late on August 14 , Charley weakened to a tropical storm over southeastern North Carolina , shortly before becoming extratropical near Virginia Beach , Virginia . 
 The storm brought rainfall and strong winds to the island of Jamaica . In Westmoreland Parish , flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways . Winds in the parish caused a large tree to fall on a house , resulting in significant damage to the home . In Kingston , high winds damaged power lines and homes . Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines . The storm left $ 4 @.@ 1 million in damage and one fatality in Jamaica .

 = = = Hurricane Danielle = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Four while south @-@ southeast of Cape Verde on August 31 . Although sea surface temperatures were only marginally warm , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle early on August 14 . Further intensification occurred and by early on August 15 , Danielle reached hurricane status . The storm deepened significantly over the next 24 hours and became a Category 2 hurricane . Later on August 16 , Danielle peaked as strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 964 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) . 
 At the time of peak intensity on August 16 , Danielle was heading northward to north @-@ northwestward because of a subtropical ridge . Shortly thereafter , southwesterly vertical shear began increasing , causing the hurricane to weaken . Mid @-@ level flow associated with a diffluent trough caused Danielle to move northeastward on August 18 . Later that day Danielle deteriorated to a Category 1 hurricane , hours before being downgraded to a tropical storm . On August 19 , Danielle became nearly stationary and moved erratically while southwest of the Azores . Eventually , the storm curved west @-@ southwestward and weakened to a tropical depression on August 20 . About 24 hours later , Danielle degenerated into a remnant low pressure area . The remnant low moved westward and then to the north @-@ northwest , before dissipating about 795 mi ( 1 @,@ 280 km ) west @-@ southwest of the westernmost islands of the Azores . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Earl = = = 
 By August 13 , a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five while located about 1 @,@ 150 mi ( 1 @,@ 850 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . The depression headed westward between 21 and 29 mph ( 34 and 47 km / h ) due to a strong subtropical ridge located to its north . After developing banding features and an increase in Dvorak intensity estimates , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl at 18 : 00 UTC on August 14 . The storm strengthened slightly further and on the following day , it reached maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Later on August 15 , Earl crossed the Windward Islands and passed just south of Grenada . 
 Although Earl appeared well @-@ organized , it unexpectedly degenerated into a tropical wave on August 16 , after a reconnaissance aircraft reported no closed circulation . The remnants eventually reached the Pacific Ocean and developed into Hurricane Frank on August 23 . Tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall in Grenada damaged at least 34 homes and a nursing home and toppled several trees and electrical poles . Damage on other islands was confined to a few impacted homes , moderate crop losses , and widespread power outages , especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Tobago . One fatality occurred and 19 people were listed as missing .

 Around 00 : 00 UTC on August 24 , a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six , while located about 755 mi ( 1 @,@ 215 km ) west @-@ southwest of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde . Moving west @-@ northwestward , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Frances later that day . Frances reached hurricane status late on August 25 while curving northwestward . By August 28 , the storm reached a primary peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) . Late the following day , Frances weakened to a Category 3 hurricane during an eyewall replacement cycle . However , by August 31 , the storm re @-@ intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) . While approaching the Bahamas , wind shear and increasing westerly winds aloft caused Frances to weaken to a Category 3 hurricane late on September 2 . 
 At 19 : 30 UTC on September 2 , the system made landfall on San Salvador Island with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . Early the next day , Frances struck Cat Island while somewhat weaker . The system decelerated and weakened slightly to a Category 2 hurricane before landfall in Eleuthera hours later . By September 4 , Frances made another landfall on Grand Bahama with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Moving slowly west @-@ northwestward , the hurricane made landfall in Hutchinson Island , Florida at the same intensity , early on September 5 . Rapidly weakening , Frances fell to Category 1 intensity around midday and deteriorated to a tropical storm about six hours later . On September 6 , the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near New Port Richey , before another landfall at the mouth of the Aucilla River with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Early on September 7 , Frances weakened to a tropical depression over Georgia . By late the next day , the system became extratropical , though the remnants persisted until dissipation over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on September 11 . 
 In the Bahamas , about 75 % of residents lost electricity . Between 13 and 17 percent of the non @-@ native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage , primarily from snapping , though some browning from salt spray was noted . Several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport . Insured losses reached about $ 300 million . Severe damage was also dealt to banana , corn , and pineapple crops . About 4 @,@ 160 homes received minor damage , while 2 @,@ 522 houses were rendered uninhabitable or destroyed . About 700 people were left homeless . Additionally , sea walls , schools , bridges , roads , and docks suffered damage . Strong winds brought severe damage to Florida , especially counties along the east coast .

In the tri @-@ county area alone , damage totaled approximately $ 4 @.@ 5 billion . Palm Beach County also suffered particularly severely , with 15 @,@ 000 houses and 2 @,@ 400 businesses damaged there . About 4 @.@ 27 million customers were left without electricity in Florida . Frances and its remnants brought extensive flooding to other states , especially in Georgia , North Carolina , Ohio , and Pennsylvania . The storm spawned 101 tornadoes in the United States , with 45 in South Carolina alone . Damage in the United States totaled approximately $ 9 @.@ 5 billion , placing Frances among the costliest hurricanes in the country . Overall , the storm caused 49 deaths , two each in the Bahamas and Ohio , eight in Georgia , and thirty @-@ seven in Florida . 
 = = = Hurricane Gaston = = = 
 A frontal low pressure area developed into Tropical Depression Seven at 12 : 00 UTC on August 27 , while located about 130 mi ( 210 km ) east @-@ southeast of Charleston , South Carolina . The depression gradually strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston early on August 28 . Initially , Gaston tracked slowly , moving southeastward and then westward , before a developing mid- to upper @-@ level ridge re @-@ curved the storm northwestward . Gaston strengthened and became a hurricane at 120 : 00 UTC on August 29 . Two hours later , the storm made landfall near <unk> , South Carolina with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Gaston weakened rapidly inland and was only a tropical depression by early on August 30 . Gaston re @-@ strengthened into a tropical storm while located over eastern Virginia on August 31 , just hours before emerging into the Atlantic . Gaston re @-@ intensified slightly further , but became extratropical near Sable Island on September 1 . 
 In South Carolina , an unofficial measurement indicated wind gusts up to 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) in South Capers Island , which is near Parris Island . Strong winds destroyed eight homes , damaged more than 3 @,@ 000 buildings , and left more than 150 @,@ 000 people without power . Additionally , flash flooding further inland severely damaged or destroyed at least 20 homes in Berkeley County . In North Carolina , widespread street flooding occurred , including inundation of portions of Interstates 40 and 95 . Several trees were downed by strong winds , especially in Chatham and Johnston counties . A tornado in Hoke County damaged several homes . Severe flooding occurred in east @-@ central Virginia due to rainfall amounts up to 12 @.@ 6 in ( 320 mm ) . In Chesterfield , Dinwiddie , Hanover , Henrico , and Prince George counties , 350 homes and 230 businesses were damaged or destroyed , and many roads were closed due to high water . In Richmond , more than 120 roads were closed , including a portion of Interstate 95 . There were nine fatalities . Throughout the United States , Gaston caused about $ 130 million in damage . The remnants produced light rainfall in Nova Scotia , Newfoundland , and Sable Island . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hermine = = = 
 The frontal zone that spawned Hurricane Gaston developed an area of convection south of Bermuda on August 25 . After detaching from the front and developing a circulation , the system became a tropical depression at 18 : 00 UTC on August 27 . It initially remained weak while the convection fluctuated , until intensifying into Tropical Storm Hermine at 12 : 00 UTC on August 29 . Later that day , wind shear exposed the circulation to the north of the convection , though the storm was able to a peak as a 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) tropical storm on August 30 . The storm turned northward under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge . Increased wind shear from Gaston weakened Hermine . By late on August 30 , the circulation was entirely exposed from the convection . 
 Early on August 31 , Hermine made landfall near New Bedford , Massachusetts as a minimal tropical storm . It rapidly weakened while moving northward , and after becoming extratropical , Hermine was absorbed by a frontal zone later that day . The storm brought tropical storm force winds and light rainfall to eastern Massachusetts , reaching about 0 @.@ 5 in ( 13 mm ) in Cape Cod . The remnants of Hermine tracked across New Brunswick and produced locally heavy rainfall , peaking at about 2 @.@ 36 in ( 60 mm ) . In Moncton , minor basement flooding and street closures were reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Ivan = = = 
 A westward @-@ moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 2 , before becoming Tropical Storm Ivan on the following day . After reaching hurricane intensity on September 5 , the storm strengthened significantly , becoming a Category 4 hurricane on September 6 . It subsequently weakened , though it reached major hurricane status again the next day . Late on September 7 , Ivan passed close to Grenada while heading west @-@ northwestward . While located near the Netherlands Antilles on September 9 , Ivan briefly became a Category 5 hurricane . During the next five days , Ivan fluctuated between a Category 4 and 5 hurricane . The storm passed south of Jamaica on September 11 and then the Cayman Islands on the next day . While curving northwestward , Ivan brushed western Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane on September 14 . 
 Shortly after moving to the west of Cuba on September 14 , Ivan entered the Gulf of Mexico . Over the next two days , the storm gradually weakened while tracking north @-@ northwestward and northward . At 06 : 50 UTC on September 16 , Ivan made landfall near Gulf Shores , Alabama with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . It quickly weakened inland , falling to tropical storm status later that day and tropical depression strength by early on September 17 . The storm curved northeastward and eventually reached the Delmarva Peninsula , where it became extratropical on September 18 . The remnants of Ivan moved southward and then southwestward , crossing Florida on September 21 and re @-@ entering the Gulf of Mexico later that day . Late on September 22 , the remnants regenerated into Ivan in the central Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression , shortly before re @-@ strengthening into a tropical storm . After reaching winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , wind shear weakened Ivan back to a tropical depression on September 24 . Shortly thereafter , Ivan made a final landfall near Holly Beach , Louisiana with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and subsequently dissipated hours later . 
 Throughout the Lesser Antilles and in Venezuela , Ivan caused 44 deaths and slightly more than $ 1 @.@ 15 billion in losses , with nearly all of the damage and fatalities in Grenada . While Ivan was passing south of Hispaniola , the outer bands of the storm caused four deaths in the Dominican Republic . In Jamaica , high winds and heavy rainfall left $ 360 million in damage and killed 17 people . The storm brought strong winds to the Cayman Islands , resulting in two deaths and $ 3 @.@ 5 billion in damage . In Cuba , a combination of rainfall , storm surge , and winds resulted in $ 1 @.@ 2 billion in damage , but no fatalities . Heavy damage was reported along the Gulf Coast of the United States . Along the waterfront of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida , nearly every structure was impacted . In the former , 10 @,@ 000 roofs were damaged or destroyed . About 4 @,@ 600 homes were demolished in the county . Similar impact occurred in Alabama . Property damage was major along Perdido Bay , Big Lagoon , Bayou Grande , Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay .

Throughout the United States , the hurricane left 54 fatalities and slightly more than $ 18 @.@ 8 billion in damage . Six deaths were also reported in Atlantic Canada . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Ten = = = 
 A tropical wave accompanied with a well @-@ organized area of convection emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 29 . Performing a slow curve over the eastern Atlantic , the wave became increasingly less @-@ defined over subsequent days as a result of strong southwesterly wind shear . Following the development of shower and thunderstorm activity near the center , the system acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 12 : 00 UTC on September 7 , while positioned about 725 mi ( 1 @,@ 165 km ) southwest of the southernmost Azores . Hostile environmental conditions caused the depression to remain below tropical storm intensity and instead degenerate into a remnant low by 12 : 00 UTC on September 9 after the center decoupled from the remainder of the convective activity . The low @-@ level circulation persisted near the Azores until dissipating the following day . 
 = = = Hurricane Jeanne = = = 
 Tropical Depression Eleven developed from a tropical wave at 18 : 00 UTC on September 13 , while located about 70 mi ( 110 km ) east @-@ southeast of Guadeloupe . After crossing the island while moving west @-@ northwestward , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Jeanne around midday on September 14 . It strengthened further in the Caribbean Sea , before making landfall near Guayama , Puerto Rico with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) at 16 : 00 UTC the following day . Hours later , Jeanne emerged into the Mona Passage and resumed deepening , becoming at Category 1 hurricane at midday on September 16 . Around the time , the hurricane made another landfall at the eastern tip of Dominican Republic with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . By early on September 17 , Jeanne weakened to a tropical storm due to its slow movement over the rough terrain of Hispaniola , and briefly fell to tropical depression intensity at 18 : 00 UTC . After re @-@ emerging into the Atlantic , the storm then moved generally northward . After the system passed between the eastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18 , slow re @-@ intensification occurred . 
 Late on September 20 , Jeanne again became a Category 1 hurricane ; around that time , it began to execute an anti @-@ cyclonic loop . The storm moved eastward , before an extratropical trough caused Jeanne to curve southeastward . Early on September 22 , the system strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . A deep @-@ layer ridge slowly curved Jeanne to the west by the following day , around the time it weakened to a Category 1 hurricane due to upwelled waters . However , the storm began re @-@ intensifying on September 24 , becoming a Category 2 hurricane again that day and a Category 3 by September 25 . At 14 : 00 UTC on the latter , Jeanne struck the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . The hurricane strengthened slightly further , peaking with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . Jeanne made its final landfall on Hutchinson Island , Florida at the same time around 04 : 00 UTC on September 26 . It quickly weakened after moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity only 14 hours later . Curving northward , Jeanne decayed to a tropical depression over Georgia late on September 27 . Jeanne turned northeastward and became extratropical over Virginia after about 24 hours . The remnants briefly re @-@ strengthened after moving offshore the Delmarva Peninsula , but dissipated late on September 29 . 
 In Guadeloupe , rainfall amounts up to 11 @.@ 81 in ( 300 mm ) caused flooding and mudslides throughout the island . Many roads and bridges were inundated or washed out . About 470 homes were damaged or destroyed . Similar impact was reported in Puerto Rico , with heavy precipitation causing flooding and mudslides . There was also heavy damage to crops , schools , houses , and businesses . Strong wind gusts left 70 % of the island without power . Jeanne resulted in $ 169 @.@ 9 million in damage and eight deaths . In Dominican Republic , major flooding was reported , with rivers overflowing , bridges collapsing , roads cut off , damage to agriculture , and mudslides . Strong winds disrupted telephone services and caused power outages . Overall , hundreds of people became homeless and there was 23 deaths and $ 270 million in damage . Up to 13 in ( 330 mm ) of rain fell on the mountainous region of Haiti , causing extreme flooding and mudslides , especially in the Gonaïves area . Over 200 @,@ 000 people were left homeless and an estimated 3 @,@ 006 fatalities occurred .

 = = = Hurricane Karl = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Twelve early on September 16 , while located 390 mi ( 630 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . The depression moved westward under a subtropical ridge and became Tropical Storm Karl later that day . On September 17 , the storm curved northwestward and continued strengthening , reaching hurricane status early on September 18 . Karl intensified significant while moving west to west @-@ northwestward and became a major hurricane by early the next day . The storm briefly deepened to a Category 4 hurricane on September 20 , before weakening slightly and subsequently re @-@ strengthening to that intensity . Early on September 21 , Karl peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) while moving northwestward again . 
 After peak intensity on September 21 , Karl weakened due to increasing wind shear , while moving northeastward in response to a baroclinic trough . After wind shear lessened , the storm briefly became a major hurricane again on September 23 . However , wind shear returned later that day and ocean temperatures began cooling . Another trough re @-@ curved Karl northward on September 24 as the storm was gradually weakening . Early on September 25 , Karl became extratropical while located about 585 mi ( 940 km ) east of Cape Race , Newfoundland . The remnants of Karl accelerated northeastward and then east @-@ northeastward . Sustained winds up to 89 mph ( 143 km / h ) and gusts reaching 112 mph ( 180 km / h ) were observed on <unk> in the Faroe Islands . The extratropical remnants of Karl dissipated over Norway on September 28 . 
 = = = Hurricane Lisa = = = 
 At 18 : 00 UTC on September 19 , a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen , which was centered located about 520 mi ( 840 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cape Verde . Despite unfavorable conditions from being located near Hurricane Karl , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lisa on September 20 . After nearly reaching hurricane status , Lisa began executing a small cyclonic loop due to a Fujiwhara interaction with a tropical wave . Additionally , the interaction caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical depression on September 23 . During the next several days , the storm fluctuated in intensity , from a tropical depression to a strong tropical storm . A deep mid- to upper @-@ level trough caused Lisa to turn northward on September 25 . 
 By October 1 , a short @-@ wave trough re @-@ curved and accelerated Lisa toward the northeast . The storm strengthened and was finally upgraded to a hurricane at 06 : 00 UTC on October 2 . At that time , Lisa attained its peak intensity with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . After sea surface temperatures dropped to around 73 @.@ 4 ° F ( 23 @.@ 0 ° C ) , Lisa weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm later on October 2 . The storm lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12 : 00 UTC on October 3 .

Overall , losses in Louisiana reached $ 255 @,@ 000 . In Mississippi , storm surge caused coastal flooding in Hancock County . Damage in the state totaled only $ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Subtropical Storm Nicole = = = 
 The interaction between an upper @-@ level trough and a cold front developed a low pressure area on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda . It developed a curved band of convection northwest of the center , and it organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole by October 10 . An approaching mid @-@ level trough turned the system northeastward . Early on October 11 , Nicole passed about 60 mi ( 95 km ) northwest of Bermuda . On the island , Nicole and its precursor dropped 5 @.@ 86 in ( 148 mm ) of rainfall and produced wind gusts reaching 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . The winds left 1 @,@ 800 homes and businesses without power , while the unsettled conditions caused delays at the L.F. Wade International Airport . 
 After passing Bermuda , Nicole developed an area of convection near the center , suggesting the beginning of a transition to a tropical cyclone . However , strong wind shear caused weakening after the storm reached peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . A larger extratropical storm absorbed Nicole on October 11 , while the storm was located south of Nova Scotia . In Maine , gusty winds from the remnants of Nicole downed trees and electrical lines , resulting some power outages , especially along or near the coast . Similarly , 11 @,@ 300 people were left without electricity in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick alone after winds uprooted trees and toppled power lines . Significant rainfall was also produced in the region , peaking at about 5 in ( 130 mm ) in northeastern Nova Scotia . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Otto = = = 
 A cold front and a strong upper @-@ level trough interacted , resulting in the development of an extratropical low pressure area on November 26 . After losing frontal characteristics , the system transitioned into Subtropical Storm Otto at 12 : 00 UTC on November 29 , while located about 1 @,@ 150 mi ( 1 @,@ 850 km ) east @-@ southeast of Bermuda . Initially , the storm moved northwestward due to a weakness in a subtropical ridge . Late on November 29 , Otto attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Deep convection formed near the center and the storm began transitioning to a warm core system . 
 The system was re @-@ classified as Tropical Storm Otto at 12 : 00 UTC on November 30 . Although sea temperatures were relatively cold , Otto did not quickly weaken , because of low wind shear . On December 1 , the storm curved southeastward and completed a cyclonic loop later that day . After wind shear began increasing , Otto started weakening and was downgraded to a tropical depression at 12 : 00 UTC on December 2 . At that , Otto reached its minimum barometric pressure of 995 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . Early on December 3 , the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure while located about 920 mi ( 1 @,@ 480 km ) southeast of Bermuda .

 = Saman ( novel ) = 
 Saman is a controversial Indonesian novel by Ayu Utami published in 1998 . It is Utami 's first novel , and depicts the lives of four sexually @-@ liberated female friends , and a former Catholic priest , Saman , for whom the book is named . Written in seven to eight months while Utami was unemployed , Saman sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies and ignited a new literary movement known as sastra wangi ( originally used pejoratively ) that opened the doors to an influx of sexually @-@ themed literary works by young Indonesian women . 
 Saman deals explicitly with themes of sexuality , taboo for women writers in Indonesia at that time . She also writes about the supernatural and mysticism . Utami has said the stories reflect some of her personal experiences , such as her loss of religion which mirrors that of the priest , Saman . Utami also includes passages reflecting the destructiveness of Suharto 's political authoritarianism ; in later interviews she said the political realities reflected in Saman are still applicable to post @-@ Suharto Indonesia . 
 Saman won the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest , which led to its publication . Critical reception was mixed . Some critics praised the richness of its language , while others derided the novel for its sexual explicitness and questioned whether it was Utami 's own work . The novel eventually was hailed for its groundbreaking portrayal of a woman 's views of sexuality . As of 2008 , it has been translated into six languages and won several awards , including the 1998 Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition and the 2000 Prince Claus Award . A film adaptation is in the making .

 Saman follows four sexually liberated female friends : Yasmin , a married Catholic lawyer from Medan ; Cok , a Balinese lawyer with a high libido ; Shakuntala , a bisexual Catholic Javanese dancer ; and Laila , a Muslim Minangkabau journalist . The other protagonist is the titular Saman , a former Catholic priest turned human rights activist who becomes the target of sexual advances by Yasmin and Cok . 
 The first chapter , beginning in Central Park , New York , describes Laila waiting for the married Sihar and planning to lose her virginity to him . Eventually Laila realises that Sihar is still in Jakarta with his wife , and feels depressed . 
 The second chapter covers Saman 's childhood — including his relationship with his mother , a woman drawn to the spiritual world — his entry into priesthood , and his attempt to protect a rubber tapping community from the attempt by a local plantation to acquire their land . After the attempt fails and the plantation 's hired thugs raze the community to the ground and kills those who resist , Saman is captured and tortured . He eventually is broken out of his confinement by the surviving resistance members , becoming a fugitive and relinquishing his duty as a priest . He becomes a human rights advocate , assisted by Yasmin . 
 The third chapter , written from the point of view of Shakuntala , tells how Yasmin , Cok , Shakuntala , and Laila met at high school and their escapades there , both sexual and academic . Shakuntala recounts a fantasy she had as a teenager about meeting a " foreign demon " , embracing him and then having a debate on the different cultural aspects of sexuality . Towards the end of the chapter , Shakuntala notes that she is attracted to Laila and dislikes Sihar , but supports her friend 's efforts as she cares for her . 
 During the fourth chapter , Saman is spirited away to New York by Yasmin and Cok . Although both Cok and the married Yasmin make advances toward him , he initially declines . However , during the middle of the night he and Yasmin have sex , but Saman is distressed because he ejaculated quickly . The entirety of the last chapter consists of emails sent between Saman and Yasmin , discussing their insecurities , that become increasingly sexualised .

 When written , Saman was intended to be included in a work in progress entitled Laila Tak <unk> Ke New York ( Laila Does Not Come to New York ) . However , after the character <unk> became too developed Utami split the storylines . Saman was published first , with <unk> following in 2001 . Saman was written during a period of seven to eight months while Utami was unemployed . 
 A. Junaidi of The Jakarta Post suggests that the political insights in Saman are partially inspired by Utami 's earlier career as a journalist , both with Forum Keadilan and as a founding member of the Alliance of Independent Journalists .

 Junaidi notes that although Saman is about a female 's perspective of sexuality , it also deals with the authoritarianism of Suharto 's regime of the New Order , including the repression of human rights activists . In a 2005 interview with The Jakarta Post , Utami said that her critique of the New Order is still relevant ; at the time of the interview , she saw the Suharto government as having left Indonesia with a legacy of what she calls " nuclear waste " , including a loss of Indonesia 's agricultural ability . In the interview , Utami also noted that Indonesians had become corrupt and lazy , increasingly bureaucratic , and without a feeling of sportsmanship . 
 Utami has also noted that the novel is a reflection of her own restlessness and anxiety . Although little of it directly reflects events in her life , she notes that Saman 's loss of religion reflects her own , and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture . Although the novel touches on racial harmony , Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped . 
 Barbara Hatley notes that Saman contrasts the perceived differences between Eastern and Western cultures . She cites the scene where Shakuntala fantasizes encountering a " foreign demon " ( European explorer ) while bathing , later " embracing " him and discussing the " bizarre " requirement that Asian men are required to wear penis decorations and the " crassness " of Europeans who do not care about virginity , wear bikinis in public , and show sex on television . According to Hatley , this is rendered more ironic by both characters being naked during the discussion . She also notes that Saman touches on the traditional archetype of feminine power drawn from nature and the supernatural , and it reinterprets the hero archetype through Saman , who is small , thin , and inexperienced with women but able to withstand torture and defend a community of rubber tappers . 
 Junaidi writes that Saman also includes bits of the supernatural , including ghosts and mysticism . In her master 's thesis , Micaela Campbell writes that Saman 's mother , known only as " Ibu " ( Indonesian for ' Mother ' ) , was " highly susceptible to supernatural forces that seem to govern over her " . Through Ibu , Javanese mysticism and other supernatural content is introduced that contrasts Saman 's father , a realist ; this leads to Ibu " failing " in her role as a mother , and , according to Campbell , may be a factor driving Saman to priesthood . Campbell notes that Shakuntala also lives in a world of <unk> and peri ; however , unlike Ibu , Shakuntala draws further strength from this spiritual world .
