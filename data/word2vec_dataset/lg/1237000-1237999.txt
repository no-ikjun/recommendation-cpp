 A native of <unk> , Sweden , Jesper Fasth was born on December 2 , 1991 . He changed his last name to " Fast " in 2012 . Fast began his hockey career with the HV71 U18 team in Sweden 's J20 SuperElit junior hockey league . He debuted in the 2007 – 08 season , tallying 26 points ( 15 goals , 11 assists ) in 30 games . The next season , as a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , Fast played in 37 regular season games and seven playoff matches for HV71 's U20 team . He scored 17 points ( nine goals , eight assists ) and had 24 penalty minutes , including two goals , one assist and eight penalty minutes in the postseason . In 2009 – 10 , Fast recorded 49 points ( 23 goals , 26 assists ) , the highest he had scored in all three categories during his SuperElit league career . He led the team in goals and placing second in points and third in assists . He tied for fifth in the overall league for regular season points , and also had two assists in three playoff games . 
 Fast also made his Swedish Hockey League debut in 2009 – 10 , playing in two games with HV71 , although he failed to record a point in either match . He returned to the SuperElit league for the start of the 2010 – 11 season , scoring 10 points ( three goals , seven assists ) in six games with the HV71 U20 team , before permanently joining the Swedish Hockey League .

 At age 18 , playing in a limited role for HV71 during the 2010 – 11 season , Fast scored 16 points ( seven goals , nine assists ) in 36 games , with a + 6 plus @-@ minus , six penalty minutes and two power play goals , exceeded most observers ' expectations . Fast credited playing alongside Johan <unk> as part of the reason for his success and growth in confidence . He was held scoreless with a -3 plus @-@ minute in three postseason games as the first @-@ place HV71 was swept from the first round of the playoffs by Allmänna <unk> ( AIK ) in an upset . In the 2011 – 12 season , Fast had three multi @-@ point games , including a career @-@ high four assists and five points against AIK on October 4 . That game started a streak of 10 points ( one goal , nine assists ) over six games , which continued to an October 20 match against Frölunda HC . However , Fast 's season was cut short after he suffered a fractured ankle during a November 29 game against Brynäs IF . He missed three months as a result , but nevertheless recorded 16 points ( five goals , 11 assists ) in 21 games for the season , matching his Swedish Hockey League career high in points and establishing new career highs in assists and plus @-@ minus ( + 9 ) . He also scored two goals and one assist in five postseason games . 
 In December 2011 , Fast signed a two @-@ year contract extension with HV71 , which included a 900 percent raise to 5 million krona annually . Fast had a strong start to his 2012 – 13 season , scoring six points ( four goals , two assists ) in the first 10 games . He finished the regular season with 35 points ( 18 goals , 17 assists ) in 47 games , exceeding the 32 points ( 12 goals , 10 assists ) he had scored in 57 games during his first two Swedish Hockey League seasons . Fast tied for HV71 lead in goals and ranked third on the team in points , behind Jason Krog ( 43 ) and Rhett <unk> ( 39 ) . Fast also had a career @-@ high + 13 plus @-@ minus . Despite ranking third in the league , HV71 was eliminated from the playoffs in five games against Linköpings HC , during which Fast recorded five points ( 1 goal , 4 assists ) , and a + 4 plus @-@ minus . He tied with <unk> for second on the team in postseason points and assists . 
 At the conclusion of the 2012 – 13 season , Fast was awarded the <unk> riddare ( Knight of the Rink ) award , which is bestowed by the Swedish hockey journalists ' association each season to the most sportsmanlike player . He was also voted favorite HV71 player of the year by readers of the Swedish publication <unk> .

 Fast was drafted by the New York Rangers in the sixth round ( 157th overall ) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft , having obtained the sixth round pick from the Carolina Hurricanes earlier in the day in exchange for defenseman Bobby Sanguinetti . Fast was the fifth of six players the Rangers drafted in 2010 , along with Dylan McIlrath , Christian Thomas , Andrew <unk> , Jason Wilson and Randy McNaught . On May 29 , 2012 , the Rangers announced Fast had been signed to a two @-@ way , three @-@ year entry level contract , valued at $ 2 @.@ 145 million , with a $ 900 @,@ 000 annual cap hit . Since HV71 was eliminated from the 2012 – 13 playoffs earlier than expected , Fast had the opportunity to go to the New York Rangers organization sooner than originally planned . The Swedish Hockey League initially voiced objections , but eventually agreed to loan him to the Rangers . 
 Fast practiced with New York for the first time on April 2 , 2013 , although he did not play with the team that season . He made his North American professional debut on April 5 , 2013 , with the Connecticut Whale , the Rangers ' American Hockey League minor league affiliate , during which he scored a power play goal against Springfield Falcons goaltender Curtis McElhinney in the Whale 's 4 – 3 victory , and was the Third Star of the Game . However , he injured his knee during the match and did not play another AHL game that season . 
 = = = = 2013 – 14 season = = = = 
 Fast participated in the Rangers ' training camp that preceded the 2013 – 14 season , during which he impressed New York 's head coach Alain Vigneault , and head European scout Anders Hedberg . Although it was his first North American professional training camp , Fast made the Rangers roster , partially because the team needed a right @-@ handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan . Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes , taking one shot on goal in 10 : 13 of ice time . Fast played in eight of the Rangers ' first 10 games of the season , playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus @-@ minus , before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin 's return from a shoulder injury . Observers said Fast needed to adjust to the smaller North American ice surface , and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL . 
 Fast recorded two assists during his October 30 debut with the Rangers AHL team , now called the Hartford Wolf Pack . However , he suffered a high ankle sprain after going into the boards during a November 2 game at Springfield . He missed the next 14 games as a result , not returning until December 20 , but was given enough minutes upon his return that he was quickly able to get back into shape . Fast scored his first goal of the season on December 26 , notching the game winner on the power play against Bridgeport Sound Tigers goalie Anders Nilsson . The game was part of a four @-@ game point streak ( two goals , two assists ) that stretched from December 21 to December 29 . Fast also set a team record on January 24 for fastest goal to start a period , scoring in the first seven seconds of the game against Springfield , beating Hartford 's previous record by two seconds . 
 Fast had a season @-@ high five @-@ game point streak from January 24 to January 31 , recording six goals and two assists . That included his first North American professional multi @-@ goal game on January 25 , in which he scored two goals against the Falcons . Fast followed that the next day with a second straight two @-@ goal game , this time against the Adirondack Phantoms . Fast had another two @-@ goal game , both on the power play , against the Phantoms on March 22 , which marked the start of a run of seven points ( four goals , three assists ) in seven games up to April 6 . Fast marked a North American single @-@ game career high with three points ( 2 goals , 1 assist ) in Hartford 's 3 – 2 win over the Norfolk Admirals on April 6 , earning him First Star of the Game . Fast recorded a total of 34 points ( 17 goals , 17 assists ) in 48 games for the 2013 – 14 Hartford season , along with 30 penalty minutes and a + 14 plus @-@ minus . Despite missing time from his injury , Fast ranked seventh on the team in assists , fourth in goals , and second in plus @-@ minus with + 14 . His eight power play goals led the team and tied eighth place in the league among AHL rookies , and his six game @-@ winning goals tied for first in Hartford and fourth in the overall league . Fast was a staple on the Wolf Pack 's penalty kill unit , and played most of the season on a line with J. T. Miller and Ryan Bourque . 
 Fast was called up to the Rangers in April 2014 to replace Chris <unk> , who suffered a left hand injury . Playing on a line with Hagelin and Brad Richards , Fast played in New York 's last three regular season games , as well as three post @-@ season matches . He recorded his first career NHL playoff point with an assist in Game 1 of the Metropolitan Division Semifinal against the Philadelphia Flyers on April 17 . At the conclusion of the season , the Rangers coaching staff told Fast to add strength , so he worked on his upper body and leg strength during the off @-@ season , adding 10 to 15 pounds of muscle , bringing him to 20 pounds heavier than when he was drafted in 2010 . 
 = = = = 2014 – 15 season = = = = 
 Fast scored three goals during the Rangers ' 2014 preseason , including a game @-@ tying goal in a September 22 loss to the New Jersey Devils , and two goals in a 6 – 3 victory over Philadelphia on September 28 . For the second consecutive year , he made the Rangers roster out of training camp , with Vigneault calling him one of the most consistent players throughout the camp . But he again struggled once the regular season began , and on October 17 was sent back to the Hartford Wolf Pack , along with J. T. Miller . Fast had nine points ( one goal , eight assists ) over the next 11 matches for Hartford , including two 2 @-@ assist games on October 24 , and November 8 , notching his sole goal in a 4 – 3 win over the Worcester Sharks on November 2 . He was recalled by the Rangers on November 10 . 
 Fast scored his first NHL regular season career point on November 23 with an assist on Dominic Moore 's goal against the Montreal Canadiens . He scored his first NHL goal on November 29 , three days before his 23rd birthday , against Ray Emery of the Philadelphia Flyers . Miller , his long @-@ time AHL teammate , assisted on the goal , and Fast assisted on a Miller goal that same game . Fast recorded his second goal in as many games on December 1 , scoring against Ben Bishop of the Tampa Bay Lightning . Fast has played most of the season on the fourth line , often with Moore and Tanner Glass , or with Hagelin and Kevin Hayes , and has been an occasional healthy scratch . He has seven points ( three goals , four assists ) on the season so far . 
 = = International play = = 
 In 2009 – 10 , Fast skated in ten international matches for Sweden at the U18 and U19 levels , but did not participate in the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship tournament . He scored one goal and one assist in four games for Sweden at the U20 USA National Junior Evaluation Camp in Lake Placid , New York . At age 18 , Fast represented Sweden in the 2011 IIHF World U20 Championship , where he tied the team lead with four goals in six tournament matches , also recording two assists and a + 4 plus @-@ minus . Sweden took fourth place in the tournament . In 2011 – 12 , Fast represented Sweden in the Karjala Cup portion of the European Trophy tournament in October . He scored two assists in three games , which tied the Swedish team lead in scoring , and tied eighth scoring for the overall tournament .

 Fast is considered a skilled forward with good skating ability , hockey sense , and speed , the latter of which gives him an edge in retrieving pucks along the boards . He excels on the forecheck , is a reliable defensive forward , and plays well in the offensive , defensive , and neutral zones . Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability , and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall . One of Fast 's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play , but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason .

 Sparebanken Sør Arena ( " Savings Bank South Arena " ) is a football stadium located at <unk> in Kristiansand , Norway . The all @-@ seater has a capacity of 14 @,@ 563 people , and serves as the home ground of Tippeligaen side IK Start . It was designed by Kjell Kosberg , and is architecturally similar to Aker Stadion . The venue has seen concerts by Elton John , Dolly Parton and A @-@ ha , among others . The name derives from a sponsorship agreement with Sparebanken Sør . UEFA refers to the stadium as Kristiansand Arena . 
 Construction started in 2006 , and the stadium opened on 15 April 2007 , replacing Kristiansand Stadion as Start 's home ground . The venue cost 400 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) , of which the stadium itself cost NOK 250 million , after significant cost overruns . While originally planned with artificial turf , the venue was ultimately built with a natural grass pitch . The venue and the holding company Start Stadion were taken over by Sparebanken Sør , the main creditor , in 2008 . They subsequently also took over Start Toppfotball , the company running the club . Both companies were sold to Ernst Ravnaas in 2009 . Following decreased attendance , ahead of the 2011 season the seating on the corners was sold as advertisement space and the maximum capacity has artificially been reduced to 11 @,@ 700 . 
 = = History = = 
 Traditionally , Start has played their home games at Kristiansand Stadion , a municipal multi @-@ purpose stadium . In May 2005 , the municipal council approved the plans for a new stadium for Start . At the time , the structure was estimated to cost NOK 177 million , of which NOK 120 million would be for the stadium itself , while the remaining would be for commercial properties . 
 The club held an architecture competition , and received six bids . On 28 September 2005 , Start Toppfotball announced that they had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from <unk> Arkitektkontor , who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena . The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9 @,@ 948 people , but the plans were scalable , allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted . Ernst Ravnaas , co @-@ owner of the club , stated that given the recent high attendance , he wanted to build a larger stadium than the default proposal . Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality , a NOK 40 million loan from the municipality , a NOK 20 million grant from <unk> , a municipal culture fund , NOK 20 in value added tax refund , NOK 10 to 20 million in naming rights , the sale of commercial property , NOK 30 to 40 million in a bank loan , and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball . 
 In October , the club stated that they hoped to finance a further expansion of the stadium to 14 @,@ 000 seats by selling part of the lot to a private developer , which would use it to build a 17 @-@ story building . On 23 December , <unk> signed a contract where they bought shares worth NOK 45 million in Start Toppfotball . In addition , they paid NOK 15 million for the right to build 11 @,@ 000 square meters ( 120 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial property in conjunction with the stadium , and an option to purchase the high @-@ rise lot for NOK 25 million . The high @-@ rise lot was again bought from the municipality for NOK 15 million . Combined with the free lot for the stadium , Start Toppfotball received municipal subsidies of NOK 25 million for constructing the venue . 
 A controversy arose regarding whether to lay natural or artificial turf . Kristofer <unk> , one of Start 's star players , stated that he would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid . The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf . In March , Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass , and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another artificial turf venue . The name of the venue was announced on 21 October , after the club had signed a ten @-@ year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK 35 million . The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company <unk> AS , which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør . 
 Construction of the stadium was subject to significant cost overruns . These were mostly caused by the increased size of both spectator and commercial area , increased standard to VIP facilities , a general increase in construction costs , and the deadline to finish the venue in time for the league to start . Total investments exceeded NOK 400 million , of which 250 million was paid for by Start . This resulted in the stadium company having a debt of NOK 173 million , in addition to NOK 60 million in share equity . In November 2007 , Start sold 2 @,@ 500 square meters ( 27 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial space at the stadium for NOK 25 million to finance part of the cost overrun . 
 The opening of the stadium took place on 15 April 2007 , in the season 's first league game , against Viking . The game attracted 14 @,@ 448 spectators , a record attendance and the only time the venue has been sold out . After the opening , the pitch was the worst in the league , and by May the grass within the penalty areas and along the one side had been replaced . By 2010 , the pitch quality had improved and was regarded as " world class " by the Start players . The cost of preparing the pitch , including snow removal , ahead of the season is about NOK 500 @,@ 000 . Ahead of the 2008 season , the 1 @,@ 400 club seats had to be replaced for a cost of NOK 1 @.@ 5 million , because the wood in the chairs were rotting . The reason was that the chairs were designed for in @-@ door use , and the necessary precautions to protect them when not in use had not been taken . 
 The stadium had a book value of NOK 230 million , way over the real value , causing Start Toppfotball to have to write down the investment . To finance this , Sparebanken Sør , the main creditor , bought Start Stadion from Start Toppfotball for NOK 2 @,@ 600 on 23 December 2008 . At the same time , the club signed a 40 @-@ year agreement to lease the stadium from Sparebanken Sør for NOK 12 million per year . On 7 March 2009 , the bank also bought the remaining shares of Start Toppfotball , becoming the sole owner of both the club and the stadium . Sparebanken Sør offered to sell Sparebanken Sør Arena to the municipality for NOK 100 million , but the municipality rejected this on 29 May . The bank subsequently sold Start Stadion and Start Toppfotball to Ravnaas on 25 June for NOK 1 each . Start Stadion had at the time a debt of NOK 34 million to Start Toppfotball , NOK 60 million to Sparebanken Sør and NOK 40 million to Kristiansand Municipality . Sparebanken Sør lost NOK 80 million in their transactions with Start and Sparebanken Sør Arena . 
 Following a fall in game attendance in 2009 and 2010 , Start decided ahead of the 2011 season to reduce the stadium 's capacity . Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners , thus reducing the capacity to 11 @,@ 700 tickets . The club stated that the intention was to move spectators closer together to increase the atmosphere , and at the same time making it easier to sell out the stadium . In February 2012 , Kristiansand District Court sentenced Start to pay NOK 6 @.@ 4 million in value added tax on the naming rights . The club stated that they believed the naming rights were exempt . After the 2011 season , Start was again relegated to the First Division . In an attempt to better the club 's financial situation , Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena , in exchange for NOK 250 @,@ 000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports . Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012 . 
 Start won the 2012 Norwegian First Division and were promoted to the top league for their 2013 season . Start Stadion had been involved in a legal suit with the Norwegian Tax Administration over whether value added tax was to be paid for the stadium 's naming rights . The company lost the case both in Agder Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court , resulting in the company having to pay NOK 9 million in taxes . As the company did not have such values , it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013 . At the time the company had a debt of NOK 107 million . At the time the municipality has commenced negotiations with Sparebanken Sør to purchase the stadium . Football economist Tor Geir <unk> stated that Sparebanken Sør had by then spent NOK 200 million on subsidizing Start and that in reality the municipality and bank were funding the repeated deficits in the club . The municipality announced a plan in October 2013 , whereby they would purchase the bank 's NOK 54 million loan for NOK 44 million and receive all the shares in the stadium company . The bank would then buy the naming rights for ten more years for NOK 10 million and yet unsold commercial property . The municipality would then be owed NOK 64 million by the stadium company , up from NOK 46 million .

 = Ernest Emerson = 
 Ernest R. Emerson ( born March 7 , 1955 ) is an American custom knifemaker , martial artist , and edged @-@ weapons expert . Originally an engineer and machinist in the aerospace industry , Emerson became a knifemaker by producing knives for a martial arts class and making art knives early in his knifemaking career . In the 1980s he became better known for his combat knives and popularizing a style of knife known as the Tactical @-@ folder . 
 In order to secure military contracts , Emerson eventually founded Emerson Knives , Inc a production company to mass @-@ produce his designs in 1996 . Emerson 's knives have been displayed as museum pieces , designed for use by Navy SEALs and used by NASA in outer space . 
 Emerson 's knives have been featured in films and novels , due to their association with military units . This has furthered their popularity with collectors . 
 Emerson is an accomplished martial artist who has developed a combatives system , Emerson Combat Systems , which has been taught to police officers , military units , and civilians . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ernest Emerson was born on March 7 , 1955 in northern Wisconsin . While attending high school he displayed athletic ability as a wrestler and baseball player , being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals to play professional baseball at the age of 17 in the Midwest League . 
 Emerson began his training in martial arts at the age of 16 with the Korean version of Judo known as <unk> , traveling from Wisconsin to Minnesota twice a week to attend school . He continued his study of the martial arts while attending the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse where he earned a brown belt in <unk> Karate and a black belt in Shotokan Karate while competing on the university 's karate team . After graduating with degrees in physical education and world history , Emerson moved to Southern California for the sole purpose of continuing his martial arts training at the Filipino Kali Academy . There he studied Jun Fan Gung Fu , Jeet Kune Do , and Eskrima under the tutelage of Dan Inosanto and Richard Bustillo ( both protégés of the late Bruce Lee ) . Emerson subsequently trained in Gracie Jiu Jitsu for three years at the original Gracie Academy in Torrance , California , under the founders of the Gracie Jiu Jitsu system , <unk> and Royce Gracie . Eventually , Emerson became an instructor in his own right and combined the principles of all these systems . It was in Southern California where he met his wife , Mary , who at the time was one of the world 's top female practitioners of Jujutsu . During this time , Emerson worked as a technician , a machine operator , and eventually a design engineer for Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo . 
 = = Early knifemaking = = 
 Although Emerson credits his grandfather 's gift of a Barlow knife to him at the age of eight years with starting his interest in knives , it was not until later in life that he turned to making them . The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a <unk> knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and , unable to afford one on his salary , Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead . He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock ; the knife 's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw , shaped with files , and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch . 
 When he started classes with this " homemade " knife , his instructors and fellow students were impressed with his handiwork and asked him to make knives for them . Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials , but he soon raised the price to $ 50 each , as demand for his knives increased . Emerson went on to make fixed @-@ blade knives on a part @-@ time basis , but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show , he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided he was going to make folding <unk> from that point on . Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker <unk> mechanism on his own knives . According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch , Emerson said of Walker , " Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife . It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular " . 
 = = Pre @-@ tactical models = = 
 Emerson 's early folding knives were of the linerlock variety , ground by the stock removal method , and utilized rare materials from the aerospace industry , including titanium , carbon fiber , micarta , and meteorite . He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time , including mother @-@ of @-@ pearl , abalone shell , paua shell , staghorn , and rare hardwoods . Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species , noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker . The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS @-@ 34 , <unk> @-@ L , or <unk> , and the blades were either highly polished or hand @-@ rubbed . Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades . Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today , these knives are known as the " Pre @-@ Tac " ( Pre @-@ Tactical ) models . They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades . The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms . Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker : Michael Walker , Clint Breshears , Bob <unk> , and Jim Ferguson . 
 Emerson 's first logo or stamp on these knives was " Emerson Knives " surrounding the outline of a Bowie knife ; accordingly this is referred to as the rare " Bowie Logo " , appearing on only a very small number of knives . When a knife collector asked Emerson if he made Bowie knives , Emerson informed him that he did not . The collector then advised him to change his logo or he might confuse the knife @-@ buying public , as they would ask for Bowie knives instead of linerlock folders . Emerson agreed with this assessment , dropping the knife outline and the word " knives " from his stamp , using just his name in a half @-@ circle on the blade as a logo . This marking is known among collectors as the " Half @-@ Moon Logo " and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives . 
 These early knives sold for between $ 800 and $ 2 @,@ 000 each ; that , combined with his appearances at knife shows and write @-@ ups in knife magazines , helped Emerson gain status and credibility as a custom knifemaker . Once established as a serious and reputable maker , Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make — knives designed for use as opposed to show , specifically folding @-@ knives designed for combat . 
 = = Viper Knives = = 
 As a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed @-@ blade fighting knife in class , yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area , Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat . Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost , in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials . He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet ; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously . He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead @-@ blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives . The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength @-@ to @-@ weight ratio and corrosion resistance . 
 Emerson ground the blades of these knives from ATS @-@ 34 steel with a Rockwell hardness of 57 – 59 and made them thicker toward the tip , creating a stronger @-@ tipped blade than he had made previously . He bead @-@ blasted the blades as he did the liners and bolsters instead of rubbing or polishing them , giving them a matte finish as opposed to the mirror @-@ polished finish common on his earlier knives and other knives at the time . Emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose . The slender Viper 1 and smaller Viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer 's backup weapon . The Viper 5 was designed to be used by naval boat crews , as the handle was contoured with a rear brake so as to not slip from the user 's hand when wet and the Viper 3 was designed as a pure fighting knife with its 4 @-@ inch blade . 
 Emerson 's goal for this Viper line was to produce a working knife which would be more resistant to the elements and more durable than the " art knives " for which he had become known . These knives were created to satisfy the demand for a practical field @-@ grade combat knife which could be carried discreetly and accessed quickly . He sold these five models under the name " Viper Knives " and changed the logo on the blades to read the same . Emerson makes these models on a custom basis under the names <unk> – 5 , " MV " standing for " Model Viper " . 
 = = Specwar Knives = = 
 In 1986 individual Navy SEALs from a West Coast team had been using personally purchased custom fixed @-@ blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield . Hartsfield 's knives were hard ground from differentially heat @-@ treated A2 tool steel and are known for their distinctive chisel @-@ ground blades . More accurately , they are zero ground ; that is , the edge has no secondary bevel , minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes . Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel @-@ ground edge and had asked Hartsfield 's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives , which Hartsfield granted . When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife , he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson . 
 According to the SEALs ' requirements , the knife had to be corrosion resistant , designed for easy cleaning in the field , durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool , and capable as a weapon should the need arise . Emerson 's folding chisel @-@ ground " tantō " became the sixth model in his Viper series and , while a handful of prototypes were referred to as " Viper 6 " , the model was soon named the " CQC @-@ 6 " ( CQC refers to close @-@ quarters combat ) and was chosen by the SEALs for use . Ownership of a CQC @-@ 6 soon became something of a status symbol among members of various elite military units , including Navy SEALs , Army Special Forces , German GSG 9 , and British SAS . Because of this connection to the Special Warfare community , Emerson changed the name of his custom knife line to " Specwar Knives " , and in 1990 this new designation began appearing in the logo on his blades . 
 Other models followed in the Specwar line bearing the CQC Series moniker , including the CQC @-@ 7 which is another chisel @-@ ground tantō @-@ bladed folder similar to the CQC @-@ 6 but with a saber @-@ type handle shape . The CQC @-@ 8 ( " Banana Knife " ) was a folder inspired by Bob Taylor 's Warrior knife and William F. Moran 's ST @-@ 23 is used by British SAS troops . The knife has the distinction of being the first folding knife that was designed to be <unk> correct in both forward and reverse grip . Its users refer to it as " the finest fighting knife ever developed " . The CQC @-@ 9 ( " Eagle Knife " ) is a reverse @-@ curved <unk> blade developed as a backup weapon for an American law enforcement agency ; it has an opening hole in the blade licensed from knife manufacturer <unk> . Although Emerson has standard models for these custom knives which progress in order to <unk> , each one is made individually by hand . 
 = = <unk> the tactical knife = = 
 While not the first knifemaker to build what is known as a tactical folding knife , Emerson was one of several makers who popularized the concept of the handmade tactical folder in the 1980s . Emerson 's knives began appearing in the Rogue Warrior series of novels written by the founder of the US Navy 's SEAL Team Six , Richard Marcinko , at this time which helped fuel interest among collectors . 
 This surge in interest for Emerson 's knives soon became overwhelming . Although he had been making knives full @-@ time since 1994 , Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later . As Emerson watched his customers ' wait time expand from two years to seven , he realized that the demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them . The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies . 
 Emerson 's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for his <unk> model . According to Stephen Dick , the editor of Tactical Knives , this collaboration was a result of " the Navy deciding that only commercial designs would be considered due to failure of a previous custom knifemaker to deliver enough models to satisfy the need " . This model featured a one @-@ side chisel @-@ ground tantō blade almost 1 / 4 inch ( 6 @.@ 35 mm ) thick . Its handle was made from fiberglass @-@ reinforced nylon molded around a near @-@ full tang . Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath . The knife was originally a custom piece designed for Naval Special Warfare Group One , and this factory version was soon entered in the trials for the Navy SEALs knife in 1995 . Although it was not chosen by the Navy , Stephen Dick reported that a number of members of SEAL Team One privately purchased the knife and were disappointed it was not made the official blade . The Emerson @-@ Neeley <unk> knife won Blade Magazine 's 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award at the magazine 's Blade Show in Atlanta , Georgia , and that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City from May 24 to August 15 , 1995 . 
 In 1994 the president of Benchmade Knives , Les DeAsis , approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC @-@ 6 on a larger scale as a factory production model . Preferring to keep the CQC @-@ 6 as a custom @-@ only knife , Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his , the CQC @-@ 7 . 
 The Benchmade factory version was sold under the model name <unk> or <unk> depending on blade length . Other designations followed which denoted blade finish , manual or automatic opening , or partially serrated blade . The knife retained the profile of Emerson 's custom piece in addition to the ATS @-@ 34 steel and the titanium liners . However , on Benchmade 's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with <unk> fiberglass scales , the slotted screws were replaced by <unk> head screws , and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip @-@ down position . 
 Despite these changes the knife was true to Emerson 's original design , and even though it did not have the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson 's work at a lower price point and without the five @-@ year wait .

 " First folding tanto with liner lock and G @-@ 10 " <unk> . In February 1996 , Emerson and his wife , Mary , founded Emerson Knives , Inc . ( abbreviated as <unk> ) in Torrance , California to manufacture knives on a larger scale than he was then capable of . This new company would be a distinct entity from his Specwar custom knives , although several custom designs would make their way into the production lineup . Four years after starting this venture , Emerson sold an entire year 's worth of production in four hours at the SHOT ( Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade ) Show in January 2000 . 
 Emerson continued to collaborate with other companies on knife @-@ related projects as his own company grew . In some cases these collaborators had become his competition , such as Gerber Knives . In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies ' first automatic opening knife , the Gerber @-@ Emerson Alliance . In that same year , Emerson collaborated with SureFire <unk> by making an exclusive CQC @-@ 8 ( Banana Knife ) numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson @-@ marked Centurion C2 <unk> . In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco , the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company , to produce the CQC @-@ T Tomahawk . This tomahawk features a curved head machined from <unk> steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle . Although not made by Emerson , the tomahawk was designed by him . In 2007 , Emerson announced a collaboration with custom knifemaker and knife thrower Bobby Branton . The collaboration piece is a fixed @-@ blade knife designed primarily for knife throwing dubbed the <unk> : Branton @-@ Emerson Tactical Thrower . " CQC @-@ 6 is the most collectible knife in the world " <unk> 
 One of Emerson 's earliest production models , the Commander ( winner of Blade Magazine 's Overall Knife of the Year Award for 1999 ) , is a large recurve folding knife based on a special custom design , the <unk> @-@ M , that he had made for a West Coast Navy SEAL Team . The Commander has a hook on the spine of the blade ( originally designed as a blade catcher ) which , when snagged on the edge of the pocket or sheath , causes the knife blade to open as it is drawn . Due to its visual aesthetic , Emerson called this innovation the " Wave " and secured a patent for it in 1998 . Since another knife and tool company , Leatherman , had trademarked the name " Wave , " in March 1999 Emerson changed its name to the " wave @-@ shaped opening feature " . Emerson 's Wave made its way onto most of the knives in both the production and custom lines , with the exception of the Viper models . It is a required feature on all knives that Emerson supplies to military units , search and rescue units , and law enforcement agencies . 
 After a disastrous helicopter crash in 1999 resulting in the deaths of six Marines and one sailor , the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife . The KA @-@ BAR knives issued to the <unk> ( Special Boat Units ) had catastrophically failed to cut the Marines free from their webbing . 
 The Navy went to Emerson , who designed and fabricated a working prototype within 24 hours . They found that it met their needs , and the model was dubbed the " SARK " ( Search and Rescue Knife ) . The SARK is a folding knife with a <unk> @-@ style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them . The knife features Emerson 's Wave . Seeing another need in the police community , Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the " P @-@ SARK " , or Police Search And Rescue Knife . In 2005 , the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a <unk> on the back of the blade for use as a line @-@ cutter . Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the <unk> ( Navy Search And Rescue ) Knife . 
 In 1999 , NASA contracted Emerson to build a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station . Rather than design a new model from scratch , NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications , with one additional design requirement . The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline with the addition of a <unk> cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages . The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA . 
 On July 1 , 2000 , Emerson announced his semi @-@ retirement from custom knifemaking in order to concentrate on this new production company and to fill the thousands of outstanding orders for his custom work . He still makes custom knives available for sale at knife shows , but takes no orders for new custom work . Since 1995 the only way to get a new custom knife from Emerson himself is through a lottery held at knife shows where he is present . Depending on the size of the show , as many as several hundred potential buyers write their names on individual pieces of paper at his booth , and at a predetermined time a name is drawn . The winner gets a chance to buy one of the custom knives brought to the show . 
 In 2007 , Emerson branched out in a new direction , announcing he would manufacture twelve custom electric guitars per year . His first guitar debuted at Blade Magazine 's Blade Show in Atlanta in June 2007 . In 2008 , Emerson opened a clothing company called " Emerson Brand Apparel " specializing in MMA and casual clothing . In 2009 at the annual NRA Convention , Emerson announced a collaboration with custom pistol manufacturer Les Baer to produce a custom M1911 pistol built to Emerson 's specifications with a semi @-@ custom ( <unk> blade ) folding knife named the " CQC @-@ 45 " ( out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the pistol ) . In late 2009 , Emerson announced a collaboration with Spike 's Tactical to produce an M @-@ 4 Carbine based upon his specifications for training , chambered in .22 long rifle and in 5 @.@ 56 NATO ; with a matching folding knife designated the " CQC @-@ 22 " ( out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the rifle ) . 
 In September 2010 , Emerson announced a collaboration with Pro @-@ Tech Knives to produce an automatic opening version of the CQC @-@ 7 . In November 2010 , Emerson 's Roadhouse Knife won Knives Illustrated 's American Made Knife of 2010 – 2011 Award at the Spirit of Steel Show in Knoxville , TN . According to Emerson , the knife will be used as a prop on the Sons of Anarchy Television Show . 
 In January 2011 , at the SHOT ( Shooting , Hunting , Outdoor Trade ) Show in Las Vegas , NV , Emerson debuted a new knife model designed in collaboration with Kelly McCann known as the Canis .

 Ridley Scott 's 2001 film Black Hawk Down portrayed soldiers carrying Emerson folding knives in the hangar scene , and in Tears of the Sun the Kandahar model appeared on Bruce Willis ' character 's web gear , and other actors were seen with Emerson Police Utility Knives . Emerson <unk> , La Griffes , and Police Utility Knives are often used as weapons or rescue tools on the television show Burn Notice . Frank Castle used an Emerson <unk> to kill an opponent in one of the final scenes in The Punisher . Transporter 2 briefly showed an Emerson fixed @-@ blade Kandahar knife in the trunk of Jason Statham 's car along with other weapons as props . An Emerson La Griffe was featured in the 2007 film : Doomsday .

 Emerson 's knives are mentioned in mystery , spy , military , action , and adventure novels . At least seven of Richard Marcinko 's Rogue Warrior novels ( Red Cell , Green Team , Task Force Blue , Detachment Bravo , SEAL Force Alpha , Violence of Action and Holy Terror ) prominently make mention of Emerson 's knives ( CQC @-@ 6 or CQC @-@ 7 ) as a regularly carried piece of equipment . The protagonist , Marcinko , uses an Emerson CQC @-@ 6 or CQC @-@ 7 on various occasions . On page 175 of Task Force Blue , Marcinko remarks that his CQC @-@ 6 was a " personal gift from Ernie Emerson , himself " . 
 New York Times bestselling author David Morrell 's novel The Protector not only has the main character , a former Delta Force operator named Cavanaugh , using an Emerson CQC @-@ 7 knife , but the cover art itself is a photographic illustration of a blood @-@ stained Emerson CQC @-@ 7 . Cavanaugh uses the knife in combat as well as in many rigorous cutting chores . The author claims Emerson is " the best manufacturer of tactical knives " as well as a " top level blade instructor for elite military and law @-@ enforcement units " . In an interview with British E @-@ Zine Shots : The Crime and Mystery <unk> , Morrell indicated that he injured his collarbone during an Emerson knife @-@ fighting course while performing research for the novel . Morrell went on to include Emerson 's knives in his books Creepers and The Spy Who Came for Christmas . 
 Three of Marcus Wynne 's novels ( Warrior in the Shadows , No Other Option , Brothers in Arms ) feature use of Emerson 's knives by the main characters . The CQC @-@ 7 , Commander , and La Griffe are favored by the main characters and are used as defensive weapons throughout the books . The characters of S.M.

 = = Emerson Combat Systems = = 
 Emerson has developed a combatives system drawn upon his experience known as Emerson Combat Systems , which has been taught to hundreds of law enforcement agencies , members of the U.S. military , and civilians . 
 According to Emerson , the techniques are based upon the physical and instinctual laws that govern the survival instincts and physical function of a human being . This system is characterized by training as realistically as possible ( not training in workout gear for example ) and using flowing , dynamic concepts ( for example , integrated fighting and weapon transition with a strong emphasis placed on overall physical fitness . Emerson maintains he does not teach a " martial art " encumbered by ritual or sporting aspects but a combatives system where the goal is more than simple self @-@ defense . 
 Emerson has been consulted as a technical advisor to television and movie productions including National Geographic , specifically the program Fight Science , due in part to his position as the hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat instructor for Harry Humphries ' Global Studies Group Incorporated , a company that teaches police and military tactics to law enforcement agencies and film production crews . 
 As an author , Emerson has written over 30 articles on hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , knife fighting , history , and knifemaking for publications including Human Events , Blade Magazine , American Cop Magazine , Martial Arts Experts , Journal of Modern <unk> , Inside Kung @-@ Fu , Black Belt Magazine , Police Magazine , and American <unk> .

 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Patricia = 
 Hurricane Patricia was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere and the second @-@ most intense worldwide in terms of barometric pressure . It also featured the highest one @-@ minute maximum sustained winds ever recorded in a tropical cyclone . Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec in mid @-@ October 2015 , Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20 . Initial development was slow , with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification . The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia , the twenty @-@ fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season . Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22 . A well @-@ defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours — a near @-@ record pace . The magnitude of intensification was poorly forecast and both forecast models and meteorologists suffered from record @-@ high prediction errors . 
 On October 23 , two Hurricane Hunter missions both revealed the storm to have acquired maximum sustained winds of 205 mph ( 335 km / h ) and a pressure of 879 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 96 inHg ) . Since the peak intensity was assessed to have occurred between the missions , the National Hurricane Center ultimately estimated Patricia to have acquired winds of 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) and pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) . This ranked it just below Typhoon Tip of 1979 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record . Patricia 's exceptional intensity prompted the retirement of its name in April 2016 . Late on October 23 , Patricia made landfall in a significantly weakened state near Cuixmala , Jalisco . Despite weakening greatly , it was the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico with winds estimated at 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico induced dramatic weakening , faster than the storm had intensified . Within 24 hours of moving ashore , Patricia degraded into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter late on October 24 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 On October 11 , 2015 , an area of disturbed weather traversed Central America and emerged over the eastern Pacific Ocean . The disturbance moved slowly over the next few days , and coalesced into a Central American gyre — a broad monsoonal circulation . A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean Sea and eventually reached Central America on October 15 ; the two systems merged the following day near the Gulf of Tehuantepec . A concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event on the western side of the gyre , complimented by anticyclonic flow behind a cold front , enhanced vorticity and spurred the formation of an elongated area of low pressure on October 17 . The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the Yucatán Peninsula into the eastern Pacific . A large , disorganized area of convection — showers and thunderstorms — accompanied the system , increasing in coverage substantially throughout the day . A strong pulse in the Madden – Julian oscillation — a propagating climate pattern associated with increased tropical cyclogenesis — may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development . 
 Moving south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on October 18 , the system consolidated and developed a small , defined circulation . Associated convection became more concentrated around its center . Another gap wind event soon impacted the system , temporarily delaying development of the disturbance into a tropical depression . The low soon relocated to the northeast , aligning itself east of the gap wind event which aided in development . A small , well @-@ defined circulation formed by early on October 20 within a broader cyclonic circulation . With increasing deep convection , the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression , assigned the identifier Twenty @-@ E , by 06 : 00 UTC . Upon its designation , the depression was situated roughly 205 mi ( 335 km ) south @-@ southeast of Salina Cruz , Mexico . 
 = = Rapid intensification = = 
 Located south of a mid @-@ level ridge and the continuing gap wind event , the nascent depression moved slowly west @-@ southwest on October 20 . Initial environmental conditions were modestly favorable , allowing for steady intensification . The depression achieved tropical storm status by 00 : 00 UTC on October 21 ; the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) assigned it the name Patricia accordingly . Throughout much of October 21 , Patricia moved through a region of drier , more stable air and over relatively cool sea surface temperatures . Both of these factors served to delay intensification of the cyclone . The system unraveled substantially , with banding features dissipating and the low @-@ level circulation becoming poorly defined . Once clear of the hindering factors , convection blossomed over Patricia late on October 21 and a central dense overcast formed over the center . Simultaneously , the storm accelerated west @-@ northwest . 
 Exceptionally favorable atmospheric conditions , consisting of little wind shear , anomalously high sea surface temperatures of 87 to 88 ° F ( 30 @.@ 5 to 31 ° C ) , and high moisture levels yielded an environment highly conducive to rapid intensification . Consequently , Patricia commenced explosive intensification late on October 21 . Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00 : 00 UTC on October 22 , featuring prominent outflow , well @-@ defined banding features , and a developing eye . Upon becoming a hurricane , Patricia was located 230 mi ( 370 km ) south of Acapulco , Mexico . In the following 12 hours , a well @-@ defined 12 mi ( 19 km ) wide eye formed within a ring of intense convection — with cloud tops of − 80 to − 90 ° C ( − 112 to − 130 ° F ) — forming " an almost perfectly symmetric [ central dense overcast ] " . Data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category 4 status on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18 : 00 UTC ; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) alongside a barometric pressure of 957 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 26 inHg ) at this time . 
 = = = Forecast errors = = = 
 The rapid intensification of Patricia was well @-@ anticipated but poorly forecast . Meteorologists at the NHC indicated the possibility of such in the system 's first advisory as a tropical depression . They noted the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core . Just before the onset of rapid intensification , the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors . This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency 's forecast . Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway . 
 At 03 : 00 UTC on October 22 , the NHC forecast Patricia to achieve major hurricane status in 36 hours ; less than 15 hours later , the system exceeded their forecast peak . Strengthening into a Category 5 hurricane was not forecast at all until Patricia had already reached such intensity , although in the intermediate advisory immediately before Patricia 's upgrade to Category 5 , the NHC noted that " Patricia could become a category 5 hurricane overnight " . This trend continued throughout the rapid intensification period , resulting in some of the largest errors on record through 48 hours ; they were the worst @-@ ever for the Eastern Pacific since the NHC took over operations for the basin in 1988 . All forecast models saw enormous errors , most of which performed worse than the official NHC forecasts . No model accurately prognosticated the magnitude nor rate of the intensification . The <unk> — an output from the European Centre for Medium @-@ Range Weather Forecasts — saw the largest average error with 98 @.@ 5 mph ( 158 @.@ 5 km / h ) at 48 hours . 
 = = Peak strength = = 
 During the overnight hours of October 22 – 23 , Patricia turned northwest and decelerated slightly as it reached the western edge of the mid @-@ level ridge . Rapid development continued into October 23 , with the hurricane reaching Category 5 status by 00 : 00 UTC , with winds estimated at 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . Convection cooled even further , with cloud tops colder than − 130 ° F ( − 90 ° C ) surrounding an 8 mi ( 13 km ) wide eye by 03 : 00 UTC . In a 24 @-@ hour span , Patricia 's winds increased by 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) and its central pressure fell by 95 mbar ( hPa ; 2 @.@ 81 inHg ) . Around 06 : 00 UTC , an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft measured flight @-@ level winds of 221 mph ( 356 km / h ) and the aircraft 's stepped frequency microwave radiometer ( <unk> ) observed surface winds of 210 mph ( 340 km / h ) . Furthermore , the final dropsonde observation from that mission at about 06 : 45 UTC indicated a central pressure of 879 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 96 inHg ) . Rapid development continued after the aircraft left the hurricane , as the three pressure readings during the mission indicated that the pressure fell at a rate 7 mbar ( hPa ; 0 @.@ 21 inHg ) per hour . Their findings also revealed an extraordinarily tight pressure gradient of 24 mbar ( hPa ; 0 @.@ 71 inHg ) per nautical mile , among the steepest gradients on record . 
 Based on continued improvement of the hurricane 's satellite appearance and the aforementioned pressure drop during the early morning reconnaissance mission , Patricia is assessed to have achieved its peak intensity around 12 : 00 UTC on October 23 ; the storm was situated about 150 mi ( 240 km ) southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . Maximum winds are estimated at 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) alongside a pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) , making Patricia the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone ever observed . It is possible that Patricia exceeded the all @-@ time record of 870 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 69 inHg ) set by Typhoon Tip in 1979 given the rate of deepening observed during the early morning mission ; due to a lack of direct observation at the time of Patricia 's peak , no concrete determination of such can be made . The violent , compact core of Patricia was roughly 25 mi ( 40 km ) wide with the radius of maximum winds extending only 7 mi ( 11 km ) . 
 Little change in strength took place for the next six hours ; a shortwave trough crossing the Baja California Peninsula turned Patricia to the northeast and induced acceleration . Another reconnaissance mission around 18 : 00 UTC recorded a central pressure of 879 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 96 inHg ) . The aircraft was battered by severe turbulence ( the result of updrafts and downdrafts ) and the crew experienced maximum g @-@ forces of + 3 @.@ 0 and <unk> . 
 = = Landfall and dissipation = = 
 Late on October 23 , radar imagery depicted the formation of a secondary outer eyewall , indicative of an eyewall replacement cycle . By 20 : 30 UTC , the final pass by reconnaissance , the hurricane 's flight @-@ level winds fell by 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and its central pressure rose at 8 mbar ( hPa ; 0 @.@ 24 inHg ) per hour . Coinciding with the eyewall replacement cycle was an increase in southwesterly wind shear , a factor that further accelerated Patricia 's degradation . The hurricane 's eye soon became cloud @-@ filled and rapid weakening ensued at an unprecedented pace . 
 At 23 : 00 UTC , the cyclone made landfall at Cuixmala in the municipality of La Huerta , Jalisco — about 55 mi ( 85 km ) west @-@ northwest of Manzanillo — with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and an estimated pressure of 932 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 49 inHg ) . This made Patricia the strongest hurricane to strike Mexico 's Pacific coast , exceeding an unnamed storm in 1959 and Madeline in 1976 ( the latter of which has not been reanalyzed ) . An automated station in Cuixmala measured a pressure of 934 @.@ 2 mbar ( hpa ; 27 @.@ 54 inHg ) . Storm chasers in Emiliano Zapata , just inside the eye of Patricia , measured a pressure of 937 @.@ 8 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 70 inHg ) . Their observations also indicated a pressure gradient of 11 mbar ( hPa ; 0 @.@ 32 inHg ) per nautical mile . Operationally , Patricia was thought to have made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) and a pressure of 920 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) . 
 Patricia 's winds at landfall are relatively uncertain , and the 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) value is based upon the <unk> @-@ Zehr @-@ Courtney pressure @-@ wind relationship and an extrapolation of a 54 mbar ( hPa ; 1 @.@ 59 inHg ) filling using the Dvorak Technique . An additional equation stemming from work by Willoughby ( 1993 ) yielded a landfall intensity of 147 mph ( 237 km / h ) . A NOAA automated weather station at the Chamela @-@ Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve , at an elevation of 280 ft ( 85 m ) , recorded sustained winds of 185 mph ( 298 km / h ) and a maximum gust of 211 mph ( 340 km / h ) . Further raw data from this station indicated unrealistically high sustained winds of 266 mph ( 428 km / h ) and a maximum gust of 1 @,@ 138 mph ( 1 @,@ 831 km / h ) . Based on the station 's distance from Patricia 's eye , outside the radius of maximum winds , the observations from this station are considered unreliable . The highest reliably measured winds of 98 mph ( 158 km / h ) occurred in Pista between 22 : 30 and 23 : 00 UTC on October 23 before the anemometer failed . 
 Even faster weakening ensued through October 24 as the hurricane traversed the Sierra Madre mountains ; its eye disappeared from satellite imagery within hours of moving ashore . The system weakened below hurricane strength by 03 : 00 UTC as it passed west of Guadalajara . Patricia accelerated inland between a trough over Northwestern Mexico and the ridge over the Gulf of Mexico . Convection dramatically decreased in organization and the low- and mid- to upper @-@ level circulation centers of the cyclone soon decoupled . The system degraded into a tropical depression by 12 : 00 UTC as little organized convection remained , and the storm dissipated shortly thereafter over central Mexico . <unk> by the mountains of Mexico , the mid- to upper @-@ level circulation of Patricia , accompanied by considerable moisture , continued northeast and interacted with a cold front over the western Gulf of Mexico . The new system produced flooding rains across large areas of Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas .

 With maximum sustained winds of 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) , Hurricane Patricia is the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone ever observed , just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 69 inHg ) . It is also the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere . It exceeded the previous sustained wind record of 190 mph ( 305 km / h ) set by Hurricane Allen in 1980 and the pressure record of 882 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 05 inHg ) set by Hurricane Wilma in 2005 , both in the Atlantic basin . In the Eastern Pacific basin , north of the equator and east of the International Dateline , the previous basin record @-@ holder was Hurricane Linda in 1997 with winds of 185 mph ( 295 km / h ) and a pressure of 902 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 64 inHg ) . Reconnaissance also found a pressure gradient of 24 mbar ( hPa ; 0 @.@ 71 inHg ) per nautical mile early on October 23 , among the steepest gradients ever observed in a tropical cyclone . 
 On a global scale , Patricia 's one @-@ minute maximum sustained winds rank as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated globally in a tropical cyclone , surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 , although the intensity of Haiyan was only estimated via satellite imagery ( T8.0 , the highest rating on the Dvorak scale ) . Since no aircraft reconnaissance was available during Haiyan , the record is uncertain and comparing the intensities of the two storms is problematic . According to the World Meteorological Organization , Typhoon Nancy of 1961 produced the highest sustained winds on record at 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) ; however , it is widely accepted that Western Pacific reconnaissance during the 1940s to 1960s overestimated cyclone intensity and Nancy 's record is considered questionable . The most powerful wind gust produced by a tropical cyclone , as well as the highest non @-@ tornadic winds ever recorded , is still retained by Cyclone Olivia in 1996 : 253 mph ( 407 km / h ) was observed on Barrow Island , Western Australia . 
 The magnitude of Patricia 's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed . In a 24 @-@ hour period , 06 : 00 – 06 : 00 UTC October 22 – 23 , its maximum sustained winds increased from 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) to 205 mph ( 335 km / h ) . This represents a record increase of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . During the same period , Patricia 's central pressure fell by 95 mbar ( hPa ; 2 @.@ 81 inHg ) . This fell just short of the world @-@ record intensification set by Typhoon Forrest in 1983 , which featured a pressure drop of 100 mbar ( hPa ; 2 @.@ 95 inHg ) in just under 24 hours . With a pressure of 932 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 52 inHg ) , Patricia is the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record . The previous record was 941 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 73 inHg ) set by Hurricane Odile in 2014 . Similarly , the hurricane featured the fastest weakening while still over water in NHC 's area of responsibility , with a pressure rise of 54 mbar ( hPa ; 1 @.@ 59 inHg ) in the five hours before it made landfall . Furthermore , a dropsonde observed a 700 mbar height temperature of 32 @.@ 2 ° C ( 90 @.@ 0 ° F ) in the eye of Patricia . This is the warmest temperature ever observed in a tropical cyclone 's eye worldwide . 
 = The Story of Marie and Julien = 
 The Story of Marie and Julien ( French : Histoire de Marie et Julien ) is a 2003 French drama film directed by Nouvelle Vague film maker Jacques Rivette . The film slowly develops from a drama about blackmail into a dark , yet tender , supernatural love story between Marie and Julien , played by Emmanuelle Béart and Jerzy Radziwiłowicz . Anne Brochet plays the blackmailed Madame X. Béart had previously worked with Rivette in La Belle Noiseuse , as had Radziwiłowicz in Secret défense . The cinematographer was William Lubtchansky . 
 The film was originally going to be made in 1975 as part of a series of four films , but shooting was abandoned after two days , only to be revisited by Rivette 27 years later . It premièred at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2003 and had a cinema release in France , Belgium and the UK . It was shown in competition at the San Sebastian International Film Festival and was nominated for the Prix Louis @-@ Delluc . Some critics found the film over long , slow , and pretentious , while others said it was moving , intelligent , and among Rivette 's best work . The film 's subject led to comparisons to Vertigo , The Sixth Sense , and The Others . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Julien ( <unk> ) is a middle @-@ aged clockmaker who lives alone with his cat in a large house in the Paris suburbs . Julien is blackmailing ' Madame X ' ( Brochet ) who is importing fake antique Chinese silks , and may have murdered her sister . By chance , he meets Marie ( Béart ) , a beautiful young woman he last saw a year ago , and they begin a passionate relationship . Though elusive , Marie agrees to move in with him ; she acts strangely at times and appears absent . A mystery connects Marie to Madame X 's dead sister and in uncovering Marie 's secret Julien risks losing her . The film is separated into four parts , named to reflect the narrative perspective . 
 Julien : Julien dreams of Marie , whom he met just over a year before at a party , and with whom he would have begun a relationship but for them both having partners . He immediately runs into her on the street as she is running for her bus and he is off to meet Madame X. They agree to meet again , but Marie fails to appear and he returns home to find Madame X waiting for him against their agreement , so he raises his price tenfold . Madame X returns the next day to try to bargain , and asks for a letter back that he does not have . Marie invites him to her place for dinner , where Julien tells her his girlfriend ran away with another man and Marie says her boyfriend Simon died six months ago . They have sex , but in the morning Marie has checked out of her apartment . Julien returns home to find that his house has been ransacked . He tries to find her by ringing her old boss , then tracks her down when an unknown woman calls to tell him the hotel Marie is staying at . Julien visits her there , and Marie agrees to move in with him . 
 Julien et Marie : Marie makes herself at home , trying on the clothes of Julien 's old girlfriend , exploring the house , and watching him at work . Their lovemaking is passionate , but Marie 's behaviour is unusual . She is sometimes cold or trance @-@ like , at one point reciting words in an unidentified language , and she is physically detached and unaware of the time — Julien corrects her " <unk> " to " <unk> " . She is jealous of his ex , compulsively decorates and rearranges a room in his attic , feels compelled to act out her dreams , and does not bleed when scratched — something she keeps from Julien . She sees a girl in her dreams who shows her a " forbidden sign " with her hands . Marie helps Julien in his blackmailing , and after meeting Madame X , who only knows of Marie as " l 'autre personne " , Marie is handed a letter by someone who says she is Madame X 's sister ( Bettina Kee ) ; she is the girl Marie dreamed of before . 
 Marie et Julien : The letter is from Madame X 's sister Adrienne to Madame X. Julien meets Madame X again , and she tells him her sister killed herself by drowning six months before . He cannot understand who gave Marie the letter , but she insists that her sister left the letter to frame her and although dead she is " reliving " ( a revenant ) — and Marie is also . Adrienne — who though dead still appears and speaks to her — has told Madame X that Marie is " like me " . He thinks she is mad . Julien becomes frustrated at Marie spending so much time alone in the attic . When she finally shows him the room , she says she does not know what it is for . She leaves before Julien wakes and checks into another hotel . He rings Marie 's old boss who suggests talking to Marie 's friend Delphine ; Delphine says that Marie 's relationship with Simon drove Marie mad and ended their friendship . 
 Marie : Julien visits Marie and Simon 's old apartment , where the letting agent shows him a room that Julien chillingly recognises — it is identical to the room Marie has prepared . This is where Marie hanged herself , trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row . Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose , feeling she has to hang herself again . Julien carries her downstairs , and they make love again . She leaves to meet Adrienne , who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die . They agree they do not know the rules of their situation . Returning , Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself in a desperate attempt to join her . He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist ; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut . Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her , but he says that all he wants is for her to be there . Marie slowly covers her face with her hands — " the forbidden sign " — and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding . Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over , confused by her enquiries about " l 'autre personne " . Madame X burns the letter , freeing Adrienne . Marie cries while watching Julien sleep , and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds . Julien wakes and asks who she is ; she replies that she is " the one he loved " . He doubts it as she 's " not his type " , but she says with a smile to give her a little time .

 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 Like Rivette 's earlier film La Belle Noiseuse , the main themes are romantic longing , impermanence , and identity , but this film adds the themes of mortality , chance , and destiny , and motifs are repeated from Rivette 's Celine and Julie Go Boating . The name of Julien 's cat , Nevermore , evokes Poe 's The Raven and its similar themes of death and longing . Julien 's work as a clockmaker , literally trying to repair time , is an obvious metaphor , and the film is also timeless , giving no indication of when it is set . The blackmail sub @-@ plot is a device to help tell the central love story between Marie and Julien and to explain Marie 's situation ; Julien is an unlikely blackmailer and Madame X 's benevolence towards him is surprising . The plot features dream logic impinging on reality : Senses of Cinema highlighted the role of " outlandish chance " and Film Comment noted the feeling that the characters are inventing or re @-@ enacting the narrative . Marie may be aware that she is part of a narrative , but she still lacks control over her fate . Michael Atkinson believed that Rivette was working in the " border world between narrative meaning and cinematic artifice " . 
 The emotional distance of the characters and the intellectual and artificial @-@ seeming , quasi @-@ theatrical dialogue is deliberate , depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation . The chasm between Marie and Julien , due to his <unk> and her ghostly nature , is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker . Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill @-@ suited and for the viewer to question the relationship ; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers . Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien , and that he literally wakes up to her existence only at the very end of the film . 
 Finally revealed to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth @-@ century French fantasy literature , the film uses the conventions of the genre — that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts — and openly details these conventions . Marie and Adrienne 's ' lives ' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose , each with only the memory of her suicide and her last emotions remaining . Julien , like the audience , is eventually confronted with Marie 's nightmare of repetition . Elements of the horror genre are used , not to scare but to explore memory and loss . To stay with Marie , Julien first has to forget about her , and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning . Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy . Marie 's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death , and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause . The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie , Our Day Will Come , that represents love as a pledge , the only music used in the film . 
 There is an aesthetic focus on Béart 's body , Julien telling Marie that " I love your neck , your arms , your shoulders , your mouth , your stomach , your eyes -- I love everything . " The focus is more than erotic as it symbolises Marie 's fight for <unk> . The film includes Rivette 's first ever sex scenes , one of them arranged by Béart . The five candid and emotionally charged sex scenes focus on their upper bodies and faces , and on their erotic monologues that employ elements of fairy tale , horror , and sadomasochism . 
 Béart is given an ethereal quality by Lubtchansky 's cinematography and lighting , and she subtly portrays Marie 's detachment and vulnerability . In the latter part of the film Béart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan , showing Marie 's ageing and angst . Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part . Radziwiłowicz 's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character 's initial dislikeable nature . Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Original shoot = = = 
 Rivette originally began to make Marie et Julien , as it was then titled , in 1975 with producer Stéphane <unk> as part of a series of four films he first called Les filles du feu and later Scènes de la Vie Parallele . Rivette said in 2003 that the film was based on the true story of a woman who committed suicide . He first shot <unk> ( fr : <unk> ) in March – April and <unk> ( fr : <unk> ) in May , although the latter was not released , and the fourth film , a musical comedy meant to star Anna Karina and Jean Marais , was never shot . Filming began on Marie et Julien that August , with Albert Finney and Leslie Caron in the lead roles and Brigitte <unk> as Madame X , but after two days Rivette gave up filming due to nervous exhaustion . He later used the names of the lovers , Marie and Julien , in his 1981 film Le Pont du Nord . 
 = = = Revisiting the screenplay = = = 
 After Rivette had later success with La Belle Noiseuse and Va <unk> in the 1990s , he revisited his older unproduced screenplays . With Hélène <unk> , he published in book form three of his " phantom films " including Marie et Julien in 2002 . He decided to film Marie et Julien ; a script had never been written and the footage had been lost , but cryptic notes by his assistant Claire Denis that had been kept by Lubtchansky ( who had also been cinematographer in 1975 ) were enough to work from . The original screenplay included a speaking " polyglot cat " , characters whose names change , a " suicide room " similar to The Seventh Victim , " Madame X " , and an unknown " forbidden gesture " that the notes stated : " Do not forget " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Rivette worked with scriptwriters Pascal <unk> and Christine Laurent using an automatic writing approach that involved writing the script day by day ; the actors and filmmakers did not know the direction of the story in advance of each day 's filming . Eurimages provided € 420 @,@ 000 of funding in July 2002 , and the film was shot that autumn and winter . Rivette immediately thought of Béart , who starred in La Belle Noiseuse , to play the carnal Marie . Béart has said that " Of all the films I 've made , this was the one which most disturbed people very close to me . They said : ' It 's almost as though the Emmanuelle we know was up there on the screen . ' . " Béart 's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended . 
 = = = Direction = = = 
 The film illustrates Rivette 's view that films involve game @-@ playing , day @-@ dreaming and paranoid fantasy . He leaves aside the usual devices of the horror genre — no music , shock sound effects , special effects , or gore — evoking feelings and scenes verbally rather than showing them , but he does employ Hitchcockian " MacGuffins " such as chance encounters , " clues , " and the blackmail plot @-@ line . The use of dream @-@ like sequences at the start and end of the film was influenced by Rivette 's 1985 film <unk> , an adaptation of Wuthering Heights . Some of the dialogue that was in the original notes was read as though quoting . 
 Glenn Kenny notes that the " calm precision " of the mise en scène in the opening dream sequence " put [ him ] under such a powerful spell " that it lasted the whole film . Throughout the film , everyday sounds are amplified by a lack of music , and the film uses sweeping long shots , and several incidental scenes of Julien working , talking with his cat , and of the characters sleeping . Slant Magazine commented that the cat is the film 's most interesting character , and Philippa Hawker of The Age notes that " this has one of the best sequences involving a cat on film . " The camera follows the cat and films it looking directly at the camera , giving a sense of artistic freedom and spontaneity . 
 The cinematography shows Rivette 's interest in visual texture . The colours are natural , except in certain scenes like the initial dream sequence that are filmed in vivid colours . The lighting when Marie is arranging the attic room changes from shadow to warm light when she places an oil lamp on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly , introducing a supernatural element that contrasts with the realism of the rest of the film . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Critics ' responses were mixed : some found the film evocative and powerful , whereas others saw it as slow and frustrating . Guy Austin writing in Scope noted that " bodily reactions are not part of critical reactions to [ the film ] . In both press and online , the head governs the body in reactions to Rivette . " Rivette had said before the release that " This I know in advance – whether it is good or not , some people will love it and others will hate it . " 
 It was nominated for the 2003 Prix Louis @-@ Delluc . Senses of Cinema suggested that it is Rivette 's most important work since his 1974 film Celine and Julie Go Boating and saw it as " a film about filmmaking " , including it in their favourite films of 2004 . DVD Verdict concluded that " it is not only intelligent , but willing to assume the same of its audience " . Glenn Kenny rated it as his favourite film of the decade , and film curator Miriam Bale writing in Slant Magazine included it in her ten most enduring films of the decade . Film Comment was equally taken with the film , stating that " what 's most remarkable about the film is how moving it is finally , how much is at stake after <unk> Rivette has done before prepares you for the emotional undertow that exerts itself in The Story of Marie and Julien 's final scenes . " LA Weekly described the film as " elegant and unsettling " ; The Age called it " quietly mysterious and haunting " and " heartrending " . 
 Peter Bradshaw was disappointed , arguing that " All the story 's power is allowed to leak away by the deliberative heaviness with which Rivette pads through his 150 @-@ minute narrative , with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis . " Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock 's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau 's Orphée , but called it " surprisingly flat and <unk> " . The New York Times also found it " dry and overdetermined , " and Time Out complained that it " never supplies the <unk> expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story . " Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others , but said that " its glacially slow pace will frustrate all but the most patient " . ( Rivette said when promoting the film that " I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn 't challenge everything that went before it . You can see it again , which I did , and it 's a second film that 's just as logical as the first one . But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless . " ) " An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art @-@ house audiences " was Empire 's wry take . The Digital Fix argued that Rivette 's direction resulted in a product that " if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master , is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness " . Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was " a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable , ultimately unfulfilling ghost story " .

 The film was ignored by both Cannes and Venice , then premièred at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2003 . It was shown in competition at the San Sebastian International Film Festival later that month , as well as at the 2004 Melbourne International Film Festival and the 2004 International Film Festival Rotterdam , among others . The film opened in France and Belgium on 12 November 2003 ; that night 239 people watched the film in Paris .

 " I Love Lisa " is the fifteenth episode of The Simpsons ' fourth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 11 , 1993 . In the episode , Lisa gives Ralph Wiggum a Valentine 's Day card when she sees that he has not received any . Ralph reads too much into Lisa 's gesture and , much to Lisa 's dismay , relentlessly pursues her with affection . Lisa snaps at Ralph and angrily tells him they are not together and that she never liked him . Heartbroken , Ralph channels his feelings into his performance as George Washington in the school 's President 's Day pageant . After a thunderous applause from the audience , he is able to accept Lisa as just a friend . 
 Frank Mula wrote the episode , and Wes Archer served as director . Michael Carrington guest @-@ starred as Rex .

The episode was well received by critics ; Entertainment Weekly placed the episode twelfth on their top 25 The Simpsons episodes list . The episode received a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 9 and was the highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . The staff received an angry letter from a Vietnam veteran because of a flashback scene depicting the fatal shooting of a Vietnam soldier .

 On Valentine 's Day in Springfield , Lisa 's class at the Springfield Elementary School construct paper mailboxes for the Valentine cards they are about to receive . When Ralph does not get any cards and breaks down in tears , Lisa hastily gives him a card out of sympathy . Ralph immediately cheers up , and develops a romantic interest in her . Ralph begins to annoy Lisa at every turn . Lisa tries to escape the situation by telling Ralph she is not ready to be romantic , but Ralph uses his position as Chief Wiggum 's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown 's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special , as well as a leading part for himself in a President 's Day pageant in which Lisa also stars . Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington . 
 With Homer having convinced Lisa that nothing can go wrong at Krusty 's show , Lisa and Ralph go together . On live air , Krusty begins interviewing audience members , and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is the love of his life and that he intends to marry her . Angry , Lisa snaps , stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would . Later at home , Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt . Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph 's feelings . 
 On the night of the Presidents ' Day pageant , Lisa tries to apologize to Ralph , but he ignores her to focus on his role . Ralph proves to be a remarkably effective and eloquent actor , gaining the approval of the audience . Lisa approaches Ralph after the performance and apologizes for her actions . He accepts and she gives him a new card with a picture of a bee on it , reading " Let 's Bee Friends " . Ralph laughs at the pun and happily accepts the offer of friendship .

 This was the first episode Frank Mula wrote for The Simpsons . Mula had previously worked with Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon at another Gracie Films show . This was the first season four episode that Wes Archer directed . Jeff Martin and Mula wrote the music for the President 's Day pageant . Michael Carrington guest @-@ stars in the episode as Rex , the boy who auditions for the role of George Washington but is beaten by Ralph . 
 The story of " I Love Lisa " originated from a personal episode of Al Jean 's life ; when Jean was in third grade , he received a valentine from a girl that read " I Choo @-@ Choo @-@ Choose You " . Years later , Jean wondered if the girl had really liked him . He told writing partner Mike Reiss about it and they thought it could be an idea for an episode where Lisa could give such a valentine to Ralph Wiggum , who would then take it too far . At that time , Ralph and Chief Wiggum were not established as being related . Jean thought it would be funny if Ralph was Wiggum 's son , considering both characters are " fat and dumb " . A technique the staff used to come up with stories and ideas was to think " what holiday haven 't we done on The Simpsons , or done lately ? " . As they had done several Halloween and Christmas episodes before , the staff liked the idea of doing a Valentine 's Day episode . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The songs " Monster Mash " ( by Bobby " Boris " Pickett ) and " Break On Through ( To the Other Side ) " ( by The Doors ) are featured in the episode . The orchestral version of Tony Bennett 's " Stranger in Paradise " can be heard in an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon . Homer 's conscience , which tells him that stealing is wrong , speaks with the voice of the fictional character Droopy . During the re @-@ enactment of the Abraham Lincoln assassination at the school pageant , Bart says " Hasta la vista , Abie " in reference to the film Terminator 2 : Judgment Day . The scene of Chief Wiggum sitting behind Krusty at an adult movie theater and Krusty thinking he is about to be arrested is a reference to Paul Reubens ' arrest for masturbating at a pornographic movie theater in Sarasota , Florida . 
 One of the clips from Krusty 's early TV shows features Robert Frost reading the first lines of his poem Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening .

 In its original broadcast , " I Love Lisa " finished eighteenth in the ratings for the week of February 6 to February 12 , 1993 , with a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 9 . The episode was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . Since airing , it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics . Entertainment Weekly 's Dalton Ross said the episode was both touching and humorous . He added that in the scene where Bart runs a videotape in slow motion to show Lisa how " you can actually pin @-@ point the second when [ Ralph Wiggum 's ] heart rips in half " , the audience does not really know " whether you 're shedding tears of laughter , empathy , or both — you just know that it 's damn good any way you slice it . " The Arizona Republic 's Bill Goodykoontz named the episode one of his five favorites and highlighted Ralph 's line " and my doctor said I wouldn 't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there " as one of the best lines in the history of the show . In a review of The Simpsons season four , Lyndsey Shinoda of Video Store cited " Brother from the Same Planet " and " I Love Lisa " among her " personal favorites " from the season . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , said their favorite scenes from the episode include Principal Skinner 's flashback to Valentine 's Day in Vietnam , the scene in which Chief Wiggum chases a duck to get his badge back , and the one where Bart and Milhouse play John Wilkes Booth and Abraham Lincoln at the school pageant . They added that those scenes were " just the icing on the cake of the main plot .

 When Principal Skinner tells the children at school that Valentine 's Day is not a joke ( due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults ) , he has a flashback in which he is sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969 . On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz . Skinner sees Johnny , one of his army friends , holding a Valentine card and asks him , " Sending your chick a Valentine ? " , to which Johnny replies " Yep " , right before he is shot to death . Cutting back to the present , Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny 's name in anguish , to which a perplexed Bart states " Cool ! I broke his brain . " After the episode aired , a Vietnam veteran sent in a letter to the show that read , " I was watching the Valentine 's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback . Do you really think this was funny , this horrible experience ? " The staff ignored the letter and , as Wes Archer pointed out , the scene was " an obvious " reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef ( Frederic Forrest ) and Mr. Clean ( Laurence Fishburne ) . In contrast , Mark Groening — the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran — " loved " the sequence as well as the episode .

 The Giant Dipper is a historic wooden roller coaster located at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk , an amusement park in Santa Cruz , California . It took 47 days to build at a cost of $ 50 @,@ 000 . It opened on May 17 , 1924 , and replaced the Thompson 's Scenic Railway . With a height of 70 feet ( 21 m ) and a speed of 55 miles per hour ( 89 km / h ) , it is one of the most popular wooden roller coasters in the world . As of 2012 , over 60 million people have ridden the Giant Dipper since its opening . The ride has received several awards such as being named a National Historic Landmark , a Golden Age Coaster award , and a Coaster Landmark award ; it has been ranked annually in Mitch Hawker 's Best Wooden roller coaster poll . 
 = = History = = 
 The Thompson 's Scenic Railway was built on the site of Giant Dipper in 1908 as the longest roller coaster in the United States . In October 1923 , manager R.L. Cardiff and Walter Loof began negotiations to build a new ride to replace the Scenic Railway . The price was set at $ 50 @,@ 000 , $ 15 @,@ 000 more than the Scenic Railway . In January 1924 , the permit to build the Giant Dipper was granted to Arthur Loof . He wanted to create a ride that had " the thrill of a plunge down a mine shaft , a balloon ascent , a parachute jump , airplane acrobatics , a cyclone , a toboggan ride , and a ship in a storm . " The Scenic Railway began to be demolished in January 1924 to make room for the Giant Dipper . It took 5 months to demolish the Scenic Railway and construct the Giant Dipper . The actual construction of the Giant Dipper took 47 days . The ride opened to the public for the first time on May 17 , 1924 . The ride had a few incidents over the years in which three people have died . 
 In 1974 , the ride received a new coat of paint with Victorian @-@ style architecture around the station . In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , the Giant Dipper was almost completely untouched . The ride was closed for about a month to be inspected . The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake . In 2002 , the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider . Ten years after the 50 millionth rider , the park celebrated the Giant Dipper 's 60 millionth rider on July 27 , 2012 . The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event . The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes . 
 The Giant Dipper was built by Arthur Looff and designed by Frederick Church . It required 327 @,@ 000 feet ( 100 @,@ 000 m ) of lumber , 743 @,@ 000 nails , and 24 @,@ 000 bolts to construct . The lumber was provided by Homer T. Maynard Lumber , and the 70 horsepower motor , which is still used today , was provided by Santa Cruz Electric . The concrete was done by T.F. Costello , and the steel work was done by Berger and Carter .

 The first death on Giant Dipper occurred four months after it debuted , on September 21 . A 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy fell from the ride while standing up near the end of the ride . The emergency brake was applied , but the boy fell head first onto the track and was crushed by the roller coaster train . Other fatalities also occurred in 1940 and 1970 . Several modifications have been made to the trains as a result .

 After departing from the station , the train immediately enters a tunnel . After going through some drops and turns in the tunnel , the train emerges at the base of the lift hill . Once climbing 70 feet ( 21 m ) to the top , the train drops 65 feet ( 20 m ) , reaching a top speed of 55 miles per hour ( 89 km / h ) . The train then rises up into a banked turn to the left . Riders then go through two hills next to the lift hill followed by a turnaround that is positioned over the tunnel at the beginning of the ride . The train then travels over three small hills situated next to the lift hill followed by another turnaround . Riders then go through three more small hills and enter the final brake run .

 The Giant Dipper currently operates with two trains with six cars per train . Riders are arranged two across in two rows for a total of 24 riders per train . The trains were built by Dana Morgan from D.H. Morgan Manufacturing . When the Giant Dipper opened , it ran with three trains , each with ten cars . Over time , the trains have been redesigned several times with changes to the restraint system . However , they are almost unchanged since they opened . The trains have changed colors several times since the ride opened .

 The wooden track is approximately 2 @,@ 640 feet ( 800 m ) in length , and the height of the lift is approximately 70 feet ( 21 m ) . The track is colored red with white supports .

 In the early 1970s , the Giant Dipper became the last " classic roller coaster " between Vancouver , British Columbia and San Diego , California . It is only one of three Church rides to still operate . The other two are Dragon Coaster at Playland Park and Giant Dipper at Belmont Park . It is one of the only roller coasters that are still operating from what ACE calls the " golden age of roller coasters . " Other than being the oldest roller coaster in California , the ride is also one of the oldest roller coasters in the world . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Since the Giant Dipper was one of the first roller coasters in existence when it opened , many people were concerned about the safety of the ride . Loof , as well as a local newspaper , insisted it was " virtually impossible " for the cars to leave the track because of the makeup of the trains and track . Although several incidents happened on the ride , none were related to the integrity of the track or trains . Many people call the Giant Dipper the icon and crown jewel of Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk as well as one of the nation 's most exciting roller coasters . It is considered to be the signature ride of the park . 
 The Giant Dipper is referred to in the song " Big Dipper " , from the 1996 album The Golden Age by David Lowery 's band Cracker . The ride also appeared in many television commercials and movies , including The Lost Boys , Sudden Impact , The Sting II , and Dangerous Minds . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 On February 27 , 1987 , the United States National Park Service recognized the Giant Dipper as a National Historic Landmark along with the Looff Carousel . 
 It was awarded the American Coaster Enthusiasts Golden Age Coaster award in June 1994 . The 1920s is often considered the " golden age of roller coaster construction " so the award recognizes the roller coasters that still remain today . It is only one of two roller coasters to receive this designation , the other being the Giant Dipper at Belmont Park . Giant Dipper was also awarded the ACE Coaster Landmark award on May 5 , 2007 at the 100th anniversary of Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk . It won the award for its innovative track design , unusual curved station and for being one of the ten oldest operating coasters in the world and one of only three remaining examples of Frederick Church 's work .

 = Iraq War in Anbar Province = 
 The Iraq War in Anbar Province , also known as the Al Anbar campaign , consisted of fighting between the United States military , together with Iraqi Government forces , and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar . The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011 , but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007 . Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines , insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) . Almost 9 @,@ 000 Iraqis and 1 @,@ 335 Americans were killed in the campaign , many in the Sunni Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi . 
 Al Anbar , the only Sunni @-@ dominated province in Iraq , saw little fighting in the initial invasion . Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army 's 82nd Airborne Division . Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed in Fallujah by U.S. soldiers during an anti @-@ American demonstration . In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines . By April 2004 the province was in full @-@ scale revolt . Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi by the end of 2004 , including the Second Battle of Fallujah . Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley . During this time , Al Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) became the province 's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold . The Marine Corps issued an intelligence report in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops . 
 In August 2006 , several tribes located near Ramadi and led by Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha revolted against AQI . The tribes formed the Anbar Awakening and helped turn the tide against the insurgents . American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007 , as well as other cities such as Hīt , Haditha , and Rutbah . In June 2007 the U.S. turned its attention to eastern Anbar Province and secured the cities of Fallujah and Al @-@ Karmah . 
 The fighting was mostly over by September 2007 , although US forces maintained a stabilizing and advisory role through December 2011 . Celebrating the victory , President George W. Bush flew to Anbar in September 2007 to congratulate Sheikh Sattar and other leading tribal figures . AQI assassinated Sattar days later . In September 2008 , political control was transferred to Iraq . Military control was transferred in June 2009 , following the withdrawal of American combat forces from the cities . The Marines were replaced by the US Army in January 2010 . The Army withdrew its combat units by August 2010 , leaving only advisory and support units . The last American forces left the province on 7 December 2011 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Al Anbar is Iraq 's largest and westernmost province . It comprises 32 percent of the country 's total land mass , nearly 53 @,@ 208 square miles ( 137 @,@ 810 km2 ) , almost exactly the size of North Carolina in the United States and slightly larger than Greece . Geographically , it is isolated from most of Iraq , but is easy to access from Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and Syria . The Euphrates River , Lake Habbaniyah , and the artificially created Lake Qadisiyah are its most significant geographical features . Outside of the Euphrates area the terrain is overwhelmingly desert , comprising the eastern part of the Syrian Desert . Temperatures range from highs of 115 ° F ( 46 ° C ) in July and August to below 50 ° F ( 10 ° C ) from November to March . The province lacks significant natural resources and many inhabitants benefited from the Ba 'athist government 's patronage system , funded by oil revenues from elsewhere in the country . 
 The Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) estimated that about 1 @.@ 2 million Iraqis lived in Anbar in 2003 , more than two @-@ thirds of them in Fallujah and Ramadi . With a population 95 percent Sunni , many from the <unk> Tribe , Anbar is Iraq 's only province without a significant Shia or Kurdish population . 95 percent of the population lives within 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the Euphrates . At the time of the invasion , Fallujah was known as a religious enclave hostile towards outsiders , while Ramadi , the provincial capital , was more secular . Outside the cities , the ancient tribal system run by Sheikhs held considerable influence . 
 Conditions in Anbar particularly favored an insurgency . The province was overwhelmingly Sunni , the minority religious group that lost its power and influence in post @-@ Saddam Hussein Iraq . Hussein was also very popular in the province than anywhere else in the country . Many did not fight during the invasion ( allowing them to claim that they had not been defeated ) and " still wanted to slug it out " , according to journalist Tom Ricks . Military service was compulsory in Saddam 's Iraq and the <unk> area contained a sizeable portion of Iraq 's arms industry . Immediately after Saddam fell , insurgents and others looted many of the 96 known munitions sites , as well as local armories and weapons stockpiles . These weapons were used to arm the insurgents in Anbar and elsewhere . While only a small minority of Sunnis were initially insurgents , many either supported or tolerated them . Sympathetic Ba 'athists and former Saddam officials in Syrian exile provided money , sanctuary , and foreign fighters to insurgent groups . Future al @-@ Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi spent part of 2002 in central Iraq , including Anbar Province , preparing for resistance . Within several months of the invasion the province had become a sanctuary for anti @-@ occupation fighters .

 = = = Invasion = = = 
 Anbar experienced relatively little fighting during the initial invasion of Iraq , as the main US offensive was directed through the Shia areas of southeastern Iraq , from Kuwait to Baghdad . An infantry division had been earmarked in 2002 to secure Anbar during the invasion . However , the Pentagon decided to treat the province with an " economy of force " in early 2003 . The first Coalition forces to enter Al Anbar were American and Australian special forces , who seized vital targets such as Al Asad Airbase and Haditha Dam and prevented the launch of Scud missiles at Israel . While there was generally little combat , the most significant engagement occurred when elements of the American 3rd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment seized Haditha Dam on 31 March 2003 . Surrounded by a larger Iraqi force , the Rangers held the dam until relieved after eight days . During the siege , they destroyed twenty @-@ nine Iraqi tanks and killed an estimated 300 to 400 Iraqi soldiers . Four Rangers were awarded the Silver Star for the action . In addition , four other Rangers were killed when their checkpoint near Haditha was attacked by a suicide bomber . 
 At the end of the invasion , the pro @-@ Saddam forces in Anbar – the Ba 'ath Party , the Republican Guard , the Fedayeen Saddam , and the Iraqi Intelligence Service – remained intact . Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April . Other pro @-@ Saddam forces were able to relocate from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons , where they set up headquarters . The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro @-@ Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria . In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad and other parts of the country , Ba 'athist headquarters and homes of high @-@ ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched . The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province , General Mohammed Jarawi , formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003 . 
 = = = Insurgency begins = = = 
 Shortly after the Fall of Baghdad , the US Army turned Anbar Province over to a single regiment , the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment ( ACR ) . With only several thousand soldiers , that force had little hope of effectively controlling Anbar . 
 The immediate catalyst for violent activity in the Fallujah area came after what many Iraqis and foreign journalists dubbed a " massacre " in Fallujah . On the evening of 28 April 2003 , Saddam Hussein 's birthday , a crowd of about one hundred men , women , and children staged anti @-@ American protests outside US military outposts in Fallujah . The Iraqis claimed they were unarmed , while the Army said that some individuals were carrying and firing AK @-@ 47s . The soldiers manning one of the outposts fired on the crowd , killing at least twelve and wounding dozens more . The Army never apologized for the killings or paid compensation . In the weeks afterwards , the town 's pro @-@ US mayor urged the Americans to leave . 
 On 16 May 2003 , the CPA issued Order Number 1 , which abolished the Ba 'ath Party and began a process of " de @-@ Ba <unk> " , and on 23 May 2003 issued Order Number 2 , which disbanded the Iraqi Army and other security services . Both orders further antagonized the Sunnis of Anbar . Many Sunnis took great pride in the Iraqi Army and viewed its disbanding as an act of contempt towards the Iraqi people . The dissolution also put hundreds of thousands of Anbaris out of work as many were members of the Army or the party . Three days after CPA Order No. 2 , Major Matthew Schram became the first American killed since the invasion in Anbar Province when his convoy came under rocket @-@ propelled grenade ( RPG ) attack on 26 May near Haditha . 
 = = = June – October 2003 = = = 
 What we have done over the last six months in Al Anbar has been a recipe for instability . 
 Following the disbanding of the Iraqi Army , insurgent activity increased , especially in Fallujah . Initially , armed resistance groups could be characterized as either Sunni nationalists who wanted to bring back the Ba 'ath Party with Saddam Hussein , or anti @-@ Saddam fighters . The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al @-@ Muhammad , the Ba 'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate , who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most @-@ wanted Iraqis . According to the US military , Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam , then still a fugitive . 
 In June , American forces conducted Operation Desert Scorpion , a mostly unsuccessful attempt to root out the burgeoning insurgency . An isolated success occurred near Rawah , where American soldiers cornered and killed more than 70 fighters on 12 June and captured a large weapons cache . 
 In general , American forces had difficulty distinguishing between Iraqi civilians and insurgents , and the civilian casualties incurred during the sweep increased support for the insurgency . On 5 July , a bomb killed seven at a graduation ceremony for the first American @-@ trained police cadets in Ramadi . On 16 July , Mohammed Nayil <unk> , the pro @-@ government mayor of Haditha , and his youngest son were assassinated . 
 As the violence escalated , the US responded with what many Iraqis called the " senseless use of firepower " and " midnight raids on innocent men " . Human Rights Watch accused the Army of a pattern of " over @-@ aggressive tactics , indiscriminate shooting in residential areas and a quick reliance on lethal force " , as well as using " disproportionate force " . For example , if Iraqi insurgents set off a land mine , the US would respond by dropping bombs on those houses with arms caches ; when insurgents fired a mortar round at American positions near Fallujah , the Americans responded with heavy artillery . American forces near Al Qaim conducted " hard knocks " on local residents , kicking in doors and manhandling individuals , only to discover they were innocent . In an incident on 11 September , soldiers manning a checkpoint near Fallujah shot multiple rounds at both an Iraqi police truck and a nearby hospital , killing seven . Soldiers also beat and abused Iraqi detainees . There was a constant rotation of units through the province , which led to confusion among the American troops : Fallujah had five different battalions rotate through in five months . Summing up the initial American approach to Al Anbar , Keith Mines , the CPA diplomat in Anbar Province , wrote : 
 What we have done over the last six months in Al Anbar has been a recipe for instability . Through aggressive de @-@ Ba <unk> , the demobilization of the army , and the closing of factories the coalition has left tens of thousands of individuals outside the political and economic life of this country . 
 On October 31 , during Operation <unk> teams from A Squadron of the British SAS supported by Delta force assaulted insurgent held compounds / dwellings in the fringes of Ramadi , killing an estimated dozen insurgents and capturing four , the operation turned up evidence of foreign fighters ; finding actual proof of an internationalist jihadist movement . One SAS operator was killed in the operation . The SAS also operated covertly in Ramadi and Fallujah in October and November 2003 and other more remote parts of Al Anbar Province as part of Operation Paradoxical which was aimed at hunting down threats to the coalition . 
 = = = November – December 2003 = = = 
 During the insurgency 's Ramadan Offensive , a military Chinook transport helicopter carrying 32 soldiers was shot down with an SA @-@ 7 missile near Fallujah on 2 November . Thirteen were killed and the rest wounded . Following the shootdown , Fallujah was quiet for a few months . On 5 November , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Marines would return to Iraq early the next year and would take over Anbar Province . As the Marines prepared to move in , there was a growing consensus that the 82nd had lost control of the area , although the only real problem was Fallujah . Some Marine commanders , like Major General James Mattis and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Mundy , criticized the Army 's tactics as " hard @-@ nosed " and " humiliating the Sunni population " , promising that the Marines would act differently . Late that November , Operators from A Squadron SAS launched a heliborne assault on a remote farm in Al Anbar province , after they came under fire from insurgents inside , air support was called in and hit the farm , after it was cleared ; seven dead insurgents were found whom American intelligence believed were foreign fighters . Riots in Fallujah and Ramadi followed the December capture of Saddam Hussein . The capture of Saddam created significant problems in Anbar : instead of weakening the insurgency , many Anbaris were outraged over what they saw as the degrading treatment of Saddam . Saddam 's removal allowed the insurgency to recruit fighters who had previously opposed the Americans but had remained passive out of hatred for Saddam . As Saddam loyalists were killed or captured , leadership positions went to AQI @-@ affiliated hardliners such as Abdullah Abu Azzam al @-@ Iraqi , who was directly responsible for murdering government officials in 2004 . While the Ba 'ath Party continued to play a major role in the insurgency , the balance of power had shifted to various religious leaders who were advocating a jihad against American forces .

 At the beginning of 2004 , General Ricardo Sanchez , head of Multinational Force Iraq ( MNF – I ) , claimed that the US had " made significant progress in Anbar Province . " However , CPA funds for the province were inadequate . A brigade commander in Fallujah was allocated only $ 200 @,@ 000 a month , when he estimated that it would cost at least $ 25 million to restart the city 's factories , which employed tens of thousands of workers . By February , insurgent attacks were rapidly increasing . On 12 February , United States Central Command ( CENTCOM ) commander General John P. Abizaid and Major General Chuck Swannack , the 82nd Airborne 's commanding officer , were attacked while driving through Fallujah . On 14 February , in an incident dubbed the " Valentine 's Day Massacre " , insurgents overran a police station in downtown Fallujah , killing 23 to 25 policemen and freeing 75 prisoners . The next day , the Americans fired Fallujah 's police chief for refusing to wear his uniform and arrested the mayor . In March , Keith Mines wrote , " there is not a single properly trained and equipped Iraqi security officer in the entire Al Anbar province . " He added that security was entirely dependent on American soldiers , yet those same soldiers inflamed Sunni nationalists . That same month General Swannack gave a briefing on Anbar where he talked about improved security , declared the insurgency there was all but finished , and concluded " the future for Al Anbar in Iraq remains very bright . " 
 The 82nd Airborne handed control of Anbar Province over to the I Marine Expeditionary Force ( I MEF ) , also known as Multi @-@ National Forces West ( MNF @-@ W ) , on 24 March . Nearly two @-@ thirds of the Marines , including their commanders James T. Conway and James Mattis , had participated in the invasion in 2003 . Conway planned on gradually reestablishing control over Anbar Province using a methodical counterinsurgency program , showing respect for the population and training the Iraqi Army and police using military transition teams ( based on the Combined Action Program used by the Marines during the Vietnam War ) . During the transition of authority between the MEF and the 82nd Airborne it became obvious that western Iraq was going to be more problematic for the Marines than southern Iraq had been . 
 On 15 March , 3rd Battalion 7th Marines operating near Al Qaim got into a firefight with Syrian border guards . On 24 March , several Marines and paratroopers were wounded in Fallujah when insurgents attacked the ceremony for transfer of authority . 
 Just one week after the MEF had taken over Anbar , insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy carrying four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March , killing all of them . An angry mob then set the mercenaries ' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates . The American media compared the attack on the mercenaries to the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu , where images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops . 
 That same day five soldiers were killed in nearby Habbaniyah when their M113 armored personnel carrier was hit by a mine . According to General Conway , it was the largest mine that had been used in Anbar to date ; only a tailgate and a boot were recovered . 
 = = = First Battle of Fallujah = = = 
 Al Jazeera kicked our ass . 
 In response to the killings , General Sanchez ordered the Marines to attack Fallujah , under direct orders from President George W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld . General Conway and his staff initially urged caution , pointing out that the MEF had already developed a more nuanced long @-@ term plan to reestablish control over Fallujah and that using overwhelming force would most likely further destabilize the city . They noted that the insurgents were specifically trying to " bait us into overreaction . " Despite these objections , General Sanchez wanted a sustained Marine presence in the city within 72 hours . 
 The Marines began their attack , codenamed Operation Vigilant Resolve , on 5 April . The overall ground commander in Anbar , 1st Marine Division commander General James Mattis , initially planned to use his only available units , 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion 1st Marines . They would push in from the east and west and methodically contain the insurgents . This plan was underway when on 9 April , General Sanchez ordered an immediate halt . 
 The main reason behind this order was the coverage by the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya television networks . The two networks had the only access to the city . They repeatedly reported that Marines were using excessive force and collective punishment , and their footage of dead babies in hospitals inflamed both Iraqi and world opinion . General Conway later summed up their effect on the battle by saying , " Al Jazeera kicked our ass . " When the 2nd Iraqi Battalion was ordered to Fallujah , 30 percent of its soldiers refused or deserted , and within days over 80 percent of the police force and Iraqi National Guard in Anbar Province had deserted . After two members of the Iraqi Governing Council resigned over the attack and five more threatened to do so , CPA Leader Paul Bremer and CENTCOM commander General John Abizaid were worried that Fallujah might bring down the Iraqi government and ordered a unilateral ceasefire . 
 Following the ceasefire , the Marines held their positions and brought in additional units , waiting for what they assumed would be the resumption of their attack . General Mattis launched Operation Ripper Sweep while the Marines waited , pushing the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion ( LAR ) and 2nd Battalion 7th Marines into the farmlands around Fallujah and neutralizing many armed gangs operating along the local highways . The 3rd Battalion 4th Marines also conducted a raid into nearby insurgent @-@ held Karmah , which expanded into a major engagement lasting the rest of the month . The Marines were able to keep their supply lines open , but withdrew for political reasons . President Bush refused to allow the resumption of the attack , but was also unhappy with the status quo , asking his commanders for " other options " . 
 Finally , General Conway proposed what was a workable compromise in his opinion : the Fallujah Brigade . Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba 'athists , such as <unk> Mohammed Saleh and Muhammed Latif , and made up largely of insurgents who had been fighting the Marines , the brigade was supposed to maintain order in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face . On 10 May , General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day . The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded . Iraqi losses were much higher . The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed . Reports differed on how many were civilians : the Marines counted 300 , whereas the independent organization Iraq Body Count argued that 600 civilians had been killed . 
 Four Marines and soldiers were awarded either the Navy Cross or Distinguished Service Cross for the battle . Another Marine , Captain Douglas A. <unk> of Echo Company 2nd Battalion 1st Marines , became known as the " Lion of Fallujah " for his actions during the assault . 
 = = = Ramadi and western Anbar in 2004 = = = 
 Outside of Fallujah , there were additional attacks on American positions in Anbar throughout the spring and summer of 2004 . They were part of a larger " jihad wave " that swept across the Province in mid @-@ April . Gangs of armed youths took to the streets , setting up impromptu roadblocks and threatening supply routes in eastern Anbar Province and around Baghdad . At one point General Mattis feared a general uprising by the Sunni community , similar to the 1978 Tehran protests . On 6 April , a force of 300 insurgents attacked Marine patrols throughout Ramadi in an attempt to relieve pressure on Fallujah . Sixteen US Marines and an estimated 250 insurgents were killed in heavy street fighting over four days . 
 Nearly all members of a squad from 2nd Battalion 4th Marines were killed when they drove into an ambush in unarmored Humvees , the first time the Marines had lost a firefight in Iraq . On 17 April , insurgents attacked a Marine patrol in the border city of Husaybah , leading to a series of engagements that lasted the whole day and resulted in five Marines and at least 120 insurgents killed . Around the same time , on 14 April , a squad led by Corporal Jason Dunham was operating near Husaybah when one member of a group of Iraqis who were being searched by Dunham 's squad threw a grenade at the squad . Dunham immediately threw himself on the grenade , receiving a mortal wound from the blast but saving his fellow squad members . He later became the first Marine since the Vietnam War to be awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 Attempting to emulate the perceived success in Fallujah , US commanders in Ramadi responded to the 28 June transfer of sovereignty from the CPA to the Iraqi Interim Government by pulling most forces back to camps outside the city and focusing on securing a highway that ran through its center . Fighting continued to escalate throughout Anbar Province . On 21 June , a four @-@ man Scout Sniper team operating with 2nd Battalion 4th Marines in Ramadi was executed by a group of insurgents who had infiltrated their observation post . In mid @-@ July , General Mattis predicted that Anbar would " [ go ] to hell " if the Marines could not hold Ramadi . On 5 August , Anbar Provincial Governor Abd al @-@ Karim <unk> resigned following the kidnapping of his two sons by Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi . <unk> appeared on television and publicly apologized for " cooperation with the infidel " . He was replaced by an interim governor until January 2005 . The head of the Ramadi police force was subsequently arrested for complicity with the kidnappings . 
 That same month , an Iraqi battalion commander was captured by insurgents in Fallujah and beaten to death . After his death , two Iraqi National Guard battalions near Fallujah promptly deserted , leaving their weapons and equipment to the insurgents . Counterinsurgency expert John <unk> , serving in nearby Khaldiyah , said that his unit knew the local police chief was supporting the insurgency , " but assessed that he had to do so to stay alive . " Suicide bombers killed seven Marines from 2nd Battalion 1st Marines on 6 September , eleven Iraqi police near Baghdadi on 23 October , and eight Marines from the newly arrived 1st Battalion 3rd Marines one week later . More than 100 Americans were killed in Anbar from May 2004 to October 2004 . 
 Prior to November , Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi invited representatives from Ramadi and Fallujah in an attempt to negotiate an end to the fighting , similar to his previous dealings with Shia leader <unk> al @-@ Sadr . In September , with the blessings of the Americans , Allawi disbanded the discredited Fallujah Brigade and privately gave the Marines permission to begin planning an offensive to retake Fallujah . In early October , Allawi stepped up his efforts , demanding that the representatives of Fallujah hand over Zarqawi or face a renewed assault . They refused . Shortly before the Marine offensive began , Sheikh Harith al @-@ <unk> , leader of the pro @-@ insurgent Association of Muslim Scholars , said that " the Iraqi people view Fallujah as the symbol of their steadfastness , resistance and pride . " 
 = = = Insurgency in 2004 = = = 
 Despite the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim Government on 28 June , the insurgency was still viewed by many Iraqis as legitimate and the Iraqi government as agents of the United States . In late 2004 , a CIA officer said that insurgents in Ramadi were receiving financing via Syria " to the tune of $ 1 @.@ 2 million a month " . The insurgency continued to enjoy broad @-@ based support throughout Iraqi society , showing few of the sectarian divisions which would become pronounced following the 2006 al @-@ Askari Mosque bombing . Shia Iraqis attacked Iraqi military units moving towards Fallujah , Shia leaders called on their supporters to donate blood for insurgents , and <unk> al @-@ Sadr referred to the insurgents in Fallujah as " holy warriors " . Some Shi <unk> attempted to join the fighting . 
 The first in a series of execution videos was released on 11 May by AQI , of its leader al @-@ Zarqawi executing American citizen Nick Berg . Many of these hostages , such as Kim Sun @-@ il , Eugene Armstrong , Jack Hensley , and Kenneth Bigley , were taken to Zarqawi 's base in Fallujah for execution . 
 After the initial push into Fallujah , the US argued that Zarqawi was behind a series of car bombings throughout Iraq . There had been no large car bombings in Baghdad during the siege , and enough munitions and contraband had been uncovered to conclude that many " bombs and car bombs detonated elsewhere in Iraq may have been manufactured in Fallujah . " In contrast , there were 30 large car bombs in the two months following the creation of the Fallujah Brigade , and the Brigade was now seen by the US and Iraqi governments as a front for the insurgency . The suicide bombings and the hostage videos made Zarqawi the public face of the Iraqi insurgency in 2004 , even though his leadership was disputed by many Sunni nationalist commanders . By late 2004 the US government 's bounty on his head matched Osama bin Laden 's . However , a senior US military intelligence official described the core of the insurgency in December 2004 as " the old Sunni oligarchy using religious nationalism as a motivating force . "

 " Hundreds of thousands of the nation 's sons are being slaughtered . " 
 The order by Allawi to attack Fallujah again came on 6 November , just four days after George W. Bush was reelected as president . 1st Marine Division commander General Richard F. Natonski assembled an ad @-@ hoc force of six Marine battalions , three Army battalions , three Iraqi battalions , and the British Black Watch Regiment . The insurgents , loosely led by Zarqawi , Abdullah al @-@ <unk> , and Zarqawi 's lieutenant Hadid , had replaced their losses and reportedly now had between 3 @,@ 000 and 4 @,@ 000 men in the city . They planned to hinder the Marine advance with roadblocks , berms , and mines , while conducting attacks outside the city to tie down Marine units . 
 The attack began on 7 November when General Natonski had the 3rd LAR and 36th Iraqi battalions seize the city 's hospital , located on a peninsula just west of the city . The main attack began the night of 8 November . Coalition forces attacked from the north , achieving complete tactical surprise . 
 The insurgents responded by attacking the Marines in small groups , often armed with RPGs . According to General Natonski , many insurgents had seen pictures of the Abu Ghraib scandal and were determined not to be taken alive . By 20 November , Marines had reached the southern boundary of the city , but pockets of insurgents still remained . The assault battalions divided the city into areas and crisscrossed their assigned areas in an attempt to find the insurgents . Four days later Zarqawi released an audiotape condemning Sunni Muslim clerics for their lack of support , claiming " hundreds of thousands of the nation 's sons are being slaughtered . " The fighting slowly ebbed and by 16 December the US had begun to reopen the city and allow residents to return . 
 The battle was later described by the US military as " the heaviest urban combat Marines have been involved in since the battle of Hue City in Vietnam . " The official Marine Corps history recorded that 78 Marines , sailors , and soldiers died and another 651 were wounded retaking Fallujah ( 394 were able to return to duty ) . One @-@ third of the dead and wounded came from a single battalion , 3rd Battalion 1st Marines . Eight Marines were awarded the Navy Cross , the US military 's second @-@ highest award for valor , three of them posthumously . Sergeant Rafael Peralta was also unsuccessfully nominated for the Medal of Honor . 
 Officials estimated they had killed between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 600 insurgents and detained another 1 @,@ 000 out of an estimated 1 @,@ 500 to 3 @,@ 000 insurgents who were believed to be in the city . Aircraft dropped 318 precision bombs , launched 391 rockets and missiles , and fired 93 @,@ 000 machine gun or cannon rounds on the city , while artillery units fired 5 @,@ 685 rounds of 155 mm shells . The Red Cross estimated that 250 @,@ 000 out of 300 @,@ 000 residents had left the city during the fighting . A Baghdad Red Cross official unofficially estimated that up to 800 civilians were killed . 
 The Battle of Fallujah was not a defeat — but we cannot afford many more victories like it . 
 The Second Battle of Fallujah was unique in the Anbar campaign , in that it was the only time the US military and the insurgents waged a division @-@ level conventional engagement . During the rest of the Anbar campaign , the insurgents never stood and fought in numbers that large . The official Marine Corps history claimed that the battle was not decisive , because most of the insurgent leadership and non @-@ local insurgents had fled beforehand . Summing up the Marine Corps view , the United States Naval Institute 's official magazine Proceedings said , " The Battle of Fallujah was not a defeat — but we cannot afford many more victories like it . "

 Following the Second Battle of Fallujah , the Marines faced three main tasks : providing humanitarian assistance to the hundreds of thousands of refugees returning to the city , retaking the numerous towns and cities they had abandoned along the Euphrates in the run @-@ up to the battle , and providing security for the Iraqi parliamentary elections scheduled for 30 January . According to top Marine officials , the elections were designed to help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation . Only 3 @,@ 775 voters ( 2 percent of the eligible population ) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott . The simultaneous elections for the provincial council were won by the Iraqi Islamic Party , which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009 . 
 During the run @-@ up to the elections , a CH @-@ 53E helicopter crashed near Al @-@ Rutbah on 26 January , killing all 31 Marines and sailors , most of whom were members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who had survived the Second Battle of Fallujah . This was the single deadliest incident for US troops in the Iraq War . On 20 February , the Marines launched Operation River Blitz , their first major offensive of the year , centered in the western Euphrates River Valley against the cities of Ramadi , Hīt , and Baghdadi . Different units adopted different strategies . In Fallujah , the Marines surrounded the city with berms , banned all vehicles , and required residents to carry identification cards . In Ramadi , the 2nd BCT of the 28th Infantry Division focused on controlling the main roads and protecting the governor and government center . In western Anbar , the 2nd Marine Regiment conducted search and destroy missions , described as " cordon and search " , where they repeatedly pushed into enemy @-@ controlled towns and then withdrew . On 2 April , a group of up to 60 AQI fighters launched a major attack , described as " one of the most sophisticated " seen to date , on the Abu Ghraib prison . The insurgents used a barrage of mortars , coupled with a suicide car bomb , in an unsuccessful attempt to breach the prison , wounding 44 US troops and 13 detainees . 
 = = = Improvised Explosive Devices = = = 
 By late February , a new threat emerged — the improvised explosive device ( IED ) . In 2005 , 158 Marines and soldiers were killed by IEDs or suicide bombers , more than half ( 58 percent ) of that year 's combat deaths in Anbar . These numbers reflected a nationwide trend . While IEDs had been used since the beginning of the insurgency , the early models had been crudely designed , using " dynamite or gunpowder mixed with nails and buried beside a road " . By mid @-@ 2005 the insurgents had refined their technique , triggering them by remote control , stringing artillery shells or missiles together , using solid foundations to magnify the explosion , and burying them under roadways to inflict maximum damage . The US responded with a series of progressively more @-@ sophisticated electronic jamming devices and other electronic warfare programs which eventually consolidated into the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization . 
 Unless there are people melting inside of Humvees , then it 's not a real problem . 
 On 17 February , Brigadier General Dennis Hejlik filed an urgent request with the Marine Corps for 1 @,@ 200 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicles , specifically designed to withstand IED attacks , for use in Anbar Province . In his request , General Hejlik added , " The [ Marines ] cannot continue to lose ... serious and grave casualties to IED [ s ] . " The Marine Corps did not formally act on the request for 21 months . Hejlik later claimed that he was referring to IEDs which " tore into the sides of vehicles " , and that the Marine Corps had determined that simply adding more armored Humvees would provide adequate protection . Whistleblower Franz <unk> disagreed , and wrote a report for Congress claiming that the request was shelved because the Marine Corps wanted to use the funds to develop the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle , a replacement for the Humvee not scheduled to become operational until 2012 . Some Army personnel complained that the Marines took an almost casual attitude towards IEDs . One Army officer in Ramadi complained that , after warning about the large number of IEDs on a particular route , he was told , " Unless there are people melting inside of Humvees , then it 's not a real problem . " 
 = = = Western Euphrates River Valley = = = 
 By the spring of 2005 , both the US and Iraqi governments concluded that the biggest problem facing Iraq was AQI 's car bombings in Baghdad . But while the Iraqis wanted to concentrate on Baghdad 's suburban belts where the vehicles were being assembled , MNF – I commander General George Casey concluded the real problem was pro @-@ insurgent foreign fighters coming across the Syrian border . He ordered the Marines to launch a campaign that summer to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley ( WERV ) . 
 On 7 May a platoon from 3rd Battalion 25th Marines near Haditha was nearly overrun by insurgents , but ultimately rescued by one of its non @-@ commissioned officers who was later awarded the Navy Cross . The next day the 2nd Marine Regiment began clearing insurgent havens in the WERV . The first major attack was Operation Matador , against the town of <unk> , which CENTCOM claimed was an insurgent staging area . Both 3rd Battalion 25th Marines and 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines participated in the attack . In most cases the insurgents vanished , leaving behind booby traps and mines . At least nine Marines were killed and 40 wounded in the operation , but the insurgents apparently returned to the town afterwards . 
 AQI was interested in the WERV too . Zarqawi had reclaimed his base in western Anbar , declared Al Qaim as his capital , and was also operating in Hit and the Haditha Triad . On 8 May , the insurgent group Jamaat Ansar al @-@ Sunna ambushed and killed a dozen mercenaries near Hīt . Two days later , Anbar Governor Raja Nawaf Farhan al @-@ <unk> was kidnapped and killed by insurgents near Rawah . He was replaced by <unk> Sami Rasheed al @-@ <unk> . 
 MEF then began a series of operations in July , under the aegis of Operation Sayeed ; in addition to clearing AQI from the WERV , Sayeed was also an attempt to set the conditions for the Anbaris to participate in the December constitutional referendum . They carried out countless operations , with names like New Market , Sword , Hunter , <unk> , Spear , River Gate , and Iron Fist , ultimately culminating in November 's Operation Steel Curtain . In August , the 3rd Battalion 25th Marines conducted Operation Quick Strike , a cordon and search operation in the Haditha Triad . Twenty Marines were killed in two days : six snipers were ambushed and killed by Jamaat Ansar al @-@ Sunna on 1 August , and fourteen Marines were killed on 3 August when their Amphibious Assault Vehicle was hit by a mine outside of Haditha . 
 By October , more Americans had been killed in Anbar than anywhere else in Iraq and senior Marines had switched from talk about victory to simply " containing the violence and smuggling at a level that Iraqi forces can someday handle . " 
 = = = October – December 2005 = = = 
 On 5 November , the 2nd Marine Regiment launched Operation Steel Curtain against the border town of Husaybah . The Marines reported that ten Marines and 139 insurgents died in the offensive . Medical workers in Husaybah claimed that 97 civilians were killed . On 1 December , ten Marines from 2nd Battalion 7th Marines were killed by a massive IED while on a foot patrol in Fallujah . 
 On 15 October , the people of Anbar went to the polls to decide whether or not to ratify the new constitution . While the turnout ( 259 @,@ 919 voters or 32 % of eligible voters ) was significantly higher than in the January elections , the results were similar : about 97 % of the voters rejected the constitution . On 15 December , there was a follow @-@ up election for the Iraqi parliament . Turn @-@ out was even greater : 585 @,@ 429 voters , or 86 % of eligible voters . 
 AQI launched a series of attacks in Jordan in late 2005 that were partially based out of Anbar . The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the <unk> checkpoint along the Jordanian border with Anbar Province in December 2004 . In August , two US warships in Aqaba , the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ashland , were attacked with rockets ; the cell which carried out the attacks then fled into Iraq . On 9 November , three Iraqis from Anbar carried out suicide bombings in Amman , killing 60 . A fourth bomber , also from Anbar , was caught . 
 = = 2006 = = 
 = = = Haditha killings = = = 
 In May 2006 , the Marine Corps was rocked by allegations that a squad from 3rd Battalion 1st Marines had gone " on a rampage " the previous November , killing 24 unarmed Iraqi men , women and children in Haditha . The incident had occurred on 19 November 2005 , following a mine attack on a convoy that killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas . A squad of Marines led by Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich had been riding in the convoy and immediately assumed control of the scene . Following the mine attack , the Marines stopped a white Opel sedan carrying five Iraqi men and shot them after they tried to run away , before the platoon commander arrived and took charge . The Marines say they were then fired upon from a nearby house , and Wuterich 's men were ordered " to take the house " . Both Iraqi and Marine eyewitnesses later agreed that <unk> 's squad cleared the house ( and several nearby ones ) by throwing in grenades , then entering the houses and shooting the occupants . They differed over whether the killings had been permitted under the rules of engagement . The Marines claimed that the houses had been " declared hostile " and that training dictated " that all individuals in a hostile house are to be shot . " Iraqis claimed the Marines had deliberately targeted civilians . In addition to the five Iraqi men killed by the sedan , nineteen other men , women , and children were killed by <unk> 's squad as they cleared the houses . 
 Internal investigations were started in February by the Multi @-@ National Force – Iraq , the Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( which examined the actual killings ) , and Major General Eldon <unk> ( who examined the Marines ' response to the killings ) . A news article that alleged a massacre had occurred was published in March . Haditha became a national story in mid @-@ May due to comments made by anti @-@ war Congressman and former Marine John P. Murtha . Murtha incorrectly claimed the number of civilians killed was much higher than reported and that the Marines had " killed innocent civilians in cold blood . " Murtha 's broader point about troop misbehavior was reinforced by news of another killing where a squad of Marines executed an Iraqi man and then planted an AK @-@ 47 near his body in <unk> , near Abu Ghraib , as well as the controversial Internet video Hadji Girl , showing a Marine joking about killing members of an Iraqi family . 
 The military 's internal investigation was concluded in June . Though <unk> found no evidence of a cover @-@ up , his report seriously criticized the Marine Corps for what he described as " inattention and negligence " as well as " an unwillingness , bordering on denial " by officers , especially senior officers , to investigate civilian deaths . MEF commander General Stephen Johnson later said that civilian deaths occurred " all the time " , and did not find the high number of deaths to be particularly unusual . He referred to the deaths as " the cost of doing business on that particular engagement . " On 21 December 2006 , the US military charged eight Marines in connection with the Haditha incident . Four of the eight , including Wuterich , were accused of unpremeditated murder . On 3 October 2007 , the preliminary hearing investigating officer recommended that charges of murder be dropped and that Wuterich be tried for negligent homicide instead . Six defendants subsequently had their cases dropped and one was found not guilty . In 2012 , Wuterich pleaded guilty to negligent dereliction of duty in exchange for all other charges against him being dropped . At least three officers , including battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey <unk> , were officially reprimanded for failing to properly report and investigate the killings . 
 = = = Second Battle of Ramadi = = = 
 In June 2006 , Colonel Sean MacFarland and the 1st Brigade Combat Team ( BCT ) of the 1st Armored Division were sent to Ramadi . Colonel MacFarland was told to " Fix Ramadi , but don 't do a Fallujah . " Many Iraqis assumed the 1st BCT was preparing for exactly that type of operation , with over 77 M1 Abrams tanks and 84 Bradley Fighting Vehicles , but Colonel MacFarland had another plan . Prior to Ramadi , the 1st BCT had been stationed in the northern city of Tal Afar , where Colonel H. R. McMaster in 2005 had pioneered a new type of operation : " Clear , Hold , Build " . Under McMaster 's approach , his commanders saturated an area with soldiers until it had been cleared of insurgents , then held it until Iraqi security forces were gradually built to a level where they could assume control . As in other offensive operations , many insurgents fled the city in anticipation of a big battle . The 1st BCT moved into some of Ramadi 's most dangerous neighborhoods and , beginning in July , built four of what would eventually become eighteen Combat Outposts . The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents in the process . On 24 July , AQI launched a counterattack , launching 24 assaults , each with about 100 fighters , on American positions . Despite the reported presence of AQI leader Abu Ayyub al @-@ Masri , the insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men . Several senior American officers , including General David Petraeus , later compared the fighting to the Battle of Stalingrad . Despite the success , Multi @-@ National Force – Iraq continued to view Ramadi as a secondary front to the ongoing civil war in Baghdad and considered moving two of Colonel MacFarland 's battalions to Baghdad . Colonel MacFarland even publicly described his operations as " trying to take the heat off Baghdad . " 
 = = = Awakening movement = = = 
 As the 1st Brigade pushed into Ramadi , it began aggressively courting the local tribes for police recruits . This was critical because , according to Colonel MacFarland , " without their help , we would not be able to recruit enough police to take back the entire city . " After the Americans promised the tribal leaders in Ramadi that their men would not be sent outside of the city , the tribes began sending men into the police force . The number of Iraqis joining the police went from 30 a month before June 2006 to 300 a month by July . AQI tried to blunt police recruitment by attacking one of the new Ramadi police stations with a car bomb on 21 August , killing three Iraqi police . They simultaneously assassinated the Sunni sheikh of the Abu Ali Jassim tribe , who had encouraged many of his tribesmen to join the Iraqi Police . The AQI fighters hid the body instead of leaving it for the tribe , violating Islam 's funeral rites and angering the tribe . This was one of the catalysts for what became a tribal revolt against AQI . According to David Kilcullen , who would later serve as Senior Counterinsurgency Adviser to General Petraeus , the revolt began after AQI killed a sheikh over his refusal to give his daughters to them in marriage . 
 During this time , one of Colonel MacFarland 's subordinates , Lieutenant Colonel Tony Deane , had kept contact with a low @-@ level sheikh from the Abu Risha tribe , Abdul Sattar Abu Risha . In 2004 and 2005 , Sattar 's father and three of his brothers had been killed by AQI , but he had refused exile . In early September , Sattar told Deane that his tribe and several others were planning to ally with the United States and throw out the Baghdad @-@ based government . Dean informed Colonel MacFarland , who pledged to support Sattar as long as Sattar continued to back the Government of Iraq . On 9 September , Sattar and former Anbar Governor <unk> al Gaood , along with 50 other sheikhs , announced the formation of the Anbar Awakening movement . Shortly after the meeting , Colonel MacFarland began hearing reports that off @-@ duty Iraqi police operating as the military wing of the Awakening had formed a shadowy vigilante organization called " <unk> al @-@ Anbar " . <unk> al @-@ Anbar conducted terror attacks against known AQI operatives , while Colonel MacFarland and his soldiers turned a blind eye . 
 Colonel MacFarland asked his tribal adviser , Captain Travis Patriquin , to prepare a brief for the Iraqi government and the MEF 's staff and journalists , all of whom remained skeptical about arming Sunni tribes who might someday fight the Shi 'a @-@ led government . Patriquin 's brief , called " How to Win in Al Anbar " , used stick figures and simple language to convey the message that recruiting tribal militias into the police force was a more effective strategy than using the US military . Ricks referred to the briefing as " perhaps the most informal one given by the US military in Iraq and the most important one . " It later became a viral phenomenon on the Internet and is still used as a training aid . 
 Following the formation of the Awakening movement , violence in Ramadi continued to increase . On September 29 , 2006 an insurgent threw a grenade onto a rooftop where a group of Navy SEALs were positioned . One of them , Master @-@ at @-@ Arms Second Class Michael A. Monsoor , quickly smothered the grenade with his body and was killed . He was later awarded the Medal of Honor . On October 18 , AQI 's umbrella organization , the Mujahideen Shura Council , formally declared Ramadi as a part of the Islamic State of Iraq . 
 = = = Operation Al Majid = = = 
 Even as the Awakening progressed , Anbar continued to be viewed as a lost cause . In mid @-@ August , Colonel Peter Devlin , chief of intelligence for the Marine Corps in Iraq , had given a particularly blunt briefing on the Anbar situation to General Peter Pace , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Devlin told Pace that the US could not militarily defeat AQI in Anbar Province , as " AQI has become an integral part of the social fabric of western Iraq . " He added that AQI had " eliminated , subsumed , marginalized , or co @-@ opted " all other Sunni insurgents , tribes , or government institutions in the province . Devlin believed that the only way to reestablish control over the province was to deploy an additional division to Anbar , coupled with billions of dollars of aid , or by creating a " sizeable and legally approved paramilitary force " . He concluded that all the Marines had accomplished was preventing things from being " far worse " . In early September , Colonel Devlin 's report was leaked to the Washington Post . MEF commander Major General Richard <unk> responded to press queries about the statement that Anbar Province was lost . <unk> said that he agreed with the assessment , but added that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces . He added that if he were asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces , but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province — that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq . 
 Some of the first offensive operations outside of Ramadi also began in late 2006 , with the construction of 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 @-@ meter ) high dirt berms around several Iraqi cities in western Anbar : Haditha , Haqlaniyah , <unk> , Rutbah , and Anah . The <unk> was part of Operation Al Majid , an American @-@ led operation to clear and hold more than 30 @,@ 000 square miles ( 78 @,@ 000 km2 ) in western Anbar . Prior to Al Majid , a previous battalion commander had observed that his unit lacked the manpower to control both the main roads and towns of the Haditha Triad , that the Iraqi Army was as blind as they were , and that the insurgents were killing anyone who spoke to Coalition forces . The 2nd Battalion 3rd Marines had lost over 23 Marines in just two months trying to hold the area . In addition to the berms and the help of a local strongman known as Colonel <unk> , the Marines set up checkpoints in key locations to regulate entry and exit . By early January , attacks in the Triad had dropped from 10 – 13 per day to one every few days . 
 The Iraq Study Group Report , released on 6 December , acknowledged that the Awakening movement had " started to take action " , but concluded that " Sunni Arabs have not made the strategic decision to abandon violent insurgency in favor of the political process " and that the overall situation in Anbar was " deteriorating " . On the same day , Captain Patriquin was killed by a roadside bomb in Ramadi along with Major Megan McClung , the first female Marine officer to die in Iraq . Following the execution of Saddam Hussein , Saddam 's family considered interring him in Ramadi because of the improved security situation . On 30 December , an unknown number of loyalists near Ramadi staged a march carrying pictures of Saddam Hussein and waving Iraqi flags .

 = = = Surge = = = 
 In his State of the Union Address on 23 January 2007 , President Bush announced plans to deploy more than 20 @,@ 000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in what became known as the Surge . Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar , which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI . Instead of deploying new units , the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar : 1st Battalion 6th Marines , 3rd Battalion 4th Marines , and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit ( MEU ) . The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit . 
 AQI had its own offensives planned for 2007 . In the first two months of 2007 , it shot down eight helicopters throughout Iraq , including two in Anbar . One was brought down by a sophisticated SA @-@ 14 or SA @-@ 16 shoulder @-@ fired missile on 7 February , near Karmah , killing five Marines and two sailors . AQI also began a series of chlorine bombings near Ramadi and Fallujah . The first attack was on 21 October 2006 , when a car bomb carrying twelve 120 mm mortar shells and two 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) chlorine tanks was detonated in Ramadi . The AQI campaign intensified in January 2007 . For five months , AQI carried out a series of suicide bombings in Anbar using conventional vehicle @-@ borne explosive devices mixed with chlorine gas . The attacks in general were poorly executed , burning the chemical agent rather than dispersing it . 
 AQI also continued its assassination campaign . On 19 February , AQI tried to kill Sheikh Sattar in his compound with a pair of suicide car bombs that missed the sheikh , but killed eleven . Several days later the Habbaniyah mosque of an imam who had spoken out against AQI was hit by a suicide bomber during Friday prayers , with 39 killed and 62 wounded . In June , a group of Anbar sheiks meeting in Baghdad 's Mansour Hotel was attacked by a suicide bomber , with 13 killed , including <unk> al Gaood , and 27 wounded . On 30 June , a group of 70 AQI fighters planned to carry out a major attack on Ramadi targeting tribal leaders and police in the city , including Sheikh Sattar . Instead they stumbled into a squad from the 1st Battalion , 77th Armor Regiment near Donkey Island , and fought an all @-@ night engagement that resulted in thirteen Americans dead or wounded and half the AQI fighters killed . 
 = = = MRAPs = = = 
 As the campaign in Al Anbar entered its fourth year the Marine Corps scored a major victory when it adopted a vehicle originally designed in the 1970s to withstand mine attacks : the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicle . As early as 2004 , the Marine Corps recognized that it needed a replacement for its armored Humvees . The few Cougar MRAP initially deployed yielded impressive results . In 2004 , the Marines reported that no troops had died in over 300 mine attacks on Cougars . In April 2007 , General Conway estimated that the widespread use of the MRAP could reduce mine casualties in Anbar by as much as 80 percent . Now Commandant of the Marine Corps , he requested an additional 3 @,@ 000 MRAPs for Anbar and told the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he wanted to require every Marine traveling outside bases to ride in one . In April , the Deputy Commander for MEF said that in the 300 attacks on MRAPs in Anbar since January 2006 , no Marines had been killed . On 8 May 2007 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the acquisition of MRAPs was the Department of Defense 's highest priority and earmarked 1 @.@ 1 billion US dollars for them . The Marine Corps purchased and fielded large numbers of MRAPs throughout 2007 . That October , General Conway described the MRAP as the " gold standard " of force protection . Deaths from mine attacks plummeted and in June 2008 , USA Today reported that roadside bomb attacks and fatalities in Iraq had dropped almost 90 percent , partially due to MRAPs . 
 = = = Operation Alljah = = = 
 In June the Marine Corps launched Operation Alljah to secure Fallujah , Karma , <unk> , and the Tharthar regions of eastern Anbar . These regions fell under the umbrella of Operation Phantom Thunder , an overall offensive throughout Iraq using US and Iraqi divisions on multiple fronts in an attempt to clear the areas surrounding Baghdad . In late 2006 , the 1st Battalion 25th Marines had turned Fallujah over to the Iraqi Army and Police , who preferred to stay in defensive checkpoints and not patrol the city . Colonel Richard Simcock , whose 6th Marine Regiment would retake the city , later admitted that the Marines had pulled out too soon . In June , he sent the 2nd Battalion 6th Marines into Fallujah , dividing it up into ten precincts and sending Marines and Iraqi Police into each precinct in a duplication of 1st Battalion 6th Marines ' operations in Ramadi . 
 In May , General Gaskin began planning to retake the city of Karmah , which sat astride a main supply route between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold . Unlike other locales , Karmah had no definable perimeter , making it easy for outsiders to access , as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being pushed out of Baghdad . Gaskin sent one of his aides to Jordan to meet with Sheikh Mishan , head of Karmah 's largest tribe , the <unk> . Sheikh Mishan fled to Jordan in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI . Gaskin 's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June , partnered with 2nd Battalion 5th Marines . By October , insurgent attacks had dropped to almost zero . 
 In May , the 13th MEU moved into Tharthar , a 970 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 500 km2 ) area that was AQI 's last Anbar refuge . Their goal was to cut off insurgent travel between Anbar and Salahuddin Provinces into Baghdad and to uncover weapons caches . Resistance was light and many insurgents fled . The insurgents laid over 400 mines to slow the Marines down . In one operation , Marines found 18 tons of homemade explosives and 48 @,@ 000 pounds ( 22 @,@ 000 kg ) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer . They uncovered several mass graves , containing a total of over 100 victims left behind by AQI . Tharthar was cleared by August . Operation Alljah was one of the last significant Anbar offensives . By late October , weeks passed without casualties .

 When you stand on the ground here in Anbar ... you can see what the future of Iraq can look like . 
 President Bush flew to Al Asad Airbase in western Anbar Province on 3 September , to showcase what he referred to as a " military success " and " what the future of Iraq can look like " . While there , he met with top US and Iraqi leadership and held a " war council " . Frederick Kagan , one of the " intellectual architects " of the Surge , referred to the visit as the " Gettysburg " of the Iraq War and observed that Bush thought Anbar was " safe enough for the war cabinet of the United States of America to meet there with the senior leadership of the government of Iraq to discuss strategy . " 
 A week after Bush 's visit , on 10 September , General David Petraeus , the Commanding General of Multi @-@ National Force – Iraq , and United States Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker gave their Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq . General Petraeus specifically singled out Anbar Province as a major improvement , referring to the tribal uprisings there as " the most significant development of the past 8 months " . He mentioned the dramatic improvements in security , stating that enemy attacks had decreased from a high of 1 @,@ 350 in October 2006 to approximately 200 in August 2007 . Ambassador Crocker referred to Anbar Province in his Congressional testimony . He was careful to credit the victory to AQI " overplay [ ing ] its hand " and to the tribal uprising being directed primarily against the " excesses " of AQI . He also referred to the Government of Iraq recruiting " 21 @,@ 000 Anbaris [ in ] police roles " , a carefully chosen phrase as many of them were tribal militia . The two referred to Anbar Province a total of 24 times in their testimony . 
 Three days later , on 13 September , Sheikh Sattar and three other men were killed by a bomb planted near his house in Ramadi . AQI claimed responsibility for the attack and twenty people were arrested in connection with the killing , including the Sheikh 's own head of security . About 1 @,@ 500 mourners attended Sheikh Sattar 's funeral , including senior Iraqi and American officials . The leadership of the Anbar Salvation Council then passed to Sheikh Sattar 's brother Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha . In December , al @-@ Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri released an interview where he denied that the tribes of Anbar Province were supporting the Americans , praising them as " noble and honorable " and referring to the Awakening as " scum " .

 = = = Transition = = = 
 Beginning in February 2008 , US forces began returning political and military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis . On 14 February , 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt . Two days later , American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant to show off the Iraqi security forces . More significantly , in late March , both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province , the 1st and 7th Divisions , were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra . Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army . On 26 March 2008 , B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours , after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house , they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight . With Helicopter support , they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists , One SAS operator was killed . 
 Earlier in January , AQI leader Ayyub al @-@ Masri ordered his fighters in Anbar to " get away from the massive indiscriminate killings " and " refocus attacks on American troops , Sunnis cooperating closely with U.S. forces , and Iraq 's infrastructure . " AQI also ordered its fighters to avoid targeting Sunni tribesman , and even offered amnesty towards Awakening tribal leaders . On 19 April , al @-@ Masri called for a month @-@ long offensive against US and Iraqi forces . In Anbar Province , that offensive may have begun four days earlier on 15 April , when 18 people ( including five Iraqi police ) were killed in two suicide bombings near Ramadi . On 22 April , a suicide bomber drove his vehicle into an entry @-@ control point in Ramadi manned by over 50 Marines and Iraqi police . Two Marines engaged the driver who detonated his bomb early , killing the guards and wounding 26 Iraqis . Both Marines were posthumously awarded the Navy Cross . On May 8 , a group of insurgents crossed the Syrian border near Al Qaim and killed 11 Iraqi policemen and military officers . That same day , four Marines were killed in a roadside blast in <unk> , a farming village just east of Karmah . On 16 May , a suicide car bomber attacked a Fallujah police station , killing four and wounding nine . 
 In June , it was announced that Anbar Province would be the tenth province to transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control , the first such Sunni region . This handover was delayed by bad weather and a suicide bombing on 26 June in Karmah at a meeting between Sunni Sheikhs and US Marines which killed more than 23 people , including three Marines . In July , presidential candidate Barack Obama visited Ramadi and met with Governor Rasheed , Sheikh Abu <unk> , and 30 other sheikhs and senior military personnel . In the meeting , Obama promised that " the United States will not abandon Iraq " ( his opponent , John McCain , had visited Haditha in March 2008 ) . On 26 August , Iraqi leaders signed the Command and Control Memorandum of Understanding in a ceremony at the Anbar Governance Center , a step towards taking full control and responsibility for security from Coalition forces . Less than a week later , on 1 September , the transition became official . 
 = = = Drawdown = = = 
 The last major military action in Anbar Province occurred on 26 October 2008 , when a group of Army Special Forces conducted a raid into Syria to kill Abu <unk> , the leader of a network of foreign fighters who were traveling through Syria . Anbar continued to play a large role in the Iraqi insurgency . That same month AQI announced the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq ( ISI ) , an umbrella group led by Abu Omar al @-@ Baghdadi , a cleric from Anbar . After both Al @-@ Baghdadi and Al @-@ Masri were killed in Tikrit in April 2010 , the US believed the new leader of AQI / ISI was Abu Dua al @-@ Badri , a former Emir of Rawa who was married to a woman from Fallujah . 
 In late 2008 , US forces began accelerating their move out of cities across Iraq , turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces . The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December . Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar , on 19 July 2009 . In early August , a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher , who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War . By 6 October 2009 , the last two Marine Regiments had left , ending the American combat presence . Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass @-@ casualty attacks to destabilize the country . There was a spike in the number of suicide attacks , and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government . 
 There were a number of car bombings in Ramadi , Haditha and Al Qaim following the US withdrawal from Iraqi cities on 30 June . Throughout the last months of the year , additional attacks , mainly assassinations , occurred around Fallujah and Abu Ghraib . In October , twin bombings killed 26 people and wounded 65 at a reconciliation meeting in Ramadi . In December , a coordinated double suicide bombing outside Ramadi 's government compound killed 25 people and severely wounded Governor Qasim Al @-@ <unk> , who lost an arm . 
 Violence continued through the last months of 2011 . In September , a bus carrying Shia pilgrims from neighboring Karbala Governorate was stopped outside of Ramadi and 22 were executed , prompting threats from Karbala to annex parts of southern Anbar Province , including the city of <unk> . In November , the provincial council in Anbar announced that it was considering whether to form a semi @-@ autonomous region with other provinces in the Sunni areas of Iraq . 
 As the Americans withdrew , many Iraqis and Americans questioned the ability of the Iraqi security forces , especially the police , to protect the province . Others expressed skepticism over whether Iran would dominate Iraq and whether the Iraqi government would be able to provide security . One angry Iraqi described the American legacy as " total destruction ... you just came in , destroyed , and left . " Discussing the American withdrawal , a journalist in Fallujah predicted that the Government of Iraq would continue to have trouble with Anbar Province , saying , " Anbar was where instability began in Iraq . It was where stability returned . And it is where instability could start again . " 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 The United States military in Anbar Province had a series of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010 . The last non @-@ American foreign forces left Iraq on 31 July 2009 and Multi @-@ National Forces West became United States Force – West . On 23 January 2010 , the Marines formally left both Anbar Province and Iraq , transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army 's 1st Armored Division . The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division – Baghdad , creating United States Division – Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad . In December 2010 , the 25th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for Anbar Province . On 7 December , the United States transferred its last base in Anbar Province , Al Asad , to the Iraqi Government . One week later , hundreds of Fallujah residents celebrated the pullout by burning American flags in the city . 
 = = Human rights abuses = = 
 Both sides committed human rights abuses in Anbar Province , often involving civilians caught in the middle of the conflict . By late 2005 , abuses had gotten so common that one American officer nonchalantly referred to " discovering ... 20 bodies here , 20 bodies there " and the head of MNF @-@ W referred to them as " a cost of doing business . " During Operation Steel Curtain , insurgents forced their way into peoples ' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces , who often destroyed the homes . One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt . During their yearlong stay in Hīt , they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for talking back to them ; the fighters later dumped the man 's body on his doorstep . The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house , and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family . An Iraqi sheikh spoke about how he was accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured . After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah who thought he was an American spy . 
 = = = By the Coalition = = = 
 For the American forces , abuses were typically either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings ( such as in Haditha ) . Many accusations of human rights violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah . Following the assault , the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds , the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons . Several Marines , all of them from the 3rd Battalion 1st Marines , were later charged ( but not convicted ) with executing Iraqi prisoners . Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing depleted uranium that caused birth defects for years after the battle . 
 American forces also killed civilians through aerial bombing . Between 2003 and 2007 , 1700 Iraqis on all sides were killed by aerial attack in Anbar Province . On 19 May 2004 , 42 civilians were killed near Al Qaim when American planes mistakenly bombed a wedding party . In November 2004 , 59 civilians were killed when the US bombed Fallujah 's Central Health Center . In November 2006 , an American airstrike in Ramadi killed 30 civilians . Some accusations , such as the alleged bombing of a Fallujah mosque in April 2004 that killed 40 , were later proven to be exaggerated or false . 
 An unknown number of Iraqis in Anbar were also killed through Escalation of Force ( <unk> ) incidents , where American troops were allowed to fire at suspicious @-@ looking Iraqi vehicles and persons under their rules of engagement . These incidents typically occurred at both coalition checkpoints and near coalition convoys on the road . One civil affairs officer recounted two separate incidents in Ramadi where families in cars were fired on for not stopping at checkpoints : in one incident the husband was killed ; in another , the wife died and a boy was critically wounded . 
 Other violations involved detainee abuse . An August 2003 memo on detainee interrogations prompted one soldier with the 3rd ACR in Anbar to reply that " the gloves need to come off . " In November 2003 , former Iraqi general Abed Hamed <unk> died at a detention facility near Al Qaim after US Army interrogators stuffed him inside a sleeping bag and beat him to death . In 2005 , several members of the 82nd Airborne described how in 2003 they beat and abused prisoners at Camp Mercury , a forward operating base near Fallujah . Iraqi security forces also committed abuses . In 2007 , a Marine commander near Tharthar uncovered several instances of Iraqi soldiers raping civilians and Iraqi police torturing prisoners . 
 Finally , while not an abuse , there was a perception among some Iraqis that Americans did not care about them . A leading cleric in Anbar later complained that : 
 If an American patrol was on the highway , and they saw a dead person , they would just leave him there . And this really started to create hatred toward the American GIs , because they couldn 't care less what happened to Iraqis . If they were killed right in front of them , they did not get involved ... When the terrorists attacked the national mosque in 2005 ... American forces were 200 yards away ... and did not interfere . 
 = = = By insurgents = = = 
 The various insurgent groups regularly executed and tortured suspected Iraqi collaborators and captured Westerners , as well as Iraqis they considered insufficiently religious . One Iraqi Christian told Human Rights Watch how he was stopped by insurgents in Anbar and ordered to convert to Islam or face death . Another Iraqi Shia related how insurgents from other Arab countries had expelled many Kurds and Shi <unk> from cities and executed others . After the Second Battle of Fallujah , American forces uncovered Al Qaeda torture and execution chambers , which had been used on Iraqis suspected of working with Westerners or the Iraqi government . Some of the chambers still contained victims . Some executions , like those of Nicholas Berg and Kim Sun @-@ il , had been videotaped by their perpetrators . Some Fallujah residents stated that during the battle , Al Qaeda had shot anyone trying to leave . 
 In Haditha , after the Marines were withdrawn in order to fight in Fallujah , insurgents " rounded up dozens of local police officers and publicly executed them in a soccer stadium . " When the Marines were withdrawn a second time later in 2004 there were similar massacres of local police . They enforced strict Islamic laws , such as breaking the fingers of smokers , whipping those who drank alcohol , and banning shops from selling images of women . An Iraqi woman from Ramadi said Al Qaeda banned women from driving or walking alone by themselves . AQI also abused local women , which antagonized some of the local tribes . Women , pretending to be seamstresses , were drafted to reconnoiter houses and report on the presence of Iraqi police in hiding . If they could not find the police , they would settle for killing their close relatives . They also murdered countless Iraqis : doctors , mullahs , college graduates , even women and children — anyone they thought might be connected to the Americans . In 2007 , American Marines found several mass graves near Lake Tharthar containing a total of over 100 victims . 
 = = = Reactions = = = 
 According to Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha , many Iraqis became disaffected with AQI but were hesitant to take up arms against them out of fear . Sheikh Ahmed said that the biggest complaint about AQI was that they were unable to create a degree of normalcy , and that " people [ who ] are wearing masks ... cannot build the country " . Other sheikhs specifically said that the large number of killings and kidnappings by AQI prompted the tribal revolt . AQI leader Ayyub al @-@ Masri practically admitted as much in 2008 when he ordered fighters in Anbar to avoid harming Sunnis who were not working closely with coalition forces and " not interfere in social issues " . However , David Kilcullen argued that the abuses themselves may have been less of an issue than AQI disrupting the tribes ' smuggling businesses , the belief that AQI was linked to Iran , and their general " high @-@ handed " behavior . He added that , whatever the spark , there was already a perception that AQI " had it coming " . 
 In the United States , incidents like detainee abuse and the Haditha killings became front @-@ page news , but many Iraqi deaths by American or Iraqi security forces went unreported . While the U.S. military claimed that " the vast majority " of Iraqi deaths were caused by other Iraqis , incidents like Fallujah and Haditha caused many Iraqis to become embittered towards the Americans . This later led to Iraqi outrage in 2011 , when the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a long @-@ term presence in Iraq that would give immunity to American military personnel . Iraqis were further angered by what they perceived as a " travesty of justice " over the lack of convictions of American military personnel . Writing in the aftermath of the Haditha killings , retired U.S. Army Colonel Andrew <unk> said : 
 Who bears responsibility for these Iraqi deaths ? The young soldiers pulling the triggers ? The commanders who establish rules of engagement that privilege " force protection " over any obligation to protect innocent life ? The intellectually bankrupt policymakers who sent U.S. forces into Iraq in the first place and now see no choice but to press on ? The culture that , to put it mildly , has sought neither to understand nor to empathize with people in the Arab or Islamic worlds ?

 = Alcoholic beverages in Oregon = 
 The U.S. state of Oregon has an extensive history of laws regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages , dating back to 1844 . It has been an alcoholic beverage control state , with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission holding a monopoly over the sale of all distilled beverages , since Prohibition . Today , there are thriving industries producing beer , wine , and liquor in the state . Alcohol may be purchased between 7 a.m. and 2 : 30 a.m. As of 2007 , consumption of spirits is on the rise , while beer consumption is holding steady . Also , 11 % of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in @-@ state , the highest figure in the United States . 
 Oregon wine production began in the mid @-@ 19th century , before it was a state . By 1919 , the industry had collapsed due to prohibition , and after prohibition ended fruit wines dominated the industry . The modern era of Oregon wine began in 1961 , and the industry cemented its reputation in 1975 by winning a French award . In 2007 , wine making was a $ 207 @.@ 8 million business . Beer production began in 1852 with Henry <unk> 's liberty brewing in Portland . In 1862 Henry Weinhard 's bought the Liberty brewery . The company is now a part of the Miller Brewing Company , but it helped Portland to become the microbrewing capital of the world . Portland hosts North America 's largest <unk> , and Oregon has produced a number of national and international award winning beers . 
 In 1844 , the Oregon territories voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages . This was repealed in 1845 , but prohibition was reinstated in a 1915 , four years before the national alcohol prohibition . When national prohibition was repealed in 1933 , the Oregon Liquor Control Commission ( OLCC ) was created . Unlike states that allow liquor sales in grocery stores , liquor in Oregon is sold only in OLCC run liquor stores and establishments that have liquor licenses , and the OLCC has strict guidelines and training to ensure that all licensed venues understand how to safely sell and serve alcoholic beverages . Alcohol and alcoholism are also studied by the state at the Portland Alcohol Research Center .

 In 2007 , sales of spirits increased 9 % over the previous year . Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers , while tequila had the largest percentage increase . Oregonian 's top buy was Jack Daniel 's , with 412 @,@ 000 bottles sold . This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers . Again in 2007 , Oregon 's 2 @.@ 6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each , versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits , but sales of beer hadn 't increased like sales of spirits . The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th – 11th graders has fallen nationally , it has increased in Oregon .

 Wine grapes were planted in Oregon in the Willamette Valley starting in 1847 . A census in 1860 revealed that Oregon 's wine production was 2 @,@ 600 gallons . In the 1880s and 1890s , German immigrants began planting wine grapes in Southern Oregon . In the 1880s , Ernest Reuter garnered a reputation for his <unk> wines , grown in the Willamette Valley , west of Forest Grove . By 1919 , the Oregon wine industry had collapsed due to the temperance movement and resulting prohibition . Fruit wines dominated Oregon 's wine industry post @-@ prohibition , and by 1938 there were 28 bonded wineries , producing wines based on berries , Concord grapes , and other American hybrids . 
 Oregon 's modern wine industry dates to 1961 when Hillcrest Vineyard in Roseburg began planting Riesling and small amounts of other grapes . In 1965 , Oregon pinot noir was established when The Eyrie Vineyards planted grapes near Corvallis . Oregon 's wine reputation was made in 1979 when a French magazine ranked The Eyrie 's 1975 Pinot noir third among 330 wines of the world . By 2007 , Oregon wineries were producing 1 @.@ 7 million cases of wine for a total of $ 207 @.@ 8 million in sales . 
 There are several official American Viticultural Areas entirely within the state , including the Willamette Valley , Southern Oregon , Umpqua Valley , and Rogue Valley AVAs . Parts of the Columbia Gorge , Walla Walla Valley , and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon . Pinot noir and Pinot gris are the top two grapes grown .

 In 1862 , German immigrant Henry Weinhard founded a brewery in Portland . By the early 1880s it had become the Northwest 's largest brewery . Weinhard once attempted to pump free beer through Portland 's Skidmore Fountain . He died in 1904 , but the company continued to do well , making it through prohibition by brewing soft drinks and merging with Arnold Blitz , a local competitor . Blitz @-@ Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company in 1979 , and then again to the Miller Brewing Company in 1999 . The company helped prepare Oregon beer drinkers for the arrival of microbrewing . 
 Portland , Oregon is considered to be the nation 's microbrew capital . A microbrewery is defined as one that produces less than 15 @,@ 000 barrels a year . Portland hosts the Oregon Brewers Festival , North America 's largest beer festival . The microbrewery industry began in 1979 when President Jimmy Carter legalized home brewing . In 2006 , 14 beers from eight Oregon breweries won medals at the Great American Beer Festival , out of 2 @,@ 800 entries . Also in 2006 , Oregon won 11 times at the World Beer Cup , in a field of 2 @,@ 200 beers . In 2007 , 11 % of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in @-@ state , the highest figure in the United States .

Dodge explained that " there 's been a recent shift from beer , and to some degree wine , to distilled spirits as the alcohol of choice . " 
 In 2008 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that absinthe was legal , though it had been understood to be illegal for about 80 years .

 = = Legislative history = = 
 Oregon has been regulating alcohol through its laws for over 150 years . In 1844 , the Oregon Territory voted to prohibit alcoholic beverages . This is often referred to as the first prohibition in the United States . The law was repealed in 1845 . From 1845 to 1915 , various local laws governing alcohol were passed . In 1915 , Oregonians voted to ban all alcohol , preceding national alcohol prohibition by four years . 
 In 1933 , national prohibition ended with a repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution . Oregon 's governor , Julius Meier , appointed Dr. William S. Knox to study the situation . Knox recommended adopting the Canadian system of sales of alcohol by the state . The reasoning was that this would provide revenue and lower alcohol abuse . 
 The Oregon Legislative Assembly held a special session and the OLCC was created days after the repeal of national prohibition . Eighteen states in total chose to regulate alcohol . Oregon Revised Statutes Chapters 471 , 472 , 473 and 474 were the commission 's enabling statutes . OAR Chapter 845 governed its administrative rules . The OLCC 's mission is " to effectively regulate the sale , distribution , and responsible use of alcoholic beverages in order to protect Oregon 's public health , safety and community livability . " 
 In 1939 , the advertising of hard liquor on billboards and in newspapers was voluntarily discontinued . Also , in 1939 , a " club bill " was passed by the Legislative Assembly . The bill gave regulatory power to the OLCC over hotels , restaurants and private clubs where liquor was served . <unk> then succeeded in having the bill referred to the voters in 1940 . Voters passed the bill in 1940 . 
 In 1944 , the " Burke Bill " became law : wines with more than 14 % alcohol could only be sold by Commission stores and agencies . Also in the 1940s , a " service bars " license was established . This restricted liquor licenses to establishments serving food . In 1949 , the Legislative Assembly approved a method where establishments that sold liquor could ask for proof of age from patrons they thought were under the age of 21 . Measure 15 — passed in 1952 — amended the Constitution ( Article I , section 39 ) to regulate the sale of liquor by the individual glass . 
 Five more types of licenses were created in the 1950s , dealing with liquor @-@ by @-@ the @-@ drink operations , industry agents , salesmen , out @-@ of @-@ state manufacturers of malt beverages , and conventions , group meetings , etc . In 1960 , establishments were required to have food sales equal to 25 % of their total sales . In the 1970s , the OLCC began enforcing the Oregon Bottle Bill and wines of up to 20 % alcohol became allowed with certain licenses . In the 1980s , the number of OLCC commissioners was changed from three to five , to reflect the number of congressional districts . The 1990s saw a flurry of laws passed governing the OLCC 's oversight of the newly numerous Oregon wineries and microbreweries . House Bill <unk> – passed in 2002 – allowed liquor stores to operate on Sunday ; they had previously been restricted to six days a week . 
 This sort of licensing is very important for maintaining safe production and sales of alcoholic beverages in Oregon . Under Oregon law , specifically ORS 471 @.@ 565 , bars and restaurants can be held legally responsible for any damages to property or injuries incurred when an intoxicated person is served alcohol and causes a car crash .

 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO / <unk> / ; French : Organisation du Traité de l 'Atlantique Nord ; <unk> ) , also called the North Atlantic Alliance , is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949 . The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party . NATO 's headquarters are located in Haren , Brussels , Belgium , where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides . Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe , the newest of which , Albania and Croatia , joined in April 2009 . An additional 22 countries participate in NATO 's Partnership for Peace program , with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes . The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70 percent of the global total . Members ' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2 percent of GDP . 
 NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization 's member states , and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders . The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact , which formed in 1955 . Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed , along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion — doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO 's military structure in 1966 for 30 years . After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia , and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999 . Politically , the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries , several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004 . 
 Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty , requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack , was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks , after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO @-@ led ISAF . The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then , including sending trainers to Iraq , assisting in counter @-@ piracy operations and in 2011 enforcing a no @-@ fly zone over Libya in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 . The less potent Article 4 , which merely invokes consultation among NATO members , has been invoked five times : by Turkey in 2003 over the Iraq War ; twice in 2012 by Turkey over the Syrian Civil War , after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F @-@ 4 reconnaissance jet , and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria ; in 2014 by Poland , following the Russian intervention in Crimea ; and again by Turkey in 2015 after threats by the Islamic State to its territorial integrity . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 The Treaty of Brussels , signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , France , and the United Kingdom , is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement . The treaty and the Soviet Berlin Blockade led to the creation of the Western European Union 's Defence Organization in September 1948 . However , participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the USSR and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism , so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the North Atlantic Treaty , which was signed in Washington , D.C. on 4 April 1949 . It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States , Canada , Portugal , Italy , Norway , Denmark and Iceland . The first NATO Secretary General , Lord Ismay , stated in 1949 that the organization 's goal was " to keep the Russians out , the Americans in , and the Germans down . " Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous , and some Icelanders participated in a pro @-@ neutrality , anti @-@ membership riot in March 1949 . The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called <unk> which stressed the importance of trans @-@ Atlantic cooperation . 
 The members agreed that an armed attack against any one of them in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against them all . Consequently , they agreed that , if an armed attack occurred , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self @-@ defence , would assist the member being attacked , taking such action as it deemed necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area . The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor . Although obliged to respond , they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so . This differs from Article IV of the Treaty of Brussels , which clearly states that the response will be military in nature . It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily . The treaty was later clarified to include both the member 's territory and their " vessels , forces or aircraft " above the Tropic of Cancer , including some Overseas departments of France . 
 The creation of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology , procedures , and technology , which in many cases meant European countries adopting US practices . The roughly 1300 Standardization Agreements ( <unk> ) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved . Hence , the 7 @.@ 62 × 51mm NATO rifle cartridge was introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries . Fabrique Nationale de Herstal 's FAL , which used 7 @.@ 62 NATO cartridge , was adopted by 75 countries , including many outside of NATO . Also , aircraft marshalling signals were standardized , so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base . Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 was crucial for NATO as it raised the apparent threat of all Communist countries working together , and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans . Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ( SHAPE ) was formed to direct forces in Europe , and began work under Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower in January 1951 . In September 1950 , the NATO Military Committee called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets , subsequently reaffirming this position at the February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon . The Lisbon conference , seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO 's Long @-@ Term Defence Plan , called for an expansion to ninety @-@ six divisions . However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly thirty @-@ five divisions with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons . At this time , NATO could call on about fifteen ready divisions in Central Europe , and another ten in Italy and Scandinavia . Also at Lisbon , the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organization 's chief civilian was created , and Lord Ismay was eventually appointed to the post . 
 In September 1952 , the first major NATO maritime exercises began ; Exercise <unk> brought together 200 ships and over 50 @,@ 000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway . Other major exercises that followed included Exercise Grand Slam and Exercise <unk> , naval and amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean Sea , Italic Weld , a combined air @-@ naval @-@ ground exercise in northern Italy , Grand Repulse , involving the British Army on the Rhine ( BAOR ) , the Netherlands Corps and Allied Air Forces Central Europe ( <unk> ) , Monte Carlo , a simulated atomic air @-@ ground exercise involving the Central Army Group , and <unk> , a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving American , British , Greek , Italian and Turkish naval forces . 
 Greece and Turkey also joined the alliance in 1952 , forcing a series of controversial negotiations , in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants , over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure . While this overt military preparation was going on , covert stay @-@ behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion , including Operation <unk> , were transferred to NATO control . Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO 's armed forces , such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery . 
 In 1954 , the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe . The NATO countries , fearing that the Soviet Union 's motive was to weaken the alliance , ultimately rejected this proposal . 
 On 17 December 1954 , the North Atlantic Council approved MC 48 , a key document in the evolution of NATO nuclear thought . MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first . This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the US Strategic Air Command . 
 The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as " a decisive turning point in the history of our continent " by <unk> Lange , Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time . A major reason for Germany 's entry into the alliance was that without German manpower , it would have been impossible to field enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion . One of its immediate results was the creation of the Warsaw Pact , which was signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Poland , Bulgaria , Romania , Albania , and East Germany , as a formal response to this event , thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War . 
 Three major exercises were held concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957 . Operation Counter Punch , Operation <unk> , and Operation Deep Water were the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date , involving more than 250 @,@ 000 men , 300 ships , and 1 @,@ 500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey . 
 = = = French withdrawal = = = 
 NATO 's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle 's presidency of France . De Gaulle protested against the USA 's strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom . In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958 , he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK . 
 Considering the response to be unsatisfactory , de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country . He wanted to give France , in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany , the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO – Warsaw Pact war . In February 1959 , France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command , and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil . This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967 . 
 Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France 's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command . In 1966 , all French armed forces were removed from NATO 's integrated military command , and all non @-@ French NATO troops were asked to leave France . US Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included " the bodies of American soldiers in France 's cemeteries ? " This withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from <unk> , near Paris , to Casteau , north of Mons , Belgium , by 16 October 1967 . France remained a member of the alliance , and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout the Cold War . A series of secret accords between US and French officials , the Lemnitzer – <unk> Agreements , detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO 's command structure should East @-@ West hostilities break out . 
 = = = Détente and escalation = = = 
 During most of the Cold War , NATO 's watch against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not actually lead to direct military action . On 1 July 1968 , the Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty opened for signature : NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war , at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling . Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time , and they were not challenged . In May 1978 , NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance , to maintain security and pursue détente . This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact 's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race . 
 On 12 December 1979 , in light of a build @-@ up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe , ministers approved the deployment of US <unk> cruise missiles and Pershing II theatre nuclear weapons in Europe . The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament . This policy was called the Dual Track policy . Similarly , in 1983 – 84 , responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS @-@ 20 medium @-@ range missiles in Europe , NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations in the event of war . This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe , and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained . 
 The membership of the organization at this time remained largely static . In 1974 , as a consequence of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus , Greece withdrew its forces from NATO 's military command structure but , with Turkish cooperation , were readmitted in 1980 . The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self @-@ defence is only applicable to attacks on member state territories north of the Tropic of Cancer . On 30 May 1982 , NATO gained a new member when , following a referendum , the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance . At the peak of the Cold War , 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5 @,@ 252 @,@ 800 active military , including as many as 435 @,@ 000 forward deployed US forces , under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters , organized into four echelons . 
 = = = After the Cold War = = = 
 The Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re @-@ evaluation of NATO 's purpose , nature , tasks , and their focus on the continent of Europe . This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union , which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 . At that time , European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO 's military spending ; by 2012 , this had fallen to 21 percent . NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Central and Eastern European nations , and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns . 
 The first post @-@ Cold War expansion of NATO came with German reunification on 3 October 1990 , when the former East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance . This had been agreed in the Two Plus Four Treaty earlier in the year . To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO , it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east , and there are diverging views on whether negotiators gave commitments regarding further NATO expansion east . Jack Matlock , American ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years , said that the West gave a " clear commitment " not to expand , and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia , Hungary , or Poland . In 1996 , Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs , that " during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east , " and repeated this view in an interview in 2008 . According to Robert Zoellick , a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process , this appears to be a misperception , and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made . 
 As part of post @-@ Cold War restructuring , NATO 's military structure was cut back and reorganized , with new forces such as the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established . The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty , which was signed in 1999 . The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France 's military position , culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009 , which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure , while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent . 
 = = = Enlargement and reform = = = 
 Between 1994 and 1997 , wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up , like the Partnership for Peace , the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership Council . In 1998 , the NATO @-@ Russia Permanent Joint Council was established . On 8 July 1997 , three former communist countries , Hungary , the Czech Republic , and Poland , were invited to join NATO , which each did in 1999 . Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO : Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Slovenia , Slovakia , Bulgaria , and Romania . They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit , and joined NATO on 29 March 2004 , shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit . In Istanbul , NATO launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with four Persian Gulf nations . 
 New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished . In 1997 , NATO reached agreement on a significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to just 20 . The NATO Response Force ( <unk> ) was launched at the 2002 Prague summit on 21 November , the first summit in a former Comecon country . On 19 June 2003 , a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander , Atlantic were abolished and a new command , Allied Command Transformation ( ACT ) , was established in Norfolk , Virginia , United States , and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ( SHAPE ) became the Headquarters of Allied Command Operations ( ACO ) . ACT is responsible for driving transformation ( future capabilities ) in NATO , whilst ACO is responsible for current operations . In March 2004 , NATO 's Baltic Air Policing began , which supported the sovereignty of Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia by providing jet fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions . Eight multinational jet fighters are based in Lithuania , the number of which was increased from four in 2014 . 
 The 2006 Riga summit was held in Riga , Latvia , and highlighted the issue of energy security . It was the first NATO summit to be held in a country that had been part of the Soviet Union . At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest , Romania , NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009 . Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members . The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia , as did NATO plans for a missile defence system . Studies for this system began in 2002 , with negotiations centered on anti @-@ ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic . Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia , both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat . 
 In 2009 , US President Barack Obama proposed using the ship @-@ based Aegis Combat System , though this plan still includes stations being built in Turkey , Spain , Portugal , Romania , and Poland . NATO will also maintain the " status quo " in its nuclear deterrent in Europe by upgrading the targeting capabilities of the " tactical " B61 nuclear bombs stationed there and deploying them on the stealthier Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II . Following the 2014 Crimean crisis , NATO committed to forming a new " spearhead " force of 5 @,@ 000 troops at bases in Estonia , Lithuania , Latvia , Poland , Romania , and Bulgaria . On June 15 , 2016 , NATO officially recognized <unk> as an operational domain of war , just like land , sea and aerial warfare . This means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty .

 No military operations were conducted by NATO during the Cold War . Following the end of the Cold War , the first operations , Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991 , were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait . Airborne Early Warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of South Eastern Turkey , and later a quick @-@ reaction force was deployed to the area . 
 = = = Bosnia and Herzegovina intervention = = = 
 The Bosnian War began in 1992 , as a result of the Breakup of Yugoslavia . The deteriorating situation led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9 October 1992 , ordering a no @-@ fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina , which NATO began enforcing on 12 April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight . From June 1993 until October 1996 , Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . On 28 February 1994 , NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no @-@ fly zone . 
 On 10 and 11 April 1994 , during the Bosnian War , the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Goražde safe area , resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F @-@ 16 jets acting under NATO direction . This resulted in the taking of 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April . On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces . A two @-@ week NATO bombing campaign , Operation Deliberate Force , began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska , after the Srebrenica massacre . 
 NATO air strikes that year helped bring the Yugoslav wars to an end , resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995 . As part of this agreement , NATO deployed a UN @-@ mandated peacekeeping force , under Operation Joint Endeavor , named IFOR . Almost 60 @,@ 000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non @-@ NATO nations in this peacekeeping mission . This transitioned into the smaller SFOR , which started with 32 @,@ 000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004 , when operations were then passed onto European Union Force Althea . Following the lead of its member nations , NATO began to award a service medal , the NATO Medal , for these operations . 
 = = = Kosovo intervention = = = 
 In an effort to stop Slobodan Milošević 's Serbian @-@ led crackdown on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo , the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September 1998 to demand a ceasefire . Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23 March 1999 , and he handed the matter to NATO , which started a 78 @-@ day bombing campaign on 24 March 1999 . Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . During the crisis , NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces , the ACE Mobile Force ( Land ) , to Albania as the Albania Force ( <unk> ) , to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo . 
 Though the campaign was criticized for high civilian casualties , including bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade , Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3 June 1999 , ending the Kosovo War . On 11 June , Milošević further accepted UN resolution 1244 , under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force . Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo , and part of KFOR 's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions , in addition to deterring violence . In August – September 2001 , the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest , a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia . As of 1 December 2013 , 4 @,@ 882 KFOR soldiers , representing 31 countries , continue to operate in the area . 
 The US , the UK , and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes , such as the action against Serbia in 1999 , while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval . The US / UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance , and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia , and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required , thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization . Recognizing the post @-@ Cold War military environment , NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management .

 The September 11th attacks in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in the organization 's history . The Article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all . The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty . The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour , a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea which is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction , as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general which began on 4 October 2001 . 
 The alliance showed unity : on 16 April 2003 , NATO agreed to take command of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , which includes troops from 42 countries . The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands , the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement , and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously . The handover of control to NATO took place on 11 August , and marked the first time in NATO 's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area . 
 ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban , al Qaeda and factional warlords , so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai . In October 2003 , the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan , and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country . 
 On 31 July 2006 , the ISAF additionally took over military operations in the south of Afghanistan from a US @-@ led anti @-@ terrorism coalition . Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south , in 2011 France allowed a squadron of Mirage 2000 fighter / attack aircraft to be moved into the area , to Kandahar , in order to reinforce the alliance 's efforts . During its 2012 Chicago Summit , NATO endorsed a plan to end the Afghanistan war and to remove the NATO @-@ led ISAF Forces by the end of December 2014 . ISAF was disestablished in December 2014 and replaced by the follow @-@ on training Resolute Support Mission .

 In August 2004 , during the Iraq War , NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq , a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the US led MNF @-@ I. The NATO Training Mission @-@ Iraq ( NTM @-@ I ) was established at the request of the Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 . The aim of NTM @-@ I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation . NTM @-@ I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission , under the political control of NATO 's North Atlantic Council . Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring . The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US @-@ led Deputy Commanding General <unk> and Training , who was also dual @-@ hatted as the Commander of NTM @-@ I. The mission officially concluded on 17 December 2011 .

 Beginning on 17 August 2009 , NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean from Somali pirates , and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states . The operation was approved by the North Atlantic Council and involves warships primarily from the United States though vessels from many other nations are also included . Operation Ocean Shield focuses on protecting the ships of Operation Allied Provider which are distributing aid as part of the World Food Programme mission in Somalia . Russia , China and South Korea have sent warships to participate in the activities as well . 
 = = = Libya intervention = = = 
 During the Libyan Civil War , violence between protestors and the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi escalated , and on 17 March 2011 led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 , which called for a ceasefire , and authorized military action to protect civilians . A coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no @-@ fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards . On 20 March 2011 , NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with Operation Unified Protector using ships from NATO Standing Maritime Group 1 and Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 , and additional ships and submarines from NATO members . They would " monitor , report and , if needed , interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries " . 
 On 24 March , NATO agreed to take control of the no @-@ fly zone from the initial coalition , while command of targeting ground units remained with the coalition 's forces . NATO began officially enforcing the UN resolution on 27 March 2011 with assistance from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . By June , reports of divisions within the alliance surfaced as only eight of the 28 member nations were participating in combat operations , resulting in a confrontation between US Defense Secretary Robert Gates and countries such as Poland , Spain , the Netherlands , Turkey , and Germany to contribute more , the latter believing the organization has overstepped its mandate in the conflict . In his final policy speech in Brussels on 10 June , Gates further criticized allied countries in suggesting their actions could cause the demise of NATO . The German foreign ministry pointed to " a considerable [ German ] contribution to NATO and NATO @-@ led operations " and to the fact that this engagement was highly valued by President Obama . 
 While the mission was extended into September , Norway that day announced it would begin scaling down contributions and complete withdrawal by 1 August . Earlier that week it was reported Danish air fighters were running out of bombs . The following week , the head of the Royal Navy said the country 's operations in the conflict were not sustainable . By the end of the mission in October 2011 , after the death of Colonel Gaddafi , NATO planes had flown about 9 @,@ 500 strike sorties against pro @-@ Gaddafi targets . A report from the organization Human Rights Watch in May 2012 identified at least 72 civilians killed in the campaign . Following a coup d 'état attempt in October 2013 , Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan requested technical advice and trainers from NATO to assist with ongoing security issues .

 NATO has twenty @-@ eight members , mainly in Europe and North America . Some of these countries also have territory on multiple continents , which can be covered only as far south as the Tropic of Cancer in the Atlantic Ocean , which defines NATO 's " area of responsibility " under Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty . During the original treaty negotiations , the United States insisted that colonies like the Belgian Congo be excluded from the treaty . French Algeria was however covered until their independence on 3 July 1962 . Twelve of these twenty @-@ eight are original members who joined in 1949 , while the other sixteen joined in one of seven enlargement rounds . Few members spend more than two percent of their gross domestic product on defence , with the United States accounting for three quarters of NATO defense spending . 
 From the mid @-@ 1960s to the mid @-@ 1990s , France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed " <unk> @-@ <unk> " . Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009 , the latter being disbanded the following year . France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom , will not commit its nuclear @-@ armed submarines to the alliance . 
 = = = Enlargement = = = 
 New membership in the alliance has been largely from Central and Eastern Europe , including former members of the Warsaw Pact . Accession to the alliance is governed with individual Membership Action Plans , and requires approval by each current member . NATO currently has three candidate countries that are in the process of joining the alliance : Bosnia and Herzegovina , Montenegro , and the Republic of Macedonia . On 2 December 2015 , NATO Foreign Ministers decided to invite Montenegro to start accession talks to become the 29th member of the Alliance . In NATO official statements , the Republic of Macedonia is always referred to as the " former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , " with a footnote stating that " Turkey recognizes the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name . " Though Macedonia completed its requirements for membership at the same time as Croatia and Albania , NATO 's most recent members , its accession was blocked by Greece pending a resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute . In order to support each other in the process , new and potential members in the region formed the Adriatic Charter in 2003 . Georgia was also named as an aspiring member , and was promised " future membership " during the 2008 summit in Bucharest , though in 2014 , US President Barack Obama said the country was not " currently on a path " to membership . 
 Russia continues to oppose further expansion , seeing it as inconsistent with understandings between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and European and American negotiators that allowed for a peaceful German reunification . NATO 's expansion efforts are often seen by Moscow leaders as a continuation of a Cold War attempt to surround and isolate Russia , though they have also been criticised in the West . Ukraine 's relationship with NATO and Europe has been politically divisive , and contributed to " Euromaidan " protests that saw the ousting of pro @-@ Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 . In March 2014 , Prime Minister <unk> Yatsenyuk reiterated the government 's stance that Ukraine is not seeking NATO membership . Ukraine 's president subsequently signed a bill dropping his nation 's nonaligned status in order to pursue NATO membership , but signaled that it would hold a referendum before seeking to join . Ukraine is one of eight countries in Eastern Europe with an Individual Partnership Action Plan . <unk> began in 2002 , and are open to countries that have the political will and ability to deepen their relationship with NATO . 
 = = = Partnerships = = = 
 The Partnership for Peace ( PfP ) programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO : each country may choose the extent of its participation . Members include all current and former members of the Commonwealth of Independent States . The Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership Council ( EAPC ) was first established on 29 May 1997 , and is a forum for regular coordination , consultation and dialogue between all fifty participants . The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership . Other third countries also have been contacted for participation in some activities of the PfP framework such as Afghanistan . 
 The European Union ( EU ) signed a comprehensive package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16 December 2002 . With this agreement the EU was given the possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis , on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act — the so @-@ called " right of first refusal . " It provides a " double framework " for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme . Additionally , NATO cooperates and discusses their activities with numerous other non @-@ NATO members . The Mediterranean Dialogue was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with Israel and countries in North Africa . The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a dialog forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue . The four participants are also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council . 
 Political dialogue with Japan began in 1990 , and since then , the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of these cooperation initiatives . In 1998 , NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal institutionalization of relations , but reflect the Allies ' desire to increase cooperation . Following extensive debate , the term " Contact Countries " was agreed by the Allies in 2000 . By 2012 , the Alliance had broadened this group , which meets to discuss issues such as counter @-@ piracy and technology exchange , under the names " partners across the globe " or " global partners . " Australia and New Zealand , both contact countries , are also members of the <unk> strategic alliance , and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation . In June 2013 , Colombia and NATO signed an Agreement on the Security of Information to explore future cooperation and consultation in areas of common interest ; Colombia became the first and only Latin American country to cooperate with NATO .

 The main headquarters of NATO is located on Boulevard Léopold III / Leopold III @-@ <unk> , B @-@ 1110 Brussels , which is in Haren , part of the City of Brussels municipality . A new € 750 million headquarters building is , as of 2014 , under construction across from the current complex , and is due for completion by 2016 . Problems in the current building stem from its hurried construction in 1967 , when NATO was forced to move its headquarters from Porte Dauphine in Paris , France following the French withdrawal . 
 The staff at the Headquarters is composed of national delegations of member countries and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries , as well as the International Staff and International Military Staff filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states . Non @-@ governmental citizens ' groups have also grown up in support of NATO , broadly under the banner of the Atlantic Council / Atlantic Treaty Association movement . 
 = = = NATO Council = = = 
 Like any alliance , NATO is ultimately governed by its 28 @-@ member states . However , the North Atlantic Treaty and other agreements outline how decisions are to be made within NATO . Each of the 28 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO 's headquarters in Brussels , Belgium . The senior permanent member of each delegation is known as the Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador ( and holding that diplomatic rank ) . Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium . 
 Together , the Permanent Members form the North Atlantic Council ( NAC ) , a body which meets together at least once a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO . From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers , defence ministers or heads of state or government ( <unk> ) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO 's policies are generally taken . However , it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision @-@ making , and its decisions have the same status and validity , at whatever level it meets . France , Germany , Italy , the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint , which is an informal discussion group within NATO . NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues , such as enlargement . 
 The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the Secretary General of NATO and , when decisions have to be made , action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord . There is no voting or decision by majority . Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions . 
 = = = NATO Parliamentary Assembly = = = 
 The body that sets broad strategic goals for NATO is the NATO Parliamentary Assembly ( NATO @-@ PA ) which meets at the Annual Session , and one other during the year , and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members , or ambassadors to NATO . The NATO Parliamentary Assembly is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members . Karl A. <unk> , German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Bundestag and a member of the Christian Democratic Union , became president of the assembly in 2010 . It is however officially a different structure from NATO , and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council . 
 The Assembly is the political integration body of NATO that generates political policy agenda setting for the NATO Council via reports of its five committees : 
 Committee on the Civil Dimension of Security 
 Defence and Security Committee 
 Economics and Security Committee 
 Political Committee 
 Science and Technology Committee 
 These reports provide impetus and direction as agreed upon by the national governments of the member states through their own national political processes and influencers to the NATO administrative and executive organizational entities . 
 = = = Military structures = = = 
 NATO 's military operations are directed by the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee , and split into two Strategic Commands commanded by a senior US officer and ( currently ) a senior French officer assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO . The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the Military Committee for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command . 
 Each country 's delegation includes a Military Representative , a senior officer from each country 's armed forces , supported by the International Military Staff . Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee , a body responsible for recommending to NATO 's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area . Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy . It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders , whose representatives attend its meetings , and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council . The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee is Petr Pavel of the Czech Republic , since 2015 . Like the Council , from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level , namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence , the most senior military officer in each nation 's armed forces . Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France , due to that country 's 1966 decision to remove itself from NATO 's integrated military structure , which it rejoined in 1995 . Until France rejoined NATO , it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee , and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members . Such was the case in the lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom . The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff . 
 The NATO Command Structure evolved throughout the Cold War and its aftermath . An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 as it became clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack . In April 1951 , Allied Command Europe and its headquarters ( SHAPE ) were established ; later , four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe , the Southern Region , and the Mediterranean . 
 From the 1950s to 2003 , the Strategic Commanders were the Supreme Allied Commander Europe ( SACEUR ) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic ( <unk> ) . The current arrangement is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation ( ACT ) , responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces , and Allied Command Operations ( ACO ) , responsible for NATO operations worldwide . Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps , including Eurocorps , I. German / Dutch Corps , Multinational Corps Northeast , and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others , as well as naval High Readiness Forces ( <unk> ) , which all report to Allied Command Operations . 
 In early 2015 , in the wake of the War in Donbass , meetings of NATO ministers decided that Multinational Corps Northeast would be augmented so as to develop greater capabilities , to , if thought necessary , prepare to defend the Baltic States , and that a new Multi @-@ National Division Southeast would be established in Romania . Six NATO Force Integration Units would also be established to coordinate preparations for defence of new Eastern members of NATO . 
 = Lazare Ponticelli = 
 Lazare Ponticelli ( born Lazzaro Ponticelli , 24 December 1897 , later <unk> as 7 December – 12 March 2008 ) , Knight of Vittorio Veneto , was at 110 , the last surviving officially recognized veteran of the First World War from France and the last <unk> of its trenches to die . 
 Born in Italy , he travelled on his own to France at the age of eight . Aged 16 , he lied about his age in order to join the French Army at the start of the war in 1914 , before being transferred against his will to the Italian Army the following year . After the war , he and his brothers founded the piping and metal work company Ponticelli Frères ( Ponticelli Brothers ) , which produced supplies for the Second World War effort and as of 2009 was still in business . 
 Ponticelli was the oldest living man of Italian birth and the oldest man living in France at the time of his death . Every Armistice Day until 2007 he attended ceremonies honoring deceased veterans . In his later years , he criticized war , and stored his awards from the First World War in a shoe box . While he felt unworthy of the state funeral the French government offered him , he eventually accepted one . However , he asked that the procession emphasise the common soldiers who died on the battlefield . French president Nicolas Sarkozy honored his wish and dedicated a plaque to them at the procession . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born as Lazzaro Ponticelli in <unk> <unk> , a frazione ( civil parish ) in <unk> , Piacenza , Emilia @-@ Romagna , in northern Italy , he was raised in the mountain hamlet of I <unk> , one of seven children born to Jean and <unk> Ponticelli . His father sold livestock on the fairgrounds and occasionally worked as a carpenter and cobbler . 
 His mother cultivated the family 's small plot of land and , like many women of the area , commuted three times a year to the Po Valley to work in its rice fields . Despite the Ponticelli family 's hard work , they were impoverished and the children often went to bed on an empty stomach . When Lazare was two years of age , his mother moved to France to earn a better living . After the unexpected deaths of Jean Ponticelli and his eldest son , Pierre , the rest of the family moved to Paris , leaving Lazare in the care of neighbors . 
 At age six , Ponticelli started several jobs , including making clogs . By 1906 , aged eight years old , he had saved enough money to buy a railway ticket to Paris , which he considered " paradise . " To travel to the capital of France , he walked 21 miles ( 34 km ) to the nearest train station at Piacenza . He could not speak French , but found work as a chimney sweep in Nogent @-@ sur @-@ Marne and later as a paper boy in Paris . He obtained a work permit at age 13 . 
 = = World War I = = 
 In August 1914 , aged 16 , shortly after the outbreak of World War I , Ponticelli was assigned to the 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion . He had lied about his age to enlist . He rediscovered his older brother , Céleste Ponticelli , who had joined the same regiment . According to Ponticelli , France had done much for him , and serving was his way of showing his gratitude . He served at Soissons in Picardy , northeast France , and at Douaumont , near Verdun . Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches . In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others , he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg , respectively . 
 Ponticelli was not a French citizen and in May 1915 , when Italy entered the war , he was conscripted into the Italian Army . Although he attempted to remain with his French regiment , he eventually enlisted in the 3rd Alpini Regiment , after being escorted to Turin by two gendarmes . Ponticelli saw service against the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army at Mount Piccolo on the Austria – Italy border . At his new post as a machine gunner , Ponticelli was seriously wounded by a shell during an assault on an Austrian mountain position . He was returned to his post after rest and recuperation in Naples . In an undated interview , he described being injured : " Blood was running into my eyes ... I continued firing despite my wound . " 
 Once , his regiment ceased fighting the Austrians for three weeks . The armies , who mostly spoke each other 's tongue , swapped loaves of bread for tobacco and photographed each other . In 1918 Ponticelli was gassed in an Austrian attack that killed hundreds of his fellow soldiers . Reflecting on war , he said : " You shoot at men who are fathers . War is completely stupid . " In one of his last interviews , Ponticelli stated he was amazed at his own survival .

 After being demobilized in 1920 , Ponticelli founded a metal work company with Céleste and Bonfils , his youngest brother , which they called " Ponticelli Frères " ( " Ponticelli Brothers " ) . Located in the 13th arrondissement of Paris , it became profitable and well known in its field . It was incorporated as a private limited company in 1932 , when its primary work was with industrial chimneys . 
 During the Second World War , Ponticelli , who became a French citizen in 1939 , was too old for combat but supported the war effort by supplying soldiers with his products . He moved his factory into an unoccupied zone when Germany invaded and occupied France . After Vichy France was taken over by the Germans , he returned northwards and began working with the Resistance . In the aftermath of World War II , he added a piping department to his company . He continued managing the company until his retirement in 1960 . At the time of his death it was reported that the company had 4 @,@ 000 employees and its annual revenue ( 2005 ) was € 300 million . The company now operates in several countries outside France , such as Angola .

 Until his death , Ponticelli lived with his daughter in the Paris suburb of Le Kremlin @-@ Bicêtre , and every 11 November until 2007 he attended Armistice Day ceremonies . An honored citizen of his adopted town , Ponticelli voted in the 2007 presidential and legislative elections . He officially became a supercentenarian on 24 December 2007 , celebrating his official 110th birthday at the National History of Immigration Museum . He kept his war medals in a shoebox . 
 When originally offered a state funeral by then French President Jacques Chirac , Ponticelli asserted that he did not want one , although the death of the penultimate recognized soldier , [ b ] Louis de <unk> , on 20 January 2008 caused him to reconsider . He eventually accepted a small ceremony " in the name of all those who died , men and women , " during World War I.

 = DNA ( Little Mix song ) =

Released as the album 's second single , the song was solicited to contemporary radio stations in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2012 . Syco digitally released the single in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 9 November 2012 . It was written by TMS , Iain James and Little Mix , while the production was handled by TMS . " DNA " is an electronic pop ballad , which incorporates R & B and techno pop musical styles . Lyrically , the song contains multiple references to scientific vocabulary and is based on themes of love and obsession . 
 " DNA " garnered positive reviews from music critics , who praised the group 's powerful vocals and the song 's darker sound . The song received comparisons to Katy Perry 's song " E.T. " ( 2011 ) , which was an inspirational factor in its development . " DNA " was commercially successful , debuting and peaking at number three the UK Singles Chart with sales of 72 @,@ 044 copies , becoming the group 's third consecutive top three hit there . It also reached the top ten in Ireland , Hungary and Scotland , and was certified gold in Australia where it peaked at number 48 . 
 The accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield and was released on 19 October 2012 . Filmed in comic book movie style , it portrays Little Mix as female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men who they are obsessed with . Critics noted the similarities from the video with that of comic series Sin City and fictional character Catwoman , and gave it positive reviews for it . Little Mix have performed " DNA " on television shows Loose Women and The X Factor . They also performed the song as a continuation of the music video 's storyline on their DNA Tour ( 2013 ) .

 In January 2012 , Little Mix begun recording songs for their debut album . The group worked with production team TMS , and Iain James on a number of songs at The Music Shed in London , England , four of which were chosen for the album . One of these four songs was " DNA , " which subsequently became the title of the album . The song originated from the group 's personal experiences in romantic situations . The group wanted to create a song about their own experiences so that they could improve the quality of their live performances . Edwards said : " We perform better when the lyrics mean something to us when we sing them . " " DNA " was developed to manifest a completely different side to Little Mix . When creating the song , Little Mix took into consideration which of their performances during their time on The X Factor was the most popular . Their performance of Katy Perry 's " E.T. " was the week during The X Factor where the group received the most votes . The group 's version of " E.T. " was perceived as " quite dark " by Jade Thirlwall , in turn , Thirlwall said that the group wanted " DNA " to showcase a darker side of the group . Thirlwall told Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post that the song was also inspired to show how the group has grown in maturity . 
 Little Mix co @-@ wrote " DNA " with TMS and Iain James . TMS developed the song 's guitar riff , drum beats and synths . It received additional vocal engineering from Daniel <unk> and Ben Collier . Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach , USA , and Tom Coyne was responsible for the song 's mastering . " DNA " was based on the emotions a girl develops when she first meets and dates a boy . In an interview with Emily Laurence of Seventeen , Perrie Edwards explained : " When a girl first gets with a boy , that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy . That 's what ' DNA ' is about . " The group wrote " DNA " as a unique love song by coming up with scientific ideas that would match with love . It was also written as a song about obsession . Speaking to Tim Jonze of The Guardian , Leigh @-@ Anne Pinnock mentioned : " It 's not just a love song , it 's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme . And sometimes when things go bad you do go like that , you stalk them on Facebook ... "

 On 31 August 2012 , Jesy Nelson told Jenn Selby of Glamour that Little Mix 's third single will be completely different from their previous two , and that it will show a different side to the group that has never been seen before . Leigh @-@ Anne Pinnock went on to reveal to Selby that the song will serve as the album 's second single , in turn resulting in the group 's debut single " Cannonball " not featuring on the album altogether . Pinnock added that the second single was a pending choice between two songs at that time , and that the group were leaning towards the " darker " and " different " track . Speaking to Selby , Pinnock reasoned the group 's choice : " It 's just a chance for us to show that we can be really serious and really show off our vocals well . This one 's really about the vocals . " On 11 September 2012 , details of the song and its title were revealed when music industry insiders were played a preview of " DNA " during the Sony Music Entertainment Conference Day . Following the conference , Chart Show TV described the song as an " electro ballad " on Twitter . Before promptly deleting the tweet , they added that the song is " very cool " and has " big vocals " . On 27 September 2012 , In : Demand announced that " DNA " will be sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2012 . The song then leaked onto the internet on 28 September 2012 , two days before its radio premiere .

After the second chorus , the song almost stops completely before a half @-@ rapped , half @-@ spoken middle eight , followed by a choral breakdown . The choral breakdown , described as " Gothic " by many critics , gives way to brief rave klaxon instrumentation . Viewed as a dark song by Little Mix and music critics alike , " DNA " sees the group depart from their fun and upbeat sound on previous single , " Wings " . It has been heavily compared to Katy Perry 's " E.T. " , which was an influential factor in the song 's development .

 = Fort Bayard ( Washington , D.C. ) = 
 Fort Bayard was an earthwork fort constructed in 1861 northwest of Tenleytown in the District of Columbia as part of the defenses of Washington , D.C. during the American Civil War . It never faced major opposition during the conflict and was decommissioned following the surrender of Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia . Named after Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard , who was killed at the Battle of Fredericksburg , the site of the fort is in Boundary Park , located at the intersection of River Road and Western Avenue NW in Washington , D.C. and is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service . No trace of the fort remains , though a marker commemorating its existence has been constructed by the Park Service . 
 = = Pre @-@ war use = = 
 Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War , the District of Columbia was a predominantly rural area . Though the city of Washington is today synonymous with the District of Columbia , in 1861 , Washington occupied only a portion of the District . The remaining portions of the District were considered part of Washington County , and it was in this region that most of the forts defending Washington , including Fort Bayard , were constructed . Washington County was characterized as " the rural part of the district ... occupied by farms of various sizes and the grand estates of the well @-@ to @-@ do . " 
 The site of Fort Bayard itself was owned by Philip J. Buckey , a farmer who made his home in the Fourth Ward of Washington County . During the construction process , he valued the land at approximately $ 5 @,@ 000 , and continued to live in a farmhouse near the fort with his wife , four children , and two servants throughout the course of the war . In exchange for the use of his land for the site of Fort Bayard , Buckey received $ 50 @.@ 00 per year in rent from the War Department . 
 Also nearby was the Shoemaker family , which owned substantial tracts of land in both the District and in Maryland . Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property : Fort Simmons , Fort Mansfield , and Battery Bailey . Despite the loss of much of their land , the Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry items to the garrison at Fort Bayard . 
 = = Planning and construction = = 
 Following the secession of Virginia and that state joining the Confederacy , Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of northern Virginia . The move was intended to forestall any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate States Army to seize the capital city of the United States . Over the next seven weeks , forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges ( Chain Bridge , Long Bridge , and Aqueduct Bridge ) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown . 
 While the Potomac River forts were being built , planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city . Unlike the fortifications under construction , the new forts would defend the city in all directions , not just the most direct route through Arlington . In mid @-@ July , this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run . As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas , the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle . In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run , panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack . The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington . 
 On July 26 , 1861 , five days after the battle , Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac . Upon arriving in Washington , McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city 's defenses . " In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of the enemy , either in the position and numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works ... not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side . There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range , which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance . " 
 To remedy the situation , one of McClellan 's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington . At all points of the compass , forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to slow an attack and buy time for reinforcements to arrive and bolster the city 's defenses . Brigadier General John G. Barnard , was named chief engineer of the Department of Washington , and would supervise the construction and maintenance of the forts before being named chief engineer of the armies in the field by Ulysses S. Grant in 1864 . 
 Prior to the outbreak of war , the Great Falls Turnpike , also known as River Road , was an important traffic artery for trade entering the District of Columbia from western Maryland and beyond . It connected the village of Tenleytown with the city of Washington , and roughly paralleled the Potomac River before turning northward . Due to its strategic position along the river , which formed the border between the Confederate state of Virginia and the Union state of Maryland , it had great military value and was a likely route for an attacking army , as would be proved three years after the outbreak of war during the Battle of Fort Stevens . 
 To prevent a Confederate force from advancing on Washington along the Potomac , several forts were constructed on hills near the river . To guard River Road , which was the most direct route into the city , U.S. Army engineers built a small , round fort at the point where River Road crossed into the district of Columbia . With a perimeter of only 123 yards and mounting only six guns , it was located forward of Fort Reno , the largest fort protecting the Tenleytown area . Details of the actual construction process are scarce , though a letter from a member of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery regiment to the Democratic Press newspaper indicates that the fort was at least partially built with labor from that regiment . 
 In April 1863 , the fort was named in honor of the recently deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard , who had been killed on December 13 , 1862 , at the Battle of Fredericksburg . At the time of its dedication , the fort was roughly complete . Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and <unk> , the fort 's guns faced north , overlooking River Road . A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half of the fort , connecting with River Road behind the fort . Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons . A small battery of guns , named Battery Bayard , was an outwork of the fort and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of the fort .

 In accordance to a plan laid out in an October 1861 report by General John G. Barnard , " rear line " forts were to receive one man per yard of fort perimeter when fully garrisoned . Front @-@ line forts were to receive two men per yard , when needed . However , most forts were not kept fully garrisoned at all times . Due to its location north of the Potomac River , Fort Bayard was considered a rear @-@ line fort . If the fort needed to be fully garrisoned due to an impending attack , the difference in the actual garrison and the plan would be made good from Washington 's 25 @,@ 000 @-@ man reserve force . As General Barnard would say in a December 24 , 1862 report , " It is seldom necessary to keep these infantry supports attached to the works . " 
 However , this plan only applied to men manning the walls of the fort , not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort 's guns . To man the guns of Fort Greble and those of Washington 's other forts , Barnard designated three crews for each gun . These crews would be permanently located at the fort , unlike the men assigned to the walls of the fort . 
 This plan was affected by the needs of the war . As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted , the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements . By 1864 , Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard 's 1861 recommendation . 
 A May 1864 report by General Albion P. Howe , inspector of artillery for the Union Army , found Fort Bayard 's garrison to consist of only a single company from the Seventh New York Heavy Artillery regiment . One hundred and thirty @-@ seven men of various ranks manned two 12 @-@ pound field howitzers and four 20 @-@ pound Parrott rifles . In addition , Howe found the fort 's single magazine to be " dry and in good order , " and the ammunition supply as " full and <unk> . " As to the garrison of the fort , Howe was less complimentary . After examining the garrison company 's drill in artillery and infantry tactics , he reported the artillery drill as " ordinary ; needs improving , " the infantry drill as " very indifferent ; needs much improving , " and discipline at the fort overall was " indifferent . " 
 <unk> and infantry from New Hampshire , Pennsylvania , Ohio , and New York were stationed at the fort at various times during the war . Following General Howe 's unfavorable review of the Seventh New York , the garrison was replaced by a company of men from the 163rd Ohio Infantry . 
 = = = Battle of Fort Stevens = = = 
 During the course of the war , Fort Bayard came under attack only once . During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864 , Confederate general Jubal Early launched a 25 @,@ 000 @-@ man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant 's troops , who were pressing hard against the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg . The raid hoped to attack Washington , thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup . On the morning of July 11 , Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno , which defended the village of Tenleytown . Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard , the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts . Discouraged by the resistance , McCausland 's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early 's force , which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens . 
 Throughout the day , additional reinforcements arrived at the fort , but no further Confederate attack took place . During the remainder of the war , Fort Bayard did not fire a shot in anger .

 After the surrender of Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9 , 1865 , the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist . Initial recommendations by Col. Barton S. Alexander , chief engineer of the Washington defenses , were to divide the defenses into three classes : those that should be kept active ( first @-@ class ) , those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state ( second @-@ class ) , and those that should be abandoned entirely ( third @-@ class ) . Owing to its position north of the Potomac River and to the small size of the fort , Fort Bayard fell into the third @-@ class category , and was abandoned a few months after the end of the war . 
 = = = Fort Bayard Park = = = 
 The abandoned fort remained in a constantly deteriorating condition until 1919 , when the Commissioners of the District of Columbia pushed Congress to pass a bill that would consolidate the sites of the aging forts into a " Fort Circle " system of parks that would ring the growing city of Washington . As envisioned by the Commissioners , the Fort Circle would be a green ring of parks outside the city , owned by the government , and connected by a " Fort Drive " road in order to allow Washington 's citizens to easily escape the confines of the capital . However , the bill allowing for the purchase of the former forts , which had been turned back over to private ownership after the war , failed to pass both the House of Representatives and Senate . 
 Despite that failure , in 1925 a similar bill passed both the House and Senate , which allowed for the creation of the National Capital Parks Commission ( NCPC ) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919 . The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s , eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the project in the 1940s . By the time the site of Fort Bayard was purchased in 1926 , the remains of the fort had been demolished and homes were being built on the site . 
 Budget cuts and the interruption of World War II repeatedly postponed the Fort Circle Park plan , but it was the growth of the city of Washington itself that eventually killed the plan . By 1963 , when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress to finally build the Fort Circle Drive , many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly questioning whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness . After all , by this time , Washington had grown past the ring of forts that had protected it a century earlier , and city surface roads already connected the parks , albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned . The plan to link Fort Bayard Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the years that followed . 
 Today , the park is bordered by Western Avenue , River Road , and Fessenden , 46th and 47th Streets , NW in Washington , D.C. It contains one softball field and one soccer field , and is maintained year @-@ round by the U.S. National Park Service . In 1999 , neighborhood residents established Friends of Fort Bayard Park , Inc . , a non @-@ profit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) corporation with the goal of assisting the National Park Service in maintaining Fort Bayard Park . To this end , the organization hosts an annual cleanup of the park , and holds fundraisers in order to build improvements at the park . 
 = Crane and Company Old Stone Mill Rag Room = 
 The Crane and Company Old Stone Mill Rag Room is one of the oldest surviving buildings ( built in 1844 ) of Crane & Co . , one of the oldest papermaking businesses in Berkshire County , Massachusetts . It is located in southwestern Dalton , on a site where paper has been manufactured since the early 19th century . The building , originally used for processing rags , has housed the Crane Museum of <unk> since 1930 , and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1983 . 
 Zenas Crane began making paper in Dalton in 1801 , taking full ownership of an established operation at the Rag Room site in 1822 . In the mid @-@ 1840s his sons constructed the Old Stone Mill , of which the Rag Room is the only surviving portion . The Rag Room is where Crane 's grandson Winthrop Murray Crane learned the business ; through his efforts Crane secured a monopoly contract to provide paper for the nation 's currency , which it still holds today . 
 The Rag Room is a gray fieldstone building with a slate roof . Its interior is a large open space that houses exhibits and artifacts of the company 's history . It is open to the public at no charge . 
 = = History = = 
 Zenas Crane ( 1777 – 1845 ) was educated in the processes of paper manufacturing in a mill owned by his brother Stephen in Newton Lower Falls , Massachusetts . After a stint at another paper mill in Worcester , Crane traveled west into Berkshire County in 1799 , looking for potential papermaking sites . He found a highly desirable site in Dalton , but the owner , a local farmer , was unwilling to part with it . Crane instead established his business on a nearby parcel in 1801 . Other <unk> followed over the next ten years , notably Henry <unk> and David Carson , who acquired the more desirable site and established what became known as the Red Mill . Through a series of partnership and purchase transactions , Crane eventually acquired control of the Red Mill , taking full ownership in 1822 . 
 In 1842 Zenas Crane retired , leaving control of the Red Mill to his sons Zenas Marshall Crane and James Brewer Crane . They founded Crane & Co . , and set about expanding the business , beginning construction of what became known as the Stone Mill . The Rag Room was part of this construction effort , and was built in 1844 . In 1869 the Stone Mill was damaged by fire ; while it was being repaired in 1870 the Red Mill was destroyed by fire . The Stone Mill was then expanded , and also became known as the Pioneer Mill . The Stone Mill was used by the firm until the 1890s , when most of it was demolished , leaving only the Rag Room . 
 In 1930 the company adapted the Rag Room for use as the company museum , a role it has filled since . Following plans developed by architect Charles S. Keefe , the company reinforced the building 's foundation with steel and concrete , filling in a number of its windows with stonework . The interior was significantly reworked , with new structural woodwork and flooring . Upon completion the interior was said to resemble that of the Old Ship Church in Hingham , Massachusetts . In 1967 the company retained the Olmsted Brothers firm to design landscaping of the area , although their work has since been compromised to some extent by later development on the property . The site was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 . In 2005 it became part of the listed <unk> Historic District , which includes , among other properties , the 1816 home of Zenas Crane . 
 The Rag Room was where Zenas Marshall Crane 's son , Winthrop Murray Crane ( 1853 – 1920 ) , began his career in the papermaking business . In 1878 he was responsible for acquiring Crane & Co . ' s exclusive government contract to manufacture the paper used in the currency of the United States . In addition to running Crane & Co. during the late 19th century , Murray Crane served as Governor of Massachusetts and United States Senator , and played an influential role in Republican Party politics . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Rag Room is a single @-@ room single @-@ story gray fieldstone building . It is three window bays wide and seven long , featuring stepped gable ends and a slate roof . It originally stood at the southwest part of the Stone Mill complex , and its north end was where it connected to the larger mill buildings . The building was where rags arriving at the mill were processed at the start of the papermaking operation . 
 In 1930 the northern facade was given a proper entranceway with transomed doors and Doric columns below a frieze identifying the building as the Crane Museum . Above this doorway a circular window was also added . The slate roof and its support beams were also replaced in 1930 , but without altering the exterior lines of the building . A late 19th century brick addition to the east side of the building ( not a part of the landmark designation ) is screened from view by plantings . The interior of the building is a single large space in which artifacts from the company 's history are displayed . Displays include tools used by Zenas Crane and a replica of the early vat process equipment used to make paper .
