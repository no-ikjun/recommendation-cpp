 = The Mountain Eagle = 
 The Mountain Eagle is a 1927 British silent film , and Alfred Hitchcock 's second as director following The Pleasure Garden . The film , a romantic melodrama set in Kentucky , is about a widower ( Bernhard Goetzke ) who jealously competes with his crippled son ( John F. Hamilton ) and a man he loathes ( Malcolm Keen ) over the affections of a schoolteacher ( Nita Naldi ) . The film was mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich , Germany in autumn of 1925 , with exterior scenes shot in the village of Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol , Austria . Production was plagued with problems , including the destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness . Due to producing the film in Germany , Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England , and he was influenced by German cinematic style and technique . 
 The film was screened for the producers in October 1926 who did not approve of it , and it wasn 't until after the success of Hitchcock 's The Lodger : A Story of the London Fog that they released the film in May 1927 . The film was poorly received and criticised for its lack of realism , and Hitchcock himself was relieved that the film was lost . Six surviving stills of The Mountain Eagle are reproduced in François Truffaut 's book , and further stills have been found to exist . In 2012 , a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock 's close friends . The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described it as " the most wanted film in the world " , and the British Film Institute has the film on the top of their list of missing films and is actively searching for it . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film is set in Kentucky . J. P. Pettigrew 's ( Bernhard Goetzke ) wife died giving birth to his son Edward ( John F. Hamilton ) , who was born a cripple . Pettigrew loathes John ( " Fear o ' God " ) Fulton ( Malcolm Keen ) who was also in love with Pettigrew 's wife . Pettigrew witnesses his now grown son making love to schoolteacher Beatrice ( Nita Naldi ) and confronts her about the relationship . He attempts to take her in his arms but Beatrice rejects his advances . Pettigrew 's son Edward sees this and flees the village . 
 Pettigrew is incensed at both Beatrice 's rejection and the loss of his son . He attempts to have Beatrice arrested as a wanton harlot . John <unk> Pettigrew 's plan by marrying Beatrice and taking her to his cabin where they fall in love . Beatrice becomes pregnant . Pettigrew seeks revenge by having John thrown in prison for murdering his ( missing ) son . 
 A year later , John breaks out of prison and attempts to flee with Beatrice and their child . However , Beatrice falls ill and John must return to the village for a doctor . There he finds that Edward has reappeared . John 's affairs are now cleared up and he is legally free from the charge of murder . Pettigrew is subsequently accidentally shot and no longer a threat to John and his family .

 This is the only feature film directed by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film , which means that no prints of the film are known to exist . Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut 's book . More stills have recently been found to exist , many of which are reproduced in Dan <unk> 's book . A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley , Massachusetts . In 2012 , a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock 's close friends . Although these images gave clues to the film and its story , they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself . They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $ 6 @,@ 000 ( £ 3 @,@ 700 ) . Hitchcock 's notebooks were also found which documented his journey to Obergurgl , by train , horse and cart , and by foot . 
 = = Production = = 
 Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were produced in co @-@ operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich , Germany . The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich in the fall of 1925 , and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl , in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria , the <unk> Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky . Due to producing the film in Germany , Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England , and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works . 
 Production was plagued with problems . Bad weather during the shooting was a constant source of trouble , and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals . Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away , causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse . The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling , but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience . Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn , and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness , he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The film was initially screened for the producers in October 1926 , but they didn 't think much of the film and decided to shelve it . However , due to the runaway success of The Lodger : A Story of the London Fog , which was released in February 1927 , the producers decided to release The Mountain Eagle three months later on 23 May 1927 . The film was reportedly released in the United States as Fear o ' God , but the title on the surviving US lobby card seems to contradict this . Film historian J. Larry <unk> claims that the film was never released under that title . 
 The film , distributed by Gainsborough Pictures , was neither a critical nor commercial success ; Leonard J. Leff states that the film " impressed neither the distributor nor the public " . Like Hitchcock 's other early films , the film was criticised for a lack of realism ; an early review by Bioscope stated that " in spite of skilful and at times brilliant direction , the story has an air of unreality . " Hitchcock himself considered The Mountain Eagle to be mundane melodrama best forgotten , and described the film to François Truffaut as " awful " and a " very bad movie " and stated that he was not sorry that there are no known prints . After being bitterly disappointed with his first two films , Hitchcock believed that his directing career would soon be over , although he later described Waltzes from Vienna ( 1934 ) to be the " lowest ebb " of his career . Film historian J. Lary <unk> , however , states in the book Hitchcock 's Notebooks by Dan <unk> that one contemporary writer called The Mountain Eagle far superior to The Lodger . The Guardian describes the film as " a ripping yarn about a dastardly father , a crippled son , a lovely schoolteacher and an innocent imprisoned " . 
 William Rothman considers both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle to be " equally worthy of study " . The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described The Mountain Eagle as " the most wanted film in the world " . In 1992 , the British Film Institute released its first " Missing Presumed Lost " list of films , and in January 2010 they announced that they had begun actively searching for some 75 missing films , including The Mountain Eagle ; A Study in Scarlet ( 1914 ) , which features the first screen appearance of the Sherlock Holmes character ; The First Men in the Moon ( 1919 ) , which is the first H. G. Wells @-@ adapted science @-@ fiction ; and Dinah <unk> 's The Last Post ( 1929 ) . 
 = 1985 Election day floods = 
 The 1985 Election Day floods ( also known as the Killer Floods of 1985 in West Virginia ) produced the costliest floods in both West Virginia and Virginia in November 1985 . The event occurred after Hurricane Juan , a tropical cyclone in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season , meandered near the coast of Louisiana before striking just west of Pensacola , Florida late on October 31 . Juan moved northward into Canada , but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid @-@ Atlantic States , wetting soils . On November 3 , a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front , bringing a plume of moisture influenced by Juan 's previous track . The storm moved through the southeastern United States , stalling on November 5 west of Washington , D.C. before turning out to sea the next day . The event was known as the Election Day floods due to its concurrence with elections in Virginia . 
 Damage was heaviest in Virginia and West Virginia . In the former state , the rainfall peaked at 19 @.@ 77 in ( 502 mm ) just northeast of Montebello . The rains increased levels along many rivers to record heights across Virginia , including the James River which crested at 42 @.@ 15 feet ( 12 @.@ 85 m ) at a station called Holcomb Rock , the highest level in the state . In Roanoke , the Roanoke River rose 18 @.@ 57 ft ( 5 @.@ 66 m ) in ten hours to a peak of 23 @.@ 35 ft ( 7 @.@ 12 m ) , considered a 1 in 200 year event . In the city , many residents had to be rescued after they were trapped , and three people drowned by driving into flooded waters . Considered the worst flood on record in the city , Roanoke sustained $ 225 million in damage , with 3 @,@ 100 damaged homes and businesses . There was also flooding in Richmond after the James River crested at the second @-@ highest level on record . Throughout Virginia , damage was estimated at $ 753 million , making it the state 's costliest flood at the time , and there were 22 deaths . 
 In West Virginia , 27 river gauging stations were 1 in 100 year events , mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins . As most of West Virginia 's liveable land is along flood plains , the river flooding caused heavy damage in the state , mostly in the eastern portion . High waters washed away topsoil and thousands of trees , and over 13 @,@ 000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in the state . Damage was estimated at nearly $ 700 million , making it West Virginia 's costliest flood , and there were 38 deaths . Flooding also affected Maryland , although to a lesser degree than neighboring Virginia , with $ 21 million in damage and one death . There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm , which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline . In Pennsylvania , flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state 's southwest portion . During the storm , a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity , triggering a class action lawsuit that ultimately failed . The floods damaged or destroyed 3 @,@ 349 houses in Pennsylvania , causing $ 83 million in damage , as well as one death . 
 Overall damage was estimated at $ 1 @.@ 4 billion , which would have been the fourth costliest United States hurricanes if it were a tropical cyclone , and there were 62 overall deaths . The flooding spurred changes to warning practices by the National Weather Service and the Government of Virginia . In December 2011 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed a flood mitigation project in Roanoke , Virginia that began following the 1985 floods . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Early on October 26 , a tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico , and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward . The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature . Due to weak steering currents , Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped again over the state , weakening into a tropical storm over land on October 29 . The storm turned eastward and later northeastward , striking just west of Pensacola , Florida late on October 31 . Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November 1 over Tennessee . After the remnants of Juan continued to the north into Canada , it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley . This low continued to the east through North Carolina , bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region , and saturating soils ; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating . 
 On November 3 , while the low was located over North Carolina , a stationary cold front extended from the Gulf of Mexico through Michigan , which absorbed the remnants of Juan . That day , a low pressure area developed in the Gulf of Mexico south of the Florida panhandle and tracked to the northeast along the front , bringing a plume of warm tropical air into the east @-@ central United States ; the previously erratic motion of Hurricane Juan allowed this flow of moisture to extend into the mid @-@ Atlantic . As a result , dew points reached over 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) in North Carolina , which is unusually high for the time of year . As the storm moved through the Carolinas , it produced an area of convection , or thunderstorms , that extended to the north and west . The low stalled over Virginia on November 5 to the west of Washington , D.C. , before turning to the east and exiting into the Atlantic Ocean , with rainfall ending on November 6 . 
 = = Preparations and warnings = = 
 Ahead of the main rainfall event , the National Weather Service ( NWS ) forecast office in Washington , D.C. issued a flood watch for southwestern Virginia , but canceled it early on November 4 after the heaviest rainfall was expected to continue to the northeast . Also that day , the NWS issued flood watches and warnings for portions of West Virginia . Later , special weather statements were issued in Virginia due to the continued rainfall . The Roanoke , Virginia NWS office lost telephone service shortly before the arrival of the flooding , which created difficulties in distributing warning information . Based on the rapid level increase of the Roanoke River , the Raleigh , North Carolina NWS issued a flash flood warning for Roanoke and its surrounding vicinity . The NWS also issued a river flood warning , initially anticipating a crest of 11 ft ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) , and later increasing the estimate to 23 ft ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) . In Virginia and Maryland along the western coast of the Chesapeake Bay , several low @-@ lying and small coastal communities were evacuated . About 18 @,@ 000 people were forced to evacuate in western Virginia due to river flooding . In West Virginia , residents relied on fire and civil defense sirens to receive warning about the floods , although some people in flood areas failed to receive any warning . Before the arrival of the floods , 23 of the 55 counties lacked updated disaster plans due to insufficient staff or funding , and as a result 29 counties ' plans were rated " poor " or " very poor " by Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The system dropped rainfall from North Carolina to Pennsylvania , westward to Ohio , with a peak of 19 @.@ 77 in ( 502 mm ) just northeast of Montebello , Virginia . Widespread areas reported over 10 in ( 250 mm ) of precipitation , with an unofficial total of about 14 in ( 360 mm ) in West Virginia . Flash flooding occurred in mountainous portions of Virginia , West Virginia , and Pennsylvania , after orographic lift caused particularly high rainfall totals in the southern Appalachian Mountains . A total of 63 gauging stations along rivers and streams recorded flood magnitudes greater than the 100 @-@ year event , of which 40 surpassed the previous record by more than 50 % . In addition to the floods , the storm produced the highest tidal flooding in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries since the 1933 Chesapeake – Potomac hurricane , and in some cases surpassed that of Hurricane Hazel in 1954 . This was due to persistent southeasterly winds just days after a full moon , causing tides that reached 4 to 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 5 m ) above normal in many places in Maryland , with 6 to 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) waves on top . Overall damage totaled $ 1 @.@ 4 billion , and the system killed 62 people ; if the system were a tropical cyclone , it would have ranked as the fourth costliest United States hurricane . 
 While moving through the southeastern United States , the storm produced gale force winds along the Outer Banks , and there were reports of two weak tornadoes that damaged boats . Rainfall reached 12 in ( 300 mm ) in eastern North Carolina , which flooded coastal cities in combination with high tides . Crop damage in the state was estimated at $ 1 @.@ 5 million , mostly to the soybean and wheat harvests . Flooding reached a depth of 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) in some places , which damaged roads and affected a trailer park in Hertford County . The floods also destroyed a fish building in Colerain . In the Piedmont interior , the rainfall flooded streams , flooding some roads and houses , while in mountainous portions , upwards of 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) of snow fell . 
 The high rainfall caused levels to increase along the Ohio River in Kentucky . Rainfall spread as far north as New York , which flooded basements in Amherst and increased levels along streams . 
 = = = Virginia = = = 
 The high rainfall caused many rivers to rise above their banks across Virginia , becoming among the top three highest crests on record along several rivers in the state . The flood set the highest river stage on record along the Roanoke River at Roanoke , Tinker Creek near <unk> , the <unk> River at Goshen , the Craig Creek at Parr , and the James River at Buchanan , Holcomb Rock , and Bent Creek . At Holcomb Rock , the James River crested at 42 @.@ 15 feet ( 12 @.@ 85 m ) , the highest in the state , and was about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) above flood stage ; based on the observations and the associated discharge , the return period was estimated as greater than a 1 in 500 year event . River gauges recorded record discharge rates at 34 stations , of which 32 were 100 year events . The rains delayed crops from being planted across the state and caused minor crop damage . Across the state , about 3 @,@ 500 houses were destroyed . Overall , the storm system caused 22 deaths and $ 753 million , greater than the devastating hurricanes Camille and Agnes , and making it the costliest flood in the state 's history . 
 The city of Roanoke recorded 6 @.@ 61 in ( 168 mm ) in a 24 ‑ hour period , the highest 24 ‑ hour total on record for the city since records began in 1912 ; of the total , 4 @.@ 25 in ( 108 mm ) fell in about three hours . After previously wet conditions , the Roanoke River at Roanoke rapidly rose 18 @.@ 57 ft ( 5 @.@ 66 m ) in ten hours to its peak of 23 @.@ 35 ft ( 7 @.@ 12 m ) , well above the flood stage of 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . The floods were considered a 1 in 200 year event , and in one instance near Salem , the waters rose to the height of a three story building . Many surrounding rivers , including the James River , also rose , with 63 peak discharge rates in local streams . The high rivers flooded much of downtown Roanoke , including roads , rail lines , houses , and businesses , with some roads and bridges closed for weeks . Residents survived by holding onto trees , while others , some trapped in their cars , required rescue ; one helicopter rescued 125 stranded people . There were 10 deaths in and around Roanoke , including three who drove into flooded rivers , and three others who refused to evacuate . The floods damaged about 3 @,@ 000 homes and 100 businesses . Overall monetary damage in the city was estimated at $ 225 million , with $ 520 million in the entire metropolitan area , making it the city 's worst flood on record . 
 Across the Shenandoah Valley , the flooding caused widespread damage , notably in Rockingham County where the floods damaged most of the roads , and entered 4 @,@ 000 houses and 350 farms . Along the Shenandoah River , 13 gauging stations reported new discharge records , including the reading at Verona which was five times the previous record . In Elkton within the county , an 89 ‑ year ‑ old railroad bridge was washed out , although nearby Bridgewater had less flooding due to a levee built in 1949 ; the town sustained minor damage to roads and the hydroelectric plant . In nearby Highland County along the border with West Virginia , the floods damaged 350 homes or barns , and deteriorated $ 2 million worth of roads . In Augusta County , also along the West Virginia border , the Buffalo Creek swept away bridges and roads , with $ 8 million in transportation damage and $ 7 million in other damages in the county . Staunton , a city independent from Augusta County , experienced minimal effects , although the water treatment plant was damaged and a hotel basement was flooded . Waynesboro , also within Augusta County , sustained $ 3 million in damages after the South River reached a record crest , damaging 213 homes and businesses . Damage was particularly heavy in Rockbridge County , estimated at $ 100 million , with 616 homes and businesses ravaged by floods . In Buena Vista alone , the Maury River left $ 50 million in damage , after 3 to 6 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 83 m ) of water entered homes and businesses . Over half of the homes and businesses were damaged in Glasgow . 
 Along the James River , 15 gauging stations reported new records . At Lynchburg , the James River rose to 35 ft ( 11 m ) , surpassing the record set by Hurricane Camille in 1969 by 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) . There , the river swept up entire houses , causing portions of U.S. Route 29 to close , and ruining about $ 8 million worth of tobacco . In Richmond , the James River rose to 30 @.@ 76 ft ( 9 @.@ 38 m ) on November 7 , the second @-@ highest peak on record after the 36 @.@ 51 ft ( 11 @.@ 13 m ) set by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 . The floods in Richmond closed a portion of Interstate 95 , and nearly overtopped the 14th Street Bridge . Three bridges were closed , resulting in heavy traffic due to detours . Portions of the industrial district south of the river was flooded , as were commercial buildings . 
 In eastern Virginia , high winds downed several trees in the eastern portion of the state , causing power outages and blocking roadways . Falling trees struck two vehicles , injuring three people . Along the Chesapeake Bay , high tides severely damaged or destroyed 75 % of piers along the <unk> and Rappahannock rivers . Flooding entered about 150 houses in Colonial Beach , while many adjacent highways and seawalls were heavily damaged . The tides damaged several marinas , sinking several boats . At the mouth of the James River , high waves capsized a crab boat , killing its two passengers . A ferry was also washed aground on the James River . Several beaches lost 15 to 20 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 to 6 @.@ 1 m ) of sand . 
 The floods occurred election day throughout the state , in which Gerald <unk> won the governorship over Wyatt <unk> . The election had a decreased turnout than in 1981 , the first decrease in total votes since 1961 . The floods caused the three districts in western Virginia to have the lowest turnouts in the state , although other counties not affected by the overall system also saw decreased turnout . The event later became known as the " Election Day Floods " due to their concurrence . 
 = = = West Virginia = = = 
 After previously dry conditions , severe flooding also occurred in West Virginia , amplified by the mountainous terrain . Record discharge rates were observed at 25 gauging stations , and 27 stations along rivers were at least 100 year events , setting records along the Potomac and Monongahela rivers , among several others . While washing away large rocks , some streams changed their channels due to the high volume of water . Near Petersburg , the South Branch Potomac River crested at 25 @.@ 4 ft ( 7 @.@ 7 m ) and produced a record discharge of 130 @,@ 000 cu ft ( 3 @,@ 700 m3 ) , and the peak discharge at Franklin was nearly three times the previous record . At five of the six gauging stations along the Potomac , there were new records for discharge rates . Along the Potomac , the floodwaters collected behind dams , causing 21 to exceed the capacity designed to withstand a 100 year flood . All five stations along the Greenbrier River recorded a new record discharge rate , as did all five along the <unk> Valley River . The flash flooding caused the Bloomington Reservoir to rise 80 ft ( 24 m ) in 30 hours . Several caves were flooded , causing high amounts of erosion and damaging some speleothems . After the flooding , Mystic Cave in Pendleton County had tree branches wedged into the ceiling and a layer of sand on the floor . 
 Flooding was worst along the Cheat River , where five of the six gauging stations set new discharge records . At Parsons , the river produced a discharge of 200 @,@ 000 cu ft ( 5 @,@ 700 m3 ) , which was about 3 @.@ 8 times the previous flood record , and 3 @.@ 5 times the rate of a 100 year flood . At <unk> , the Cheat River crested at 36 @.@ 9 feet ( 11 @.@ 2 m ) , which remains the highest on record as of 2013 . At Hendricks , the Dry Fork of the Cheat River had a peak flow of 100 @,@ 000 cu ft ( 2 @,@ 800 m3 ) , more than twice the previous record . 
 As most of the livable land in West Virginia is in the flood plain , the high river flooding caused heavy damage , wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways . A total of 43 bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged . Near Moorefield , the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed , but was reopened after emergency repairs . In Paw Paw , a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge , washing it away . Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18 bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides . The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132 houses in Albright , and washed away a trailer park in <unk> . The flooding downed thousands of trees , which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage . Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris . Many farm structures were washed away , and hundreds of thousands of chicken or turkeys were killed . Statewide , at least 8 @,@ 968 houses were damaged , and another 4 @,@ 000 were destroyed , which left nearly 2 @,@ 600 people homeless . In addition , the floods damaged or destroyed 711 businesses . Agriculture damage was estimated at $ 97 million , and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $ 3 @.@ 9 million . Statewide damage totaled nearly $ 700 million , and 38 people were killed in West Virginia . This made it the most damaging flood in the state 's history , according to then @-@ Governor Arch A. Moore , Jr .

 Flooding in Maryland largely occurred along the Potomac River , primarily along the north branch , as well as downstream after draining floodwaters from Virginia and West Virginia . Two gauging stations recorded new discharge records , although the peak of 235 @,@ 000 cu ft ( 6 @,@ 700 m3 ) at Paw Paw was slightly less than the record set in 1936 . There was also flooding along the Youghiogheny River , which had a peak discharge of 11 @,@ 700 cu ft ( 330 m3 ) at Oakland , just below the record set in 1941 . The floods along the Potomac swept up debris and animals . In Georgetown in Washington , D.C. , the floods reached within 2 in ( 51 mm ) of overtopping the lock , thus preventing significant flooding in the nation 's capital , although floodwaters reached 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep in portions of the neighborhood . Levels along the Potomac in Washington were the third highest on record . Officials closed the Washington Monument , Lincoln Memorial , and Jefferson Memorial for two days due to fears of flooding . The floods left $ 9 million worth of damage to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal between Georgetown and Cumberland , Maryland , which was closed for the first time in its 157 year history . In general , the floods in Maryland caused less damage than in neighboring states , and overall damage in the state was estimated at $ 21 million ; there was one death . 
 Along the Chesapeake Bay , the high tides damaged many piers , bulkheads , and coastal homes along the western coastline of the Chesapeake , mainly in Maryland between St. Mary 's and Anne Arundel counties . High waters damaged roads and entered many cars while also washing away several boats . Along the Atlantic coast , high waves washed away 400 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 310 @,@ 000 m3 ) of beaches in Ocean City , just months after Hurricane Gloria eroded twice that amount of sand . In addition , winds gusted as strong as 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , which downed power lines and left thousands without power . During the storm , a member of the United States Coast Guard was injured while responding to a hoax mayday call . Damage in eastern Maryland totaled over $ 5 million . 
 High rainfall also flooded streams in southwestern Pennsylvania , estimated as 50 year events , and primarily along the Monongahela River . In Point Marion at the confluence of the Monongahela and Cheat rivers , the waters crested at 40 ft ( 12 m ) , or 14 ft ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) above flood stage . There were many evacuation orders after a false report that the Lake Lynn dam had burst , which is located along the Cheat River several miles south of Point Marion in extreme northern West Virginia . The dam , owned by West Penn Power , reached the highest levels in its 60 year history , prompting the company to open flood gates , which flooded Point Marion with 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) of water . The Monongahela River crested at 42 @.@ 7 ft ( 13 @.@ 0 m ) , or 10 @.@ 7 ft ( 3 @.@ 3 m ) above flood state in Brownsville , and rose 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) above flood stage in Greensboro . In the latter city , the peak discharge rate was 220 @,@ 000 cu ft ( 6 @,@ 200 m3 ) , 60 % greater than the previous record , and downstream at Elizabeth , the peak discharge was 178 @,@ 000 cu ft ( 5 @,@ 000 m3 ) , also a record . 
 Damage in Pennsylvania largely occurred along the Monongahela River basin . In Brownsville , 35 businesses were flooded , while in Greensboro , high waters damaged roads and forced 300 people to evacuate . During the floods , 23 barges broke free and became lodged in the Maxwell Lock & Dam , which is an important shipping link ; the lock remained closed for nearly six weeks , costing the local economy $ 20 million in lost production . The same river crested at 44 ft ( 13 m ) in Charleroi , breaking the record set in 1967 . The flooded river caused $ 1 million in damage at California University of Pennsylvania , broke 40 barges from their moorings , and forced about 2 @,@ 600 people to evacuate ; one person in North Charleroi drowned after returning to his evacuated home . Throughout the region , the floods damaged or destroyed 3 @,@ 349 houses , leaving at least 2 @,@ 000 people homeless , and statewide damage was estimated at $ 83 million . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the aftermath of the floods , President Ronald Reagan declared 121 counties or other areas as disaster areas , including 40 counties and 12 independent cities in Virginia , 29 West Virginia counties , and 6 Pennsylvania counties . After a year of hurricanes Elena , Gloria , and Juan , as well as flooding in Puerto Rico , the American Red Cross ran out of funds while responding to the flood disaster , prompting an emergency fundraising appeal . 
 Much of the eastern portion of West Virginia was declared a federal disaster area on November 7 , 1985 . Within two weeks of the declaration , the United States Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) began clearing debris across the state , which was completed by July 1986 . Widespread areas were under a boil @-@ water advisory due to damage to water facilities , prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas . The state 's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings . Workers also buried killed animals , cleared blocked streams , and helped farmers regrow lost crops . FEMA opened 20 disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents ' requests for federal aid , and used 290 full or part @-@ time employees . Overall federal assistance totaled $ 285 million , including $ 171 million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure , $ 90 million for loans and temporary housing , and $ 24 million through payments from the National Flood Insurance Program . This followed a six @-@ week period when applications for such assistance were processed . After receiving complaints about inadequate funding , FEMA increased payments to 869 people . FEMA also built 647 temporary mobile homes , only about half of which were utilized . Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims . Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away . In the city of Parsons , most businesses relied on small business loans to continue operating , although 18 stores never reopened following the floods . Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December 7 , 1985 , that ultimately raised $ 1 @.@ 7 million for storm victims in the state . In the years after the flood , residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains , while officials rebuilt roads , bridges , and public buildings . 
 In general , the USACE credited existing flood control projects as preventing additional flooding . In West Virginia alone , it was estimated that existing flood @-@ control projects saved about $ 135 million in damage . Lake <unk> in western Virginia helped prevent $ 70 million in damage along the James River . In Pennsylvania , flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River . After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning , the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November 21 , 1985 , against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages . The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam . The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986 , citing the Federal Power Act 's provision that claims should be in the District Court , but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas , bringing it to trial in September 1989 . The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent , the damage was caused mainly by the historic and unprecedented flooding ; consequently , the case entered a compulsory <unk> , meaning the company was not required to pay compensation . The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990 , which was denied . 
 The city of Roanoke , Virginia had experienced a series of major floods that affected . The floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 prompted a study that would <unk> 10 mi ( 16 km ) of the Roanoke River to increase water capacity . After the 1985 floods , the city council sought assistance from the USACE to build flood walls and improve river flow to mitigate against future flooding . The agency estimated that the project would cut the damage in half for a flood similar to the 1985 one . The cost for the project was initially project to be $ 34 @.@ 4 million , of which the city was expected to pay $ 14 @.@ 3 million . Private land donations and other financial sources provided about $ 6 @.@ 8 million of the cost , while the remaining $ 7 @.@ 5 million was covered by a bond , approved in an April 1989 single @-@ issue referendum . This was the first such referendum for the city , and passed with 56 @.@ 6 % in support amid a voter turnout of 19 @.@ 6 % . The bond would be repaid by a 2 % raise of the utility tax . Construction began in 1990 , and that year a flood warning system was completed . In 1993 , Roanoke 's raw sewage plant and hospital finished flood proofing . The bulk of the project was finished in December 2011 when the final terrain cuts were made . When the project was completed , the USGS estimated that the annual damage from flooding decreased from $ 5 @.@ 8 million to $ 2 @.@ 7 million , and that the work prevented major floods in November 2009 from Hurricane Ida and January 2013 . Also in the state , the General Assembly passed the " Virginia Flood Damage Reduction Act " in 1989 , partly due to the flooding from 1985 ; this coordinated all work related to flood prevention throughout the state into one department . 
 In Pennsylvania , then @-@ governor Dick Thornburgh allocated $ 1 million in emergency aid for the disaster areas , and activated 600 National Guardsmen to help with clean up . After nine water plants were closed , the companies relied on reserves to provide water supply to local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage . About 2 @,@ 900 people in Washington County lost access to clean water . 
 In the decades following the floods , the NWS utilized enhanced radar technology and computer models to better forecast flood events , as well as improved communications . Whereas in 1985 , three different NWS agencies issued different warnings for the area affected in southwest Virginia , the NWS has since restructured to allow local offices , such as the one in Roanoke , to directly issue watches and warnings . The NWS also implemented increased flood prediction techniques across West Virginia in the years after the floods . As many West Virginia counties lacked a full @-@ time emergency management director at the time , funding from the NWS provided 24 ‑ hour weather radios for every county by the year 1987 . 
 = Southsea Castle = 
 Southsea Castle , historically also known as Chaderton Castle , South Castle and Portsea Castle , is an artillery fort originally constructed by Henry VIII on Portsea Island , Hampshire , in 1544 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the Solent and the eastern approach to Portsmouth . The castle had a square central keep , two rectangular gun platforms to the east and west , and two angled bastions to the front and rear , and was an early English example of the trace italienne @-@ style of fortification popular on the Continent . The Cowdray engraving of the Battle of the Solent in 1545 depicted Henry VIII visiting the castle . Despite several serious fires , it remained in service and saw brief action at the start of the English Civil War in 1642 when it was stormed by Parliamentary forces . 
 The castle was expanded in the 1680s by Sir Bernard de Gomme and , after a period neglect in the 18th century , was redesigned again in 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars . After a brief period of use as a military prison in the 1840s , the fortification was expanded in the 1850s and 1860s with additional gun batteries on the east and west sides . The defences were upgraded throughout the century due to the fears of a French invasion and formed part of the plan for defending Portsmouth during the First World War . In the interwar years some of the fortifications were stood down , but the castle saw service again in the Second World War , when it was involved in Operation Grasp , the seizure of French naval vessels in Portsmouth harbour . In 1960 , Southsea Castle , by now obsolete , was sold to Portsmouth City Council . It was restored to its pre @-@ 1850 appearance and opened as a tourist attraction , receiving over 90 @,@ 000 visitors from 2011 – 12 .

 = = = 16th century = = = 
 Southsea Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III over the annulment of his long @-@ standing marriage to Catherine of Aragon . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , who took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . The immediate threat passed , but resurfaced in 1544 , with France threatening an invasion across the Channel , backed by her allies in Scotland . Henry therefore issued another device to further improve the country 's defences , particularly along the south coast . 
 The castle was built on the southern end of Portsea Island to protect a deep @-@ water channel running through the Solent to the royal naval base at Portsmouth . Work began in early 1544 , under the overall direction of Sir Anthony <unk> , the Governor of Portsmouth , supported by Richard <unk> , the Dean of Chichester , and John Chatterton , the captain of the <unk> garrison ; Thomas Bertie was appointed as the master mason . It is uncertain who designed the castle , although <unk> described it as being " of his Majesty 's own device " , which typically indicated that the King had taken a personal role . The design abandoned the earlier use of semi @-@ circular bastions , which could not be fully covered by flanking fire from the supporting walls , and instead used an angular design , forming an early , if imperfect , adoption of the trace italienne @-@ style of fortification already in use in Continental Europe . 
 The work was carried out quickly due to the risk of a French attack , and by July two brass saker guns were mounted on the site . It cost at least £ 3 @,@ 100 , £ 1 @,@ 300 of which came from the proceeds of the Dissolution of the Monasteries , with chalk , stone and timber being brought across from the neighbouring Isle of Wight . The castle was completed by October and formed a fortification with a square keep , rectangular gun platforms to the east and west , and angled bastions to the front and rear . Chatterton was appointed the new captain , with a team of eight soldiers , twelve gunners and a porter . The castle was well @-@ armed , with seven brass artillery pieces - a culverin , demi @-@ culverin , cannon and demi @-@ cannon - and eight iron guns . 
 The French invasion emerged in 1545 , when Admiral Claude d 'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July , landing troops on the Isle of Wight . Henry 's fleet made a brief sortie , resulting in the Battle of the Solent , in which the English flagship , the Mary Rose , was lost , before retreating safely behind the protective fortifications . Henry was present in Portsmouth at the time and the Cowdray engraving of the battle depicts him visiting Southsea Castle . The French expedition moved further on along the coast on 25 July , bringing an end to the immediate invasion threat , but Henry gave orders for additional improvements to the fortification to be made that summer , including the construction of stone flankers and timber caponiers , to guard against a potential infantry attack . Edward VI spent a night at the castle in 1552 while inspecting the defences of Portsmouth .

 In the early 1600s , England was at peace with France and Spain and as a result the coastal defences received little attention ; a survey found Southsea Castle to be " verie ill prepared for defence " , with no guns mounted along the walls or any stocks of powder . In March 1626 , a serious fire broke out that destroyed the interior of the keep and generated panic among the ships moored nearby . The damage was not repaired until 1635 , when 210 loads of timber was sent from the New Forest for use in the work . Another serious fire then broke out in 1640 , causing damage to the lodgings and store rooms . 
 At the start of the English Civil War in 1642 , fighting broke out around Portsmouth between the Royalist forces , led by Colonel George Goring , and Parliamentarians under the command of Colonel Richard Norton . Southsea Castle was held by the Royalist Captain <unk> , supported by a small garrison of eleven men and 14 guns , and Norton decided to attack the fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry . The assault took place at in the early hours of the morning on 5 September ; the garrison had positioned their guns to point inland , so the attackers stormed the moat on the seaward side . They then demanded that the garrison surrender but <unk> , who had been drinking heavily with Goring the night before , refused to discuss this and asked them to return later in the day . A fresh assault began and the garrison surrendered without loss of life . The capture of the castle meant left Portsmouth 's position untenable and the town surrendered . A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being retaken . 
 The castle was primarily used as a prison during the interregnum and the early days of the Restoration . Concerns about a potential Dutch attack grew , however , and in 1665 King Charles II commissioned his Dutch @-@ born master engineer , Sir Bernard de Gomme , to carry out a major scheme to improve the defences of Portsmouth , including Southsea Castle . Funding and poor organisation meant that the work did not begin until the 1680s . It included constructed an earthwork glacis around the castle ; a new castle gate ; four projecting turrets ; and a redesign of the central keep . A large , stone plaque above the gatehouse entrance , bearing Charles ' coat of arms , is dated 1683 . 
 When opposition grew in 1688 against the Catholic King James II , the military establishment around Portsmouth was controlled by the King 's illegitimate son , James <unk> , the Duke of Berwick . Revolution broke out and for a period Portsmouth and its defences were important to the King as a potential exit route for the Royal Family to France ; by late December , however , this route was no longer needed . George Legge , the Baron Dartmouth , pressurised <unk> to hand over control of Southsea Castle to the Protestant Captain Carter on 18 December and Portsmouth surrendered to the revolution two days later . The traveller Celia Fiennes , who visited the castle in 1690 , observed that it was " very fine , but I think it is but of little strength and service . " 
 = = = 18th – 19th centuries = = = 
 The east side of the castle was badly damaged in an explosion in August 1759 , caused after cooking sparks fell onto gunpowder stored in the castle by the 72nd Regiment of Foot ; 17 men , women and children were killed . Probably as a consequence of this event , a new powder store called the <unk> was built outside the north side of the castle . By the second half of the century , the castle was in poor condition and , according to one contemporary account , only garrisoned by " an old sergeant and three or four men who sell cakes and ale " . The Master – General of the Ordnance , Charles Lennox , the Duke of Richmond , reported in 1785 that it was " of too bad a form to deserve the expense necessary to repair it " and proposed building a more modern fort along the coast instead . By the end of the century , coastal erosion had destroyed most of the 18th @-@ century grand battery . 
 With the outbreak of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars at the end of the 18th century , Southsea Castle 's importance increased once again . In 1797 , a French invasion appeared imminent and the castle was urgently readied for action ; only eight 32 @-@ pounder ( 1 @.@ 45 kg ) and five 6 @-@ pounder ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) guns were available and these were in a poor condition . In 1813 , work was begun to expand the castle , under the direction of Major @-@ General Benjamin Fisher . Fisher had the work carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors , arguing that it made it easier to contain costs and prevent union activity and the project cost an estimated £ 18 @,@ 105 . The fort was extended north by up to 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) , with the keep and interior bailey redesigned in brick . The moat was rebuilt and a counterscarp galley was built round the edge . Most of the work was finished by 1814 although the final elements were not completed until 1816 . 
 A lighthouse , commissioned by the Admiralty , was constructed on the western gun platform in 1828 , rising 34 feet ( 10 m ) above the its base atop the walls . The lighthouse keeper was housed in the castle itself . An 1837 enquiry had looked into the management of military offenders in the south of England and in 1844 it was decided to bring Southsea Castle and Fort Clarence into use as military prisons , to reduce the pressure on the civilian gaols in the area and to provide a more suitable military environment for the prisoners . Southsea was used as a prison until 1850 , holding 150 offenders under the supervision of a Royal Artillery sergeant who also oversaw the remaining artillery defences . 
 The introduction of shell guns and steam ships in the 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast . In 1850 , with the closure of the prison , seven 8 @-@ inch ( 22 @.@ 3 cm ) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements , but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns . In 1856 , at the end of the Crimean War , there was a large review of the fleet along the Solent , attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists . Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle , which responded by firing a volley of forty 8 @-@ inch guns , causing chaos among the crowds watching around the base of the fortification . 
 Fresh worries about France , combined with the development of rifled cannon and iron @-@ clad warships , led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom expressing fears about the security of Portsmouth in 1860 . Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Jervois oversaw the broader programme of work across the country , and was supported at Southsea by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Fisher . New gun batteries with underground magazines were constructed on the west and east sides of the castle between 1863 and 1869 to form part of a 17 @-@ acre ( 6 @.@ 9 ha ) complex enclosed by a defensive wall ; the old castle was used for range and direction finding , rather than to house weapons , and was left to slowly decline . By 1886 , the site was well @-@ armed , with 25 rifled , muzzle @-@ loading guns and the design was praised by a visiting Russian military engineer . 
 By the 1890s , the castle 's defences had become obsolete once again due to the development of torpedo boats and superior breech @-@ loading guns . In response , five 6 @-@ pounder quick @-@ firing guns and searchlights were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and , between 1899 and 1901 , the east battery was converted to hold breech @-@ loading guns at a cost of £ 16 @,@ 670 . 
 Meanwhile , in 1785 , the government had taken possession of Southsea Common , the marshland surrounding the castle , to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort 's guns , and convicts were deployed to fill in and flatten out the marshes from 1831 onwards . The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre ; seaside facilities were established at the start of the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built around the edge of the common , used by military and naval officers . The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea , named after the castle , to turn into a prosperous resort . Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and , as the population grew , practising firing the castle 's guns became more difficult . 
 = = = 20th – 21st centuries = = = 
 At the start of the 20th century , Southsea Castle formed part of the " Fortress Portsmouth " plan for defending the Solent , the east battery equipped with two BL 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 2 cm ) Mark VII guns and two BL 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 23 @.@ 3 cm ) Mark X guns , and the west battery armed with three 12 @-@ pounders ( 5 @.@ 4 kg ) and one 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 11 @.@ 9 cm ) QF gun . During the First World War , the castle was at first manned by Royal Garrison Artillery and Number 4 company of the Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery Territorials . Later these units were transferred to France and were replaced by the Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery Volunteers . In response to the threat from German zeppelin raids , a QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt ( 10 @.@ 9 cm 50 @.@ 8 kg ) anti @-@ aircraft gun was added to the castle . Even though the castle remained in active military use after the conflict , by 1929 it had become a tourist attraction , and visitors were able to watch the castle garrison carry out practice firings out to sea . Southsea Common was bought by Portsmouth City Council in 1922 and turned into a park , while the west battery was disarmed in 1927 . 
 During the Second World War , the Hampshire Heavy Regiment , Royal Artillery ( Territorial Army ) , occupied the castle , which was used as the Headquarters Portsmouth Fixed Defences . During the war , the castle was manned by a range of units including coastal artillery from the regular army and the home guard , and the east battery was armed with two 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch BL Mark X guns . Living conditions were poor , with the keep described by one member of the Auxiliary Territorial Service as " cold and wet and horrible " . The castle was protected by barrage balloons , but it was hit by at least two incendiary bombs which did little damage . 
 During the war , the castle was involved in an armed stand @-@ off with French naval vessels . After the Fall of France in 1940 , some of the French ships had made their way to British ports , including Portsmouth , but fears rose that the warships might leave and fall into German hands . On 23 June , the castle was ordered to man its guns and to be prepared to fire on the French navy to prevent their departure ; one gun , albeit not ready for action , was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer Léopard responded by aiming its guns at the castle , but no shooting ensued . On 3 July , under Operation Grasp , British forces boarded and seized the ships , ending the confrontation . 
 Southsea Castle was obsolete in the post @-@ war years and in 1960 it was sold to Portsmouth City Council for £ 35 @,@ 000 . The council carried out restoration work and archaeological surveys , removing many of the later , post @-@ 1850 features and landscaping the surrounding area ; in 1967 it was opened as a museum , although the lighthouse remained in operation . The west and east batteries partially demolished by the council in the 1960s . 
 In the 21st century the castle is still operated as a tourist attraction by the council and received over 90 @,@ 000 visitors from 2011 – 12 . The castle houses a collection of cannon . Two of these , a 68 @-@ pounder ( 30 @.@ 8 kg ) and an RML 9 @-@ inch 12 ton ( 22 @.@ 8 cm 12 @,@ 192 kg ) gun , are location in the grounds , and within the castle itself is a 24 @-@ pounder ( 10 @.@ 8 kg ) from HMS Royal George , an RML 9 @-@ pounder 8 cwt ( 4 kg 406 kg ) and two hexagonally rifled <unk> 3 @-@ pounder ( 1 @.@ 3 kg ) breech @-@ loaders dating from 1876 . The castle is protected under UK law as a Scheduled Ancient Monument . 
 = Heller House = 
 The Isidore H. Heller House is a house located at <unk> South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , USA . The house was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright . The design is credited as one of the turning points in Wright 's shift to geometric , Prairie School architecture , which is defined by horizontal lines , flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves , windows grouped in horizontal bands , and an integration with the landscape , which is meant to evoke native Prairie surroundings . 
 The work demonstrates Wright 's shift away from emulating the style of his mentor , Louis Sullivan . Richard Bock , a Wright collaborator and sculptor , provided some of the ornamentation , including a plaster frieze . The ownership history of this building demonstrates the property 's evolution and development in the framework of surrounding Hyde Park buildings , and the building 's location in the current community — near other Prairie School architecture — includes this building into the overall body of Lloyd Wright 's work . The Heller House was designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15 , 1971 , and added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 16 , 1972 . On 18 August 2004 , the U.S. Department of the Interior designated the house a National Historic Landmark . 
 = = History = = 
 Little is known about Isidore H. Heller and his family , but what is known has been compiled through personal interviews as well as census and county records . Heller was born in Austria in 1847 , and his wife , Ida , was born in Wisconsin in 1857 . In America , Heller worked at Wolf , Sayer , and Heller : Packers and Butcher ’ s Supplies , which was located on Fulton Street , Chicago , on the northwest side of the city . Heller and Ida were later married and had three children , including Walter Heller , a Chicago investment banker . 
 Heller purchased land in the Hyde Park area of Chicago from Jonas Hamburger on 2 January 1895 and commissioned Lloyd Wright to design the house in 1896 . A building permit was issued on 13 July 1897 , at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 70 , and named William Adams as the builder . The building was constructed on the 50 by 175 feet ( 15 by 53 m ) lot in 1897 . The total cost of the work is estimated at $ 12 @,@ 500 . In 1906 , the lot was enlarged when Heller purchased an additional 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) to the north of his original plot . 
 The <unk> lived in the house for about 16 years , until the death of Ida Heller on October 11 , 1909 . The house was sold to Francis Bickett on 18 June 1913 , as records indicate that by 1915 , Heller had been living in Silver Lake for some years . Bickett sold the house within a year to Charles McFarlane , and from 1924 – 39 the Heller House was owned and occupied by Joseph Mayer and his wife ; the house became known as the " Joseph Mayer House " to local residents . The Mayers sold the home to Mr. and Mrs. Wilfred Fox in 1939 , who reportedly made alterations to the home 's third floor . 
 In 1948 , George Watson purchased the home from Fox and owned it for the next 25 years , becoming the owner with the longest tenure . Lewis Bradford then bought the house in 1972 , and had the exterior sandblasted . In 1977 , Victor and Danielle <unk> bought the house . They occupied it until 1987 , when it was sold to David and Catherine Epstein , who sold the home to <unk> <unk> and Judith Bromley , in 1995 . They restored a bathroom and restored the master bedroom 's fireplace . The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in the same year . The house was then sold in 2004 again to the current inhabitants the Goldstein family , who in 2006 restored the roof of the house . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 When Wright designed the Heller House in 1896 , it marked his move away from styles that were popular into an era of geometric and highly modern designs . Wright 's design exhibits the influence of Wright 's mentor , Louis Sullivan , and demonstrates Wright 's move towards Prairie School homes which would epitomize much of his early work . Sullivan 's influence can also be seen in the floral pattern of the Richard Bock plaster frieze on the home 's third floor , although during the 1970s , restoration work — which utilized sandblasting — destroyed much of the detail on the frieze . 
 The 26 by 98 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 by 29 @.@ 9 m ) rectangular house stands 41 feet ( 12 m ) high and was built with Indiana Limestone , and yellow Roman brick , which emphasizes the geometric and horizontal nature of the home 's exterior . The house was constructed on a narrow lot , so the main entryway is located on the side of the building , similar to Wright 's Warren McArthur House of 1892 . The south side entrance was adorned with Classical detailing and the cantilevered entry lintel , which sits on two ornately detailed stone columns , was decorated with quatrefoils ( French : Four leaves ) which were set on a stone panel .

 The Heller House was Wright 's first work in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago , an area that was influenced by the Gothic Revival work of Henry Ives Cobb . The house blends together key elements of Wright 's Prairie style and is located within a half mile of other early works . Wright 's Robie House is six blocks from the Heller House , and the Blossom House and McArthur House are nearby , in Kenwood . 
 Many of the Hyde Park houses of Chicago are surrounded by elaborate gardens , and have been the subject of an ongoing neighborhood revitalization since the late 1950s . Hyde Park experienced an explosion of growth after the Township 's incorporation into the city of Chicago in 1889 , the establishment of the University of Chicago in 1892 , and the Columbian Exposition in 1893 . The design of the Heller House was unlike any other home in Chicago at the time it was built and was called Wright 's most " outrageous " design . 
 = 1999 South Dakota Learjet crash = 
 On October 25 , 1999 , a chartered Learjet 35 was scheduled to fly from Orlando , Florida , to Dallas , Texas . Early in the flight , the aircraft , which was cruising at altitude on autopilot , quickly lost cabin pressure and all on board were incapacitated due to hypoxia — a lack of oxygen . The aircraft failed to make the westward turn toward Dallas over north Florida and continued on its northwestern course , flying over the southern and midwestern United States for almost four hours and 1 @,@ 500 miles ( 2 @,@ 400 km ) . The plane ran out of fuel over South Dakota and crashed into a field near Aberdeen after an uncontrolled descent . The four passengers on board were PGA golf star Payne Stewart , his agents , Van Ardan and Robert Fraley , and Bruce Borland , a highly regarded golf architect with the Jack Nicklaus golf course design company .

 On October 25 , 1999 , Learjet 35 , registration N47BA , operated by Sunjet Aviation of Sanford , Florida , departed Orlando International Airport ( IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) at <unk> ( <unk> EDT ) on a two @-@ day , five @-@ flight trip . Before departure , the aircraft had been fueled with 5 @,@ 300 lb ( 2 @,@ 400 kg ) of Jet A , enough for 4 hours and 45 minutes of flight . On board were two pilots and four passengers . 
 At 1327 : <unk> , the controller from the Jacksonville ARTCC instructed the pilot to climb and maintain flight level ( FL ) 390 ( 39 @,@ 000 feet ( 11 @,@ 900 m ) above sea level ) . At 1327 : 18Z ( <unk> : 18 EDT ) , the pilot acknowledged the clearance by stating , " three nine zero bravo alpha . " This was the last known radio transmission from the airplane , and occurred while the aircraft was passing through 23 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) . The next attempt to contact the aircraft occurred six minutes , 20 seconds later ( 14 minutes after departure ) , with the aircraft at 36 @,@ 500 feet ( 11 @,@ 100 m ) , and the controller 's message went unacknowledged . The controller attempted to contact N47BA five more times in the next 4 ½ minutes , again with no answer .

 About <unk> ( now <unk> CDT due to the flight 's crossing into the Central Time zone ) , a U.S. Air Force F @-@ 16 test pilot from the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin AFB in western Florida , who happened to be in the air nearby , was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA . When the fighter was about 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 600 m ) from the Learjet , at an altitude of about 46 @,@ 400 feet ( 14 @,@ 100 m ) , the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response . The F @-@ 16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear , finding no visible damage to the airplane . Both engines were running , and the plane 's red rotating anti @-@ collision beacon was on ( standard operation for aircraft in flight ) . The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark . Further , he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was opaque , as if condensation or ice covered the inside . He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque , although several sections of the center of the windshield seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice ; a small rectangular section of the windshield was clear , with only a small section of the glare shield visible through this area . He did not see any flight control movement . About <unk> , the F @-@ 16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation , proceeding to Scott AFB in southwestern Illinois .

 At <unk> , almost three hours into the flight of the unresponsive Learjet , two F @-@ 16s from the 138th Fighter Wing of the Oklahoma Air National Guard ( ANG ) , flying under the call @-@ sign " TULSA 13 flight " , were directed by the Minneapolis ARTCC to intercept . The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported that he could not see any movement in the cockpit , that the windshield was dark and that he could not tell if the windshield was iced . A few minutes later , a TULSA 13 pilot reported , " We 're not seeing anything inside , could be just a dark cockpit though ... he is not reacting , moving or anything like that he should be able to have seen us by now . " At <unk> , TULSA 13 left to rendezvous with a tanker for refueling . 
 The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 48 @,@ 900 feet ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ; 14 @.@ 9 km ) . 
 = = = Third interception and escort = = = 
 About <unk> , two F @-@ 16s from the 119th Wing of the North Dakota ANG with the identification " NODAK 32 flight " were directed to intercept N47BA . TULSA 13 flight also returned from refueling , and all four fighters maneuvered close to the Lear . The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported , " We 've got two visuals on it . It 's looking like the cockpit window is iced over and there 's no displacement in any of the control surfaces as far as the ailerons or trims . " About <unk> , TULSA 13 flight returned to the tanker again , while NODAK 32 remained with N47BA . 
 There was some speculation in the media that military jets were prepared to shoot down the Lear if it threatened to crash in a heavily populated area . Officials at the Pentagon strongly denied that possibility . Shooting down the plane " was never an option , " Air Force spokesman Captain Joe Della <unk> said , " I don 't know where that came from . " 
 = = = Crash = = = 
 The Learjet 's cockpit voice recorder ( CVR ) , which was recovered from the wreckage , contained an audio recording of the last 30 minutes of the flight ( it was an older model which only recorded 30 minutes of data ; the aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder ) . At 1710 : <unk> , the Learjet 's engines can be heard winding down , indicating that the plane 's fuel had been exhausted . In addition , sounds of the stick shaker and autopilot disconnect can be heard ( with the engines powered down , the autopilot would have attempted to maintain altitude , causing the plane 's airspeed to bleed off until it approached stall speed , at which point the stick shaker would have automatically engaged to warn the pilot and the autopilot would have switched itself off ) . 
 At 1711 : <unk> , the Lear began a right turn and descent . One NODAK 32 airplane remained to the west , while one TULSA 13 airplane broke away from the tanker and followed N47BA down . At 1211 : 26 CDT , the NODAK 32 lead pilot reported , " The target is descending and he is doing multiple aileron rolls , looks like he 's out of control ... in a severe descent , request an emergency descent to follow target . " The TULSA 13 pilot reported , " It 's soon to impact the ground ; he is in a descending spiral . " The fighter planes were at this point forced to break off their pursuit and had to land at local airports , having reached the limit of their endurance . 
 Impact occurred approximately <unk> , or 1213 local , after a total flight time of 3 hours , 54 minutes , with the aircraft hitting the ground at a nearly supersonic speed and an extreme angle . The Learjet crashed in South Dakota , just outside Mina in Edmunds County , on relatively flat ground and left a crater 42 feet ( 13 m ) long , 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) wide , and 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) deep . None of its components remained intact .

 = = Investigation = = 
 The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) has several levels of investigation , of which the highest is a " major " investigation . Because of the extraordinary circumstances in this crash , a major investigation was performed . 
 The NTSB determined that : 
 The probable cause of this accident was incapacitation of the flight crew members as a result of their failure to receive supplemental oxygen following a loss of cabin pressurization , for undetermined reasons . 
 The Board added a commentary regarding the possible reasons why the crew did not obtain supplemental oxygen : 
 Following the depressurization , the pilots did not receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and / or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation . The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator / shutoff valve was open on the accident flight . Further , although one flight crew mask hose connector was found in the wreckage disconnected from its valve receptacle ( the other connector was not recovered ) , damage to the recovered connector and both receptacles was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane 's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact . In addition , both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks . Therefore , assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen , supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots ' oxygen masks . 
 [ A ] possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks . No definitive evidence exists that indicates the rate at which the accident flight lost its cabin pressure ; therefore , the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization . 
 If there had been a breach in the fuselage ( even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in @-@ flight observers ) or a seal failure , the cabin could have depressurized gradually , rapidly , or even explosively . Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about 30 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks . 
 A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes , such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve . Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane 's flight altitude over a period of several minutes . However , without supplemental oxygen , substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression ( the cabin altitude warning ) , when the cabin altitude reached 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) ( which could have occurred in about 30 seconds ) . 
 Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that , even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization , pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter . In this accident , the flight crew 's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression . 
 In summary , the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not , or did not , receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and / or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation . 
 The NTSB report showed that the plane had several instances of maintenance work related to cabin pressure in the months leading up to the accident . The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented , but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports . The report gently chides Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify , track , and resolve ; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Stewart was ultimately headed to Houston for the 1999 Tour Championship , but planned a stop in Dallas for discussions with the athletic department of his alma mater , Southern Methodist University , about building a new home course for the school 's golf program . Stewart was memorialized at the Tour Championship with a lone bagpipe player playing at the first hole at Champions Golf Club prior to the beginning of the first day of play . The owner of the crash site , after consulting the wives of Stewart and several other victims , created a memorial on about 1 acre ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) of the site . At its center is a rock pulled from the site inscribed with the names of the victims and a Bible passage . 
 The 2000 U.S. Open , held at Pebble Beach Golf Links , began with a golf version of a 21 @-@ gun salute when 21 of Stewart 's fellow players simultaneously hit balls into the Pacific Ocean . 
 In 2001 , Stewart was posthumously inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame . 
 On June 8 , 2005 , a Florida state court jury in Orlando found that Learjet was not liable for the deaths of Stewart and his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan , who had also been aboard the plane .

 Robert Edward " Bo " Rein , a noted football coach for North Carolina State and then Louisiana State University ( LSU ) ( where he had been hired only six weeks before ) was flying with a pilot in Louisiana from Shreveport to Baton Rouge on January 10 , 1980 in a Cessna 441 Conquest twin @-@ turboprop , registered <unk> . The flight was supposed to last 40 minutes , but after flying east and climbing to avoid a thunderstorm , the plane lost contact with air traffic control and was seen on radar to climb to 40 @,@ 000 feet ( 12 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 The Conquest was eventually intercepted by two Michigan Air National Guard F @-@ 4C Phantoms from Seymour @-@ Johnson AFB in North Carolina and a pair of F @-@ 106 Delta Dart interceptors from the 48th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Langley AFB in Virginia .

The plane continued out over the Atlantic Ocean where it ran out of fuel , descended to 25 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 600 m ) and then entered a spin , crashing into the water . The military pilots spotted some debris , but no wreckage was ever recovered ; the bodies of Rein and pilot Lou <unk> were never found .

It was then that Air Traffic Control noticed that the pilot 's speech had become significantly impaired and he was unable to respond to instructions .

 The aircraft was completely destroyed in the impact and the post @-@ crash fire , making the investigation difficult . The Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( ATSB ) and coroner investigating the crash concluded that depressurization was likely the cause of incapacitation , but were unable to conclusively rule out the presence of toxic fumes , possibly from the air conditioning system .

 = Gubby Allen = 
 Sir George Oswald Browning " Gubby " Allen CBE ( 31 July 1902 – 29 November 1989 ) was a cricketer who captained England in eleven Test matches . In first @-@ class matches , he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University . A fast bowler and hard @-@ hitting lower @-@ order batsman , Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club , which effectively ruled English cricket at the time ; he also served as chairman of the England selectors . 
 Allen was born in Australia but grew up in England from the age of six . After playing cricket for Eton College , he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler , albeit one who was often injured . After leaving university , Allen played mainly for Middlesex . He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly . A change of career allowed him to play more cricket , and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team . He made his debut in 1930 , and remained in contention for a place , when he was available to play , for the rest of the decade . During the controversial bodyline tour of 1932 – 33 , Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his team @-@ mates . 
 From 1933 , Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange , which limited the amount cricket he could play . Even so , he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936 – 37 tour of Australia , when the home team won 3 – 2 having lost the first two matches . He continued to play for Middlesex until 1939 ; after the Second World War , in which he worked in Military Intelligence , he played irregularly into the 1950s . He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947 – 48 . As a cricketer , Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form . At other times , his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating . An orthodox batsman , he often scored runs when his team were under pressure . 
 As Allen 's first @-@ class career came to a close , he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket . He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual , and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions . As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961 , he presided over a period of great success for English cricket , during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May . In 1963 , he became MCC President , and was made the club 's Treasurer the following year . In this role , he was deeply involved in the D 'Oliveira affair , a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D 'Oliveira to tour South Africa . After Allen 's gradual retirement from his administrative roles , he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord 's Cricket Ground , where he died , aged 87 , in 1989 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Allen was born on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill , Sydney , Australia , the second of three children to Walter Allen , a lawyer , and his wife Marguerite ( Pearl ) , née Lamb , the daughter of a Queensland Minister of Lands . Later rumours suggested that Allen 's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner , who supported Allen in his cricket career . Both of Allen 's parents had roots in England as well as Australia . In 1909 , when Allen was six years old , his family moved to London — hoping that the children would benefit from an English education — where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages . Finding that they enjoyed England , the family abandoned plans to return to Australia . 
 After being educated by a governess , Allen joined Summer Fields School in Oxford in 1912 . He began to play cricket seriously at school ; by his second year , he reached the school second team , from where he progressed to the first team then the captaincy . His ability attracted the attention of Eton College , where a friend of Allen 's father , C. M. Wells , was a housemaster . The family had planned to send Allen to Haileybury , but Wells persuaded Allen senior to send his son to Eton instead , although it was a considerable financial burden on the family . Allen , although not initially keen on the prospect , started there in the winter of 1915 – 16 . 
 At Eton , Allen played many sports , but his academic performance was no more than respectable , and he later admitted to laziness . In cricket , Allen played for his school house team and had reasonable success with bat and ball ; by 1918 he was house cricket captain . After a trial match , and a spell in the school second team , he progressed to the Eton first team in 1919 . The effects of a rib injury limited his bowling , and he achieved little with the bat . Even so , he was chosen to play in the prestigious match against Harrow School , played annually at Lord 's Cricket Ground in London . In his second innings , he scored 69 runs , the highest individual score of the game , and Eton won the match . His rib injury continued to trouble him in 1920 , and caused him such pain that he considered abandoning bowling altogether . The new Eton coach George Hirst persuaded him to continue , and a few weeks later Allen took nine for 19 ( nine wickets while conceding 19 runs ) in an innings against Winchester . But other than this performance , Allen was ineffective . More successful in 1921 , he opened the batting for a time ; he also opened the bowling , topping the Eton bowling averages . He had some success at Lord 's against Harrow and a particularly fast bowling spell in this match was seen by Hubert Ashton , who was to captain the Cambridge University team the following year — Allen had already been approved for a place at Trinity College , Cambridge beginning later that year . He was chosen to play in the annual matches at Lord 's in which two teams representing the best public schoolboys opposed each other , but was forced to withdraw with sunstroke . 
 Towards the end of the 1921 season , Allen was invited to play first @-@ class cricket as an amateur for Middlesex , for whom he qualified by residence . Allen believed that Pelham Warner , who often supported young Middlesex cricketers , encouraged his selection by the club , despite the potential risks to the team 's position in the County Championship from playing an inexperienced cricketer . Allen made his first @-@ class debut against Somerset on 21 August 1921 and made one other appearance that season without achieving much in either match . 
 = = First @-@ class cricketer = = 
 = = = Cambridge University = = = 
 Allen played for Cambridge in 1922 . He was left out of the team 's first game ; as the University was playing Middlesex , he played for the opposition instead and took six for 13 . Around this time , he began to bowl fast for the first time . After success in the following games — including ten wickets in the game against Sussex — Allen was awarded his blue by being selected for the University Match against Oxford at Lord 's . In that game , he had match figures of nine for 78 in a comfortable Cambridge victory . This was Cambridge 's last game of the season — Allen had taken 49 first @-@ class wickets at an average of 15 . There were suggestions in the press at the time that Allen illegally threw , rather than bowled , the ball . In his biography of Allen , E. W. Swanton writes that these rumours were neither widespread nor repeated later in Allen 's career , and that they may have resulted from a one @-@ off lapse . Towards the end of the season , Allen returned to the Middlesex team and his 15 wickets placed him at the top of the county 's bowling averages . 
 Allen played rugby for the Trinity team before resuming cricket for the 1923 season . He began well , reaching fifty in a first @-@ class match for the first time against Middlesex and taking six for 89 in the same game . Further bowling success followed but before the University Match , he once more injured his rib muscles . Persuaded to play anyway , Allen could only bowl short spells which lacked incisiveness and Cambridge lost heavily . Several critics , including some team @-@ mates , believed he did not try . During the match , Allen consulted a specialist over his frequent rib injuries ; the specialist 's treatment and a period of rest cured the problem for the remainder of his career . Allen 's Cambridge season was further marred by differences with his captain , Claude Ashton , over team selections and tactics . The 1923 University Match was his final game for Cambridge as Trinity , unhappy with his lack of academic work , rusticated him in the summer . 
 Later in the 1923 season , Allen was recalled by Middlesex and played five games for the county . At the end of the season , he was chosen in two Scarborough Festival games ; one of these was the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match , in which he appeared for the amateur " Gentlemen " . This was the first of Allen 's 11 appearances for the Gentlemen in this fixture between 1923 and 1938 . In the whole season , he took 66 wickets at 19 @.@ 50 and scored 528 runs at an average of 24 @.@ 00 . 
 = = = Middlesex = = = 
 In late 1923 , having decided not to return to Cambridge , Allen took a job in the City ( London 's financial district ) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter . Not particularly well @-@ off financially , he had to work full @-@ time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business . He played cricket as often as he could in the summer ; when unable to play for Middlesex , he played weekend club cricket — including for the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) — and country house cricket . 
 Allen was free to play regularly for Middlesex in 1924 . The team was involved in a close race for the County Championship with Yorkshire , and Allen had several successful matches . He ended the season with 568 runs at 21 @.@ 84 and 50 wickets at 17 @.@ 48 . Playing less often in 1925 , he scored 392 runs , took 39 wickets , and scored his maiden first @-@ class century in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval . He was also chosen for the first time to represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord 's , where he scored 52 , and his reputation grew steadily . By the beginning of the 1926 season , he and fellow fast bowler Harold Larwood were tipped in the press to be chosen for the England team against Australia that summer . Allen began well for Middlesex but was less successful in a trial match to help choose the England team . Larwood was chosen for the Test series ; Allen was not . In county cricket , Allen scored his first century for Middlesex , and began to open the bowling occasionally , having been the third or fourth bowler in previous seasons . Overall , he scored 771 runs , the highest seasonal aggregate of his career , at an average of 29 @.@ 65 and took 44 wickets at 28 @.@ 27 . 
 During the winter of 1926 – 27 , Allen toured Argentina to play first @-@ class cricket with an MCC team . When he returned to England , he played eight matches before the end of June , including a game for the MCC against the touring New Zealand team in which he scored a century and took ten wickets . In total , he scored 482 runs at an average of 43 @.@ 81 and took 19 wickets , but this was his last regular cricket until 1929 . He declined an invitation to tour South Africa with an MCC team , and work limited him to two first @-@ class games for Middlesex in 1928 . 
 Through Vivian Hugh Smith , the father of some old school @-@ mates , Allen had the opportunity to work in France . He moved to Lyons for 18 months to work for a silk company . During his time there , Allen became aware that the firm 's finances were unsound ; he warned Hugh Smith , who after some enquiries , withdrew from the business , along with his fellow investor Sir Frederick Richmond . The latter subsequently offered Allen work at Debenham 's , of which he was chairman . Allen worked at Debenham 's until 1933 , initially as first assistant to the Works Department manager ; then as the assistant to the assistant general manager . 
 While at Debenham 's , Allen was allowed leave to play cricket . During his first appearance of the 1929 season he performed well but suffered a strain in his next game , which reinforced an impression in the press — articulated by Pelham Warner among others — that he was injury @-@ prone and inclined to hypochondria . His next appearance came a fortnight later , at Lord 's against Lancashire ; that team had won the County Championship every year since 1926 . Owing to work commitments , Allen arrived by prior agreement around 20 minutes after play started . He took the first three wickets , but Lancashire were batting comfortably at 215 for three wickets . Around the tea interval , Allen took the last seven wickets in 69 deliveries while conceding 13 runs from his bowling , including the last four wickets in five balls . In total , he took all ten wickets at a cost of 40 runs , to become only the second man to take all ten wickets in a first @-@ class match at Lord 's since 1874 , and the last to date . He was praised in the press , although the Manchester Guardian correspondent suggested that a weak batting performance helped him , and Wisden merely described this as one of several good performances in the game . Despite his success , the England selectors preferred Larwood in the Test team against South Africa ; even when Larwood was injured , Allen was passed over . Swanton suggests that Allen 's bowling was inconsistent throughout the season ; he finished with 31 wickets at 25 @.@ 87 and scored 544 at 45 @.@ 33 .

 During 1930 , Allen again had leave in which he could play cricket , and was among the front @-@ runners for a place in the England team . His first appearance of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team . Although he took four for 28 on the last day , his rivals for an England place were also successful . Playing for Middlesex against the Australians , Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge , Nottingham . England won the match during the course of which Larwood , the incumbent fast bowler in the team , fell ill . Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen , and took six for 77 . His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well received by the press . 
 On the morning of the match , Larwood was unfit and Allen played . England batted first , and Allen scored three runs before being dismissed on the first afternoon . On the second morning , an article in the Daily Express by Trevor Wignall , a popular journalist who wrote sensational sports stories , suggested that the crowd 's enjoyment of the day was marred by Allen 's inclusion on the grounds of his Australian birth . Wignall claimed that the public felt Allen should have been omitted , and that the selectors were rumoured to be ignorant of his birthplace . That day , Allen opened the bowling for England ; after a slow start , the Australian openers added 162 runs before the first wicket fell . Like the other bowlers , Allen then rapidly conceded runs to Donald Bradman , who scored 254 runs . Australia scored 729 for six declared in reply to England 's 425 , and Allen returned bowling figures of none for 115 from 34 overs . England lost early wickets in their second innings , and when Allen came in to bat , the score was 147 for five wickets , still 167 behind the Australians . He scored 57 and shared a partnership of 125 with his captain , Percy Chapman , to take England into the lead but Australia won the match by seven wickets . In contrast to the reaction to his bowling , Allen 's innings was praised in the press . This was his only Test of the series . 
 Allen was unsuccessful in the Gentlemen v Players game , but performed effectively with the ball for Middlesex . He continued to struggle when batting , and his highest innings of the year was 77 runs scored in the end @-@ of @-@ season Scarborough Festival . In total , he scored 281 runs at 17 @.@ 56 and took 42 wickets at 22 @.@ 19 . He was not invited on the MCC tour of South Africa .

 Allen 's cricket remained limited in 1931 . Despite all @-@ round success in several early games for Middlesex , he was initially omitted from the team for the first Test against the New Zealand team . When Larwood withdrew with an ankle injury , Allen was added to the team ; according to Anthony Meredith , writing in The Cricketer in 2002 , Pelham Warner made this decision himself without consulting his fellow selectors , to their considerable annoyance . Allen did not have a particularly good match as a bowler , but was successful with the bat . When he started his innings at the beginning of the second day , England had scored 190 for seven wickets in reply to New Zealand 's 224 . He scored 98 in the 150 @-@ minute first session , and went on to score 122 ; with Les Ames , he added 246 for the eighth wicket . This was a record partnership in Test matches for the eighth wicket until 1996 , and an England record for that wicket until 2010 . England scored 454 , but New Zealand replied with 469 and the match was drawn on the third and final day . This was Allen 's only innings of the series . 
 After a gap of three weeks with no cricket , Allen took six wickets in his first match back . Meanwhile , Larwood was ruled out of the England team after an injury in a car crash ; Allen played in the second Test and took five for 14 in New Zealand 's first innings . England won that game , and the next was drawn after rain washed out the first two days ; Allen neither batted nor bowled . In the series , he took eight wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 12 . He ended the season with 401 first @-@ class runs at 30 @.@ 84 and 40 wickets at 18 @.@ 77 . 
 Allen played less frequently in 1932 , even though he wanted to secure a place in the MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932 – 33 season . He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games , but did not play in the season 's only Test match . His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match , in which many of those involved were potential selections for the touring team ; he took eight wickets in the game , and after the second trial was named in the MCC team . The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed , and there were several who criticised the selectors . He was low in the national batting and bowling averages ; critics pointed out his infrequent appearances in first @-@ class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour . Having been named in the team , Allen did not play again in the season . In eight first @-@ class matches , he scored 113 runs at 11 @.@ 30 and took 25 wickets at 25 @.@ 36 . 
 = = = Bodyline series = = = 
 The MCC tour of Australia during the 1932 – 33 season was highly controversial owing to the England team 's use of what came to be known as Bodyline bowling . The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it , pitching the ball short so that it reared at the batsman 's body and with a ring of fielders ranged on the leg side to catch any defensive deflections from the bat . Bodyline bowling was intimidatory , and was largely designed and implemented by Douglas Jardine , the MCC captain , in an attempt to curb the prolific scoring of Bradman . Allen was one of four fast bowlers chosen for the tour , but did not go along with Jardine 's instructions to " hate " the opposition . Nevertheless , the two men got along , and Allen later claimed to be Jardine 's " best friend " on the tour . However , Allen wrote home that Jardine was " the stupidest man I know " , claimed to be terrified of him and suggested that at times he felt like killing him . 
 Jardine did not initially plan to include Allen in the Test team , but the latter 's bowling in the opening tour matches brought him into the frame . In his first game , he unsettled and dismissed Bradman with his pace ; in later years Jack Hobbs , who reported on the game , suggested that Bradman was intimidated by Allen , and Jack Fingleton , who played in the team with Bradman , claimed that he refused to face Allen 's bowling . Allen later wrote to his father that Bradman was a " terrible little coward of fast bowling " ; the two men later became friends , and Bradman was never made aware of what Allen wrote . 
 Allen played in England 's victory in the first Test but took only one wicket . He retained his place as part of a four @-@ man pace attack in the second Test , took four wickets and was one of the most successful English batsmen in the match . Australia levelled the series after Bradman scored a century , but England won the remaining three matches of the series . In the third game , Allen opened the bowling and took four wickets in each innings . His performance was praised by critics and enhanced his reputation . As Voce missed the fourth Test with injury , Allen bowled more in that game and took five wickets , but suffered a side @-@ strain in the second innings . The injury prevented Allen bowling at full pace in the final Test ; he played despite his own reservations and struggled throughout . In total , Allen took 21 Test wickets at an average of 28 @.@ 23 and scored 163 runs at 23 @.@ 28 . In his review of the tour for Wisden , Sydney Southerton wrote : " G. O. Allen , about whose selection many hard things were at the time said , fully justified his choice ... He accomplished great work , often getting rid of batsmen likely to be dangerous ; his fielding close in on the leg side was uniformly good and he played several excellent innings . Altogether a most useful man in the team . " Jardine praised his contribution after the tour , both to Allen 's family and in his official report . In all first @-@ class matches , Allen scored 397 runs at 24 @.@ 81 and took 39 wickets at 23 @.@ 05 . In his biography of Jardine , Christopher Douglas suggests : " [ Allen ] thrived on the intensive programme of matches and was able to build up his form and consistency to a standard that he hardly ever matched in England . " 
 Throughout the series , Allen refused to use Bodyline tactics , and openly said so within the team . His attitude made him popular with Australian spectators . Jardine twice tried to force the issue . Before the first Test , he asked Allen to bowl more bouncers with fielders on the leg side ; Allen refused , saying he did not want to play cricket like that and that Jardine should leave him out if he was not happy . Prior to the second Test , Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short , and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity . Allen wrote home : " Well , I burst and said a good deal about swollen @-@ headed , gutless , uneducated miners . " Allen threatened not to play , and to go home to relate the events of the tour to the press . Jardine did not pursue the matter . Others in the team also opposed Bodyline . The Nawab of Pataudi refused to field in the " leg trap " — the ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries — during the first Test . Allen had no compunction fielding there ; at short leg he held five catches from Larwood 's bowling in the series . Upon his return to England , Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics , making his opinion known to senior figures in the MCC , and leading a debate among county representatives which resulted in legislation to ban the tactic after the 1934 season . 
 = = = Change of career = = = 
 During the Bodyline tour , his first visit to Australia since the age of six , Allen spent time visiting friends and family . Before returning to England , the MCC played two Tests in New Zealand . Allen played in both , but batted just once and , still feeling the effects of his injury , took only two wickets . The team returned to England via Canada , but Allen parted company in Vancouver to meet friends in Los Angeles . During his trip , he met several Hollywood stars and passed through Chicago and New York on his way back to England . In New York , he met and fell in love with Norah Grace , the daughter of a shipping magnate . She travelled to England in 1934 , and the pair wrote frequently to each other , but Grace died from Bright 's disease in 1935 . 
 Allen did not feel suited to working in a department store , and on his return home took a job with the stockbroking company David Bevan and Co . Consequently , he played little cricket in 1933 . He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies , but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form , so he was persuaded to play in the first Test . He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team . In three games that season , he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets . That December , he was elected as a member of the Stock Exchange . 
 As the 1934 season began , Allen was recovering from an operation to repair a rupture and played only once before that summer 's Ashes series , in which Bob Wyatt captained England . Injury ruled him out of the second Test , but he was fit for the third . In a drawn game , he scored 61 runs but took no wickets ; troubled by uneven footholds , he bowled three wides and four no balls during his first over , which lasted for 13 deliveries . He was selected for the fourth Test but , unhappy with his fitness , withdrew to play for Middlesex . He was successful in several games preceding the final , deciding Test , and was included in the team . Australia won comfortably after scoring 701 in their first innings ; Allen took four for 170 and was wicketless in the second innings . In two Tests , he took five wickets at an average in excess of 70 and scored 106 runs at 35 @.@ 33 . In all first @-@ class games that season he scored 438 runs at 25 @.@ 76 and took 51 wickets at 27 @.@ 49 . Amid growing speculation that Allen would be chosen as the next England captain , Warner arranged for him to captain a low @-@ key tour to Gibraltar in early 1935 . During the return journey , Allen pulled a muscle when his ship pitched unexpectedly ; the injury limited his cricket during 1935 . He played twice before withdrawing from the rest of the season on medical advice . Off the field , Allen was elected to the MCC Committee at the unusually young age of 32 .

 = = = Selection as captain = = = 
 Prior to the 1936 season , Allen was the leading contender to replace Wyatt as England captain ; under Wyatt 's leadership , the team had lost three successive Test series . Although still unable to appear regularly , Allen played 16 first @-@ class matches , his most in a season since 1926 ; he scored 598 runs at an average of 35 @.@ 17 , and took 81 wickets , his best return in a season . When selected to lead one of the teams in a Test trial match , he was effective enough for the selectors to name him as England captain for the series against India . England won the first Test by eight wickets . Allen took five for 35 in his first innings as captain and a further five wickets in the second innings , making this the only Test in which he took ten wickets . The selectors at this time set about choosing a captain and team for the MCC tour of Australia in the 1936 – 37 season . At least one selector favoured Claude Ashton , who played first @-@ class cricket infrequently ; Allen informed the selectors that , were Ashton to be made captain , he would not take part in the tour . Soon after the first Test , Allen was chosen to captain the Gentlemen against the Players , the only time he did so , and the MCC announced that he would captain the MCC in Australia . Allen believed that Warner was influential in securing his appointment , but that his Australian background was also important given that the tour had to repair tensions left over from 1932 – 33 . 
 Allen captained England in the remaining two Tests against India . The second game was drawn but England won the third and Allen took seven for 80 , his best figures in Test matches . In the Tests , Allen scored 27 runs in three innings , and took 20 wickets at 16 @.@ 50 . His good form for Middlesex continued throughout the season and he performed well against some of the strongest opposition ; he topped the county 's batting averages and came second in bowling . The MCC team for Australia was chosen in several stages with input from Allen . Larwood was not considered ; he had spoken out in the press against Australia and opponents of Bodyline , and like Voce , had not played a Test since the 1932 – 33 series . The selectors wished to include Voce but Allen at first threatened to resign were he to be included . He met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline . He was therefore named in the touring team . 
 = = = Tour of Australia , 1936 – 37 = = = 
 The inexperience of the tour manager , Rupert Howard , and Allen 's vice @-@ captain , Walter Robins , left Allen with a heavy workload for the 1936 – 37 tour ; he later suggested to the MCC that this affected his form . In the early part of the tour , Allen selected the team by himself , but later used Robins , Bob Wyatt , Wally Hammond and Maurice Leyland as a selection committee . 
 The team was hampered throughout by injuries — at one point , seven of the sixteen players were unfit — and the absence of senior players meant that Allen had to play more matches . He played well in the early games , but the team 's results were poor as players struggled to adapt to the Australian pitches . When the Test series began , Australia were clear favourites . In the first Test , in reply to England 's first innings of 358 , Australia were bowled out for 234 . When England batted again , Allen top @-@ scored with 68 , an innings he later rated the best of his career . England made 256 and , on a pitch affected by rain , Allen took five for 36 as Australia were bowled out for 58 to lose by 322 runs . Allen 's team also won the second Test . England scored 426 for six on the first two days before rain prompted Allen to declare . On a damaged pitch , he took four for 10 ; Australia were bowled out for 80 and eventually lost by an innings . During the second Australian innings , Bradman , the Australian captain , who went on to score 82 , was at one point dropped by Robins . The latter apologised , but Allen replied : " Oh , forget it , old boy , it 's probably cost us the rubber , but what the hell ! " 
 Rain affected the third Test ; on the second day , Australia declared having scored 200 for nine in their first innings . In reply , England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch almost impossible to bat on . Several critics , including members of his own team , suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult . Allen considered the risk to be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine . Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the conditions eased ; the tactic worked , as he and Jack Fingleton shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket . Bradman scored 270 and England were defeated by 365 runs . In the fourth Test , Australia were bowled out for 288 in their first innings , when several of Allen 's tactical moves worked well . England replied with 330 , and Australia scored 433 in the second innings . Needing to score 392 to win , England were bowled out for 243 , and the series was level at 2 – 2 . 
 Complaining of exhaustion , and struggling with an injury , Allen rested from the MCC 's next tour games . He was criticised for this , by Warner among others , particularly when the team lost in his absence . Allen proposed that he miss the final Test , but the other selectors insisted he play . For the game , Australia chose a fast bowler , Laurie Nash , who had returned to first @-@ class cricket after a three @-@ year absence to play for Victoria against the MCC . Allen , concerned over the possible use of Bodyline by Nash , who had bowled short against the MCC , spoke to Bradman before the game . Bradman replied that an opposing captain could not veto members of his team , at which Allen went to the umpires and threatened to bring his team off the field if Bodyline was used . Struggling with a leg injury , Allen was below his best . Australia won the toss , scored 604 and , assisted by rain , bowled England out for 239 and 165 to win the match and series ; Nash did not bowl short . 
 The series was watched by over 900 @,@ 000 people in total ; the MCC took home a larger profit than on any previous tour . Allen was treated sympathetically by press and public . The Wisden review of the tour suggested : " It would be churlish to criticise Allen 's captaincy . During the first two Tests , almost every one of his moves succeeded instantly ... No doubt , Allen had studied his opponents carefully and knew their weaknesses , and if his tactics were not always dictated by accepted principles they certainly proved very successful . Those who attributed so much of the England captain 's success to good luck were inclined to overlook the many stratagems exploited by him " . In the Test series , he scored 150 runs at 18 @.@ 75 and took 17 wickets at 30 @.@ 94 . During the tour , Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and encouraged his team to fraternise with the Australian team . However , he clashed over tactics with one of his team , Joe Hardstaff ; the pair never got along thereafter . 
 The team played three games in New Zealand before returning home via America ; Allen left the team early and spent time in Hollywood . In all first @-@ class games , he scored 380 runs at 25 @.@ 33 and took 38 wickets at 26 @.@ 23 .

 = = = Before the war = = = 
 A combination of fatigue from the Australian tour and his need to return to work reduced the amount of cricket Allen played in 1937 , and he announced his unavailability for the summer 's Test series against New Zealand . He played just four first @-@ class games that season , scored 161 runs and took 15 wickets . When the following season began , he remained in contention for the England captaincy for the 1938 Ashes series . However , Wally Hammond , formerly a professional , became an amateur before the season , immediately making him another candidate . Allen played several times in the early season for Middlesex and performed well with bat and ball , but injured his back . Even so , he was selected to captain " the Rest " against England in a Test trial , but was annoyed that Hammond was preferred as captain of the England team , particularly as Warner had not discussed the matter with him . In the event , Allen withdrew on the grounds of fitness , and did not play again for over a month . When he returned , his form was good but a succession of injuries plagued him for the rest of the season . In 13 first @-@ class games , Allen scored 431 runs , with a highest score of 64 , at an average of 26 @.@ 93 . He also took 23 wickets at 25 @.@ 00 . In July 1938 , Allen was commissioned into the Territorial Army as a second lieutenant . He joined the City of London Yeomanry along with several friends and colleagues , and this took up much of his time in 1938 and 1939 . He had time for five first @-@ class games in 1939 , scoring 164 runs and taking 16 wickets , before he was called up to the regular army on 24 August 1939 . 
 = = = War service = = = 
 Allen 's regiment was part of the Royal Artillery ; he quickly became involved with Anti @-@ Aircraft Command and began to associate with Royal Air Force ( RAF ) officers . In 1940 , he was appointed as an Anti @-@ Aircraft ( AA ) liaison officer to RAF Hawkinge , part of an initiative to share intelligence on German AA operations with bomber groups ; these posts were controlled by a branch of Military Intelligence , MI14E . Later that year , Allen 's brother Geoffrey was killed fighting in France . 
 In June 1940 , Allen was appointed as a flak liaison officer to Five Group , an RAF Bomber Command group responsible for distributing intelligence on German air defences collated by MI14 to bomber stations . Through this position , Allen became friends with Arthur " Bomber " Harris , who commanded Five Group at the time . As part of his work there , Allen accompanied one bombing mission to the Ruhr , to gain first hand experience of AA defences . In December , Allen was appointed to lead the MI14E section which collated AA intelligence ; aside from appointing flak liaison officers , Allen received sensitive intelligence data from a variety of sources on German air defences . He remained in this position for the rest of the war , being promoted to lieutenant colonel when MI14E became <unk> . Throughout the war , he also found time to play regular charity cricket matches . Allen left the army in July 1945 . 
 = = = Last years as a cricketer = = = 
 After the war , Allen dedicated most of his time to stockbroking and was made a partner by David Bevan and Co . He had little time for cricket , although he appeared twice for Middlesex in 1946 . The following season , he played once for Middlesex , and captained their second team . He also played twice for the Free Foresters , a club of wandering amateurs , in first @-@ class games . Late in the 1947 season , Allen was asked to captain and manage an MCC team which was to tour the West Indies that winter . The young and experimental team suffered badly with injuries ; Allen missed several matches himself through strains . In first @-@ class games on the tour he scored 262 runs and took six wickets , but writing in Wisden , Norman Preston judged : " Allen was too old . " Allen also clashed with several members of his team ; he did not get along with Ken Cranston , his vice @-@ captain , nor Joe Hardstaff , his senior professional . When Allen tried to impose discipline on the team to prevent his players staying out late to drink alcohol , neither Cranston nor Hardstaff backed him . 
 With many players indisposed and his options limited , Allen requested reinforcements and the MCC sent out Len Hutton in time for the third Test ; in the meantime , Allen asked S. C. Griffith , not a highly regarded batsman , to open the batting for England in the second Test . Griffith responded by batting the entire first day and scoring 140 runs in total , his maiden century in first @-@ class cricket . The West Indies won the last two Tests ( the first two having been drawn ) to win the series ; the MCC team did not win a single match on the tour . Allen later regretted accepting the invitation to lead the team . In three Tests , he scored 94 runs and took five wickets . Allen did not play any more Test cricket ; in 25 matches , he scored 750 runs at an average of 24 @.@ 19 and took 81 wickets at 29 @.@ 37 . 
 Although Allen appeared four times for Middlesex in 1948 , most of his remaining cricket was played for the Free Foresters against Cambridge University . On very good batting pitches , the matches lacked a competitive edge , but in 12 games between 1948 and his retirement , he scored four centuries and averaged over 80 with the bat . In 1948 , he scored 180 in the fixture , the highest score of his career ; in combination with his success in Middlesex matches , he finished on top of the English batting averages that season . He played his final Middlesex games in 1950 , captaining the team in four matches in the absence of the regular captain , and made his final first @-@ class appearance for the Free Foresters in 1954 . In all first @-@ class cricket , he scored 9 @,@ 233 runs at an average of 28 @.@ 67 and took 788 wickets at 22 @.@ 23 . 
 = = Cricketing technique = = 
 Allen was capable of bowling unusually quickly . Critics judged him to have an excellent bowling action , through which he achieved his pace . He bowled from sideways on , and according to his Wisden obituary , had " a rhythmical run @-@ up and full follow @-@ through " . R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow described Allen in 1943 : " Of no more than medium height , he has a solid yet elastic strength , every unit of which is used in the delivery and in a follow @-@ through which is the finest I have ever seen . " Robertson @-@ Glasgow continued : " His bowling , though it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous irrelevance , has often touched greatness . " Although opposed to Bodyline tactics in Australia , Allen often bowled short to intimidate batsmen in county cricket — for example , he once struck Wyatt over the heart with a fast ball . 
 During the early part of his career , Allen was often in competition with Larwood . Swanton suggests that , had he played regularly , Allen may have matched the achievements of Larwood . Other critics had reservations . Alan Gibson , in his study of England captains , wrote that Allen " was a fast bowler , not quite of the highest class " ; he noted that Allen became more accurate as he got older , but this was offset by a loss of pace . Robertson @-@ Glasgow believed that Allen suffered from not bowling regularly . When called upon to play while lacking practice , he often " bowled wildly or inconsistently " . But Woodcock and Robertson @-@ Glasgow believed that , in this period , only Larwood was capable of more devastating spells of fast bowling among Englishmen . 
 As a batsman , Allen was technically sound . Robertson @-@ Glasgow described him as a " correct , strong and courageous " batsman who was at his best when his team most needed runs . Gibson called him as a " hard @-@ hitting batsman in the middle of the order " . In later years , his understanding of batting technique enabled him to co @-@ write the MCC coaching book . Gibson described Allen as an unlucky captain , affected by injuries and poor selection , who had little opportunity to lead teams . He judged him to be an orthodox tactician , possibly influenced by the fact that his two predecessors , Jardine and Wyatt , often used highly unusual tactics . Gibson stated that Allen was popular with his teams and that his influence during the potentially difficult Australia tour of 1936 – 37 was crucial . Wyatt rated him as a good captain , and stated : " As a captain , he was a disciplinarian but was always most considerate to the members of his side " . 
 = = Administrative career = = 
 Allen 's Wisden obituary stated : " [ He ] had a stronger influence on the welfare and development of cricket than anyone since Lord Harris [ who died in 1932 ] over a period of more than 50 years . " Gibson , writing in 1979 , described Allen as " a patriarchal , though not aloof , figure at Lord 's " . Ian Peebles , a team @-@ mate of Allen 's at Middlesex and later a journalist , said of him : " Allen 's impact [ as an administrator at Lord 's ] was immediate and it was the foundation of a remarkable career in the course of which he was to initiate and sponsor measures which affected every possible aspect of the game . " 
 = = = After the Second World War = = = 
 In the final stages of his playing career , Allen became increasingly influential off the field . After the war , he rejoined the MCC Committee . One of his first actions , prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour , was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers . Allen was heavily involved in an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s . Unlike many of the cricketing Establishment , who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority , Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and boys who did not have access to top @-@ class facilities . In 1951 , the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association , of which Allen was a member . Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC coaching book in 1951 , which aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country . Allen worked in collaboration with Harry Altham ; Allen was responsible for the technical aspects of the publication . In later years , Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator . However , in his survey of English cricket in the 1950s , Tim Quelch states that the coaching drive , and other similar initiatives at the time , achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached had little actual opportunity to play cricket . 
 = = = Test selector = = = 
 In July 1954 , Allen was involved in the selection of the MCC team to tour Australia in 1954 – 55 , as the MCC 's representative . That winter , he travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts and was present when England won three Test matches , which ensured victory in the series . Before the 1955 season , he was nominated as the Chairman of Selectors , and as his senior partner at David Bevan had no objection , he accepted . The workload of the post brought his playing days to an end . 
 Allen served as chairman from 1955 to 1961 ; under him were three other selectors , who varied throughout his period as chairman , and the serving England captain . Among Allen 's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship , good fielding , and for the team to bowl overs more quickly . While looking for new batting talent , Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen ; several emerged in this period , including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey , who had successful careers and were part of a strong English batting line @-@ up . However , at least one member of the England team , Jim Laker , resented the preference of amateurs , whom he believed were actually paid more for playing than the professionals . Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place ; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class . Allen also played the role of disciplinarian . Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life ; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed . He played an active role in home Test matches , generally attending at least three of the five days of every game , discussing tactics with the captain , and speaking to the press . In his first season , Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain ; Len Hutton , the serving captain , retired from the team with injury . In his place , the selectors appointed May , who served until 1959 and again in 1961 ; he and Allen established a good working relationship . When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961 , Cowdrey replaced him . 
 Allen and May 's first series in control resulted in a 3 – 2 win over South Africa . In 1956 , the Australians toured England . The home team won the five @-@ match series 2 – 1 . The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series . In the third Test , Allen pushed for the inclusion of Cyril Washbrook , who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years . The decision was controversial , and Quelch suggests that , with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test , Allen was feeling the pressure . He was also criticised in the press by Bill Bowes , a former England team @-@ mate , for forcing one of the England team , Fred Trueman , to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match , in an attempt to improve his accuracy . The incident took place before a large crowd ; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time , he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place . Washbrook scored 98 , and England won the match . In the fourth game , David Sheppard , who had barely played in 1956 , was selected and scored a century , and in the final Test Denis Compton was recalled after a long @-@ term injury and scored 94 . The Wisden editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season , making choices with which critics disagreed . He wrote : " I think it is appropriate , therefore , that tribute be paid to [ the selectors ] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer . Nothing was too much trouble for them . " Allen was involved in one controversial episode , when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to give a lot of assistance to spin bowlers , which led to Laker 's extraordinary success in the series . Allen denied any involvement . During the winter , Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket . 
 England won the 1957 Test series against the West Indies 3 – 0 and the 1958 series against New Zealand 4 – 0 . But despite having what was regarded as a strong team , England lost 4 – 0 in Australia in 1958 – 59 . The team was more successful afterwards , beating India 5 – 0 in 1959 , defeating West Indies 1 – 0 in 1959 – 60 and South Africa 3 – 0 in 1960 . Allen 's final series as chairman was against Australia in 1961 ; England lost after making tactical mistakes in the fourth Test . 
 = = = Influence behind the scenes = = = 
 In 1956 , Allen became chairman of the MCC 's Cricket Committee . The committee looked at ways to improve cricket , for example analysing whether reducing the size of the ball would help bowlers . Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions ; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken , and Allen took the lead . Three English bowlers were no @-@ balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960 . Geoff Griffin , a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960 , was perceived to have a suspect action ; when the bowler was no @-@ balled for throwing in a Test match , the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part . Later that year , Allen met Bradman , Australia 's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference ( ICC ) ; the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future , and the ICC agreed to take action . When Australia toured England in 1961 , no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team . Allen later took the lead in re @-@ drafting the law on throwing . 
 When the MCC abolished amateur status in cricket in 1963 , making all cricketers paid professionals , Allen opposed the change . In 1963 , he was appointed as MCC President . When his one @-@ year term of office ended in late 1964 , he was appointed to the influential role of MCC Treasurer , a position he filled until 1976 . During this period , Allen instituted several reforms , including limiting the terms of office of key positions . He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions . Less successfully , he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968 . He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968 . The newly formed Sports Council required that , to receive financial support from the government , cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members ' club . Allen and S. C. Griffith , the MCC secretary , liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council , comprising representatives from the MCC , the new Test and County Cricket Board and the National Cricket Association . This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC , and at Allen 's suggestion , the club 's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974 . 
 Allen was prosperous by this stage of his life . An inheritance from his mother , his earnings on the Stock Exchange and the success of investments he had made in Australia left him affluent — his knowledge of Australian markets was respected in the City . In 1965 , Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years ; he believed that his fast bowling may have brought about his hip problems . 
 = = = D 'Oliveira affair = = = 
 In 1968 , the MCC was involved in controversy over the non @-@ selection of the mixed @-@ race cricketer Basil D 'Oliveira to tour South Africa , which was then under apartheid . The South African government did not want D 'Oliveira , himself South African @-@ born , in the England team because of his colour . The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place , and that D 'Oliveira 's place in the team would be an issue , but wanted the tour to go ahead . The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas @-@ Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster , who privately did not want D 'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances . Vorster suggested to Douglas @-@ Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D 'Oliveira 's selection would be acceptable , but that it was likely no protest would be made . Douglas @-@ Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer . They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team , but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it . In his biography of D 'Oliveira , Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster 's intentions . 
 In March 1968 , Lord Cobham , an MCC member who wanted the tour to go ahead , met Vorster , who told him that D 'Oliveira would not be an acceptable selection to the South African government . Cobham communicated this information to an MCC Committee member , whose identity has never been made public , by private letter . Other than the recipient , only Allen , Griffith and the then @-@ President Arthur Gilligan were aware of the letter , but they chose to keep its contents from the rest of the Committee . Allen 's justification was that Douglas @-@ Home , a statesman and former Prime Minister , had given advice which contradicted this ; also , other Committee members were Test selectors and Allen believed that the information would place non @-@ cricketing pressures on their choices for the England team . Oborne suggests that Douglas @-@ Home 's advice was made redundant by Cobham 's letter , and that Allen 's supposed desire to protect the other selectors was " preposterous " as the tour would have been cancelled . 
 When the English selectors met to choose the team , Allen , Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC ; they had no official say in the selection , but Oborne suggests that Allen made it clear that he considered D 'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on cricketing grounds . D 'Oliveira was eventually left out , to considerable anger and controversy . When he was later added to the team following an injury to another player , Vorster said that the MCC would not be welcome and the tour was cancelled . Some of the events leading up to D 'Oliveira 's exclusion became public knowledge the following year ; the MCC came under heavy public pressure , and the press called for Allen to resign . Oborne suggests that Allen , although not a supporter of apartheid , wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa ; he regarded opponents of apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment . 
 In 1970 , the proposed visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition . The MCC was no longer solely responsible for any decisions , being only a part of the Cricket Council , but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead . He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities ; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Allen retired from the Stock Exchange in 1972 , resigned as MCC Treasurer in 1976 and left the Cricket Council in 1982 . He was appointed a CBE in 1962 and knighted in 1986 . In 1968 , Allen moved to a flat directly behind the Pavilion at Lord 's , where he lived until his death . Following his retirement , he spent much of his time in the MCC Committee room , watching cricket at Lord 's . He never married , and died at home on 29 November 1989 , suffering from the effects of a stomach operation earlier in the year . 
 = Belted Galloway = 
 The Belted Galloway is a heritage beef breed of cattle originating from Galloway in the west side of southern Scotland , adapted to living on the poor upland pastures and windswept moorlands of the region . The exact origin of the breed is unclear although it is often surmised that the white belt that distinguishes these cattle from the native black Galloway cattle may be as a result of cross breeding with Dutch <unk> belted cattle . It is the belt that gives them their name . 
 Belted Galloways are primarily raised for their quality marbled beef , although they are sometimes milked and purchased to adorn pastures due to their striking appearance . 
 In the United States , Belted Galloways are often nicknamed Oreo cows because their color pattern is reminiscent of an Oreo cookie , the sandwich cookie consisting of two chocolate disks with a cream filling in between . The black and red coat colors are caused by the same alleles of the MC1R gene , ED for black and e / e for red , as in most other breeds of cattle . 
 = = Breed history = = 
 The origin of the white belt is unknown , but generally presumed to come from cross breeding with Dutch Belted cattle , also known as <unk> . A Polled Herd Book was started in 1852 which registered both Aberdeen @-@ Angus and Galloways . Galloway breeders acquired their own herd book in 1878 . The Dun and Belted Galloway Association was formed in Scotland in 1921 , and in 1951 the name of the organization was changed to the Belted Galloway Society and dun cattle were no longer registered . It also keeps and records pedigrees for Belted Galloways and oversees the registration of White and Red Galloways . 
 Currently in the UK there is a thriving breeding programme overseen and guided by the Belted Galloway Cattle Society . Belted Galloways were first imported to the United States by a Mrs. McLean of East Kortright , New York . The formerly known American Belted Galloway Breeders Society was formed in the United States on July 1 , 1951 by Harry A. Prock of Whitemarsh , Pennsylvania , Gordon Green of Quebec , Canada and Charles C. Wells of East Lansing , Michigan . It is now known as The U.S. Belted Galloway Society Inc . 
 = = Population = = 
 Belted Galloways , also informally known as <unk> , are currently listed with the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy as a " recovering " breed , which means there are more than 2 @,@ 500 annual registrations in the United States and a global population of exceeding than 10 @,@ 000 . However , this status still means that they were once on the watch list . In 2007 they were formally removed from the UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust 's watch list , having recovered sufficiently from the devastation of the foot and mouth crisis of the early 2000s , to have reached in excess of 1500 registered breeding females . 18 @,@ 390 cattle were registered in the US in 2015 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Galloway cattle are naturally polled . The most visible characteristics of the Belted Galloway are its long hair coat and the broad white belt that completely encircles the body . Its coarse outer coat helps shed the rain , and its soft undercoat provides insulation and waterproofing , enabling the breed to spend winter outside . Black <unk> are most prominent , but Dun and Red <unk> are also recognized by breed societies , the latter being comparatively rare and sought after . A female Belted Galloway cannot be registered in the Herd Book if it has white above the dewclaw other than the belt , but can be registered in the Appendix . A bull can only be registered in the Herd book if it has no other white than the belt . 
 The dun color is caused by a mutation in the <unk> gene , the same mutation that causes dun and silver dun in Highland cattle . 
 Bulls weigh from 1 @,@ 700 pounds ( 770 kg ) to 2 @,@ 300 pounds ( 850 kg ) with the usual being around 1 @,@ 800 pounds ( 820 kg ) . Cows weigh from 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) to 1 @,@ 500 pounds ( 675 kg ) with the usual being around 1 @,@ 250 pounds ( 565 kg ) . Calves generally weigh around 70 pounds . Belted Galloways are generally of a quiet temperament , but still maintain a maternal instinct and will protect a calf against perceived threats . 
 They are well @-@ suited for rough grazing land and will utilize coarse grasses other breeds would shun . They are able to maintain good condition on less than ideal pasture , and produce a high quality beef product on grass alone . 
 = Maggie Laubser = 
 Maria Magdalena Laubser , known as Maggie Laubser ( 14 April 1886 – 17 May 1973 ) was a South African painter and printmaker . She is generally considered , along with Irma Stern , to be responsible for the introduction of Expressionism to South Africa . Her work was initially met with derision by critics but has gained wide acceptance , and now she is regarded as an exemplary and quintessentially South African artist . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Maria Magdalena Laubser was born on the wheat farm <unk> near Malmesbury in the Swartland , a productive agricultural area in South Africa . She was the eldest of six children of <unk> Petrus Christiaan Laubser and Johanna Catharina Laubser ( née Holm ) . Laubser 's youth was dominated by the rural and pastoral and she delighted in this carefree existence . 
 After attending the farm school <unk> , she left for boarding school at <unk> Seminary , Stellenbosch , where she was introduced to the art of drawing . She returned to the farm in 1901 , and during a visit to Cape Town she met Beatrice Hazel , a realistic romantic style painter , who introduced her to Edward Roworth , giving impetus to her desire to study painting . 
 In 1903 she convinced her parents to let her go to Cape Town once a week for singing lessons . The difficulty of travel and the low opinion her mother had of her mezzo @-@ soprano voice discouraged her , but it was at this stage that she started painting on her own . 
 She studied painting under Roworth in Cape Town for two months of 1903 , during which time she received a silver medal for her work . By 1907 she had become proficient enough to be elected to the South African Society of Artists ( <unk> ) and , in 1909 , she was represented at the annual exhibition of the <unk> and the Fine Arts Association of Cape Town . By 1910 , she had her own studio in Strand Street , Cape Town . 
 During a 1912 visit to her nephew , Gert Coetzee , in Pretoria , she took up employment as a governess on a farm owned by the <unk> family in <unk> district , Transvaal , where she also taught art and needlework . While on vacation in Durban with a friend , Sophie Fisher , she befriended Jan Hendrik Arnold Balwé ( Consul for the Netherlands in Durban 1903 @-@ 1913 ) , a shipping @-@ line owner who offered to finance her and her sister Hannah 's studies abroad . 
 = = = Holland and England = = = 
 Laubser and her sister left for Europe on 4 October 1913 , initially living in an artists ' colony at Laren , Noord @-@ Holland in an area called het <unk> . She met Ita Mees , a concert pianist and Frederik van <unk> , author and poet . She also befriended Laura Knight and Frans <unk> , both painters . In the last years of his life , Anton Mauve ( 1838 – 1888 ) , who was an important influence on Vincent van Gogh , lived in Laren . Maggie worked in the studio he established there . 
 At the outbreak of World War I she went to London . She initially stayed in Huntingdonshire and then , in October 1914 , moved to a London hotel and registered at the Slade School of Art for the period October 1914 to March 1919 . Henry Tonks , Walter Westley Russell and Ambrose McEvoy taught her drawing , while Philip Wilson Steer lectured her in painting . It seems that she never painted during her time at the Slade , instead concentrating her efforts on drawing of portraiture and figure studies . Maggie returned to South Africa briefly in 1915 to visit the new family farm at <unk> , near <unk> in the Cape Province and again in March 1919 , after her studies were concluded .

 = = = Belgium , June 1919 to September 1920 = = = 
 She left London on 6 June 1919 for Belgium , staying at Antwerp and the Villa Chenes in the <unk> Lei in <unk> . She befriended Arnold Balwé , son of her patron , who studied at the Academy . She might have accompanied Balwé as an occasional student , as is evidenced by a number of nude studies sketched during this period . There is also some evidence that she came into contact with the art of Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter during a stay in Munich in 1919 . 
 = = = Italy , October 1920 to August 1921 = = = 
 She travelled with Balwé to Italy in August / September 1920 and lived and worked at Torri del <unk> and San <unk> on the Garda Lake . During this time the couple was supported financially by Balwé 's father and this gave them freedom to work on paintings for possible exhibitions instead of sale . A large number of signed and dated works from this period give some support to this . 
 J. H. A. Balwé had been ill towards the end of 1920 , and Arnold Balwé and Maggie accompanied him to Bad Kissingen in mid @-@ April 1921 , where he died in April or May of that year . After Balwé 's death Laubser 's meanders took her to Venice , where she visited the Doge 's Palace ( June / July 1921 ) , then to Milan and , on 18 August 1921 , back to Germany . On 19 September 1921 she arrived in Cape Town on the Union @-@ Castle Line . 
 = = = Germany , November 1922 to November 1924 = = = 
 Laubser was issued with a visa by the German Consulate in Cape Town on 16 November 1922 and was installed at Kurfürstendamm 40 , Berlin by 1 January 1923 . Her address had apparently changed to Kurfürstendamm 43 , Berlin by 23 January 1923 . She looked up Irma Stern and they undertook a trip to the Baltic Sea at <unk> for three weeks in July 1923 . After trips to Weimar and Bavaria and another change of address from <unk> 5 to lodgings with a Fräulein Finck at Von der Heydt Strasse 1 , south of the Tiergarten , which she obtained with the help of her friend Kate Mädler , she settled down to the cultural life of Berlin . She met members of the diplomatic corps , painted portraits and attended music concerts . She befriended pianists Wilhelm Busch and Otto <unk> . 
 It was in Berlin , from 1922 to 1924 , that she came into contact with German Expressionism and was encouraged by Karl Schmidt @-@ Rottluff . The works of Emil Nolde , Max Pechstein , Franz Marc and Erich <unk> were available to her and clarified her ambitions . She singled out Franz Marc of Der Blaue Reiter and Nolde , Schmidt @-@ Rottluff and Pechstein of Die Brücke as significant to her personality , although she would claim not to have been influenced by them . The extent of their influence is evident in that she came closest to the German Expressionist style during these years , in which she produced a series of ten lithographs called <unk> . 
 On 14 August 1924 she made arrangements with Allison Bros. , London to ship her paintings to South Africa . 
 = = South African debut and critical reception = = 
 In November 1924 , Laubser returned to South Africa and settled at <unk> , the family farm . She met sculptor Moses <unk> and the cartoonist D. C. <unk> , who introduced her to his son Gregoire , founding member of the New Group , and renewed her friendship with painters Ruth Prowse and Nita <unk> . She was asked to exhibit in Cape Town , and was cruelly disillusioned . Her work , like that of Irma Stern , met with fierce criticism , most notably from Bernard Lewis of Die Burger and The Cape Times , who as late as 1931 was able to write of her work in a group show : 
 " Is there any normal , sane human being in all South Africa who is able to appreciate as a work of art , to enjoy as a picture ... the one sent by Maggie Laubser ? " — Bernard Lewis 
 In April 1929 she met P. <unk> and his wife , as well as A. C. Celliers and Koos Botha , all of whom encouraged her to have a one man exhibition . Her first solo exhibition was held in Stellenbosch , with support from A. C. <unk> and Con de Villiers . During this time she also met Martin du Toit , who would become a fervent supporter , organising her first exhibition in the Transvaal in 1931 . 
 = = Empire Exhibition , Johannesburg , 1936 = = 
 On 3 May 1936 , Laubser 's father died , leaving the farm to her brother , and establishing a trust fund for her mother . Laubser would inherit the balance of the trust fund when her mother died on 20 November 1936 . Although she was treated harshly by the press , Laubser was elected to the selection panel of the prestigious British Empire Exhibition , the convener of which was M. L. du Toit , without her parents living to see this acquiescence to her talents . 
 The Empire Exhibition was a quadrennial exposition , which in 1936 was held in Milner Park , Johannesburg , and it was representative of the best South Africa had to offer . It was here that Laubser would become familiar with Alexis <unk> , who would attract the ire of the critics for his work at the first New Group exhibition on 4 May 1938 . Maggie Laubser would also be a member of the New Group , and present at the exhibition of 1938 . 
 = = Later years and legacy = = 
 Maggie Laubser was active from as early as 1900 and continued working uninterrupted until her death in 1973 . The catalogue raisonné compiled by <unk> Marais contains 1784 individual works . Her predominant style of work is generally accepted by many authors to be Expressionist , but there are also identifiable elements of Fauvism at work , and a pastoralism that belie the German Expressionist prototypes to which Maggie was exposed . 
 After the death of her parents she settled in Cape Town in 1937 , taking a studio in <unk> <unk> . In 1942 , she moved to the Strand . She built a cottage there , called <unk> Lig ( Always Bright ) , in 1947 . On 28 May 1946 Prof. P. J. <unk> announced that Loubser would receive the honorary medal of the Academy of Arts and Science . In 1947 she received the Oscar award for painting from Die Vaderland , a newspaper . In 1948 , membership of the South African Academy for Arts and Science was awarded to her and the poet Elisabeth <unk> . She continued painting and continued to evolve her style , and in 1959 she was presented with an honorary membership of the Academy of Art and Science . The South African Association of Arts honoured her with a medal in 1968 , presented by Prof. A. L. <unk> . 
 The South African National Gallery and the Pretoria Art Museum combined to host a major retrospective exhibition of Laubser 's works in 1969 . This was followed in 1987 by a retrospective of early works , again at the South African National Gallery , which ran from 2 December 1987 to 31 January 1988 . 
 Maggie Laubser died on 17 May 1973 at <unk> Lig . There was an unfinished canvas on her easel .

 = Steak = 
 A steak is a meat generally sliced perpendicular to the muscle fibers , potentially including a bone . Exceptions , in which the meat is sliced parallel to the fibers , include the skirt steak that is cut from the plate , the flank steak that is cut from the abdominal muscles , and the <unk> steak that is cut from the loin and includes three rib bones . When the word " steak " is used without qualification , it generally refers to a beefsteak . In a larger sense , there are also fish steaks , ground meat steaks , pork steak and many more varieties . 
 Steaks are usually grilled , but they can be pan @-@ fried , or broiled . Steak is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire . Steak can also be cooked in sauce , such as in steak and kidney pie , or minced and formed into patties , such as hamburgers . 
 Steaks are also cut from grazing animals , usually farmed , other than cattle , including bison , camel , goat , horse , kangaroo , sheep , ostrich , pigs , reindeer , turkey and deer , as well as various types of fish , especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish , shark and marlin . For some meats , such as pork , lamb and mutton , <unk> and veal , these cuts are often referred to as chops . Some cured meat , such as gammon , is commonly served as steak . 
 Grilled Portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak , and similarly for other vegetarian dishes . Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat , while fruits such as watermelon can be grilled and described as " watermelon steak " because of their shape and color . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word steak originates from the mid @-@ 15th century Scandinavian word <unk> , or <unk> ' in the Middle English dialect , along with the Old Norse word <unk> . The Oxford English Dictionary 's first reference is to " a thick slice of meat cut for roasting or grilling or frying , sometimes used in a pie or pudding ; especially a piece cut from the hind @-@ quarters of the animal . " Subsequent parts of the entry , however , refer to " steak fish " , which referred to " cod of a size suitable for cutting into steaks " , and also " steak @-@ raid " , which was a custom among Scottish Highlanders of giving some cattle being driven through a gentleman 's land to the owner . An early written usage of the word " <unk> " comes from a 15th @-@ century cookbook , and makes reference to both beef or venison steaks .

In 2010 , there were 244 @,@ 000 cattle producers in Argentina . In Argentina , a steakhouse is referred to as a <unk> , which are common throughout the country . Portion sizes of steak dishes in Argentine restaurants tend to be large , with steaks weighing over 454 grams ( one pound ) being commonplace . <unk> is a traditional dish that often includes steak and is also the standard word for " barbecue " in Argentina and other countries . <unk> is considered a national dish of the country .

 The " Steak of Origin " competition has been run for a decade on behalf of the Beef + Lamb Corporation of New Zealand . It " aims to find the most tender and tasty sirloin steak " in the country . Criteria for judging claims to include " tenderness , pH , marbling and % cooking loss " however while this data is collected for each entrant steak , only the shear force ( correlated to perceived tenderness ) determines qualification to a tasting panel , at which objective taste from a panel determines the winner . The pH is used solely to disqualify entrants and neither the ' marbling ' or the ' % cooking loss ' have any effect on the outcome of the competition at any stage .

 According to a survey by trade magazine Caterer and Hotelkeeper , the most popular dinner menu in British restaurants in the 1980s included steak : being prawn cocktail , steak and Black Forest <unk> . 
 Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus date back to the 1700s , and a handful of farmers continue to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls .

 In the United States , cuts of beef for retail sale include various beefsteaks , as well as stew meat and hamburger meat . In the U.S. circa 1956 , approximately 24 % of retail beef cuts were beef steaks . 
 Beef production is the largest single agriculture in the United States , with 687 @,@ 540 farms raising cattle and over a million in the production process , as of the 2007 Agriculture Census . On average , a single farm typically raises about 50 cattle at a time , with 97 percent of the cattle farms classified as one of these small family farms .

 = = Cooking = = 
 Beef steaks are commonly grilled , broiled or occasionally fried . Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures , or for different lengths of time ; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue ( very rare ) to overdone . The most common characteristics of a rare steak is a soft , cold , red center . The outside is seared for flavor , while the inside is cooked to suit the diner 's preference . Steaks cooked well @-@ done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat . For example , a beefsteak cooked well @-@ done will not have any <unk> in the middle when sliced . <unk> beef steak can be served raw , such as in steak <unk> . 
 Fish steaks are generally cooked for a short time , as the flesh cooks quickly , especially when grilled . Fish steaks , such as tuna , can also be cooked to various temperatures , such as rare and medium @-@ rare . The different ways in which a steak dish could be cut are - rib eye , sirloin , tenderloin , rump , <unk> and t @-@ bone . 
 Cuts of steak are quite dissimilar between countries owing to different methods of cutting up the carcass . The result is that a steak found in one country is not the same as in another , although the recipes may be the same , differing " only in their sauces , butters or <unk> " .

 Down on the place d 'Armes near <unk> 's , there was a restaurant ... the Pré Aux <unk> ... [ that ] made very good grilled rare steaks with watercress , which at that time were beginning to be in great vogue in the big cities among the younger generation ... les <unk> ... but were dismissed with impatient disgust by older <unk> raised in the intricate traditions of fine sauces and culinary disguise .

 Steak has become a popular dish in many places around the world , cooked in domestic as well as professional kitchens , and is often a primary ingredient in a menu . It is used in small amounts in an hors d 'oeuvre , in an entrée dish or more usually , in a larger amount as the main course . A steak knife is a specialized piece of cutlery to make cutting the steak easier . It is sharper than other knives and has a serrated edge . Steak has also been an important breakfast dish , especially for people undertaking hard outdoor work , such as farmers .

 A steakhouse is a restaurant that specializes in beefsteaks and other individual portions of meat . <unk> started in London in the 1690s , and served individual portions of meat , known as chops . The houses were normally only open for men : for example , women were only admitted to Stone 's Chop House in 1921 . Accounts of travellers in 19th century London refer to their " dining off mutton chop , rump steak and a ' weal ' cutlet " , as well as hams and <unk> . 
 Delmonico 's restaurant in New York City , which opened in 1827 and stayed open for almost 100 years , has been described as " the most famous steak restaurant in American history " . Delmonico steak refers to a method of preparation from one of several cuts of beef ( typically the rib cut ) prepared Delmonico style , originally from the mid @-@ 19th century . 
 Hundreds of restaurants continue to specialize in serving steak , describing themselves as " steakhouses " , competing for culinary awards and aiming for culinary excellence .

 Steak and other meat products can now be frozen and exported , but before the invention of commercial refrigeration , transporting meat over long distances was impossible . Communities had to rely on what was locally available , which , in turn , determined the forms and tradition of meat consumption . Hunter @-@ gathering peoples cut steaks from local indigenous animals . For example , Sami cuisine relies partly on the meat of the reindeer ; the Inuit diet uses locally caught sea @-@ mammal meat from whales ; Indigenous Australians ate kangaroo , while indigenous North American food included bison steak . In the Middle East , meat recipes from medieval times onwards simply state " meat " without specifying the kind or the cut and " apart from an occasional gazelle , kid or camel " , only lamb and mutton were eaten because cattle were seldom bred . 
 In contemporary Argentina , where consumption of steak is very high , steak is a significant part of the national cuisine and the barbecue <unk> has the status of a national dish .

 Many types of beefsteak exist . The more tender cuts of beef , from the loin and rib , are cooked quickly , using dry heat , and served whole . Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized ( e.g. cube steak ) . Beef steak can be cooked to a level of very rare ( bleu , a cold raw center ) , rare , medium rare , medium , medium well done , or well done . Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside . Beef , unlike certain other meats , does not need to be cooked through . Food @-@ borne human illnesses are not normally found within a beef steak , though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling , and thus , very rare steak ( seared on the outside and raw within ) is generally accepted as safe . 
 Beef steak is graded for quality , with higher prices for higher quality . Generally , the higher the quality , the more tender the beef , the less time is needed for cooking , or the better the flavor . For example , beef fillet is the most tender and <unk> , such as Kobe beef from Japan , is known for its high quality and commands a high price . Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat , particularly when cooked at very high temperatures , such as by broiling or grilling . 
 The quality and safety of steak as a food product is regulated by law . In Australia , there are National Meat Accreditation standards ; in Canada , there is the Canadian Beef Grading Agency ; in the United Kingdom , the Food Standards Agency is responsible ; in the United States , beef is graded by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) as select , choice or prime , where " prime " refers to beef of the highest quality , typically that which has significant marbling . In 1996 in the U.S. , only 2 @.@ 4 % of cattle were graded as prime , and most prime beef is sold in restaurants and hotels . 
 There is a wide range of quickly prepared and well @-@ known beef steak dishes , including Minute steak , steak sandwiches , and steak and eggs . " Surf and turf " , which combines meat and fish , requires more time to prepare . Steak meat is also often minced , shredded , chopped finely or re @-@ formed to create a range of dishes , including steak burgers , that retain the name " steak " . Other such dishes include : 
 Chicken fried steak – a breaded cutlet dish consisting of a piece of steak ( tenderized cube steak ) coated with seasoned flour and pan @-@ fried . It is associated with U.S. Southern cuisine . 
 Hamburg steak – a beefsteak that is shaped into a patty to be cooked after being minced . It is similar to the Salisbury steak . Made popular worldwide by the migrating Germans , it became a mainstream dish around the start of the nineteenth century . 
 <unk> steak – a class of imitation beef steaks made from smaller pieces of beef fused together by a binding agent . Its development started in the 1970s . 
 Salisbury steak , first recorded in 1897 and named after James Salisbury , a doctor during the American Civil War , who recommended people eat hamburger three times per day . During World War I , American soldiers replaced the word " hamburger " with Salisbury steak for political reasons . 
 = = = Fish steak = = = 
 Fish steaks are cut perpendicular to the spine and include bones . Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef , steaks from swordfish , halibut , tuna , salmon and mahi @-@ mahi can be grilled . They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets . Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon , wine or sauce or cooked en <unk> . 
 Commercial sashimi tuna steaks may have their coloration fixated by the use of flushing with carbon monoxide ( CO ) , whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna , which is then stored at 4 ° Celsius . The duration of time for color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat . For example , a two @-@ inch tuna steak takes twenty @-@ four hours for color fixation to be completed using this process . When utilized , color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage . In Japan , color fixation using CO is prohibited .

 Pork steaks are generally cut from the shoulder of the pig , but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig .

 Cooked gammon steaks are a component of a full breakfast , whereas ham steaks from a rolled pork loin are more likely to be served at lunch .

 Mass Effect 2 is an action role @-@ playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts . It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26 , 2010 , and for PlayStation 3 on January 18 , 2011 . Mass Effect 2 is the second installment of the Mass Effect series and a sequel to the original Mass Effect . The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century , where humanity is threatened by an insectoid species known as the Collectors . The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard , an elite human soldier who must construct and gain the loyalty of a diverse team in order to defeat the enemy in a suicide mission . With the use of a completed saved game of its predecessor , the player can impact the story of the game in numerous ways . 
 For the game , BioWare changed several gameplay elements and put further emphasis on third @-@ person shooter aspects , including limited ammunition and <unk> health . In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect , the developers opted to create a plot where optional missions had as much intensity as the main mission . Mass Effect composer Jack Wall returned to compose Mass Effect 2 's music , aiming for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game . Mass Effect 2 also supports a variety of downloadable content packs , ranging from single in @-@ game character outfits to entirely new plot @-@ related missions . Notable packs include Overlord , Lair of the Shadow Broker , and Arrival . 
 Mass Effect 2 was a commercial success and received considerable acclaim from video game publications , with the Xbox 360 version holding a score of 96 out of 100 at the review aggregate website Metacritic . Critics praised multiple aspects of the game , including its interactive storytelling , characterization , and combat . In contrast , some reviewers expressed concerns about the game 's simplified gameplay compared to the previous game in the series . The game received numerous year @-@ end awards , including Game of the Year at the 14th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards , and Best Game at the 2011 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards . The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time . A sequel , Mass Effect 3 , was released in 2012 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Mass Effect 2 is a single @-@ player action role @-@ playing game in which the player takes the role of Commander Shepard through a third @-@ person perspective . Shepard 's gender , appearance , military background , combat @-@ training and first name are determined by the player before the game begins . The player may choose to import a character from a completed saved game of the original Mass Effect or start the game with a new character . Importing an old character allows several decisions the player made in the original game to impact the story of Mass Effect 2 and grants the player a set of starting bonuses . The game features six different character classes for the player to choose from . Each class is proficient in a different set of powers and weapon types . For example , the Vanguard class is specialized in close @-@ range combat and shotguns , while the Infiltrator class relies on stealth combat and the use of sniper rifles . 
 The world of Mass Effect 2 is a galaxy map that the player can explore to find and complete quests . Most quests consist of combat missions , but some involve the player interacting with local characters during visits to settlements . As the player progresses throughout the game , different locations and new squad members become available . Experience points are gained by completing quests . Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained , the player " levels up " and is awarded Squad Points that can be used to develop powers for both Shepard and the members of the squad . Powers provide enhanced combat capabilities , with each power having four ranks that can be unlocked . Each rank costs the same number of Squad Points as its rank . For example , unlocking the first rank of a power requires one point , but unlocking all four ranks of a single power requires a total of ten points . Upon raising a power to its fourth rank , the player must evolve the power into one of two given forms . 
 The player 's primary mode of transportation is a starship which serves as Shepard 's base of operations . Aboard the ship , the player can interact with the squad members , customize the player 's armor , travel to numerous planetary systems , and scan planets for mineral resources . These resources allow the player to research numerous in @-@ game upgrades that are found in the missions , providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage , fortifying the player 's health , or extending the ship 's fuel capacity , among others . Scanning requires the player to move a reticle over a planet and launch a probe when an oscilloscope warns of near resources . Additional upgrades , equipment , and nonessential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad @-@ based and a maximum of two combat members may accompany the player on the battlefield . The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence . Battles take place in real @-@ time , but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use . The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third @-@ person shooter , and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces . The player may also issue commands to the squad members , such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target . 
 Unlike the original Mass Effect , where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods , the weapons of Mass Effect 2 have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots . Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage @-@ absorbing shield . When the shield is fully depleted , further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter . Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period . The player can revive fallen squad members with the use of the Unity power . However , if Shepard dies , the player must start the game again from the last saved point . 
 All enemies are protected by health , shields , armor , barriers , or a combination thereof . Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities . For example , armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate , which burns enemies over time , and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols . In contrast , shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid @-@ firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles . Barriers are typically used by boss @-@ type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers . When the shields , armor , or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted , the player can use status @-@ effect powers such as Pull , which temporarily levitates targets into the air , incapacitating them . Other powers may temporary benefit the player ; for instance , Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time . Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource ; they only have a global refresh time period . 
 = = = Dialogue and morality = = = 
 During conversations with characters , Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu , called Dialogue Wheel , where the player 's dialogue options depend on wheel direction . The left side of the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth , while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion . Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless , while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile . The game also introduces a context @-@ sensitive interrupt system , allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times . Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard , the rewards for completing missions , possible discounts from merchants , romances and , most importantly , the Commander 's morality . 
 Morality is measured by Paragon ( charm ) and Renegade ( intimidate ) points . These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game . For example , the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad . What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member , which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle . Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed , Shepard included , and everything in between . Upon completing the game , a New Game Plus option is unlocked , allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it .

 Mass Effect 2 is set within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century where interstellar travel is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays , a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the <unk> . A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community . Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian <unk> and <unk> , the environmental suited quarians , and a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called geth . 
 During the events of the original Mass Effect , a geth army attempted to open a portal for a highly advanced machine race of synthetic @-@ organic starships known as the Reapers . It is believed that the Reapers eradicate all organic civilization every 50 @,@ 000 years . The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion . Meanwhile , a pro @-@ human organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity 's ascension are entirely justified , including illegal or dangerous experimentation , terrorist activities , sabotage , and assassination . As such , the Citadel Council has declared Cerberus to be a terrorist organization and will prosecute Cerberus agents accordingly .

Other characters include Normandy 's pilot Jeff " Joker " Moreau ( Seth Green ) , Cerberus leader the Illusive Man ( Martin Sheen ) , and Normandy SR @-@ 2 's enhanced defense intelligence , also known as EDI ( Tricia Helfer ) . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Mass Effect 2 begins weeks after the events of the original game . While patrolling for geth resistance , the SSV Normandy is attacked by an unknown starship , forcing the crew to abandon ship . During the evacuation , Shepard tosses Joker into the Normandy 's final escape pod before being blasted into space . After a suit breach , Shepard dies of asphyxiation as his / her body is pulled into the orbit of a nearby planet . Shepard 's body is recovered shortly after death by Cerberus , who creates the Lazarus Project with the sole purpose of bringing Shepard back to life . After two years , Shepard awakens on an operating table to ringing alarm bells in a research station under attack by its own security mechs . Shepard teams up with Jacob Taylor and medical officer Wilson to reach the escape shuttle . However , Miranda Lawson , who was already waiting at the shuttle bay , shoots Wilson , citing him as the station 's betrayer . Shepard is brought to meet with the Illusive Man , who reveals that entire populations of human colonies are disappearing all over the galaxy . 
 Now working for Cerberus , Shepard is sent to investigate a recently attacked colony where he / she finds clues about the validity that the Reapers are working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors . The Illusive Man explains that Shepard must construct a team in order to stop the Collectors who reside beyond the Omega @-@ 4 Relay , a place from which no ship has ever returned . Shepard is also given command of a new starship , the Normandy SR @-@ 2 , piloted again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI . Shepard recruits four new squad members — Mordin Solus , Garrus Vakarian , Jack , and ( optionally ) Grunt — before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack . With the help of Mordin 's studies on Collector biology , Shepard successfully stops the attack , but a large portion of the colony 's population is captured . Shepard continues to recruit squad members , adding Tali 'Zorah , Thane <unk> , and Samara , until the Illusive Man contacts Shepard about a supposedly disabled Collector ship . As Shepard and the squad board the ship , they encounter no Collector resistance and learn that the Collectors were originally <unk> turned into slaves of the Reapers . With EDI 's help , Shepard finds out how to bypass the Omega @-@ 4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors . Although Shepard and the squad manage to escape the Collector ship , relations between Shepard and the Illusive Man are strained due to the Illusive Man 's knowledge of the Collector trap . 
 After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad , Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF transponder necessary for safe travel through the Omega @-@ 4 Relay . Shepard may acquire a disabled geth that , if activated , voluntarily joins the squad and is given the name of Legion . The Normandy integrates the IFF into her systems while Shepard and the squad leave the ship in a shuttle . During their absence , the Normandy is attacked and boarded by the Collectors . Only Joker avoids capture and , with EDI 's help , is able to get the Normandy away from the ambush . After Shepard 's squad returns to the Normandy , the team uses the Omega @-@ 4 Relay to get to the Collector base , located in the Galactic Center . In the Collectors base , the team rescues any surviving members of the Normandy and fight their way to the central chamber . Squad members may survive or perish depending on their loyalty to Shepard , the upgrades made to the Normandy , and the tasks assigned for specific members to perform in the battle . 
 In the central chamber , Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted humans , but EDI is unsure of its true purpose . Shepard destroys the machine powering the human Reaper and prepares to destroy the Collector base . However , before doing so , the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base with a radiation pulse so that its information can be used against the Reapers . After choosing to destroy or sterilize the base , Shepard destroys the awakened human @-@ reaper larva and , if enough squad members survived , escapes the base before the bomb detonates . If no squad members survive , Shepard will be unable to escape the Collector Base and will die . Back on the Normandy , Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man , who either praises or condemns Shepard 's decision . As Shepard meets in the Normandy 's cargo bay with the survivors of the mission , Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper . Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers , who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy , setting the stage for Mass Effect 3 . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mass Effect 2 was developed by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson , who previously led the production of the first Mass Effect game . Development of the game started in early 2008 , shortly before the Microsoft Windows version of the original game was released . Before actual production for Mass Effect 2 began , BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans , reviewers and internal people . The development team 's main goal was to " create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience . " In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect , Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where side stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities . He noted , " the funny thing is that people will say ' other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission , there 's not much story there . ' But that is the story . " 
 During the first stages of development , the designers ' priority was purely on streamlining and polishing the shooting aspects ; RPG elements did not start until this process was complete . According to lead designer Christina Norman , " we wanted more satisfying combat and a big part of that is making weapons more accurate and powerful at level one – basically saying ' let 's take the RPG out of the shooter . ' " Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games , the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original Mass Effect as a basis . Norman explained that they wanted the weapons to have their own identity , noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables . The inclusion of limited ammunition was not initially part of the main game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting . However , the developers eventually felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat . 
 BioWare wanted more real @-@ time gameplay with emphasis on weapons and cover . Norman explained that the constant pausing to select powers interrupts the intensity of the combat . For that reason , the team added more options to assign different abilities to the game controller for use in real @-@ time . Developers also decided to introduce regenerating health because it prevents players from playing erratically and relying on health kits . Norman remarked that it was important not to <unk> the RPG elements but to still make them easier to use . She explained that the original game offered " too many choices that weren 't particularly representative of how they would impact the game . In Mass Effect 2 , the leveling options were pared down and made more descriptive . " For the character classes , the developers wanted to create very different play styles , " even if it meant cutting some of the possible choices . " The powers were balanced with a unified recharge time since the earlier system where powers could be used sequentially was considered " ridiculous and endgame easy . " 
 Mass Effect 's inventory screen was criticized by video game journalists and players , and designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 was one of the main concerns during development . The idea was to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity . To this end , Norman spent time examining various RPG inventory systems , though none could be applied to support such a large number of characters . The team ultimately decided to implement a unified system where a character could use a weapon without taking it away from someone else . Norman explained that the inventory of Mass Effect 2 is " so simple some people say it 's not an inventory system . " Keeping track of the enemies ' strengths and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players did not have to estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies . The game 's HUD was revised eight times during development . 
 In March 2009 , a new development team of 30 people was set to work at the EA Montreal studio to supplement the teams already working on the game . The new team was composed of a number of people who worked on the original game but the majority was new hires . Mass Effect 2 contains voices from 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25 @,@ 000 lines of dialogue . Voice recording for the game took twice as long as the original Mass Effect . Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development : the 2008 – 2012 global recession limited the game 's budget , and the team had to get through it without impacting their ambitious goals . Additionally , due to the spread of the 2009 H1N1 virus , a significant part of the team was ill during the last months of development , resulting in a loss of a man @-@ year of time . Despite these factors , Hudson described the development of the game as successful " on time , on budget , and exceeding quality goals . " 
 Mass Effect 2 was simultaneously developed with the same level of dedication for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms . According to former BioWare and Electronic Arts vice president Greg Zeschuk , " our philosophy is to lovingly handcraft every version so that players have a different entry point , different interface , different controls that work really well . " BioWare initially denied that a PlayStation 3 version was in the works . Despite this , it was reported that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3 . BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine , the game engine that Mass Effect 2 uses , is a cross @-@ platform , which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code . Eventually , a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game . The PlayStation 3 version uses a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine ; the same engine BioWare was using for the then @-@ upcoming Mass Effect 3 . In this newer version , character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller , even though an option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 layout was also added . 
 = = Music = = 
 The music of Mass Effect 2 was primarily composed by Jack Wall . His previous work with BioWare was as the main composer for Jade Empire and the original Mass Effect . The score also features some pieces by Sam <unk> , David Kates , and Jimmy Hinson , with additional editing and in @-@ game implementation by Brian <unk> . Unlike the original Mass Effect , the composers aimed for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game . The music incorporates both orchestral and classic sci @-@ fi arrangements which were inspired by the soundtrack of the cult classic film Blade Runner and music by German electronic group Tangerine Dream . The harmonic structure of Wendy Carlos 's Tron soundtrack also represented significant influences . To complement each character , the composers gave them their own theme song to convey their personalities and backgrounds . According to Kates , " it was one of our mandates to create a dynamic score that expressed a wide range of emotions . " 
 Music from the game has been released in several albums . BioWare released the main soundtrack album , Mass Effect 2 : Original Videogame Score , on January 19 , 2010 . The soundtrack spans two discs and 27 tracks , covering a duration of 1 : 55 : 43 . Major downloadable content packs for the game , which include Kasumi - Stolen Memory , Overlord , Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival , feature new music . The soundtrack from Kasumi - Stolen Memory and Arrival was composed by Sonic Mayhem duo Sascha Dikiciyan and Cris Velasco , while the music from Overlord and Lair of the Shadow Broker was composed by Christopher Lennertz . Mass Effect 2 's score was nominated for Best Original Music at the 2011 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards and Best Soundtrack Album at the 9th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards .

 Mass Effect 2 was formally unveiled at the Game Developers Conference on March 17 , 2009 , accompanied by a teaser trailer which declared Shepard to be " killed in action " . The announcement also confirmed that the game would be released for both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 . In June 2009 , the game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo . New features were shown off and , for the first time , fans were shown a guided demo . The demo also confirmed that Shepard would be alive and playable in Mass Effect 2 , but the character could die at the end of the game . The game 's release date was announced on October 16 , 2009 .

Players could also redeem codes on specially marked Dr Pepper products for one of three pieces of headgear , and on registered copies of Dragon Age : Origins for a new armor . In the months leading to the game 's release , BioWare launched six class walkthroughs narrated by Norman and released a final cinematic trailer . 
 Mass Effect 2 was initially released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26 , 2010 in North America and January 29 , 2010 in Europe . The game was released in multiple editions : alongside the standard edition , a digital deluxe edition and a collector 's edition were made available for purchase . The collector 's edition featured a different packaging , an artbook , bonus in @-@ game content , behind @-@ the @-@ scenes DVD , and one issue from the Mass Effect : Redemption comic series . Electronic Arts sold @-@ in more than two million copies of the game to worldwide retailers in its first week of release . Despite being released at the end of the month , Mass Effect 2 became the second best @-@ selling game of January 2010 with 572 @,@ 100 units sold , behind Nintendo 's New Super Mario Bros. Wii . 
 At Gamescom 2010 , BioWare announced that a PlayStation 3 version of the game was in development . Microsoft responded to the announcement that , despite losing the game 's exclusivity , the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console to play the game due to the game 's compatibility with the original Mass Effect , which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time . The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18 , 2011 in North America and January 21 , 2011 in Europe . Unlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game , which span two DVDs , the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 fits on one Blu @-@ ray Disc . The downloadable PlayStation Network version accounted for more than 10 % of the game 's overall sales on PlayStation 3 . As of April 2011 , it was reported that both the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 combined have sold more than seven million units worldwide . In 2012 , a compilation featuring the three main games of the series , titled Mass Effect Trilogy , was released for Microsoft Windows , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 . 
 New purchases of the game are provided with a one @-@ time use card granting access code that unlocks the game 's Cerberus Network , an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game . However , users who bought the game used would have to pay for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content . This policy allows publishers to combat the used @-@ game market ; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers , but the publisher does not make a profit . BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11 % of all Mass Effect 2 's downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network . The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community , who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release .

 Shortly after the game 's release , it was reported that the game 's font @-@ size had been formatted in such a way as to make in @-@ game text difficult to read on standard definition televisions . Representatives from BioWare stated that the issue was " a design choice , not a bug " . Mark <unk> , president of the website <unk> , which advocates for making games more accessible to the disabled , observed that " It 's not just the size of the text of Mass Effect 2 that is the problem , it 's the coloring of the text " that is the problem . After investigating the complaints further , BioWare released a statement acknowledging that " on some standard definition TVs the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to read " , and concluded that they were unable to resolve it through a title update . However , they stated that they would take it into consideration for future games . 
 Other issues with regards to crashes , temporary freezes and long load times were found on single core computers , but these were ultimately addressed in a patch . A second patch , which reduced the amount mining time required to acquire upgrades , fixed some saved game loading issues , and addressed other minor bugs , was also released . On PlayStation 3 , a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly . Community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare responded with : " Just to make it clear , we are aware of this issue and are working to understand what is [ occurring ] and how we can fix it . If you are encountering this issue , please provide details about your PS3 and your playthrough . " On February 21 , 2011 , BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs , game freezes and crashes experienced . 
 = = Downloadable content = = 
 Mass Effect 2 supports additional in @-@ game content in the form of downloadable content packs that were released from January 2010 to May 2011 . The downloadable content ranges from single in @-@ game character outfits to entirely new plot @-@ related missions . Major packs include Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival , which are vital to the series ' plot . In Lair of the Shadow Broker , Shepard helps former squad member Liara T 'Soni to find an information dealer known as the Shadow Broker . In Arrival , Shepard investigates evidence of a Reaper invasion , leading to events that bridge to Mass Effect 3 . Other plot @-@ related downloadable content packs include the loyalty missions Zaeed - The Price of Revenge and Kasumi - Stolen Memory , and Overlord , which adds five new missions to the game . 
 Unlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game , the PlayStation 3 version includes the Kasumi - Stolen Memory , Overlord , and Lair of the Shadow Broker packs . Since the first Mass Effect game was originally not released on PlayStation 3 , BioWare also released a new downloadable content , titled Mass Effect : Genesis , which allows players to impact the story of the game with several major plot decisions of the first game . These decisions are made through an interactive comic book which appears at the beginning of the game . Mass Effect : Genesis was eventually released on May 17 , 2011 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 users . The game 's downloadable content was generally well received by critics and some packs were nominated for Best DLC ( downloadable content ) at the Spike Video Game Awards .

 Upon release , Mass Effect 2 received universal critical acclaim from video game publications . At the review aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic , the Xbox 360 version of the game holds an average review score of 95 @.@ 77 % and 96 out of 100 respectively . Substantial praise was given to the game 's diverse characters , interactive storytelling , voice acting and art design . IGN reviewer Erik Brudvig called Mass Effect 2 a very personal game , with a lot of emotion involved . He praised the option of importing a character , stating that the overall experience changes as different saved games from the previous game are used . Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer highlighted positively the weight of social interaction on the outcome of events and that players feel actual pressure for their decisions . Further praise was given to the game 's characters . Edge credited them for their complex personalities and great characterization , while Game Revolution pointed out that the loyalty missions " reach deep enough into their characters to make you empathize with all of them " . 
 The game 's visuals and atmosphere received similar praise . GameSpot reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that Mass Effect 2 is more detailed and darker than its predecessor . He wrote that " deep reds and glowing <unk> saturate certain scenes , making them richer and more sinister ; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission , while rain pours down upon you in another . Subtle , moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact . " Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and cutscenes for being better shot than the first game , stating that " it 's hard to imagine them becoming much better in Mass Effect 3 " . Critics also gave high marks to the game 's extensive cast of voices , in particular Martin Sheen 's performance of the Illusive Man , which was singled out for " steal [ ing ] the show " . Andrew Reiner , writing for Game Informer , opined that the music " flows beautifully " in both the story and action sequences . The IGN reviewer felt that the game 's presentation and direction are " miles ahead of the competition " . 
 Numerous publications declared the gameplay was an improvement over the original . John Davison of GamePro wrote " BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward , and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci @-@ fi epic . " VanOrd praised Mass Effect 2 for possessing an identity , which was something that its predecessor lacked . He noted that the shooting is " more immediate and satisfying , which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter " . Similarly , GameSpy 's Gerald Villoria observed that , while the original Mass Effect " walked the line between RPG and shooter [ ... ] Mass Effect 2 has become a much more focused shooter experience " . Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com credited the combat for being more balanced , stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it . Despite the praise , some publications like GameCritics and RPGamer expressed concerns about the game 's simplified RPG elements , calling it " stripped @-@ down " and with a " dumbed @-@ down feeling " . Some reviewers also criticized the slow planet scanning . Game Revolution felt it was a " chore , mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge " , but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole " does more than enough to live up to its predecessor " . Italian journalist Jaime d <unk> of la Repubblica defined Mass Effect 2 as " dazzling " and " a great sci @-@ fi fresco that would be a shame to miss . " 
 Reception for the PlayStation 3 version was similar . Colin Moriarty of IGN described it as " the best , most complete version of the game available " due to the upgraded game engine and the extra downloadable content packs . In contrast , VanOrd criticized the inclusion of the character Kasumi Goto from the Kasumi - Stolen Memory pack , stating that " she never fits in with her more fully developed cohorts ” . He also remarked that the PlayStation 3 version suffers from technical issues such as frame rate inconsistencies , graphic glitches , and other minor bugs , which are mostly present in the downloadable content sections of the game . Game Informer reviewer Joe Juba reacted negatively to the lack of save importation from the original Mass Effect , which was originally not released on PlayStation 3 , and pointed out that the decisions made in the Mass Effect : Genesis interactive comic book " have practically no context " . Despite the criticism , he stated that the game itself is equally as good on PlayStation 3 as it is on Xbox 360 .

 = = Sequel = = 
 The Mass Effect series was envisioned as a trilogy from its inception , and production on a sequel began shortly before Mass Effect 2 was released . The sequel , entitled Mass Effect 3 , was released for Microsoft Windows , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 on March 6 , 2012 , and for Wii U on November 18 , 2012 . The game begins on Earth with Commander Shepard having been detained following the events in the Arrival downloadable content pack . The story of the game is influenced by decisions the player made in the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 . However , if Shepard dies at the end of Mass Effect 2 , the character cannot be imported into Mass Effect 3 . 
 BioWare stated that the game ends Shepard 's story arc and that future games in the series would feature a different context . Unlike the previous games in the series , Mass Effect 3 also features a multiplayer cooperative mode in addition to the single @-@ player campaign . The game received critical acclaim from video game publications , with an aggregate score of 93 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version at Metacritic . However , there was some controversy over the ending , which fans said did not meet the expectations . 
 = Allard J2X @-@ C = 
 The Allard J2X @-@ C , or the Allard J2X as it is sometimes referred to , was a Group C sports racing car built by Allard in 1992 for use in international sports car racing events . It featured a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ litre Cosworth <unk> V8 engine , capable of producing around 580 hp ( 432 @.@ 5 kW ; 588 @.@ 0 PS ) . The J2X @-@ C had bodywork that is more reminiscent of modern Le Mans Prototypes than a conventional Group C car , but the engine proved too weak for the level of downforce , and this , coupled with the fact that Allard Holdings were liquidated during the car 's development , severely restricted the J2X and prevented it ever reaching its potential . One car was built . 
 = = Development = = 
 In the 1980s , Chris Humberstone , who had a history of designing cars for various Formula One teams , licensed the rights to the Allard name from Alan Allard , the son of the company 's founder , Sidney . After a few years of wrangling , the company hired Hayden <unk> from Brun <unk> to begin developing the J2X @-@ C. He was joined in 1991 by John <unk> , who was hired as the aerodynamicist , and the car was designed to have as little frontal area as possible , giving it a unique look . Although it was originally planned to use a Chevrolet small block @-@ derived V8 engine , the car was instead fitted with a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ litre Cosworth <unk> V8 engine , derived from a Formula One engine , which produced about 580 hp ( 432 @.@ 5 kW ; 588 @.@ 0 PS ) of power and 400 lb · ft ( 542 @.@ 3 N · m ; 55 @.@ 3 kg · m ) of torque . The gearbox was also from an F1 car : a Leyton House @-@ March Engineering 6 @-@ speed sequential manual transmission modified for endurance racing . This transmission would prove to be problematic throughout the car 's lifetime . 
 The J2X @-@ C used double wishbone suspension , with push @-@ rod actuated coil springs over dampers at both ends of the car ; the front suspension was mounted on the carbon @-@ fibre monocoque , whilst the rear suspension was mounted to a carbon @-@ fibre sub @-@ structure that had been designed to allow quick transmission replacement . The car 's radical bodywork generated a high amount of downforce ; it was calculated to give approximately 5 @,@ 500 lb ( 2 @,@ 495 kg ) of downforce at 150 mph ( 241 km / h ) , and 9 @,@ 778 lb ( 4 @,@ 435 kg ) at 200 mph ( 322 km / h ) . However , some of the more conventional cars were able to match this level of downforce ; the works Toyota TS @-@ <unk> had a claimed maximum downforce of over 9 @,@ 500 lb ( 4 @,@ 309 kg ) , for example . It was , however , higher than the works Nissan <unk> , which had a claimed maximum of 6 @,@ 438 lb ( 2 @,@ 920 kg ) at 200 mph ( 322 km / h ) , whilst the 1993 Joest @-@ Porsche 962C had a claimed maximum of 5 @,@ 584 lb ( 2 @,@ 533 kg ) at 200 mph ( 322 km / h ) . 
 = = Racing history = = 
 Terai Engineering attempted to enter the J2X @-@ C at the 500 km of Suzuka in April 1992 , but the car was far from ready , and did not attend . The J2X @-@ C was first tested on 9 July 1992 , with Costas Los selected to drive it at Pembrey Circuit . He said of the car ; " the J2X felt very different to a regular Group C car ... Contrary to most Group C cars I had driven , it was a lot more <unk> than I was accustomed to . " However , he did state that the car 's lack of power @-@ assisted steering was a problem . The team struggled to find a buyer for the car , as the Group C era was drawing to a close by 1992 and 1993 ; the IMSA GTP Championship was on its last legs , and the World Sportscar Championship was beginning to shift away from the category . 
 With the J2X @-@ C far from being completely developed , Allard Holdings were liquidated in the first quarter of 1993 , and the car was sold to <unk> Lamplough for £ 76 @,@ 000 . The car 's lack of straightline speed , due to a combination of undeveloped aerodynamics , the high level of downforce , and the low power of the engine , would restrict the car 's racing career even further . After Lamplough had bought the car , he ran the car in the test session for the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans ; however , he was only able to finish 19th overall , and last in the car 's category , even lapping slower than four of the GT cars . The car was clocked at just 172 mph ( 277 km / h ) down the Mulsanne Straight , and this led to Lamplough opting to not run in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race . Instead , Lamplough debuted the car , with assistance from Bob Pond Racing , at the ninth round of the IMSA GTP Championship , held at Laguna Seca Raceway ; ninth place overall , and last in the GTP category , was the best Lamplough could do with the car . The car never raced again . 
 = = Later history and legacy = = 
 Lamplough held onto the J2X @-@ C for a while , but eventually sold the car , which then passed through the hands of several owners before ending up in Canada . Although even conventional rivals such as the Toyota TS @-@ 010 were able to develop more downforce , the J2X @-@ C was far from the end of its development , and various other companies had considered developing a similar style of car . Most manufacturers considered the radical bodywork just too great a risk , as Spice Engineering 's lead designer , Graham Humphries , stated ; " With limited resources , it was decided instead to follow the more conventional route of further developing what we knew . " However , Le Mans Prototypes of the early 2000s and beyond , such as the Audi R8 , the Lola B01 / 60 and the Lola <unk> / 40 have all been said to use some of the lessons learned in the J2X @-@ C. The J2X @-@ C was , as of 2008 , in running order having been fully restored , and ran in the 2007 Goodwood Festival of Speed , as part of the Group C 25th Anniversary celebration . 
 = M @-@ 97 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 97 is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan . It runs from Detroit to north of Mt . Clemens following Groesbeck Highway . The highway starts south of 7 Mile Road and runs northeasterly through Macomb County suburbs to Hall Road , which takes the place of 20 Mile Road in the Mile Road System . In between the termini , Groesbeck Highway runs through suburban residential and commercial areas . 
 Groesbeck Highway is named after Alex Groesbeck , former Michigan governor and attorney @-@ general . The road was constructed starting in the 1920s to provide traffic relief to Gratiot Avenue , which was the main route between Detroit and Mt . Clemens . It was created as a state trunkline to facilitate construction financing . The final extension was opened at a ribbon cutting ceremony in 1949 . This ceremony also dedicated the entire roadway in the former governor 's honor after sections were named for another politician by the state .

 M @-@ 97 runs through an urbanized area in the larger Metro Detroit . The highway starts at M @-@ 3 / Gratiot Avenue and follows Gunston Street northwesterly . This intersection is one block northeast of the Coleman A. Young International Airport in Detroit . At McNichols Road , which forms part of 6 Mile Road in the Mile Road System , M @-@ 97 turns north on Hoover Street , and follows it north past Bessy Playground at 7 Mile Road . It continues north on Hoover until it turns onto Groesbeck Highway , just one block south of M @-@ 102 / 8 Mile Road . 
 Groesbeck Highway runs northeast from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road . The trunkline here is parallel to railroad tracks through Warren . M @-@ 97 crosses Interstate 696 ( I @-@ 696 ) at an interchange located on the Warren – Roseville line . This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System . M @-@ 97 crosses through the southeast corner of Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township . There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway , which is a limited access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System . Between this intersection and Harrington Street , Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north , crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt . Clemens . M @-@ 97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt . Clemens before re @-@ entering Clinton Township . Groesbeck Highway and M @-@ 97 ends at M @-@ 59 / Hall Road , another limited access county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road . The northern terminus is on the Clinton Township – Macomb Township line northwest of Selfridge Field , an Air National Guard facility on Lake St. Clair . The road continues north as a county road known as North Avenue . 
 = = History = = 
 The Macomb County Road Commission passed Resolution 15 on October 23 , 1925 . This resolution authorized the construction of a new roadway 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of Gratiot Avenue to relieve traffic traveling between Detroit and Mt . Clemens . The roadway was named in honor of Governor Groesbeck , a Macomb County native and former state attorney general . While the county had difficulty funding the new highway , Groesbeck interceded to have it named a state @-@ financed trunkline . The county started construction on Groesbeck Highway in 1926 . The highway was incomplete when Groesbeck left office at the end of 1926 , leaving the final paving undone . State Rep. Archie Reid asked the State Administrative Board on December 12 , 1927 for assistance to complete the roadway . The board voted unanimously to name the highway for Reid and to proceed " at once " to conclude construction . 
 The M @-@ 97 designation was applied to the roadway in 1929 between M @-@ 102 / 8 Mile Road and 14 Mile Road . An extension in 1931 moved the northern terminus to US Highway 25 ( US 25 ) in Mt . Clemens . A second extension in 1932 moved the southern end into the City of Detroit at US 25 / Gratiot Avenue . 
 Named " Reid Highway " by the state and " Groesbeck Highway " by the county , M @-@ 97 was not completed until 1949 . On October 29 , 1949 , the final section bypassing Mt . Clemens along the city 's west side was opened and the entire road was dedicated to Groesbeck . The former governor was on hand for the ribbon cutting ceremony which renamed the highway north of Hoover Avenue . The northern end was extended to M @-@ 59 / Hall Road .

 Named after Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee was one of Portland 's first coffeehouses . The classical music @-@ themed business , located in Portland 's Buckman neighborhood , serves coffee and desserts . It operates from the former living room of a reportedly haunted Craftsman @-@ style house , built in 1902 and " nearly hidden from view " by the surrounding foliage . In 2006 , The Oregonian 's Vivian <unk> suggested that writer Louise Bryant once lived in the house . Bryant and her second husband , John Reed , documented parts of the Russian Revolution in works such as her Six Months in Red Russia . However , evidence analyzed by Michael Munk for publication in Oregon Historical Quarterly and elsewhere lends no support to the idea that Bryant ever lived at 707 Southeast 12th Avenue ( Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee House 's street address ) and casts strong doubt on the idea that she met Reed there . 
 The coffeehouse is owned by Goody Cable , who opened it for business in 1980 . According to Cable , she opened Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee " to stop cleaning [ her ] house for music parties , " having hosted classical music events in her home for years prior . Her vision was an unconventional and " homelike " restaurant , attractive to <unk> who enjoy beer , desserts and music . Cable has established business hours that work for her and prioritizes " conversation , creation , education , game playing and enjoying nature " . She insists on recycling whenever possible and is adamant that the coffeehouse will " never " have a sign to advertise the business . In 2008 , Cable said she thought that locating in Portland was what made the business successful : " I don 't think Rimsky 's would have worked <unk> else ... Certainly not for 28 years . " 
 Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee has a casual , communal atmosphere and has been described by The Oregonian as a " cozy little place with an easygoing feel " . The Jewish Week 's travel writer called the house a " mecca for grungy young artist @-@ types seeking caffeine , chocolate and liberal @-@ minded conversation " . Yahoo ! Travel described the environment as dimly lit , with sounds of stringed instruments . The house 's interior has " bizarre 70 's style " wallpaper and features <unk> , " oddball " art and " odd things " hanging from the ceiling . Weekends feature live classical music . Guests are encouraged to write in blank journals placed throughout the house . Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee is unusual in that it accepts payments in cash only . 
 According to Cable , each table is named after a different composer and has a " pseudo elegant " decor . Some of the tables are " haunted " ( animated ) , at times rotating or vibrating ; one rises 18 inches ( 46 cm ) every 45 minutes , returning to its original position after moving through a succession of different heights . The table named for Sergei Rachmaninoff shakes when a button in the kitchen is pressed , and the Stephen Sondheim table disappears completely through a slit in the wall . <unk> are also available for lounging .

 Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee has received a generally positive reception and is known mostly for its desserts and for offering a unique experience to guests . After noting its status as one of the oldest coffeehouses in Portland , Fodor 's said in a Pacific Northwest guide that it remains " one of the best " , specifically complimenting the desserts . In her travelogues of Portland , Rachel Dresbeck noted the coffeehouse 's uniqueness and recommended the mocha fudge cake and the ice cream desserts known as " Rasputin 's Vice " and " Tsar Sulton Suite " . Similarly , Portland Examiner contributor Dominique Dobson called the coffeehouse " whimsical " and wrote , " this is a great evening <unk> for caffeine and dessert . It can sometimes be a bit crowded , but the mocha fudge cake is phenomenal with coffee , and the quirky clientele and ( sometimes live ) music can keep you lingering over that amazing cheesecake ! " In his 2010 Frommer 's guide titled Portable Portland , Karl Samson noted the coffeehouse 's loyal patrons , calling it " Portland 's favorite dessert hangout for more than 25 years . " Julian Smith wrote in a 2012 Frommer 's guide , Portland Day by Day , that Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee is the " most atmospheric " of the city 's coffee establishments , with " fun and sassy " waiters , desserts " to die for " and bathrooms " you have to see to believe " . Ari Shapiro , a journalist and White House correspondent for NPR who has performed with the band Pink Martini , was raised in Portland and worked at Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee . 
 The Portland Mercury described the coffeehouse as an " eclectic spot " . According to the paper , the reported haunting and surrounding trees and shrubs " make you feel like you 've slipped into a dimension similar but not quite the same as our own " .

A student blogger for the PSU Chronicles recommended Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee as a destination for people under the age of 21 . Willamette Week called the coffeehouse a unique , " nights @-@ only " establishment that " screams ' only in Portland ' " . The publication found the service staff to be friendly , and sometimes slow . In 2005 , Willamette Week readers ranked Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee third in the categories " Best Coffee Shop " and " Best Dessert " . The coffeehouse ranked first in a similar poll conducted in 2007 . Yahoo ! Travel called the coffee " rich " and the ice cream desserts " attractive " . The guide considered the " eclectic haunt " a " spooky alternative " to an evening at a bar , club or movie . Zagat described the coffeehouse as " quirky " and " unlike any other place in Portland " . The restaurant guide also called the decor of the upstairs bathroom " famous " . 
 David Stabler , music critic for The Oregonian , recommended the coffeehouse for post @-@ concert visits and awarded it the title " Best concert @-@ in @-@ a @-@ coffeehouse " . Rimsky @-@ Korsakoffee was a finalist in the " Best Dessert " category of The Village Voice 's " Best of Portland " list for 2011 but lost to Pix <unk> .

For 28 years , from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson 's disease , Jenner engaged in personal evangelism , probably speaking with more than 100 @,@ 000 people in total . One person who became a Christian after encountering Jenner 's question was Noel Stanton , who went on to found the Jesus Army in 1969 . 
 In 1952 , the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth , England , began hearing several testimonies from people who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street , Sydney . The following year , Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and told him about the people he had met who had become Christians as a result of Jenner 's evangelism , and Jenner , then fifty years old , cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people he had talked to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith . 
 Jenner died from colorectal cancer in 1977 . While he was alive , very few people knew of him , but after he died , stories of his evangelistic activities circulated widely , and elements of some of these stories contradicted others . In 2000 , Raymond Wilson published Jenner of George Street : Sydney 's Soul @-@ Winning Sailor in an attempt to tell the story of Jenner 's life accurately . Nonetheless , conflicting accounts of Jenner 's life have continued to propagate , including accounts from Ray Comfort and Ché Ahn in which Jenner is referred to as " Mr. Genor " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Frank Arthur Jenner was born on 2 November 1903 in Southampton , Hampshire , England . His father was a hotel pub owner and former sea captain . Jenner had four brothers . According to his posthumous biographer Raymond Wilson , Jenner was anti @-@ authoritarian as a boy and , at the age of twelve , during World War I , he was sent to work aboard a training ship for misbehaving boys . When he was fourteen , the ship sailed from Southampton to Cape Town , South Africa . On the way , while the ship was docked at a port in West Africa , a tsetse fly bit Jenner and infected him with Trypanosoma ; he therefore contracted African trypanosomiasis , which is also called " sleeping sickness " . He subsequently entered a 15 @-@ day coma , but eventually recovered . From this point on , he suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness and was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy , which prevented him from ever being able to drive a car . When the war ended , he returned to England . 
 = = Navy career = = 
 After some time , Jenner joined the Royal Navy , but deserted in New York City , United States . He soon joined the United States Navy . Jenner 's daughter stated in an interview after his death that he learned how to gamble during this time and he soon developed the impulse control disorder of problem gambling . He became particularly attached to the game craps , which was popular in the United States at the time . He started to keep a rabbit 's foot in the left upper pocket of his shirt , and would rub it with his left hand while he rolled the dice with his right . His shipmates therefore began calling him " Bones " , a nickname that he retained for the rest of his navy career . 
 When he was 24 , his work with the United States Navy involved going to Australia and he deserted again , this time in Melbourne . There , he met Charlie Peters , who invited him to his home to have a meal with his family including Jessie , Peters ' 23 @-@ year @-@ old daughter . Jessie and Jenner married a year later , on 6 July 1929 , at HMAS Cerberus . They continued to live in Melbourne after their wedding and Jenner joined the Royal Australian Navy . He soon became one of the sailors assigned to travel to England to retrieve HMAS Canberra . He was serving on HMAS Australia in 1937 when he was legally discharged from the navy , buying his way out but not receiving a pension . 
 In 1939 , with the onset of World War II , Jenner was recalled to active duty . Because of his narcolepsy , he was given shore duties in Sydney . In this capacity , he participated in undercover operations and delivered sealed orders . After the war , he left the navy and became a janitor for IBM , a technology and consulting corporation . 
 = = Conversion to Christianity = = 
 In 1937 , Jenner encountered a group of men from the Glanton Open Brethren standing in front of the National Australia Bank on Collins Street . One of the men was engaging in open @-@ air preaching . Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man 's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first . The man agreed , so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement . One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel . Jenner converted to Christianity and , when he went home , told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation . According to Wilson 's biography of Jenner , Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane . They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family . For both of these reasons , Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm , taking Ann with her . She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity . On several occasions , he aggressively told Jessie 's brothers that they needed to become Christians , which angered them . On one of these occasions , their conversation became physical and they began punching each other . The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him . He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too , but he received no reply . 
 Later in 1937 , Jessie became seriously infected with boils and , while under the care of a Glanton Brethren family , became a Christian . Before the end of the year , Jenner and Jessie began living together again . Although Jenner gave up gambling , he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired . In 1939 , Jessie developed a peptic ulcer . At the time , it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress , and Jessie 's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family 's lack of money . Consequently , she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner 's aunt Emily McKenzie , who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home . Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty , Tamil Nadu , until she was ten years old . Once Jessie had recovered from her illness , they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay . 
 Jenner would normally wake up to pray at 5 am each day . In the 1940s , Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the Open Brethren . For the rest of his life , Jenner attended Open Brethren churches : one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley , New South Wales . At these churches , people did not understand what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God . The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches ; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators , Campaigners for Christ , Baptists , Anglicans , and Methodists . 
 = = Evangelism = = 
 Out of gratitude to God for giving him salvation , Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism , and aimed to talk with ten different people every day thenceforward . For 28 years , from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson 's disease , Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism . He probably spoke with more than 100 @,@ 000 people in total , hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity . He kept religious tracts in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit 's foot , and he often gave these tracts to people he met . He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4 : 13 on it in order to give himself courage in evangelising . This verse reads , " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me . " [ <unk> : 13 ] While engaging in these activities , Jenner would normally wear a white shirt , black shoes , and trousers , and sometimes a navy greatcoat . Usually evangelising on George Street , Sydney , Jenner asked many people the same question : " If you died within 24 hours , where would you be in eternity ? Heaven or hell ? " If they were willing to engage in conversation with him , he would invite them either to his home or to a local church . The question became known as " the Frank Jenner question " . Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II . On Saturday nights during the war , Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon . 
 One of the people to whom Jenner posed his question was Noel Stanton , a man from Bedfordshire , England , who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time . Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and , the next year , became a committed Christian . Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton , England , in 1969 . In 1945 , Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs , who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra , and , having asked Jeffs his question , Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian . Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house , where Jeffs met several other visitors , including the woman who would later become his wife . In 1952 , another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden , a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force . After having a brief conversation with Jenner , Boyden accepted Jenner 's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall , where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward , which he did for at least fifty years . Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians , but Jenner did not realise that any of the people he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953 , when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people . 
 When Dave <unk> , another Sydney evangelist , attempted to imitate Jenner 's method of evangelism , he was punched in the midriff by the first person he spoke to , so he decided that Jenner 's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate . In 1947 , Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers , who responded that he was a Christian and going to heaven . Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home , where Carruthers met Jenner 's daughter , Ann . Carruthers and Ann married three years later . 
 = = Discovery by Francis Dixon = = 
 The Reverend Francis Willmore Dixon was the head pastor of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth , England , and his youth pastor , Peter Culver , had become a Christian as a result of meeting Jenner on George Street on 2 September 1945 . In 1952 , at an All Nations Bible College event , Dixon and Culver heard Noel Stanton 's Christian testimony , which included the episode in which Stanton had met Jenner . Dixon then realised that Culver and Stanton must have become Christians as a result of the same man . The following year , Dixon heard two different British sailors who did not know each other tell their testimonies at Lansdowne Baptist Church , and both had told very similar stories to Culver and Stanton ; both had been walking down George Street and had been asked Jenner 's question . 
 Dixon then travelled to Australia with his wife to engage in itinerant preaching there . Dixon hoped to find Jenner there , although Dixon did not yet know the name of the man he was looking for . In Adelaide , Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching . Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner 's question on George Street . At a Methodist church in Perth , Dixon told Culver 's , Stanton 's , and Wilkes ' stories again , and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner . Finally arriving in Sydney , Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street whether or not they were headed for heaven or hell . Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner . Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner 's evangelism . Jenner , now fifty years old , had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism , and he cried upon hearing that there were several . 
 After returning from Australia , Dixon went on to discover more people who had become Christians because of Jenner in Bournemouth , Cumbria , India , and Jamaica . By 1979 , Dixon had discovered ten people who had become Christians as a result of Jenner 's evangelism . It is because of Dixon that the story of Jenner 's evangelism began to be told . Dixon 's wife Nancy wrote an account of Jenner 's evangelism , which she called " The Jenner Story " . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In later years , Jenner developed Parkinson 's disease and therefore retired from IBM . With money that Jessie had inherited , the couple moved to Bexley in 1953 , where they began attending Bexley Gospel Hall . Towards the end of his life , Jenner developed dementia and his narcolepsy worsened . For six months , he was confined to a bed and was treated with amphetamine . He was then diagnosed with colorectal cancer and spent a subsequent ten days at Calvary Hospital , Kogarah , New South Wales , where he died at 11 : 45 pm on 8 May 1977 at the age of 73 . Because he had befriended so many police officers towards the end of his life , his body was given a police escort to the burial , which took place at Woronora Lawn Cemetery . His wife died two years later . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 While Jenner was alive , very few people knew of him , and the effects of his evangelism were largely unrecognised . After his death , however , stories about his evangelism circulated widely . Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition , and elements of some stories contradicted others . Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair ; this description is contradicted by interviews with family members . 
 In 2000 , Raymond Wilson published a book called Jenner of George Street : Sydney 's Soul @-@ Winning Sailor in an attempt to tell the story of Jenner 's life accurately . Jenner 's family had been finding it painful to have alternate accounts of Jenner 's life circulating around the world , so they gave Wilson all the information he desired . Wilson wrote that Jenner was " eccentric ... the very antithesis of the ' wise ' , ' mighty ' , and ' noble ' , " but that his life was therefore a good demonstration of 2 Corinthians 12 : 9 , which states that God 's " power is made perfect in weakness . " [ <unk> : 9 ] Wilson wrote that Jenner 's question of " heaven or hell " was very similar to that of Arthur Stace , another Australian street evangelist who wrote the word " Eternity " on the sidewalks so people would consider where they would be in eternity . Wilson called Jenner a <unk> and did not recommend that his readers emulate Jenner 's evangelistic activities " unless Divinely fitted in a similar way . " Wilson wrote that he " travelled and corresponded widely to ascertain the facts of the story " and that he personally verified the accuracy of the information by retrieving first @-@ hand accounts from all of the major figures in Jenner 's life . The people Wilson interviewed included Nancy Dixon ; Ann and Angus Carruthers , Jenner 's daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law ; Murray Wilkes ; Ian Boyden ; Tas McCarthy ; Peter Culver ; Noel Stanton ; and Mary <unk> . 
 Nonetheless , conflicting accounts of Jenner 's life continued to propagate at least as late as 2006 . In some accounts of Jenner 's evangelism , Jenner is referred to as " Mr. Genor " . One such account was recorded by Ray Comfort on the Living Waters website and then repeated in the 2006 book Spirit @-@ led Evangelism : Reaching the Lost through Love and Power by Ché Ahn . Ahn is one of the storytellers who refers to Jenner as a " little white @-@ haired man " , and Ahn concludes his story by writing that Jenner died two weeks after encountering Dixon , who is not named . These details contradict the information provided by Wilson , who writes in his biography that Jenner died more than twenty years after Dixon told him about the people who had become Christians as a result of his evangelism . 
 In 2013 , Gary Wilkinson produced and directed The Frank Jenner Question , a documentary film featuring interviews with Jenner 's daughter and people who had become Christians because of Jenner 's evangelism . Claire Goodwin encouraged people to emulate Jenner by including an account of his evangelism in her 2013 book Compelled to Tell : A Fascinating Journey from a New York Dead @-@ End Street to a Lifetime of Ministry and Soul @-@ Winning . 
 = Fabian Cancellara = 
 Fabian Cancellara ( born 18 March 1981 ) , nicknamed " Spartacus " , is a Swiss professional road bicycle racer for UCI ProTeam Trek – Segafredo . He was born in Wohlen bei Bern , Switzerland . Cancellara began road cycling after falling in love with an old bike at the age of thirteen . After that , he began to take the sport more seriously and won two consecutive World Junior Time Trial Championships in 1998 and 1999 . At age nineteen he turned professional and signed with the Mapei – Quick @-@ Step team , where he rode as a stagiaire . He is known for being a quality time trialist , a classics specialist , and a workhorse for his teammates that have general classification aspirations . 
 After winning a few stages and small races in his starting years , Cancellara earned his first major victory at the 2004 Tour de France where he won the opening prologue time trial and wore race leader yellow jersey for one day . The following season saw fewer victories , but his 2006 season saw a victory in the men 's time trial at the UCI Road World Championships , along with victory at the Paris – Roubaix . Cancellara repeated as world champion in the time trial the next year , along with winning two stages at the Tour de France . 
 During the 2008 calendar he won gold at the Summer Olympics in the individual time trial event and the Milan – San Remo . The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España . In 2010 , he won the Paris – Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders . Cancellara 's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories , while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout . After a lackluster two @-@ year period , Cancellara again won the Tour of Flanders and Paris – Roubaix double in 2013 . In 2014 , Cancellara repeated as winner of the Tour of Flanders . 
 Since turning professional in 2000 , Cancellara has ridden for four professional teams . He has achieved great success in the classics ; he has won Paris – Roubaix three times , the Milan – San Remo once , and the Tour of Flanders three times . Cancellara has won the opening stage of the Tour de France five times and has led the race for 29 days total , which is the most of any rider who has not won the Tour . His success has not been limited to just time trials and classics , as he has won general classification of the Tirreno – Adriatico , Tour de Suisse , and the Tour of Oman . In 2008 , he won gold in the individual time trial and silver in the men 's road race at the Summer Olympics . In addition , Cancellara has been the time trial world champion four times in his career . 
 = = Early life and amateur career = = 
 Fabian Cancellara was born on 18 March 1981 , in Wohlen bei Bern , Switzerland , to Italian parents . He discovered cycling at the age of 13 after falling in love with an old family bike that he had found in the garage and immediately gave up football to concentrate on cycling . In addition , Cancellara excelled at cross @-@ country skiing during his youth . 
 Cancellara 's cycling skills began to blossom at an early age , when he impressed as a time trialist and dominated Swiss junior cycling . Yvan Girard , Swiss national junior team coach from 1997 to 2005 , was quoted saying that Cancellara was " head and shoulders above everyone else " in the time trials . He won the junior World Time Trial Championship in both 1998 and 1999 and at the age of 19 he came in second at the 2000 U @-@ 23 World Time Trial Championship .

 After his second @-@ place finish at the Under @-@ 23 time trial championship , Cancellara turned professional with Mapei – Quick @-@ Step , which was one of the strongest teams in the world at the time . Cancellara rode as a stagiaire for the Mapei – Quick @-@ Step team in late 2000 before joining the team for the 2001 season as a member of the " Young Riders Project " . Cancellara 's first victory as a professional came at the prologue of the Tour of Rhodes , where he also won the overall final general classification . 
 For 2002 the Mapei team split into two formations per UCI regulations , the " Top Team " with 25 riders and the GS @-@ III " Gruppo Giovani " ( youth group ) to develop young talents , which Cancellara joined with other riders including Filippo Pozzato , Michael Rogers and Bernhard Eisel . Giorgio <unk> , the head of Mapei firm , later said in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport that he took Cancellara and Pozzato all the way from the Junior category to Mapei 's top team , in order to let them avoid the Under @-@ 23 category where he suggested that doping was even worse than among professionals . <unk> also said that Cancellara was going to be " The future Miguel Indurain " . During his two seasons with Mapei , Cancellara used his time trialling skills to great effect , winning several individual time trials and a total of eleven victories .

 Following the folding of Mapei – Quick @-@ Step at the end of the 2002 season , Cancellara joined Fassa Bortolo to work as a lead @-@ out man for Alessandro Petacchi in 2003 . Cancellara 's first victory came Tour Méditerranéen ; he helped lead the Fassa Bortolo squad to victory in the race 's final stage , which was a team time trial . On 6 April , Cancellara raced his first ever classic in the Tour of Flanders . He finished in the 73rd place and over ten minutes behind the winner . His next success came in the brief 3 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 1 mi ) prologue at the Tour de Romandie . Cancellara was a consistent finisher throughout the race and because of that , he won the points classification for the Tour de Romandie . Next , he won the stage four individual time trial at the Tour of Belgium by a margin of ten seconds over the second @-@ place finisher . His final victory of the season came in the Tour de Suisse 's prologue , where he beat out Spaniard Oscar <unk> by a little over a second for the win . 
 Cancellara earned his first victory in 2004 at the Tour of Qatar . Cancellara won the race 's fourth stage after attacking in the final kilometers of the race and then out @-@ sprinting the riders who were able to keep pace with him to win the stage . His next victory came in the first stage of the Setmana Catalana de <unk> , where he won the opening stage 's bunch sprint . Up next on the calendar for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders . Cancellara crossed the line in 42nd place , just a little over two minutes after the winner Steffen <unk> . The next weekend , he raced the Paris – Roubaix for the second time . Cancellara showed great form during the race and was a member of the four man group that was first to reach the finish line . He lost the sprint to the line and crossed the line in fourth . Cancellara 's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg , where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second @-@ place finisher . He then went on to win his second Swiss National Time Trial Championship in late June . Cancellara 's next success came at the Tour de France . He won the prologue around the Belgian city of Liege and took the first race leader 's maillot jaune . Cancellara lost the lead after the second stage to Thor Hushovd . Cancellara did participate in both the time trial and road race at the Road World Championships . Cancellara performed well in the time trial and came in eighth place ; he finished over two minutes behind the winner . He entered the men 's road race four days later , but did not finish the course . 
 Cancellara 's first victory of the 2005 season came in the Paris @-@ Nice , where he won the fourth stage after out @-@ sprinting his fellow breakaway member Jaan <unk> for the stage win . Up next for Cancellara was the Setmana @-@ Catalana . There he won the race 's final stage , an individual time trial by seven seconds over American Tom Danielson .

Cancellara then competed in the road race and the time trial at the Road World Championships . Cancellara finished in third place in the time trial event and missed out on a silver second place medal by twelve hundredths of a second . Three days later , he finished the road race in 123rd place and over ten minutes behind the winner . 
 = = = 2006 : First classic win = = = 
 Cancellara 's team , Fassa Bortolo , disbanded after the 2005 cycling season . Cancellara signed a three @-@ year contract with Team CSC during the 2005 Tour de France . Cancellara 's first victory with his new team came in the stage five individual time trial at the Tirreno – Adriatico . He then raced the Milan – San Remo , where he finished with the same time as winner Filippo Pozzato but 24 places behind . A week later , Cancellara lined up to start the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen . He figured into the early breakaway and led the race for a good distance before being caught and ultimately finishing in 37th place . Up next for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders . He finished sixth overall after being in the lead chase group that was in pursuit of the winner Tom Boonen and second @-@ place finisher Leif Hoste . The next weekend , Cancellara rode his final classic of the season in the Paris – Roubaix . Cancellara was in the leading group of riders for most of the stage . When the race reached the Carrefour de l 'Arbre , he powered away from his fellow riders and went on by himself to win the race itself . This was his first ever classic victory . 
 His next victory came in the stage one individual time trial at the Volta a Catalunya . In late June , Cancellara won his third straight Swiss National Time Trial champion title . He was not selected to ride with Team CSC at the Tour de France . Outside of repeating as time trial champion in June , Cancellara had a quiet June and July . Cancellara 's next victories of the season came at the Danmark <unk> . He won the second stage and took the race lead after riding solo to victory . He expanded his lead after winning the stage fifth time trial by eighteen seconds over the second @-@ placed finisher . The next day , he won the race after completing the final stage . In addition to the race 's general classification , he also won the youth classification . Later that month , he rode the Vuelta a España and helped his team with the opening team time trial . After the Vuelta , <unk> competed in the elite men 's time trial and road race at the UCI Road World Championships . On September 21 , Cancellara won the men 's time trial event by over a minute to American David <unk> and became the world champion of the time trial discipline . Three days later , he finished the road race in 31st place . 
 = = = 2007 : Success in summer and autumn = = = 
 The early portion of Cancellara 's 2007 campaign began with no victories to his credit . He started the Tour of California and came closest to a stage win in stage five time trial , where he finished in fourth place . He finished in 119th place in the Milan – San Remo , over six minutes behind the winner Óscar Freire . The next week , Cancellara lined up to race the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen . He missed out on the victory after Belgian rider Tom Boonen edged out Cancellara for the win . Eight days later , Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders and came in 53rd place after his moves were not successful . The last classic Cancellara raced in the 2007 season was the famed Paris – Roubaix , which he finished in 19th place . 
 After the slow start to the season , Cancellara began to achieve success in June . He rode the Tour de Suisse and won the opening time trial , along with the final stage that was also a time trial . With the opening stage victory in the Tour de Suisse , Cancellara led the race for a few stages before losing it to teammate Fränk Schleck after stage four . Cancellara continued his success in the time trial with a victory in the Swiss national time trial . 
 Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de France in London , defeating Andreas <unk> of Astana by thirteen seconds . During stage two , he was caught up in a very large crash which brought down an estimated thirty riders . He crossed the finish line nursing his left hand but appeared to be fine during the yellow jersey presentation . The next day , he won the third stage in Compiègne after he caught and overtook the breakaway group just 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 640 @.@ 4 ft ) from the finish line . Cancellara held the yellow jersey until stage seven , the Tour 's first mountain stage . 
 Cancellara returned to the Road World Championships in September with the aims to defend his time trial crown . He achieved his goal and won the time trial by 52 seconds over second @-@ place finisher László <unk> . Three days later , Cancellara raced the road race , but did not finish the course .

 Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour of California ahead of Olympic track gold medalist Bradley Wiggins in his first race of the season . Two weeks later , he won the second edition of Italian Monte <unk> Eroica ahead of Italian rider Alessandro Ballan . Cancellara then rode the Tirreno – Adriatico where he won stage five time trial to <unk> , which allowed him to take the race lead . Cancellara would go on to win the race by sixteen seconds over the second place rider . Just a few days later in the Milan – San Remo classic monument race , Cancellara broke away from a leading group in the final kilometres to win the race , thus becoming just the second Swiss rider triumphant in this race , after Erich <unk> in 1987 . At Paris – Roubaix , Cancellara finished second after being out @-@ sprinted by the winner Boonen . 
 In preparation for the second half of the season , Cancellara rode the Tour de Luxembourg and the Tour de Suisse . Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de Luxembourg and briefly held the overall lead because of the victory . After finishing the Tour de Luxembourg , he started the Tour de Suisse where he saw great success . Cancellara won the seventh and ninth stages through attacks in the closing kilometers of each stage . In addition to the two stage wins , he also won the points classification . Cancellara joined his team at the Tour de France . Cancellara proved to be a valuable asset to the squad as he helped his teammate Carlos Sastre to overall victory at the Tour . Cancellara was later awarded the stage win in the penultimate stage after the initial winner , Stefan Schumacher , tested positive for EPO . 
 In the Olympic Road Race in Beijing , Cancellara was in a chasing group with around 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) before he attacked and successfully bridged the gap to the leading group when 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) was left to race . The race then came down to a sprint finish that was won by the Samuel Sánchez , with Davide Rebellin coming in second and Cancellara coming in third for a bronze medal . However , later it was found that Rebellin had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( CERA , a third @-@ generation form of erythropoietin ) and his medal was removed by both the UCI and the IOC . Cancellara was subsequently promoted to second place , and the initial fourth @-@ place finisher Alexandr Kolobnev was promoted to third place . The riders did not initially receive new medals for their new placings . On December 18 , 2010 , Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin , in a ceremony held in his hometown of <unk> , Switzerland . Cancellara 's bronze was then given to Kolobnev . Four days after racing the road race , Cancellara raced the time trial event . He won the gold medal by winning the race by over thirty seconds to Swedish rider Gustav Larsson . After finishing with the Olympics , Cancellara decided not to defend his world time trial title in Varese due to mental fatigue . For his success on the road in the 2008 season , Cancellara was named the Swiss Male Athlete of the Year at the Credit Suisse Sports Awards . 
 = = = 2009 : Domination in the time trial = = = 
 Cancellara 's first victory of the 2009 season came in the prologue of the Tour of California . This was his second victory in a row in the prologue at the Tour of California . Cancellara then returned to the Tirreno – Adriatico , but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event .

 In 2010 , former cyclist Davide Cassani claimed in a YouTube video that Fabian Cancellara had used a motorized bike during his victories at the Tour of Flanders and the Paris – Roubaix that year . In the video , Cassani showed a normal road bike on a stand and after he pressed a button , the pedals began to rotate . Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the <unk> of the bike and the button to turn it on would be located on the handlebars . In the YouTube video , Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly " turning on " the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed . The claims caught steam since rumors were already going around about riders possibly using the new motor , the Gruber Assist , which could produce 100 Watts of power to aid the rider . 
 The Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) stated that whilst they are not investigating any specific teams or riders , it would review the need for a new bicycle inspection system to detect such cheating . Then UCI stated that there was no case against Cancellara after the claims gained prominence . Cancellara dismissed Cassani 's claims saying that they were " stupid " and far too risky to do . He even told the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad that he had " never had batteries on [ his ] bike . "

 This was Cancellara 's first year with his new team Leopard Trek , which lacked the high caliber domestiques that Cancellara had in the past , meaning that winning would be tougher for Cancellara . His first major race of the year was the Tirreno – Adriatico , where he won the race 's final stage which was an individual time trial . Cancellara came to the Milan – San Remo with the hopes of winning the race a second time . He positioned himself in an eight @-@ man breakaway that made it all the way to the finish . As the group approached the finish line , Cancellara was bested in the sprint for the line by Australian Matthew Goss and Cancellara crossed the line in second . 
 Cancellara was seen as the favorite or top contender for the next three one day races – the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke , the Tour of Flanders , and the Paris – Roubaix – due to his great performance in the 2010 season and his good form in the early portion of the 2011 season . He lived up to his expectations and won the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke after having several flat tires and a few bike changes , he launched a solo attack with 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) and rode by himself to the finish line for the victory .

He launched an attack with about 60 kilometres ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) left to go in the race and caught up with the leader Sylvain Chavanel ; however , Cancellara cracked after Chavanel did not help with the pacing and the two were picked up by a chasing group on the Muur van Geraardsbergen . With 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) left in the race , Cancellara launched two attacks . His first attack was marked by the whole group , while his second attack could only be matched by Chavanel and Nick Nuyens .

 " Piggies " is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles ( also known as " the White Album " ) . Written by George Harrison as a social commentary , the song serves as an Orwellian satire on greed and consumerism . Among several elements it incorporates from classical music , the track features harpsichord and orchestral strings in the baroque pop style , which are contrasted by Harrison 's acerbic lyrics and the sound of grunting pigs . Although credited to George Martin , the recording was largely produced by Chris Thomas , who also contributed the harpsichord part . 
 In the context of the turbulent political climate of 1968 , " Piggies " was adopted by the counterculture as an anti @-@ establishment theme song . It was also among the tracks on The Beatles that cult leader Charles Manson used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race @-@ related countercultural revolution . Inspired especially by the line " What they need 's a damn good whacking " , Manson 's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate – LaBianca murders in August 1969 . 
 Since its release in November 1968 , " Piggies " has received mixed responses from music critics . While some reviewers admire its musical qualities and recognise sardonic humour in the lyrics , others consider the song to be mean @-@ spirited and lacking in subtlety . Harrison 's demo of the song , recorded at his home in Surrey , was included on the Beatles ' 1996 compilation Anthology 3 . A live version by Harrison , reinstating a verse that was omitted from the studio recording , appears on his 1992 album Live in Japan . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 George Harrison began writing " Piggies " in early 1966 , around the time that the Beatles were recording their album Revolver . He returned to the song two years later , after discovering his manuscript in the attic of his parents ' house in Liverpool . The same visit led to Harrison starting a new composition , " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " , which he would similarly complete for its inclusion on the Beatles ' eponymous double album ( also known as " the White Album " ) . 
 As an anti @-@ establishment song , " Piggies " recalls Harrison 's Revolver composition " Taxman " . In his 1980 autobiography , I , Me , Mine , Harrison describes " Piggies " as a social commentary . He intended it as a light @-@ hearted satire on consumerism and class distinction . Through its theme of social strata within a community of farm animals ( in this case , one consisting entirely of pigs ) , the song references George Orwell 's novel Animal Farm ( 1945 ) . According to Harrison 's 1968 draft of " Piggies " , the lyrics contained a final verse , subsequently cut for the Beatles ' recording , that ends with the animals " Paying piggy thanks – to thee Pig Brother ! " Musicologist Walter Everett cites these words as evidence that Harrison 's main inspiration for the song was Orwell 's work , particularly " his fable of autocracy masquerading as democracy , Animal Farm " . While also identifying Orwell 's book as an influence on the composition , author Ian Inglis views " Piggies " as one of several White Album songs in which the Beatles drew inspiration from their childhood in the 1940s . 
 During Harrison 's Liverpool visit in early 1968 , his mother , Louise , responded to his request for assistance with the lyrics by providing the line " What they need 's a damn good whacking " . Harrison then taped a demo of the song at his house in Esher , Surrey , in late May that year . Following this recording , John Lennon supplied the final phrase in the line " Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon " , replacing the words " to cut their pork chops " , which Harrison had sung on the demo version . When performing " Piggies " in concert during the early 1990s , Harrison reinstated the omitted final verse . 
 = = Composition = = 
 = = = Music = = = 
 " Piggies " features baroque musical elements in its melody and texture . Music journalist Steve Smith groups the song with the Paul McCartney @-@ written " For No One " and " She 's Leaving Home " as examples of the Beatles ' forays into baroque pop . Harrison biographer Simon Leng recognises the composition as essentially a folk song , however , that was then given a " satirical , drawing @-@ room [ musical ] arrangement " on the official recording through the prominence of harpsichord and orchestral strings .
