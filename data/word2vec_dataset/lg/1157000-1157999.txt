 The God Thing remains known to Star Trek fans because of comparisons to other works , in particular the film Star Trek V : The Final Frontier . Roddenberry opposed the plot of The Final Frontier , not wanting the film to be part of the overall canon for the franchise . Roddenberry 's themes of interaction with religion and God have appeared elsewhere in the franchise . 
 Edward Gross described Roddenberry 's rejection of The Final Frontier as " ironic " because of the similarity between that film and The God Thing . In his book , Jewish Themes in Star Trek , Rabbi <unk> Gershom compared the two plots , saying they were different in their approaches . He said Roddenberry wanted to disprove God 's existence in The God Thing , whereas William Shatner , who directed The Final Frontier , sought to take God seriously . This was partly due to the novelization of The Final Frontier , in which the original version of the scene was to show all manner of religious expression on the final showdown with the God @-@ like figure in Sha @-@ Ka @-@ Ree . However this scene was simplified for the film .

 Neila Sathyalingam ( Tamil : <unk> <unk> ் <unk> ் <unk> ் ) ( born 1938 ) is a Singaporean classical Indian dancer , choreographer and instructor of Sri Lankan Tamil origin . An alumna of Kalakshetra in Madras ( now Chennai ) under the tutelage of Srimathi Rukmini Devi Arundale , she emigrated with her family to Singapore in 1974 . In 1977 she and her husband founded the performance arts company Apsaras Arts , which has staged performances throughout the world . She is the company 's artistic director and continues to teach dance . In 1983 , Neila was appointed the dance instructor and choreographer for the Indian Dance Group of the People 's Association ( PA ) , and remains its resident choreographer . She is also an artistic adviser to the National Arts Council . For her contributions to dance , Neila was awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1989 . She became a Singapore citizen in 1994 . 
 Neila 's interactions with choreographers and dancers of different cultural backgrounds and traditions in Singapore have inspired her to create new Indian dance steps based on classical foundations ; for instance , her dance @-@ drama Kannagi , staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998 , was said to have stretched tradition to its limits and offered something to a range of audiences far wider than a traditional dance @-@ drama would have done . Up to 2007 , Neila had choreographed dance segments for the last 13 <unk> Parades , street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities . 
 = = Biography = = 
 The second of four daughters of a well @-@ to @-@ do dental surgeon and a housewife , Srimathi Neila Sathyalingam was born Neila <unk> in 1938 in Colombo , Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) . She began dancing at the age of five , and trained in the classical Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam , Kathak , Kathakali and Manipuri at the Shanti Kumar School of Dance and the <unk> School of Dance in Colombo . In 1954 , she won the gold medal at the All @-@ Ceylon Dance Festival and was selected to perform for Elizabeth II when the Queen visited Sri Lanka in April 1954 during her tour of the Commonwealth after acceding to the throne . Neila has said : " That was the day I decided I was going to devote my life to dance . My father wanted me to become a dental surgeon , but I refused " . At 18 , she enrolled in Kalakshetra , a cultural academy located in Madras ( now Chennai ) which was established to preserve traditional values in Indian art and reputed to be one of the best dance institutions in India , under the tutelage of Srimathi Rukmini Devi Arundale ( 1904 – 1986 ) . She lived a regimented lifestyle , living in a thatched house with " snakes above and rats running below " and waking at 4 : 30am for dance practice every day . She completed her five @-@ year course in two years , graduating with a first @-@ class honours diploma in Bharatanatyam in 1957 . 
 Neila met her husband , Sathyalingam <unk> , at Kalakshetra . The son of a Sri Lankan politician , C. <unk> , he had graduated from the University of Madras with a <unk> <unk> ( Degree in Music ) and from Kalakshetra in 1955 with a Diploma in Music , and was then teaching Indian classical music theory and the playing of the Indian drum and cymbals at the academy . After a two @-@ year courtship , they married in 1956 and moved back to Sri Lanka where they lived in a 40 @-@ ha farm just outside Colombo . Sathyalingam then taught dance in schools while raising her children , the first of whom was born in 1957 . 
 In May 1958 , riots broke out in Sri Lanka between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities . Although the <unk> received a tip @-@ off that they had been targeted and managed to escape the violence , 80 Sinhalese rioters attacked and burned their home . Having lost their abode and all their possessions , they resettled in Colombo . In 1969 Neila returned to Kalakshetra to be trained as an instructor and to take up a postgraduate diploma course . She graduated in 1972 with a distinction and was appointed a dance teacher with Kalakshetra . 
 In 1974 the family moved to Singapore after American company Uniroyal Chemicals , for which Sathyalingam worked as an area sales manager , posted him there . Coming to Singapore exposed Neila to dancers of different cultural backgrounds and traditions , inspiring her to create new Indian dance steps based on classical foundations . In 1977 , Neila and her husband founded performing arts company Apsaras Arts under the auspices of the Kamala Club , an organisation for Indian ladies promoting Indian dance and music . Starting with 20 students , the company expanded in size and significance , and has staged numerous <unk> ( dance débuts ) and performances in Singapore and abroad , including Australia , Indonesia and Vietnam . Apsaras Arts , now based at the Telok Ayer Performing Arts Centre , has also taken part in numerous arts and dance festivals worldwide , including the Asean Festival in Malaysia ( 1983 ) ; the Australian Youth Musical Festival ( August 1983 ) ; the Hong Kong Arts Festival ( 1990 ) ; the World of Music , Arts and Dance ( <unk> ) Festival in Singapore ( 2002 ) ; the 17th National Cultural Festival in Nong Khai , Thailand ( 2003 ) ; and the Indian Festival of Arts in Singapore ( 2003 ) . Neila and her husband are respectively the company 's artistic director and music director , and continue to teach classical Indian dance and music . 
 In 1983 , Neila was appointed the dance instructor and choreographer for the Indian Dance Group of the People 's Association ( PA ) where , for a modest sum , she taught Indian dance to children from lower @-@ income families for free . She continues to be the resident choreographer for the Indian Dance Group , which is now under the umbrella of PA Talents . She is also an artistic adviser to the National Arts Council . 
 Neila was awarded the Cultural Medallion for her contributions to dance in 1989 . She became a Singapore citizen in 1994 , her husband and children following suit in subsequent years . Also in 1994 , she was honoured by Bharat <unk> , a music and dance school in Chennai , with the Viswa Kala Bharathi , an award given to non @-@ resident Indian artistes who have helped to propagate Indian arts in foreign lands , for her artistic contributions throughout the world . 
 Together with fellow Cultural Medallion holders Som Said and Yang <unk> Lian , Neila was a choreographer for the Lion City Angels , a multiracial children 's dance troupe formed in 1988 . The group performed in the Children 's Folklore Festival in France in 1995 and the International Children 's Folklore Festival in Spain in 1996 . Other major achievements of Neila 's include the dance @-@ drama Kannagi , staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998 , and the " Fire " segment of the performance The Rhythm of Life staged by the People 's Association Cultural Troupe in November 2001 ; the former was said to have " stretched the bounds of traditions to its limits and succeeded in offering something to a range of audiences far wider than what a traditional dance @-@ drama would have done " . Up to 2007 , Neila had also choreographed dance segments for the last 13 <unk> Parades , which are street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities . 
 On 14 and 15 September 2007 , Neila staged at the Victoria Theatre what has been termed her " last mega @-@ production " , an Indian epic dance drama called <unk> written by Kalki Krishnamurthy ( 1899 – 1954 ) , which involved 65 dancers from Apsaras Arts and from India . Thereafter , she has said that she intends to " slow down " by focusing on her teaching , although she has remarked : " There is really no such thing called a swan song , and I won 't like to keep still after being so active . ... I will keep dancing as long as my body will say yes to me " .

 Neila and her husband Sathyalingam have three daughters and two sons . Of her daughters , her eldest , Mohana ( born 1957 ) , sings for Apsaras Arts ' performances ; while Nandana ( born 1960 ) , runs an Indian performing arts school also called Apsaras Arts in Canberra , Australia . Her older son Shaan ( born 1962 ) is a legal adviser for the National Library Board of Singapore . Her younger son Skanda ( born 1963 ) contracted encephalitis at six months and became severely mentally and physically disabled . Skanda 's condition is a source of sadness for Neila , who has said , " People ask me how is it that I 'm so strong . But I don 't know whether I 'm strong . This strength is just a facade . If I talk [ about my son ] ... I 'm going to cry . My son has made me a better person , more patient and more compassionate towards people . I suppose good has come from the sad . " Neila 's younger sister , Anusha , who lives in Zambia , is also a Bharatanatyam dancer and teacher . 
 Neila enjoys cooking , sewing and keeping her home tidy , while her husband is an avid gardener . 
 = Oregon wine = 
 The state of Oregon in the United States has established an international reputation for its production of wine . Oregon has several different growing regions within the state 's borders that are well @-@ suited to the cultivation of grapes ; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho . Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s , with commercial production beginning in the 1960s . 
 American Viticultural Areas entirely within the state include the Willamette Valley , Southern Oregon , Umpqua Valley , and Rogue Valley AVAs . Parts of the Columbia Gorge , Walla Walla Valley , and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon . Pinot noir and Pinot gris are the top two grapes grown , with over 16 @,@ 000 tons ( 14 @,@ 515 metric tons ) harvested in 2005 . As of 2005 , Oregon wine makers produced over 1 @.@ 5 million cases combined . 
 With 679 wineries in Oregon , a tourism industry has developed around wine tasting . Much of the tourism focuses on the wineries and tasting rooms in and around the Yamhill Valley southwest of Portland . In 2004 , enotourism contributed an estimated USD $ 92 million to the state economy , excluding winery and tasting room sales . 
 = = History = = 
 Wine has been produced in Oregon since the Oregon Territory was settled in the 1840s ; however , winemaking has only been a significant industry in the state since the 1960s . Grapes were first planted in the Oregon Territory in 1847 . Valley View , the first recorded winery , was established by Peter Britt in the late 1850s in Jacksonville . Throughout the 19th century , there was experimentation with various varietals by immigrants to the state . In 1904 , an Oregon winemaker won a prize at the St. Louis World 's Fair . Wine production stopped in the United States during Prohibition . As in other states , the Oregon wine industry lay dormant for thirty years after Prohibition was repealed . 
 The Oregon wine industry started to rebuild in the 1960s , when California winemakers opened several vineyards in the state . By 1970 , there were five commercial wineries , with 35 recorded acres ( 14 ha ) . 
 This included the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley , a region long thought too cold to be suitable for viticulture . In the 1970s , more out @-@ of @-@ state winemakers migrated to the state and started to organize as an industry . The state 's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts , preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards . In 1979 , Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics ; the wine was rated among the top <unk> in the world , thus gaining the region its first international recognition . 
 The accolades continued into the 1980s , and the Oregon wine industry continued to add both wineries and vineyards . The state industry continued to market itself , establishing the first of several AVAs ( American Viticulture Areas ) in the state . The state also grew strong ties with the Burgundy region of France , as Oregon 's governor paid an official visit to Burgundy and a leading French winemaking family bought land in Dundee . 
 In the early 1990s , the wine industry was threatened by a Phylloxera infestation in the state , but winemakers quickly turned to the use of resistant rootstocks to prevent any serious damage . The state legislature enacted several new laws designed to promote winemaking and wine distribution . The state found a newfound focus on " green " winemaking , leading the global wine industry into more environmentally friendly practices . Several new AVAs were established . By 2005 , there were 314 wineries and 519 vineyards in operation in Oregon . By 2009 , the number of wineries in the state has increased to 453 and remains the 3rd largest wine producer in the country 
 = = Varieties of wine = = 
 Like other wines produced in the United States , Oregon wines are marketed as varietals . Oregon law requires that wines produced in the state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made , and for most varietals it must contain at least 90 % of that variety . The exceptions to the 90 % law are the following varietals : Red and White Bordeaux varietals , Red and White Rhône varietals , Sangiovese , Tempranillo , Zinfandel and <unk> . For these wines , they follow the Federal guidelines of 75 % . Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names , except as appellations of origin . Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir , which is produced throughout the state . Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics , and Oregon is regarded as one of the premier Pinot @-@ producing regions in the world . 
 In 2005 , the top five varieties produced in Oregon were : 
 Pinot noir 7 @,@ 974 acres ( 3 @,@ 227 ha ) , 12 @,@ 086 short tons ( 10 @,@ 964 t ) 
 Pinot gris 1 @,@ 184 acres ( 479 ha ) , 4 @,@ 317 short tons ( 3 @,@ 916 t ) 
 Chardonnay 842 acres ( 341 ha ) , 1 @,@ 568 short tons ( 1 @,@ 422 t ) 
 Merlot 550 acres ( 220 ha ) , 675 short tons ( 612 t ) 
 Riesling 524 acres ( 212 ha ) , 1 @,@ 000 short tons ( 907 t ) 
 Other varieties with significant production in Oregon include Cabernet Sauvignon , Gewürztraminer , Müller @-@ Thurgau , Pinot blanc , Sauvignon blanc , Sémillon , and Syrah . V. vinifera based wines produced in smaller quantities include <unk> , Baco noir , Cabernet franc , Chenin blanc , <unk> , <unk> noir , Grenache , Marechal Foch , Malbec , Muscat , Nebbiolo , Petite Syrah , Sangiovese , Tempranillo , <unk> , and Zinfandel . The state also produces sparkling wine , late harvest wine , ice wine , and dessert wine . 
 = = Facts and figures = = 
 As of the 2005 wine growing season , the state of Oregon has 303 bonded wineries , 384 wine brands , and 734 vineyards growing Vitis vinifera , composing a total of 14 @,@ 100 acres ( 57 km2 ) of which 11 @,@ 800 acres ( 48 km2 ) were harvested in 2005 . Out of all US wine growing regions , Oregon ranked third in number of wineries and fourth in production . Nearly 1 @.@ 6 million cases of Oregon wine were sold in 2005 . The retail value of these cases was $ 184 @.@ 7 million , a 24 % increase over the previous vintage . 
 The industry has had a significant economic impact on the state . The industry contributed a total of US $ 1 @.@ 4 billion to the Oregon economy . Of that figure , over US $ 800 million is directly provided by wineries and vineyards via sales , wages , and spending . It is estimated that the industry contributed 8 @,@ 479 wine @-@ related jobs and US $ 203 million in wages . Exports to other states in 2004 were US $ 64 @.@ 1 million . 
 Oregon produces wine on a much smaller scale than the California wine industry . Oregon 's leading producer , King Estate , ships only 175 @,@ 000 cases per year and most produce under 35 @,@ 000 cases . The state features many small wineries that produce less than 5 @,@ 000 cases per year . In contrast , E & J Gallo Winery , the United States ' largest winery , produced 65 million cases of wine in 2002 . The majority of wineries in the state operate their own vineyards , although some purchase grapes on the market . Oregon contains a significant number of independent vineyards . 
 The Oregon wine industry focuses on the higher @-@ priced segments of the wine market . Oregon growers receive a higher average return per ton and a higher average revenue per case than do growers in other wine @-@ producing regions in the United States . Despite producing a much smaller volume of wine , Oregon winery revenues per capita are comparable to those of New York and Washington . 
 = = Major wine @-@ producing regions = = 
 There are , loosely speaking , three main wine producing regions with a major presence in the state of Oregon , as defined by non @-@ overlapping American Viticultural Areas . Two of them — the Willamette Valley AVA and the Southern Oregon AVA — are wholly contained within Oregon ; a third , the Columbia Gorge AVA straddles the Columbia River and includes territory in both Oregon and Washington ; however , this AVA is considered to be an Oregon AVA . Portions of the Walla Walla Valley AVA , an area primarily in Washington ( along with the Columbia Valley AVA , which contains it ) , descend into Oregon in the Milton @-@ Freewater area . The Southern Oregon AVA was recently created as the union of two Southern Oregon winegrowing regions long considered distinct , the Rogue Valley and the Umpqua Valley . Several other smaller AVAs are found within some of these larger regions . The Snake River Valley AVA , which straddles Oregon 's border with Idaho along the Snake River , is the first AVA to include a part of Eastern Oregon . 
 = = = Willamette Valley = = = 
 The Willamette Valley AVA is the wine growing region that encompasses the Willamette Valley . It stretches from the Columbia River in the north to just south of Eugene in the south , where the Willamette Valley ends ; and from the Oregon Coast Range in the West to the Cascade Mountains in the East . At 5 @,@ 200 square miles ( 13 @,@ 500 km2 ) , it is the largest AVA in the state , and contains most of the state 's wineries ; approximately 200 as of 2006 . 
 The climate of Willamette Valley is mild year @-@ round , with cool , wet winters and warm , dry summers ; extreme temperatures are uncommon . Most rainfall occurs outside the growing season and the valley gets relatively little snow . Not all parts of the Valley are suitable for viticulture , and most wineries and vineyards are found west of the Willamette River , with the largest concentration in Yamhill County . 
 The region is best known for its Pinot noir , and also produces large amounts of Pinot gris , Riesling , and Chardonnay . The region also produces Cabernet Sauvignon , Gewürztraminer , Müller @-@ Thurgau , Sémillon , and Zinfandel grapes , but in far smaller quantities . 
 The region is divided into six subordinate AVAs : Chehalem Mountains AVA , Dundee Hills AVA , <unk> @-@ Amity Hills AVA , McMinnville AVA , Ribbon Ridge AVA , and the Yamhill @-@ Carlton District AVA . In addition , many wine connoisseurs further divide the Willamette Valley into northern and southern regions approximately at the latitude of Salem . 
 = = = Southern Oregon = = = 
 The Southern Oregon AVA is an AVA formed as the union of two existing AVAs — the Rogue Valley AVA and the Umpqua Valley AVA . ( A small strip of connecting territory is included in the Southern Oregon AVA to make it a contiguous region ; however , this strip passes through mountains regions not suitable for vineyards . ) This AVA was established in 2004 to allow the two principal regions in Southern Oregon to jointly market themselves . As the Rogue Valley and Umpqua Valley regions produce different grapes and different varietals , they are examined separately . 
 = = = = Umpqua Valley AVA = = = = 
 The Umpqua Valley AVA contains the drainage basin of the Umpqua River , excluding mountainous regions . The Umpqua Valley has a warmer climate than the Willamette Valley , but is cooler than the Rogue Valley to the south . It is the oldest post @-@ prohibition wine region in Oregon . Grapes grown here include Tempranillo , Baco noir , Pinot noir , Pinot gris , Cabernet Sauvignon , Chardonnay , and Riesling , Grüner Veltliner , and a host of lesser known Vitis vinifera . The region includes two sub @-@ AVAs , the Red Hill Douglas County , Oregon AVA , a single vineyard AVA , as well as the Elkton , Oregon AVA , which was established in early 2013 . 
 = = = = Rogue Valley AVA = = = = 
 The Rogue Valley AVA includes the drainage basin of the Rogue River and several tributaries , including the Illinois River , the Applegate River , and Bear Creek . Most wineries in the region are found along one of these three tributaries , rather than along the Rogue River itself . The region is 70 miles ( 110 km ) wide by 60 miles ( 100 km ) long ( although much of the land within the AVA is not suitable for grape cultivation ) ; there are currently 32 wineries with only 1 @,@ 100 acres ( 4 km2 ) planted . The three valleys differ greatly in terroir , with the easternmost Bear Creek valley being warmest and driest , and the westernmost Illinois River valley being coolest and wettest . Each river valley has a unique climate and grows different varieties of grapes . Overall , however , this region is the warmest and driest of Oregon 's wine @-@ growing regions . The region has one sub @-@ AVA , the Applegate Valley AVA . 
 = = = Columbia Gorge = = = 
 The Columbia Gorge AVA is found in the Columbia Gorge . This region straddles the Columbia River , and thus lies in both Oregon and Washington ; it is made up of Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon , and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington . The region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams , situated in their rain shadows ; thus , the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley . It also exhibits significant differences in elevation due to gorge geography , and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region 's climate . This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown in the Columbia Gorge . The region has nearly 40 vineyards , growing a wide variety of grapes , including Syrah , Pinot noir , Chardonnay , Gewürztraminer , Zinfandel , Cabernet Sauvignon , Pinot gris , Riesling , and Sangiovese . 
 = = = Walla Walla Valley = = = 
 Portions of northeastern Oregon ( in the vicinity of Milton @-@ Freewater ) are part of the Walla Walla Valley AVA , which was established in 1984 . This appellation , which is part of the Columbia Valley AVA , lies primarily within Washington state . This region has nearly 100 wineries and 1 @,@ 200 acres ( 5 km2 ) planted . Wines grown in the valley include Syrah , Merlot , and Cabernet Sauvignon , as well as Sangiovese and a few exotic varietals including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Cabernet Franc , Nebbiolo and Barbera . 
 A new AVA , The Rocks District of Milton – Freewater , was established in 2015 . 
 = = = Snake River Valley = = = 
 A new viticultural area along the Snake River was established on April 9 , 2007 . Principally located in Idaho , the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon , Baker County and Malheur County . The region 's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon ; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low , creating a shorter growing season . Current production is led by hardy grapes such as Riesling , Gewürztraminer , and Chardonnay . The climate also lends itself extremely well to the production of ice wine . However , the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can also support different types of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot .

 With the continuing improvement in the region 's winemaking reputation , enotourism in Oregon has become a significant industry in its own right . On @-@ site sales are becoming an increasingly important part of the business of Oregon winemaking , and other businesses that cater to wine tourists , such as lodging , fine restaurants , art <unk> , have been appearing in places like Dundee , many of which have long been rural farming communities . Wine festivals and tastings are commonplace . It is estimated that enotourism contributed USD $ 92 million to the state economy in 2004 , excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms . There are approximately 1 @.@ 48 million visits to Oregon wineries each year , 49 % by Oregonians and 51 % from out of state visitors . Major events drawing significant numbers of tourists to wine country include the International Pinot Noir Celebration and the Oregon Pinot Camp . 
 Facilities for wine tourists in Oregon are considered underdeveloped compared to wine regions in California , especially premium growing regions like the Napa Valley AVA . Only 5 % of overnight leisure trips in the state involve visits to wineries , a much smaller figure than comparable Californian growing regions , which range from 10 % to 25 % . Oregon lacks many accommodations found in wine growing regions in other states such as luxury hotels , resorts , and other attractions suitable for well @-@ heeled tourists . As of August 2006 , a resort hotel is being planned in Dundee , which would be located near notable wineries such as Domaine <unk> Oregon . A local developer and businessman has proposed construction of a 50 @-@ room hotel , spa and restaurant in the Dundee Hills region , but has met with opposition from many notable vintners , including David Lett , who fear that such a development would dramatically alter the landscape of the region . Concern has also been raised by vintners that the proposed site is on prime growing land that should be used for wine production rather than a resort hotel . 
 The increase in winery @-@ related tourism , as well as the presence of a casino in the Willamette Valley , has greatly impacted the region 's transportation infrastructure . Oregon Route 99W , the highway running through the heart of Willamette Valley wine country ( and which is the main street in towns such as Newberg and Dundee ) , is plagued with frequent traffic jams . Plans to construct a freeway bypass around Newberg and Dundee ( avoiding the prime growing areas in the hills ) are in motion , but are highly controversial . Currently , construction of the highway project is unfunded , and the Oregon Department of Transportation has proposed making the new bypass a toll road , highly unusual for Oregon . Tolls have also been proposed on the existing route of OR 99W , in addition to the new bypass . This proposal has proven to be highly controversial , with many local residents opposing the plan , primarily due to potential negative effects on businesses located on 99W and a general aversion to tolling existing roads .

 = Pulaski Skyway = 
 The Pulaski Skyway is a four @-@ lane bridge @-@ causeway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey , carrying a freeway designated U.S. Route 1 / 9 ( US 1 / 9 ) for most of its length . The landmark structure has a total length of 3 @.@ 502 miles ( 5 @.@ 636 km ) . Its longest bridge spans 550 feet ( 168 m ) . Travelling between Newark and Jersey City , the roadway crosses the Passaic and Hackensack rivers and Kearny Point , the peninsula between them . 
 Designed by <unk> Johannesson , the Pulaski Skyway opened in 1932 as the last part of the Route 1 Extension , one of the first controlled @-@ access highways or " super @-@ highways " in the United States , to provide a connection to the Holland Tunnel . One of several major projects built during the reign of Hudson County political boss Frank Hague , its construction was a source of political and labor disputes . The viaduct is listed in the state and federal registers of historic places . 
 Unpredictable traffic congestion and its functionally obsolete design makes the Skyway one of the most unreliable roads in the United States . As of 2014 , the bridges handle about 74 @,@ 000 crossings per day , none by trucks , which have been barred from the road since 1934 . The bridges have been little altered . In 2007 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation ( NJDOT ) began a rehabilitation program , which it estimates will cost more than $ 1 billion . To facilitate the work , it closed the eastbound ( northbound US 1 / 9 ) lanes for traffic on April 12 , 2014 , and expects to reopen them in 2016 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Built as part of the 13 @-@ mile ( 21 km ) long Route 1 Extension , sources differ on the length and terminal points of the skyway . The National Bridge Inventory identifies the Hudson County section as 14 @,@ 906 feet ( 4 @,@ 543 @.@ 5 m ) long and the Essex County section as 3 @,@ 592 feet ( 1 @,@ 094 @.@ 8 m ) . In a historic roadway and bridge study for NJDOT , it was described as 16 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) long . NJDOT has indicated the overall length of the bridge structures to be 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) and identified the Hudson County section as 14 @,@ 900 feet ( 4 @,@ 500 m ) long . Other sources , along with the National Register of Historic Places , The New York Times , and The Star @-@ Ledger , describe it as being 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) long . 
 The four @-@ lane iconic skyway carries the US 1 / 9 concurrency for most its length . While the skyway generally runs east – west between Newark and Jersey City , US 1 and US 9 are generally north – south routes . The west end of the skyway begins as US 1 / 9 roadway ascends and passes over Raymond Boulevard in Newark 's Ironbound neighborhood . At Tonnele Circle , US 1 / 9 exits to grade and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge and the skyway becomes the four @-@ lane Route 139 as it passes over it . While the road continues to the Holland Tunnel , the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at a cut in Bergen Hill , just west of John F. Kennedy Boulevard . In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic , the skyway also passes over the New Jersey Turnpike , with which it has no interchange . Under most of the skyway is other vehicular , rail , maritime , and industrial infrastructure built on <unk> wetlands of the New Jersey Meadowlands . 
 Some maps , including one of Newark ( 1938 ) and one of Elizabeth ( 1967 ) , labeled the US 1 / 9 southern approach starting north of Newark Airport as the Pulaski Skyway . An NJDOT single line diagram ( 2010 ) shows the General Pulaski Skyway starting at mile post 49 @.@ 00 , which is just north of the renamed Newark Liberty International Airport . Google Maps includes the Route 139 eastern approach . 
 There is limited intermediate access to the skyway : two single @-@ lane ramps rise to the inner lanes of the elevated structure , requiring traffic to enter or exit from the left providing access at the Marion Section ( southbound entrance and northbound exit only ) of Jersey City and South Kearny ( northbound entrance and southbound exit only ) . 
 Trucks have been prohibited for the " safety and welfare of the public " since 1934 because of the state 's approval of a local ordinance that was championed by Frank Hague , mayor of Jersey City . They are detoured to use U.S. Route 1 / 9 Truck , along the route of the Lincoln Highway that carried traffic before the skyway 's construction . Pedestrians and cyclists are banned , as the road has no dedicated lanes or sidewalks . The speed limit on the skyway is 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) , but is generally not enforceable as there is nowhere for police to pull over speeders because of the absence of shoulders . 
 In 2011 , the Texas Transportation Institute determined that the Skyway was the sixth @-@ most unreliable road in the United States because of the unpredictability of traffic congestion and therefore travel times . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Except for crossings over Jersey City rail lines and the Hackensack and the Passaic , the main part of the skyway is a steel deck truss cantilever bridge , supported by concrete piers . Each of the two river crossings is a 1 @,@ 250 @-@ foot ( 381 m ) combination of a 550 @-@ foot ( 168 m ) subdivided ( K @-@ shaped ) through Pratt truss between the supports and a 350 @-@ foot ( 107 m ) basic Pratt truss structure connecting each end to the deck truss part of the skyway . Spanning the rivers , they reach a clearance height of 135 feet ( 41 m ) . In Jersey City , three short Pratt through truss spans take the roadway over rail lines , the westernmost passing over the Port Authority Trans @-@ Hudson ( PATH ) rapid transit line and the Conrail Passaic and <unk> Line . The two easternmost Pratt through truss spans are in the vicinity of Marion Junction , one of which passes over the Marion Running Track , to the east of which the skyway is low enough to use simple vertical supports . 
 Design began in 1919 for the Holland Tunnel , the first fixed roadway connection between New Jersey and New York City ; construction began in 1922 , and the tunnel opened in late 1927 . To provide for a continuous highway connection on the New Jersey side , the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill in 1922 authorizing the extension of Route 1 from its end at Elizabeth through Newark and Jersey City to the proposed tunnel . It was conceived as the nation 's first " super @-@ highway " . State highway engineer Hugh L. Sloan appointed old acquaintance Fred Lavis , a consulting engineer who had worked on foreign rail lines and the Panama Canal and written four books on locating and designing rail lines , to design this Route 1 Extension . <unk> Johannesson designed the Skyway portion . 
 Frank Hague , mayor of Jersey City and boss of the state 's political machine , directed the state to avoid the open cuts that were already common where the railroads crossed Bergen Hill , and to include an access ramp in Kearny to spur industrial development . Construction of the highway , which was mostly raised on embankments and passed through Bergen Hill in a cut , began in mid @-@ 1925 . The two major eastern and western sections in Jersey City and Newark — including the viaduct leading to the " covered roadway " ( Route 139 ) and the embankments in eastern Newark — were opened on December 16 , 1928 , about a year after the tunnel opened . Traffic was still required to use the Lincoln Highway to cross the Hackensack and the Passaic on the since replaced drawbridges that frequently stopped traffic to allow ships to pass . 
 Lavis 's design for the final viaduct passageway , which would be raised on concrete piers across the Meadowlands , included two vertical @-@ lift bridges 35 feet ( 11 m ) above the Passaic and Hackensack rivers , sufficient for the majority of ships to pass underneath . He resigned in 1928 , believing his task was complete , but in January 1929 the War Department objected to the continued existence of the Lincoln Highway bridges once the skyway was complete . Since the Route 1 Extension was not intended for local traffic , and replacing the vertical @-@ lift bridges with tunnels would have been expensive , a compromise was worked out by late 1929 to raise the river bridges to 135 feet ( 41 m ) while allowing the Lincoln Highway drawbridges to remain in place . The concrete jacketing of the steel was removed from the plans since it would make the taller fixed bridges heavier . This resulted in more maintenance . 
 Four companies — the American Bridge Company , McClintic @-@ Marshall Company , Phoenix Bridge Company , and Taylor @-@ <unk> Steel Construction Company — were awarded contracts for the so @-@ called " Diagonal Highway " , with construction to start in April 1930 . The two river bridges , McClintic @-@ Marshall 's portion , were completed first , and the $ 21 million road was opened at 8 : 00 a.m. on November 24 , 1932 , after an official ceremony the previous day on the Kearny ramp . Owing to the Great Depression and problems with funding , Governor A. Harry Moore directed the Highway Commission on October 25 , 1932 to make a formal request to the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads to charge tolls on the Diagonal Highway . It was thought that tolls would be illegal because of the use of $ 600 @,@ 000 of federal aid to build the road , but that it might be possible to transfer this funding to other projects . A bill was introduced into the state legislature on May 1 , 1933 , to add tolls to the road ( then known as the " sky way " ) , at a rate of 10 cents for cars and 20 cents for trucks . The legal obstacle to federal aid was resolved by gaining approval to transfer the funds . 
 During planning and construction , and for about half a year after opening , the road had no official name and was known as the Diagonal Highway , Newark – Jersey City Viaduct , or High @-@ Level Viaduct . On May 3 , 1933 , the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Eugene W. <unk> of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after Casimir Pulaski , the Polish military leader who helped train and lead Continental Army troops in the American Revolutionary War . An official ceremony was held on October 11 , 1933 , including the unveiling of signs with an abbreviated designation , Gen. Pulaski Skyway . 
 Surveys taken during 1932 and 1933 proved that the skyway saved time on the new and old routes . Not only was the distance shortened by one @-@ half mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) , but it took at least six minutes less to travel the new route during regular traffic . Trucks gained even more time , saving anywhere from five to eleven minutes . During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends on the old route , the viaduct saved around 25 minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion . In addition , the new route did not have the much longer delays and traffic back @-@ ups that were caused whenever the bridges on the old highway were opened . It was found that the skyway also diverted a good deal of traffic from other routes . 
 = = Labor issues = = 
 Pulaski Skyway construction ended up causing a dispute between Mayor of Jersey City Frank Hague , who ran a statewide political machine , and Theodore M. Brandle , a " labor czar " allied with Hague . Brandle and Hague had become friends through Hague 's efforts to get approval of unions . Brandle helped organize <unk> Company , a construction bond underwriter , which Hague channeled construction projects towards . During the mid @-@ 1920s redevelopment of Journal Square , Brandle 's Labor National Bank , founded in June 1926 , acquired a new 15 @-@ story headquarters , the Labor Bank Building . Essentially Brandle controlled any construction projects in northern New Jersey , and any strikes he might call would be backed by Hague 's police . 
 The relationship between Hague and Brandle started to go bad in late 1931 , during construction of Jersey City Medical Center , an important project to Hague . Leo Brennan , a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle , who was building a backup power station for the hospital , refused to work with Brandle 's card @-@ file system , by which he kept track of union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked . The annoyed Brandle called a strike , but Brennan 's workers refused ; the police shut down the site after a brawl , but Brennan got court approval to continue . To placate Brandle , who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center , Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved . 
 For the construction of the Pulaski Skyway , which began in April 1930 , Hague chose four members of the National Erectors ' Association , an organization of " open shop " ( anti @-@ union ) steel contractors . Performance bonds were paid in cash , bypassing <unk> , and the companies hired Foster 's Industrial and Detective Bureau to guard the site against Brandle 's threat to " unionize this job or else " . Brandle organized picket lines of loyal union men , and the two sides frequently fought in the streets or in the work area . Brandle 's sole victory was a five @-@ day stoppage in July 1931 by 165 non @-@ union workers , who were interested in higher pay and afraid of the ongoing fights , but decided against joining the union . During the LaFollette Civil Liberties Committee hearings , it was discovered that , in order to save about $ 50 @,@ 000 in salary , the American Bridge Company , one of the four contractors , spent almost $ 300 @,@ 000 on keeping its " open shop " . 
 The first casualty of the labor battle was a <unk> , shot and temporarily paralyzed by a perimeter guard on November 14 , 1931 , for throwing stones at workers . Several months later , on February 27 , 1932 , a car carrying six workers to the construction site was surrounded by union men , who began to beat them with iron bars . One of the workers , William T. Harrison , was dead by the next morning ; Hague broke all ties with Brandle and ordered the police to " wage relentless war against the Brandle gang @-@ rioters " . In April 1932 , 21 ironworkers were indicted as suspects in the Harrison murder . The trial was held on December 6 , 1932 , two weeks after the completion of the skyway . Every defendant was found not guilty , since county prosecutor John <unk> was unable to place any of them at the scene of the crime , and witnesses and defendants testified that they had been forced under torture or the threat of prosecution to sign affidavits and confessions . In addition to William T. Harrison 's death , 14 lives were claimed by work @-@ related accidents during construction . 
 Hague refused to allow Brandle and the unions to win , and began to force unions to foreclose through his control of the courts . On the public side , Hague attacked the " labor racketeers " with words , and the local newspapers gladly went along . In 1937 and 1938 , Hague turned Jersey City into a police state to fight the Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) , which was trying to inform workers of their rights under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act . Socialist Norman Thomas was prevented from speaking in Jersey City and Newark by Hague and his friends . This and other similar cases turned the national spotlight on Hague , and he was attacked by the New Yorker and Life in early 1938 . Finally , in 1947 , Governor Alfred E. Driscoll cut off Hague 's judicial power , and the mayor retired . 
 = = Truck and other safety issues = = 
 The slippery concrete surfacing , steep left @-@ side ramps , center breakdown lane , and wide @-@ open alignment built for high speeds all contributed to a high number of crashes . Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City passed an ordinance in November 1933 banning trucks from its section of the skyway , which effectively banned them from the whole road . Enforcement began on January 15 , 1934 , when Jersey City police began arresting truck drivers using the skyway . The New Jersey State Highway Commission approved the ban on January 23 . 
 As a result of controversy caused by the ban , 300 @,@ 000 ballots were distributed on February 6 to motorists on the skyway , asking whether trucks should be banned . Mayor Hague promised to go with the majority , which agreed with the ban . The matter was also taken to court , with one of the convicted truck drivers arguing that the ban was an unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce , and that since the federal government contributed money towards the road , Jersey City lacked the power to ban trucks . On August 14 , Justice Thomas W. Trenchard of the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the ban , stating that " the court is not at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the municipality 's as to the best and most feasible manner of curing traffic evils and traffic congestion where such regulation bears a direct relationship to public safety and is reasonable and not arbitrary . " The Tonnele Circle Viaduct , a new offramp allowing westbound trucks from the Holland Tunnel to bypass Tonnele Circle to southbound US 1 / 9 Truck , which now also leads to Interstate 280 ( I @-@ 280 ) , opened on September 14 , 1938 . The Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike ( I @-@ 78 ) opened in September 1956 , allowing trucks to bypass the old surface road , US 1 / 9 Truck . 
 On May 21 , 1952 , large numbers of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police entering the city on the skyway . Upon pulling over the drivers , they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction . A call to Newark police confirmed the situation . Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City , since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway . Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in , and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway , though only in one direction . 
 When the skyway first opened , it carried five lanes ; the center one was intended as a breakdown lane , but was used as a " suicide lane " for passing slower traffic . By the 1950s , the skyway was seeing over 400 crashes per year ; an aluminum median barrier was added in mid @-@ 1956 , in addition to a new pavement coating designed to make the road less slippery . 
 The skyway was a constraint in the building of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951 . The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway , but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River . Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway ( at a much higher cost ) or under the skyway 's trusses ; the latter option was chosen . As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project , the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full @-@ width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway . Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by four feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) , without shutting it to traffic . 
 = = Rehabilitation = = 
 Since its design does not meet current highway bridge standards , Pulaski Skyway is considered functionally obsolete , In 2007 , it was rated structurally deficient . The 2007 collapse of the I @-@ 35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis raised concerns about the stability of the skyway , one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar design features . Within days of the collapse , NJDOT announced that it would start a previously planned one @-@ year , $ 10 @-@ million project to make critical repairs . The work was the first phase of a planned 10 @-@ year , $ 200 @-@ million interim renovation project , the first significant repairs since 1984 . 
 After work began , it was determined that the repairs needed were more extensive , costly , and time @-@ consuming than expected , and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $ 1 @.@ 2 billion . In 2009 , NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure . In a controversial move in 2011 , Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ( PANYNJ ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region 's Core rail project to highway projects . The agency agreed to pay $ 1 @.@ 8 billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route 139 , replace Wittpenn Bridge , and extend US 1 / 9 Truck , all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey . 
 In January 2013 , NJDOT announced that work on the $ 335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would begin at the end of 2013 . To facilitate the work , the eastbound lanes ( northbound US 1 / 9 ) would close for two years after the Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex . The proposal was opposed by local politicians , who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives . The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options . 
 The roadway remained open through the use of alternate lane closures during the work until April 12 , 2014 , affecting the 74 @,@ 000 daily crossings . The rehabilitation project , with an estimated cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 5 billion , is being done in phases and spread out over ten contracts , the first of which began in 2012 , and the last , for final painting of the steel structure , planned for completion in 2020 . The improvements are expected to extend the life of the bridge until at least <unk> . 
 The skyway was closed for eastbound ( northbound US 1 / 9 ) traffic on April 12 , 2014 , for two years in order to replace the entire bridge deck . The midway access ramps in South Kearny and Jersey City were closed to regular traffic , but would be available to emergency responders . In April 2015 , NJDOT said that unforeseen additional repairs would be made , extending the scheduled April 2016 completion date to sometime later that year and adding $ 14 million in costs . 
 = = = Travel alternatives = = = 
 NJDOT worked with New Jersey Transit ( NJT ) to bolster public transportation , encouraged car and van pooling , worked with local community officials , employers , truckers , local port employees , and the public to alleviate problems and address flexible working hours , and publicized alternate transportation options through television , radio , social media , news media , and its skyway website . 
 To ease congestion , the Turnpike Authority converted a shoulder of the Newark Bay @-@ Hudson County Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike to a traveling lane . Temporary lane control lights on six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of the extension would indicate that extra lane is open during peak hours , at which time the speed limit would be reduced . This set @-@ up would be able to handle 1 @,@ 900 vehicles an hour in addition to the slightly more than 4 @,@ 000 vehicles per hour on the existing lanes during peak periods . To reduce delays , variable message signs would provide motorists with daily traffic alerts and an adaptive traffic signal system would be installed and monitored by the Meadowlands Commission to synchronize traffic lights at 15 intersections along US 1 / 9 Truck and Route 440 in Kearny Point and Jersey City . They are part of a larger " intelligent transportation system " , the Meadowlands Adaptive Signal System , a network of traffic @-@ controlled intersections with vehicle detectors in the Meadowlands . In anticipation of traffic overflow onto local Jersey City streets , off @-@ duty police officers would be hired to direct traffic heading to the Holland Tunnel during rush hours . 
 To promote public transportation , NJT and PATH would offer more frequent peak hour train services to Newark , Hoboken and Jersey City on the Hudson Waterfront , and Manhattan . NJT would add a new bus route for peak hour service between Watchung and Newark Penn Station , along the US 22 corridor , and their bus schedules would accommodate additional passengers on existing routes .

 On June 12 , 2014 , the PANYNJ acknowledged that the Securities and Exchange Commission , New York County District Attorney , and United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey were investigating its diversion of $ 1 @.@ 8 billion to fund the Pulaski Skyway and other New Jersey roadway rehabilitation projects . These inquiries were related to how this funding , which was made at the urging of the Christie administration , was potentially misrepresented in documents related to bond sales . State laws require the PANYNJ to spend money only related to its own facilities , unless it gets approval from lawmakers in New Jersey and New York . The PANYNJ documents state that the Pulaski Skyway was designated as also providing access to the Lincoln Tunnel , even though it is miles from the tunnel and does not connect to it directly . In December 2014 , United Airlines filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration that claims that since 2004 the PANYNJ has diverted more than $ 2 billion from the metro area airports to non @-@ airport uses and that in 2014 alone it spent $ 181 million to repair the Pulaski Skyway and $ 60 million on the Wittpenn Bridge , NJDOT @-@ owned and -operated structures .

 The Pulaski Skyway is the subject of The Last Three Miles , a book written by Steven Hart published in 2007 . The Skyway has been used in radio , film , television , and at least one video game . In the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds , one of the Martian machines straddles the skyway ( a scene replicated in the 2005 film wherein the first machine appears in the shadow of the bridge ) . It was featured in the 1979 film Hair . Alfred Hitchcock 's 1943 film Shadow of a Doubt and the 1999 – 2007 television drama The Sopranos include shots of the bridge in the opening montages . Clutch included the track " Pulaski Skyway " on its 2005 release Robot Hive / Exodus . 
 = Projections ( Star Trek : Voyager ) = 
 " Projections " is the 19th ( 3rd in the second season ) episode of the American science fiction television program Star Trek : Voyager . Originally slated for the first season , the episode originally aired on September 11 , 1995 , and tells the story of Voyager 's holographic doctor having an identity crisis on the holodeck regarding whether he or the world around him is the illusion . 
 Brannon Braga compared " Projections " to the work of René Descartes , and wrote the episode around the premise of <unk> ergo sum , questioning whether the Doctor or the Voyager is the illusion . Beating out LeVar Burton ( Geordi La Forge ) for the guest appearance , Dwight Schultz as Reginald Barclay was praised by the cast and crew , especially for his on @-@ screen chemistry with co @-@ star Robert Picardo . The episode received decidedly mixed reviews , ranging from 50 – 92 % approval with critics commenting on predictability and the underutilization of Schultz and Picardo . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Voyager 's Emergency Medical Holographic Program ( EMH ) , " the Doctor " ( Robert Picardo ) , is activated due to a red alert . Despite the computer 's ( Majel Barrett ) assertion that nobody is aboard , B 'Elanna Torres ( Roxann Dawson ) soon arrives in sickbay . She informs the Doctor that the ship was attacked by Kazon and that all except herself and Captain Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew ) have abandoned ship . After treating her injuries , Torres transfers the Doctor 's program to the bridge using newly installed holographic emitters there . After treating the captain and then assisting Neelix ( Ethan Phillips ) to defeat a stray Kazon in the mess hall , the Doctor discovers he 's bleeding and feeling pain , neither of which are functions of his program . In sickbay , making inquiries with the computer , the Doctor is told that there are no holographic programs matching his own and that he is actually Lewis Zimmerman ( Picardo ) — whom the Doctor recognizes as his programmer . 
 With the computer insisting that the crew of Voyager is only a collection of holographic programs , a new hologram appears in sickbay and claims that he 's Reginald Barclay ( Dwight Schultz ) , Doctor Zimmerman 's assistant at the Jupiter Station <unk> Center . Barclay explains that the Doctor is really Lewis Zimmerman and that the Voyager is actually a simulation in which he 's been stuck and is suffering mental damage due to radiation poisoning . To end the program and rescue Zimmerman , Barclay suggests destroying the ship before he suffers irreparable brain damage . To convince the Doctor that he 's Zimmerman in a simulation , Barclay restarts the Voyager program and the Doctor finds himself reliving the events of " Caretaker " when he was first brought online . 
 Convinced of Barclay 's claims , the Doctor prepares to destroy the ship when Chakotay ( Robert Beltran ) arrives and gives an alternate story : he is the Voyager EMH , but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck . The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out ; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests , it will prematurely end the program and the Doctor will be lost . Even though Barclay introduces Kes ( Jennifer Lien ) as Zimmerman 's wife , the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence . The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck ; Chakotay 's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay .

 " Projections " is one of four first @-@ season episodes that was held over by UPN to get the jump on other networks in the 1995 – 1996 television season . 
 Brannon Braga wrote the story from the initial idea of the Doctor having an identity crisis , " What if the doctor discovers that Voyager is a hologram and he is real ? " From there , Braga questioned the axiom " I think , therefore I am " and what it means to be " real " . Calling it a " creepy , philosophical quandary " , Braga related the story of " Projections " to the work of René Descartes , where " the [ character is ] plagued by an evil demon out to prove he doesn 't exist " ; in this instance , Braga made Barclay ( Schultz ) the demon . The episode was written to keep the viewer guessing as to which reality was true ; Braga would later say that the fun of the episode wasn 't in the story itself , but in the telling of the story , " in considering all the different twists and turns along the way . " 
 The final draft of the episode was submitted on March 30 , 1995 .

 Silent Hill : Shattered Memories ( サイレントヒル <unk> , <unk> Hiru : <unk> Memorīzu ) is a survival horror video game developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami Digital Entertainment for the Wii in December 2009 . It was ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable platforms , and these versions were released in January 2010 . In April 2014 , it appeared on the PlayStation Network in Europe . The game is the seventh installment in the Silent Hill video game series , serving as both a reboot of the franchise and a reimagining of the first installment . 
 Shattered Memories retains the premise of the original game — Harry Mason 's quest to find his missing daughter in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill — but is set in a different fictional universe , has a different plot , and altered characters , alongside new ones . Five endings are available . Gameplay takes place in two parts : a framing , first @-@ person psychotherapy session , and an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder perspective of Harry 's journey through Silent Hill , which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension . Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry 's journey . 
 After designing the Silent Hill prequel ( 2007 ) , which intentionally replicated elements of the first installment , Climax Studios wanted to try a different approach to creating a title in the series . Among the changes made was the removal of combat and the constant presence of monsters , which they thought unnecessary to the storyline . Akira Yamaoka composed the soundtrack of the game , which was the first in the series to prominently feature dynamic music . The game received generally positive reviews , and its graphics , storyline , voice acting , soundtrack , and use of the Wii Remote were praised by reviewers . Some reviewers criticized Shattered Memories ' chase sequences and duration , which they deemed potentially frustrating and short . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Silent Hill : Shattered Memories is a reimagining of the first installment of the series , Silent Hill . It keeps the premise of writer Harry Mason 's quest for his missing daughter after a car crash , although it leads into a different plot . The personalities and roles of characters from the first game have also been changed , and Shattered Memories introduces new characters as well . 
 Silent Hill : Shattered Memories divides its gameplay between two different settings . The first section is set in a psychotherapist 's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill . In the first section , the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann , a therapist who is a non @-@ player character , from a first @-@ person perspective . The player responds to Kaufmann 's questions and completes a psychological test , fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures . The player 's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting , including the available areas , the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered , and the physical appearance of the monsters . Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann 's office periodically throughout the game . 
 In the second setting , the player guides Harry Mason in an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder view as he searches for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill . Harry is equipped with a smartphone and flashlight : he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map , take photographs , and make telephone calls . Moving to certain spots with high interference , represented by a lot of radio noise , or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen , unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues . To view the details of various documents , the player can zoom in on objects . The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views . Throughout his journey , Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms , which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento . In the Wii version , the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone . 
 The game occasionally shifts to an icy alternate dimension called " Nightmare " , where hostile monsters exist . To escape from this dimension , Harry must find a predetermined exit while avoiding the wandering creatures which chase him upon detection . Unlike previous installments in the series , there is no combat element to the gameplay : Harry is weaponless for the entire duration of the game and can only run , hide , slow down the monsters by knocking down objects to block their path , throw off the creatures if they latch onto him , and temporarily ward them off by picking up and using flares found lying on the ground . His running speed and " health " ( the amount of damage that he can endure before dying ) decrease every time the monsters grab him . In contrast to the previous installments of the series , which featured various types of monsters , Shattered Memories features only one type of humanoid monster , whose physical appearance changes in response to the player 's actions inside and outside the Nightmare realm , including their responses to Kaufmann 's psychological tests . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game begins with a psychotherapy session conducted by Dr. Kaufmann , which acts as a frame story for Harry 's quest . Suffering from issues with his memory , Harry travels home to search for his seven @-@ year @-@ old daughter Cheryl , hoping that she is already there . His consciousness moves between the in @-@ game real world and Nightmare — a frozen version of the town in which monsters chase him — and finds that another family lives in his house . Police officer Cybil Bennett arrives and decides to take him to the police station , but they become caught in a blizzard , and Harry eventually leaves his car to continue his search . Eventually , Harry finds his way to the local high school , where he learns from a woman named Michelle Valdez that a Cheryl Mason attended school there previously , but then moved . She offers to drive Harry to Cheryl 's new address , but after briefly stepping away , he returns to find Michelle has been replaced by Dahlia Mason , who claims to be Harry 's lover and acts as if she has been with him the whole time . He accepts the ride , although during another shift to the Nightmare , the car falls into a river . Harry escapes but loses consciousness . 
 He awakens in a wheelchair pushed by Cybil in the town 's hospital . Before Cybil can tell him about his file at the station , the town transitions to the Nightmare . Harry escapes and meets Lisa Garland , a nurse injured in a crash , and escorts her to her home . At her request , Harry gives Lisa pills for her headache , and returns to find her either dead or dying , depending on in @-@ game actions taken by the player . Finding him next to Lisa 's corpse , Cybil attempts to arrest him , but is frozen as the Nightmare emerges around them . Harry escapes to Cheryl 's home , where he finds an older Dahlia who claims to be his wife and tells him that Cheryl is at the lighthouse . Harry enters the Nightmare , escapes it , and eventually gets a ride from Michelle . Harry finds a young Dahlia aboard a boat at a lakeside harbour , who sets the course for the lighthouse and seduces him . Harry wakes , finds Dahlia and the environment covered in ice , and crosses the now @-@ frozen lake but falls into the water and passes out . Harry is dragged ashore near the lighthouse by Cybil , who confronts him with the news that Harry Mason died eighteen years ago in a car accident . As Harry proceeds , he finds " the lighthouse " is the name of Dr. Kaufmann 's counseling clinic : the patient in the therapy session is an adult Cheryl , who is in denial over her father 's death . Harry enters the office and Cheryl either reconciles herself to his death or continues to cling to her fantasy father . 
 At the end of the game , an old video clip from Cheryl 's camcorder is played . Four variations of this clip are available depending upon the player 's actions as Harry . In " Love Lost " , Harry packs his luggage in a car and tells Cheryl not to blame herself for her parents ' separation . In " Drunk Dad " , a drunken Harry yells at Cheryl , demands a beer and blames his drinking on his family . In " Sleaze and Sirens " , Harry flirts on his bed with Lisa and Michelle . In " Wicked and Weak " , Dahlia verbally abuses Harry and slaps him . In the " UFO " joke ending , Cheryl tells Dr. Kaufmann that she believes Harry was kidnapped by aliens and that Silent Hill is a spaceship . After James Sunderland interrupts , the therapy session continues , revealing Cheryl to be a dog and Dr. Kaufmann to be a grey alien . Regardless of the ending , the final scene shows Cheryl packing away mementos that the player can collect throughout the game . An additional scene the player can obtain shows her reconciling with Dahlia outside the clinic . 
 = = Development = = 
 Plans for a Silent Hill remake , and speculation about a possible remake based on the Silent Hill film , were circulating as early as 2006 . The idea of a remake was also considered early in the development of the prequel game Silent Hill : Origins ( 2007 ) . Rumours persisted into 2009 , and were seemingly confirmed in February when the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) re @-@ rated the original game . The game was officially announced in the May 2009 issue of Nintendo Power . 
 Climax Studios , the developer of Silent Hill : Origins , developed Shattered Memories with a development team made up of more than 55 members and a supporting network of more than 90 artists . With the completion of Origins — for which they had attempted to closely replicate the atmosphere and gameplay elements of the first Silent Hill game ( 1999 ) — Climax Studios wanted to create a different horror game . Because of the tenth anniversary of the first Silent Hill installment , Konami thought the time was ideal " to revisit " the game . Climax Studios saw the then @-@ newly introduced Wii platform as a way to reach a wider range of gamers , especially as outside Japan , no Silent Hill title had been exclusively released on a Nintendo platform . Development costs for the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and their gamers ' " mindset " factored into the decision for the gaming platform . Additionally , the developers wanted to use the Wii Remote to incorporate the gameplay elements of the flashlight and radio static . Climax felt that the first game would be a good starting point , instead of continuing any existing storylines or adding onto the mythology of the town . To please fans of the series and bring in new ones , they decided to reimagine the setting and characters , such as Dahlia , who was changed from " a haggard old woman " who led the town 's cult into a physically attractive young woman . 
 Climax Studios began with the game 's plot , which the development team considered the main appeal of the series . Early in the game 's development , some team members visited a psychiatrist for research . The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game , as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill , and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States , where the fictional town is located . Falling snow was added to limit the player 's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread . The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player 's interaction with the game . Writer Sam Barlow explained the system : " ultimately every little thing you do in the game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score . This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research . " The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player 's profile . Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult , according to the game 's producer , Tomm Hulett . Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player . 
 The developers felt that creating another game in the series with the same style of gameplay had limited potential . In an attempt to imbue the game with the feel of a horror film where the protagonist is a regular person and the antagonist is powerful , they avoided the common survival horror gameplay feature of a player character who is skilled in the use of weapons . Instead they generated an unarmed player character ; and examined the survival horror gameplay staple of difficult combat and sluggish opponents , inspired by zombie films and modelled after the video games Alone in the Dark ( 1992 ) and Resident Evil ( 1996 ) . They also analyzed around 50 chase sequences from various films , including horror films , and the structure of slasher films , in which a powerful and intelligent antagonist pursues the protagonists . The developers drew inspiration from common childhood nightmares about running away from an unknown threat , and decided to incorporate an intelligent enemy capable of trailing and outrunning the protagonist . The chase sequences were designed to evoke a brief sense of tension and fright for the player , although the developers did not want to prolong the tension with the constant presence of monsters , and were concerned that this would become overwhelming and spoil the player 's immersion in the game and interest in the story . The constant presence of monsters was also thought to be irrelevant to Shattered Memories ; director Mark Simmons said , " this Harry Mason is not a guy who is constantly under attack from monsters . It 's not a story of surviving a zombie apocalypse . " Additionally , to make information @-@ gathering in the game realistic and corresponding to modern life standards , the developers substituted text in scattered documents , a common element in survival horror games , for the player 's interaction with the in @-@ game environment and use of the cell phone . 
 Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka scored the soundtrack of Shattered Memories . It was his final contribution to the Silent Hill series before he resigned from Konami after 16 years with the company . Voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn provided vocals for four musical pieces included in the game and co @-@ directed Shattered Memories ' voice acting , and musician Joe Romersa wrote lyrics for three of the pieces . The game is the first in the series to make prominent use of dynamic music ; a composition is introduced and subsequently retracted , based on the player 's actions , in every major area of the game . Widely varying compositions , ranging from undertones to rock music , were produced for the game .

 A playable demo of Shattered Memories was made available in June 2009 at the annual trade fair Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 ( E3 ) and received favorable reviews from video game journalists . A group of editors of the IGN website gave the game three " Best of E3 " awards in the Wii category for best overall game , best adventure game , and best video game graphics technology . The game was also given a " Best Wii Game " award by editors of the GameSpot website in an article on their preferred games featured at the E3 show . 
 Shattered Memories was published by Konami for the Wii in North America on December 8 , 2009 ; in Europe on February 26 , 2010 ; and in Japan on March 25 , 2010 . The Australian release was delayed until June 22 , 2010 , due to European supply problems caused by the economic effects of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull . Major Australian retailers struggled to confirm available copies of the game for several months after the delayed release , potentially damaging initial sales of the game . The PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions were published in North America on January 19 , 2010 ; in Europe on February 26 , 2010 ; in Japan on March 25 , 2010 ; and in Australia on April 22 , 2010 . It also became available on the PlayStation Network for Europe and the United Kingdom on April 28 , 2014 . Compatibility with PS Vita was planned but cancelled ; the games are currently only available for the PSP . [ 1 ]

 According to producer Tomm Hulett , the number of pre @-@ ordered copies of Silent Hill : Shattered Memories " looked very good " . In March 2010 , the game placed fifth on the list of the top forty bestselling PS2 videogames in the United Kingdom and eleventh on the corresponding list for Wii games . However , <unk> stated that sales of the game were low . The game eventually broke even with the help of the PS2 port , selling an estimated 440 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Review aggregator website Metacritic displays an averaged score for Silent Hill : Shattered Memories of 79 / 100 , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . Wesley Yin @-@ Poole of VideoGamer.com ranked Shattered Memories in seventh place on his list of " top ten nerve @-@ shredding video games " , and wrote : " Dark , dank and dangerous , Silent Hill grabs you by the scruff of the neck , shakes you till you throw up , then headbutts you right between the eyes . " Gamasutra 's Brandon Sheffield , ranked the game in fifth place on his top ten list of overlooked games of 2009 , and wrote that despite the absence of horror elements , the game was a nice experience . Matt Wales of IGN also included the game in a list of overlooked Wii games , and wrote that the combination of various elements which he regarded as positive delivered " a meticulously @-@ constructed , expertly @-@ paced experience quite unlike anything the series has seen before . " 
 Chris Schilling of The Daily Telegraph described it as " one of the most innovative and enjoyable survival horrors for many a year . " Eurogamer 's Kristan Reed wrote , " Packed with inventive ideas and one engaging sequence after another , it 's a spirited , poignant and unsettling game that not only delivers a long @-@ overdue return to form , but reinvigorates horror adventures in the process . " According to Lark Anderson of GameSpot , " Shattered Memories is a fantastic return to the core concept of personal fear , and though its developers made some unorthodox decisions — such as removing combat entirely — those decisions have paid off handsomely . " Nintendo Power called it audacious and compelling . In a retrospective feature , Nintendo World Report 's Jonathan <unk> generally agreed with Gamespot , stating that the installment " is a noble and arguably successful attempt to revive and reform the survival horror genre . While perhaps not scary , it is genuinely disturbing , shocking , and always interesting . " According to Leigh Alexander of The A.V. Club , the innovation and uniqueness of the installment made it capable of standing alone from the Silent Hill series , without having to use the series ' reputation or name to attract players . Conversely , Game Informer 's Tim Turi considered the frustrating controls and dull pacing to be major flaws , and wrote , " If you ’ re a Silent Hill fan interested in a fresh take on the stale formula , this Wii entry may be the Cheryl you ’ ve been searching for — but it comes at a cost . " 
 The division of gameplay into puzzle @-@ based exploration , weaponless chase sequences , and therapy scenes drew mixed comments from reviewers . About.com 's Charles Herold wrote that the fast @-@ paced action of the nightmare sequences and the therapy scenes undercut the " trapped in a nightmare " feeling of previous Silent Hill games . Matt Casamassina of IGN wrote that " the separation between safe exploration and puzzling and run @-@ for @-@ your @-@ life monster scenarios is too transparent and as a result you will inevitably come to fear the ice and few things else . " PALGN 's Michael <unk> said that the chase sequences severely detracted from the rest of the game . Eurogamer wrote that they created a welcome mix with no gameplay element overemphasized . Reviewers were also divided on whether the chase sequences were potentially frustrating , or quickly grew repetitive . GamesRadar 's Henry Gilbert expressed frustration over the similar enemies and repetitive use of a stock scream . Neon Kelly of VideoGamer.com was concerned by the absence of a possible death of the player character which would result in a " game over " , because he esteemed the fear potentially caused to the player by player character death as a major element of the survival horror genre . The use of the Wii Remote was praised by reviewers as natural @-@ seeming , and well @-@ suited to the movement @-@ based puzzles and scenes . 
 Shattered Memories ' reimagined plot received praise from reviewers , some of whom found it easier to follow than the plot of the first game . Game Informer drew comparisons with film director M. Night Shyamalan 's style . GamesRadar wrote that the storyline and characterizations were mature , its puzzles clear yet challenging and that the atmospheric scares contributed to the game 's appeal . Justin Haywald of 1UP.com said that the text messages about minor characters not introduced in the game detracted from the overall narrative . The game 's duration , considered relatively short by reviewers , was seen as a drawback , although some reviewers said that the psychological elements and multiple endings increased the replay value of the game . The psychological elements were also criticized . About.com wrote that they were far less subtle than those in Silent Hill 2 , and GamePro 's Will Herring said that while the player @-@ profiling element was ambitious , he did not think it went far enough , as it changed only cosmetic details and character dialogue . Reviewers praised the graphics , and called them detailed and well @-@ done . Chris McMahon of Play placed the game tenth on his list of the " ten best @-@ looking PSP games " . GameTrailers praised the variety of objects , many of which can be manipulated by the player , and the detailed textures which lent the game 's environments authenticity . The soundtrack was favorably received , and reviewers described it as moody , atmospheric , and helping to create tension . The voice acting was similarly well @-@ received as believable . Additionally , the soundtrack won an award for its audio design at the <unk> European Games Awards , an event held in Paris , France , at the Paris Game Festival ; the awards were handed out by an eight @-@ person jury and the French Minister of Culture and Communication . 
 Metacritic shows an averaged score of 77 / 100 for the PlayStation 2 port , indicating generally favorable reviews . Casamassina gave the PS2 port a score of 8 @.@ 0 / 10 , and wrote that while the graphics and control system in the Wii version were better , the port held up well . For the PlayStation Portable port , Metacritic displays an averaged score of 73 / 100 , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . Casamassina gave it a score of 7 @.@ 0 , and commented upon the " obvious visual downgrades " , " sluggish controls " , and " the inability to directly control and point his flashlight " . In his review of both ports , Haywald said that the control systems of both ports worked well , and described them as " a technical triumph " . 
 = Chew Valley Lake = 
 Chew Valley Lake ( grid reference <unk> ) is a large reservoir in the Chew Valley , Somerset , England , and the fifth @-@ largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom ( the largest in south @-@ west England ) , with an area of 1 @,@ 200 acres ( 4 @.@ 9 km ² ) . The lake , created in the early 1950s and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 , provides much of the drinking water for the city of Bristol and surrounding area , taking its supply from the Mendip Hills . Some of the water from the lake is used to maintain the flow in the River Chew . 
 Before the lake was created , archaeological investigations were carried out that showed evidence of occupation since Neolithic times and included Roman artefacts . The lake is an important site for wildlife and has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) and a Special Protection Area ( SPA ) . It is a national centre for birdwatching , with over 260 species recorded . The lake has indigenous and migrant water birds throughout the year , and two nature trails have been created . The flora and fauna provide habitats for some less common plants and insects . 
 Some restricted use for recreational activities is permitted by the owner , Bristol Water , including dinghy sailing and fishing , primarily for trout . 
 = = Location = = 
 Chew Valley Lake is in the Chew Valley at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills , surrounded by meadows and woods and close to the villages of Chew Stoke , Chew Magna and Bishop Sutton . When it was built in the 1950s , its 1 @,@ 200 acres ( 4 @.@ 9 km ² ) were flooded with 4 @,@ 500 million imperial gallons ( 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m ³ ) of water from the Mendip hills , with a catchment area of 14 @,@ 000 acres ( 57 km ² ) . It is shallow , with an average depth of 14 ft ( 4 m ) at top level and a maximum depth of just 37 ft ( 11 m ) . It is fed by small rivers , and it flows into the River Chew for 17 miles ( 27 km ) before it joins the Avon to head out to sea . The deepest part is near the dam and the outlet tower , where the steeply sloping shores of Walley Bank and the north shore result in depths of up to 20 ft ( 6 m ) . " Denny Island " , above the surface throughout the year , is wooded and provides a habitat for wildlife . 
 The lake is owned and operated by Bristol Water , which created it in 1956 when the demand became too large for nearby Blagdon Lake . Working with the Avon Wildlife Trust , Somerset Wildlife Trust and other environmental groups , Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants , and created a venue for visitors . 
 It has two landscaped picnic areas . Facilities include a tea shop , with indoor and outdoor seating areas with a view of the lake , and information centre . There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails . The Grebe Trail is a hard @-@ surfaced , all @-@ weather path suitable for pedestrians , <unk> and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) long , starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area . The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook . The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter , but there is a boardwalk over a short section . The trail runs along the east shore , visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge , making a 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ) circuit . Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors , particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed . 
 = = Access and transportation = = 
 Access to the waterside is restricted in places to reduce the disruption to wildlife . Paths around the lake are generally flat and , where paths are surfaced , wheelchair access is possible . 
 Visitors are officially invited to use public transport , but overwhelmingly arrive by private car , encouraged by the provision of parking spaces . The " Chew Valley Explorer " bus route 672 / 674 provides access . 
 In 2002 a 1 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ( 3 @-@ kilometre ) safe cycle route , the Chew Lake West Green Route , was opened along the <unk> on the western part of the lake . It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way , National Cycle Network Route 3 . It has all @-@ weather surfacing , providing a smooth off @-@ road facility for ramblers , mobility @-@ challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities . It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association . Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists . 
 Bristol Airport is approximately 10 miles ( 15 km ) away . The nearest major road is the A368 , which runs along the southern edge of the lake and provides access from Bath and Weston super Mare . The A37 and A38 are slightly further away , providing access from Bristol . Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge , for which a charge is made , and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake ; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits . 
 = = History = = 
 The area the lake covers was once rich farmland . Farms and houses had to be removed before the land was flooded , and old roads , hedgerows and tree stumps can reappear when dry summers cause the level of the lake to drop . Prior to the flooding of the reservoir , archaeological excavations were carried out by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield employed by the Ministry of Works , from 1953 to 1955 . The excavations found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic , Mesolithic and Neolithic ( Old , Middle and New Stone Age ) , Bronze Age and Iron Age , including implements such as stone knives , flint blades and the head of a mace , along with buildings and graves . The artefacts from this period are held at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery . Further evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age occupation is provided by the archaeological survey of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . 
 Excavations have also uncovered Roman remains , indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century to third century AD . The finds included a villa at Chew Park where wooden writing tablets ( the first in the UK ) with ink writing were found . The tablets were sent to the British Museum , but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake 's other historical artefacts . 
 Further excavations around the village of Moreton , which has now been totally submerged , found evidence of a thriving community in medieval times and possibly the remains of the Nunnery of Santa Cruz . During the Middle Ages farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake , supported by four flour mills powered by the River Chew . Stratford Mill was demolished and re @-@ erected in the grounds of Blaise Castle Museum , in north @-@ west Bristol . The largest settlement was Moreton , which is listed in the Domesday Book and survived until the flooding of the lake , when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to Chew Stoke Parish Church . There is evidence of lime kilns , which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches . Farming , both arable and dairy , continued until the flooding of the lake , with most households also keeping pigs . There were orchards for fruit production , including apples , pears and plums . Moreton was also the site of gunpowder mill in the 18th century . 
 = = = Reservoir = = = 
 Plans for the building of the reservoir were under discussion before the Second World War , and an Act of Parliament submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939 . Following this , farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies . Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by compulsory purchase . The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr , who employed 300 people on the site . The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the bedrock . The core of the dam was made of puddled clay mixed with sand . This was the first time the gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified . The lake was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II , accompanied by Prince Philip , with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque , which can be seen from the dam , on 17 April 1956 , although it was not full until 25 February 1958 . Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown , daughter of Kennedy Brown , who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake . 
 During the storm of 10 July 1968 , the lake gained an extra 471 million imperial gallons ( 2 @,@ 140 @,@ 000 m ³ ) and rose 19 inches ( 480 mm ) in under 12 hours . At one point worried Bristol police issued a warning that the dam might not hold , prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including Pensford and Keynsham . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The lake is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) and a Special Protection Area ( SPA ) ( Site Code : <unk> ) largely because of the diversity of species and habitats . Providing further protection , much of the area around the lake also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . 
 The lake appears to have a higher sedimentation rate than would be expected in other similar reservoirs , being in the region of 100 – 150 <unk> − <unk> − 1 . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 The main geological outcrops around the lake are mudstone , largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape . Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area . There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew . 
 = = = Birds = = = 
 Over 260 species of birds have been recorded at Chew , an internationally important site for wintering and migrating wildfowl . From late July to February , up to 4 @,@ 000 ducks ( Anatidae ) of twelve different species may be present , including internationally important numbers of northern shoveler ( Anas clypeata ) and gadwall ( Anas strepera ) . Up to 600 great crested grebes ( Podiceps cristatus ) gather to moult on the lake in autumn . Data on bird species and their numbers on the lake , dating back to the first " ringing " in 1964 , is available from the Chew Valley Ringing Station . 
 Numerous other birds can be seen , especially during the spring and autumn migration . Sand martins ( Riparia riparia ) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the second or third week of March . Flocks of tits ( Paridae ) , swallows ( Hirundinidae ) and terns ( Sternidae ) can regularly be seen . Waders , such as lapwings ( Vanellus vanellus ) , dunlin ( Calidris alpina ) and common snipe ( Gallinago gallinago ) , are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn . By midwinter up to 55 @,@ 000 gulls , mostly black @-@ headed gull ( Chroicocephalus ridibundus ) and common gull ( Larus canus ) , may be roosting . Good numbers of reed warblers ( Acrocephalus <unk> ) and sedge warblers ( A. <unk> ) nest in the fringing reeds , along with grebes ( <unk> ) and Eurasian coots ( Fulica atra ) . 
 Much of the management work carried out in the nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed , and small numbers of tufted duck ( Aythya fuligula ) , common pochard ( Aythya ferina ) , common shelduck ( Tadorna <unk> ) and gadwall raise broods most years . Recent breeding successes also include water rail ( Rallus aquaticus ) and Cetti 's warbler ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 A wetland reserve has been created at Heron 's Green Pool on the opposite side of the causeway to the lake . A shallow pool fringed with sedges ( Cyperaceae ) , rushes ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( Calamagrostis ) and surrounded by lightly grazed , rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings . 
 = = = Fish = = = 
 In late summer large shoals of roach ( <unk> rutilus ) and perch ( Perca fluviatilis ) fry congregate around the margins and weed beds , which are predated by the brown trout ( Salmo trutta <unk> <unk> ) and rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) . Chew Valley also holds a large population of pike ( Esox <unk> ) , and fishing for these is permitted at certain times of the year . 
 = = = Insects = = = 
 Aquatic midges ( Chironomidae ) provide the highest proportion of the fly life of the lake . The trout ( Salmonidae ) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen ( Corixidae ) , and below the surface on the caddisfly ( Trichoptera ) larvae and pupae ; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge . Other aquatic fauna including <unk> and snails are also found in the lake . Large populations of dragonflies , including migrant hawker ( Aeshna mixta ) and significant numbers of ruddy darter ( Sympetrum sanguineum ) , occur at the lake . Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds , including the nationally local brown @-@ veined wainscot ( <unk> <unk> ) , twin @-@ spotted wainscot ( <unk> <unk> ) and silky wainscot ( <unk> maritimus ) . 
 = = = Vegetation = = = 
 The lake is surrounded with fringing reedbeds , carr woodland and grassland , which are managed by Bristol Water . The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams . Open @-@ water plant communities are rather sparse , largely comprising fennel pondweed ( Potamogeton pectinatus ) , lesser pondweed ( Potamogeton pusillus ) , opposite @-@ leaved pondweed ( <unk> densa ) and water @-@ crowfoot ( Ranunculus spp . ) . On neutral soils around the reservoir , pepper @-@ saxifrage ( <unk> <unk> ) , burnet @-@ saxifrage ( <unk> <unk> ) and devil 's @-@ bit scabious ( Succisa pratensis ) occur , and on calcareous soils fairy flax ( <unk> <unk> ) , dwarf thistle ( Cirsium <unk> ) and salad burnet ( Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor ) are found . 
 The small and medium @-@ sized fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland , some of which date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period . Mature oak ( Quercus ) and ash ( Fraxinus excelsior ) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) and chestnuts ( Castanea sativa ) . Many elm ( Ulmus ) trees have been lost in this area , and dead / dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape . 
 Four areas of woodland containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity around the lake on the Restaurant side , for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them . These forests contain Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) , English oak ( Quercus robur ) , rowan ( Sorbus <unk> ) and the silver birch ( Betula pendula ) .

 During 2005 – 2006 Bristol Water started restoring two artificial islands . These are intended to provide safe nesting and roosting sites for a range of wildfowl . Permits to enter the reservoir enclosure and to use the access roads , paths and bird hides are available ( for a fee ) only to members of ornithological and naturalist societies recognised by Bristol Water . They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners .

 Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area , approximately 1 @.@ 9 miles ( 3 km ) long , for dinghy sailing . The lake is divided into two areas : a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season ( mid @-@ March to mid @-@ October ) , and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons . The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys . Racing marks are red buoys with flags , although large inflatable marks are used of open events . 
 The club can cater for fleets of over one hundred boats and it hosts large national events . Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes : Flying Fifteen ( keelboat ) , Laser ( dinghy ) , Solo ( dinghy ) and Topper ( dinghy ) as well as a handicap fleet run under the Portsmouth yardstick scheme . Five slipways enable easy launching . Off the water , the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms , hot showers , hot food at the weekends , a bar and terrace overlooking the lake . The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift . Royal Yachting Association sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training , youth training , powerboat training , race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet .

 = HMS Eagle ( 1918 ) = 
 HMS Eagle was an early aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy . Ordered by Chile during the South American dreadnought race as the Almirante Latorre @-@ class battleship Almirante Cochrane , she was laid down before World War I. In early 1918 she was purchased by Britain for conversion to an aircraft carrier ; this work was finished in 1924 . Her completion was delayed by labour troubles and the possibility that she might be repurchased by Chile for reconversion into a battleship , as well as the need for comparative trials to determine the optimum layout for aircraft carriers . The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and then later to the China Station , spending very little time in home waters other than for periodic refits . 
 Eagle spent the first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German commerce raiders . During the early part of the war , the Fleet Air Arm was desperately short of fighters and Eagle was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940 . She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940 , where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping , naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean . The ship also participated in the Battle of Calabria in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle . Whenever Eagle was not at sea , her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore . 
 The ship was relieved by a more modern carrier in March 1941 and ordered to hunt for Axis shipping in the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic . Her aircraft sank a German blockade runner and disabled a German oil tanker in mid @-@ 1941 but did not find any other Axis ships before the ship was ordered home for a refit in October . After completing an extensive refit in early 1942 , the ship made trips delivering fighter aircraft to Malta to boost its air defences in the first half of 1942 . Eagle was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U @-@ 73 on 11 August 1942 while escorting a convoy to Malta during Operation Pedestal .

 In 1911 , the Chilean Navy ordered one 28 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 28 @,@ 450 t ) super @-@ dreadnought battleship , with an option for a second ship , each to be armed with ten 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) and sixteen six @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns , that were named Almirante Latorre and Almirante Cochrane . Almirante Latorre was laid down in December 1911 , followed by Almirante Cochrane at the Armstrong yards at Newcastle upon Tyne on 20 February 1913 . On the outbreak of the First World War , construction of the two ships was suspended . As Almirante Latorre was almost complete , she was purchased for the Royal Navy , entering service as HMS Canada in 1915 . Almirante Cochrane was almost complete up to the forecastle , although her side armour had not yet been installed when war broke out . No work was carried out during the war until the British decided to complete her as an aircraft carrier for the Royal Navy . She was therefore purchased from Chile on 28 February 1918 to be converted into the carrier HMS Eagle . She was the fourteenth ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name . 
 The Director of Naval Construction began preliminary design work even before the ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8 February 1918 . This design had a full @-@ length flight deck and its most distinctive features were the two islands separated by the flight deck . Each island was to be 110 feet ( 33 @.@ 5 m ) long , containing two funnels and a tripod mast . Although they were staggered to make it more difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship 's course , they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing . The bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) for the aircraft on the flight deck . There was to be a 68 @-@ foot ( 20 @.@ 7 m ) wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off . Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts ( elevators ) . A crane was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes . Bulk petrol storage consisted of 15 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 68 @,@ 000 l ; 18 @,@ 000 US gal ) in 2 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 9 @.@ 1 l ; 2 @.@ 4 US gal ) tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plating . Two ready @-@ use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel . The ship 's planned armament consisted of nine 6 @-@ inch guns and four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted on the platform between the islands . Eagle retained the battleship 's mixture of coal and fuel oil , but the quantities were increased to 3 @,@ 200 long tons ( 3 @,@ 300 t ) of coal and 1 @,@ 750 long tons ( 1 @,@ 780 t ) of oil , as the forward and rear 14 @-@ inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks . 
 Based on trials with HMS Furious , in which pilots were found generally to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing , the design was revised to eliminate the port island in April 1918 . The starboard island was lengthened to 130 feet ( 39 @.@ 6 m ) and its width was reduced to 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to minimise air turbulence . The island contained the bridge , both funnels and the tripod mast that carried the fire @-@ control directors for the armament . At the request of Admiral David Beatty , commander of the Grand Fleet , the main armament was increased to 12 six @-@ inch guns , including one mounted on the island , and eighteen torpedo tubes were added , three triple fixed mounts on each broadside , in case the ship met German light cruisers at night . The anti @-@ aircraft armament was reduced to a single 4 @-@ inch gun mounted on the island between the funnels as Beatty believed that the ship 's own fighters would be her best defence against enemy aircraft . This design was approved in June , although work had begun earlier . 
 The 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 114 mm ) armour planned for her upper belt was used to protect the ship 's waterline . The already @-@ completed superstructure was removed as were the barbettes for the 14 @-@ inch guns . Eagle was launched on 8 June 1918 and was towed downriver to the shipbuilder 's High Walker yard for fitting @-@ out ten days later . The boiler uptakes were re @-@ routed and the existing openings were plated over . The existing 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 38 mm ) upper deck became the floor of the hangar deck and a new superstructure was built above it . The flight deck was 1 inch ( 25 mm ) thick and served as the uppermost strength deck , or main supporting deck , of the ship . When the war ended in November 1918 , the ship was about nine months from completion . 
 Construction was slowed by industrial action after the war , and was suspended on 21 October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase the ship and have it re @-@ converted to a battleship . The £ 2 @.@ 5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £ 1 @.@ 5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship . The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island , and the Admiralty approved the use of Eagle on 11 November . Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck ( which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications ) , finished the rear funnel , removed the torpedo tubes , and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20 April 1920 . Only two of her boilers , converted to run on fuel oil only , could be used during the trials . 
 = = = Flight trials = = = 
 The trials principally tested the longitudinal arresting gear used previously on the small aircraft carrier Argus . They were not intended to stop landing aircraft — the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind — but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and falling off the flight deck . Initially , the arresting gear was about 170 feet ( 51 @.@ 8 m ) long and was installed too far forward . Over the course of the trials it was moved further to the rear and lengthened to a total of 320 feet ( 97 @.@ 5 m ) . 
 The ship was commanded during the trials by Captain Wilmot Nicholson , who had previously commanded the carrier Furious in 1918 , and the Royal Air Force representative was Group Captain Charles Samson . <unk> trials began on 10 May with Sopwith Camel fighters and Parnall Panther reconnaissance aircraft while the ship was still docked . Flights over and around the ship to evaluate air currents over the flight deck and around the island began shortly afterward and the first on @-@ board landing was made on 1 June . Larger aircraft like the Bristol <unk> fighter , the Sopwith Cuckoo torpedo bomber , and the De Havilland DH.9 bomber were also evaluated during the trials . They were generally successful with only 12 minor accidents in 143 landings in all types of weather conditions , although they did reveal that aircraft landing aboard carriers would need landing gear fitted with shock absorbers to handle the impact of landing on a pitching deck . Group Captain Samson strongly preferred the elimination of the island entirely , but Nicholson recommended that the ship be retained for service , although he was not satisfied with the size and shape of the island . He also recommended that Eagle be converted to burn fuel oil exclusively and that the removal of the 6 @-@ inch guns in exchange for anti @-@ aircraft guns would allow the tripod mast in the island to be eliminated , since it would not then be required for fire control purposes . 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The ship was paid off on 16 November , but did not begin construction to a revised design until 24 March 1921 at Portsmouth . The Admiralty accepted some of Nicholson 's suggestions , but not all . The shape and size of the island was modified in accordance with the results from wind tunnel testing at the National Physical Laboratory , but the 6 @-@ inch guns were retained . The forward edge of the flight deck was faired into the ship 's bow to smooth out the air currents over the bow and the 4 @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft guns were mounted on and around the island . The forward elevator was moved to the forward end of the hangar . After construction began , anti @-@ torpedo bulges were added , 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) deep , and the petrol tin storage room was replaced by a 8 @,@ 100 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 37 @,@ 000 l ; 9 @,@ 700 US gal ) tank . The ship 's designed fuel capacity was 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) , but this was increased to 3 @,@ 750 long tons ( 3 @,@ 810 t ) when she was bulged . However , 500 long tons ( 510 t ) of this amount was required to act as ballast to offset the weight of the island and its equipment . 
 Eagle had an overall length of 667 feet 6 inches ( 203 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 115 feet ( 35 @.@ 1 m ) , and a draught of 26 feet 8 inches ( 8 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load . She displaced 21 @,@ 850 long tons ( 22 @,@ 200 t ) at standard load . Each of the ship 's four sets of Brown @-@ Curtis geared steam turbines drove one 3 @-@ bladed propeller . They were powered by 32 Yarrow small @-@ tube boilers . During her sea trials on 9 – 10 September 1923 , the turbines produced 52 @,@ 100 shaft horsepower ( 38 @,@ 900 kW ) and gave Eagle a speed of 24 @.@ 37 knots ( 45 @.@ 13 km / h ; 28 @.@ 04 mph ) , but this caused leaks in the turbine joints and she was limited to a maximum of 50 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 37 @,@ 000 kW ) in service . She had a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 The ship 's flight deck was 652 feet ( 198 @.@ 7 m ) long and her hangar was 400 feet ( 121 @.@ 9 m ) long and no less than 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) wide . Its minimum height was 20 feet 6 inches ( 6 @.@ 2 m ) , and it was equipped with four steel shutter fire curtains to isolate any fires in the hangar . The forward lift 's dimensions were 46 by 47 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m × 14 @.@ 3 m ) and the aft lift was 46 @-@ by @-@ 33 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 0 m × 10 @.@ 1 m ) . The fore @-@ and @-@ aft arresting gear was 328 feet ( 100 @.@ 0 m ) long and extended the length of the flight deck between the edges of the lifts . A large crane with a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) radius was positioned behind the island . The ship 's aircraft capacity was 25 to 30 and , in 1939 , the ship 's crew totalled 41 officers and 750 men , exclusive of the air group . 
 For self @-@ defence against enemy warships , Eagle had nine BL Mk XVII 6 @-@ inch guns , three at the stern and six along both sides of the ship . The ship carried 200 rounds per gun . Two of her five QF Mk V 4 @-@ inch AA guns were positioned on the flight deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island . The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island , one between the two funnels , and each gun was provided with 150 rounds .

 Eagle was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7 June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished working up . She was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six @-@ aircraft flights of the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force . These consisted of No. 402 Flight with Fairey Flycatchers , No. 422 Flight with Blackburn Blackburn reconnaissance aircraft , No. 440 Flight ( Supermarine Seagull flying boats ) and No. 460 Flight with Blackburn Dart torpedo bombers . 
 While in the Mediterranean , one flight usually operated ashore at either RAF Hal Far , Malta , or Aboukir , Egypt . The Seagulls proved to be unsatisfactory in service and they were replaced by Fairey IIIDs in January 1925 . Avro Bison spotters of No. 421B Flight operated aboard for a time in late 1925 . Eagle sailed for Devonport at the end of 1925 for a brief refit where the longitudinal arresting gear was removed as it had been found to be virtually useless in service . Two single QF 2 @-@ pounder pom @-@ pom light anti @-@ aircraft guns were added forward of the 4 @-@ inch guns on the flight deck in front of the island and the ship 's petrol capacity was increased to 14 @,@ 190 imperial gallons ( 64 @,@ 500 l ; 17 @,@ 040 US gal ) . 
 When the ship returned to the Mediterranean after the completion of her refit in 1926 , the Bisons of No. 448 Flight replaced No. 422 Flight . In 1928 she was joined by HMS Courageous which allowed the fleet to experiment with multi @-@ carrier operations . Eagle was refitted again in early 1929 and a salt @-@ water spray system was fitted to fight hangar fires . When the ship returned to the Mediterranean later in the year , both 440 and 448 Flights had re @-@ equipped with Fairey IIIF reconnaissance aircraft . Eagle departed Malta on 8 January 1931 , en route to Portsmouth to load the latest carrier aircraft for a demonstration at the British Industries Exhibition at Buenos Aires , Argentina . She returned to the Mediterranean to participate in the summer fleet exercises before sailing for Devonport where she began a lengthy refit in August . 
 The ship 's boilers were replaced during the refit and the 4 @-@ inch gun between the funnels was replaced by an eight @-@ barrel QF 2 @-@ pounder Mark V pom @-@ pom mount . A single quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount was added on the starboard aft side of the flight deck . Four fire @-@ fighting foam generators were also fitted on the flight deck . A single High Angle Control System ( HACS ) director was fitted on the aft end of the control top on the tripod mast . The crew , now numbering 753 sailors and 253 airmen , benefited from improved accommodation . The refit was completed on 28 November 1932 , but personnel shortages prevented her from working up until April 1933 . 
 Following the refit , Eagle was sent to the Far East , serving on the China Station throughout 1934 , with her aircraft being deployed against pirate ships and their bases . The tropical heat caused problems in cooling the bomb magazines , and the food storage rooms and the ventilation proved to be barely satisfactory . Another quadruple .50 machine gun mount was added forward of the 2 @-@ pounder gun on the flight deck and the original mounting was shifted over to the port side . During this time , the ship 's air group comprised nine Hawker Osprey fighters of 803 Squadron and 12 Fairey IIIFs of 824 Squadron ; the latter unit was re @-@ designated as 825 Squadron in October 1934 . 803 Squadron transferred to HMS Hermes when she relieved Eagle at the end of 1934 . They were replaced by Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers of 812 Squadron when Eagle arrived in the Mediterranean in February 1935 . Both squadrons remained behind at RAF Hal Far when the ship sailed for Devonport for another refit in June . 
 Eagle was paid off until her refit began in early 1936 . Transverse arresting gear was installed and a second octuple pom @-@ pom replaced the 2 @-@ pounders in front of the island . Two more quadruple .50 machine gun mounts were installed in sponsons on either side of the bow . The capacity of her bomb magazines was also increased during this refit , and the ship 's ventilation and insulation arrangements were improved as well . She was sent back to the Far East in 1937 with only nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers ( cloth @-@ covered biplanes ) of 813 Squadron aboard as well as nine more Swordfish to re @-@ equip 824 Squadron when it transferred from Hermes in April . Captain Clement Moody commanded Eagle from 1 January 1937 until relieved by Captain A. R. M. Bridge on 16 June 1939 . In August 1939 the ship 's crew was exchanged in Hong Kong and Eagle sailed for Singapore to begin a short refit on 12 August .

 When World War Two began the following month , the ship had just completed her refit in Singapore . She put to sea a few days later and began searching for German merchant ships in company with the light cruiser Birmingham and escorted by the destroyer Daring . A Swordfish discovered the freighter SS Franken south of the port of Padang on Sumatra and Birmingham was ordered to intercept it while Eagle continued her air patrols . She arrived in Colombo , Ceylon , on 10 September and until 5 October she searched the Indian Ocean for German ships between the west coast of India and the Maldive Islands with the light cruiser Liverpool . Eagle was then assigned to Force I together with the heavy cruisers Cornwall and Dorsetshire , to search the Indian Ocean for the pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee and other German commerce raiders . In mid @-@ December her boilers and bottom were cleaned during a period of maintenance in Durban , South Africa . 
 Eagle continued to patrol the Indian Ocean in 1940 , but escorted a large Australian troop convoy to Suez early in the year . While in the vicinity of the Nicobar Islands on 14 March , a 250 lb ( 110 kg ) bomb accidentally exploded , killing 14 men . The damage to the ship was mostly confined to the bomb magazines , although two generators were knocked out . The explosion flashed upwards through the port bomb lift and ignited the wing on one Swordfish stowed in the hangar . All but four of the aircraft were damaged by the corrosive salt @-@ water spray system when the fire was doused . She was repaired at Singapore between 15 March and 9 May when the ship sailed for Colombo en route to the Mediterranean , which she reached on 26 May . In June three crated Gloster Sea Gladiators were found in storage at <unk> and these aircraft became the only fighters available for the entire fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean . 
 Flying from shore bases on 5 July , 813 Squadron attacked Tobruk harbour in a combined attack with the RAF at dusk , sinking the Italian destroyer <unk> and the freighter SS Manzoni , and blowing the bow off the destroyer Euro . Two other merchantmen had to be beached before they sank . During the Battle of Calabria on 9 July , 813 Squadron was used to search and track the Italian fleet while 824 Squadron made two unsuccessful attacks on Italian cruisers without loss . On the evening of 10 July , Eagle 's aircraft attacked Augusta harbour in Sicily , sinking the destroyer Leone <unk> . While under heavy aerial attack on 13 July , pilots of the Sea Gladiator Flight shot down three Italian bombers . On the night of 20 July , six aircraft from 824 Squadron , flying from Sidi Barrani , sank the destroyers Nembo and Ostro as well as the freighter SS Sereno . While providing distant cover to a convoy bound for Greece , one Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 medium bomber was shot down on 29 July by Eagle 's Sea Gladiators while attacking the fleet . 
 On 22 August three Swordfish from 824 Squadron , flying from Sidi Barrani , attacked and sank the Italian submarine Iride and the depot ship Monte Gargano in the Gulf of Bomba . The ships were carrying eight frogmen and four manned torpedoes to attack British shipping in Alexandria harbour . In September , she was joined by the carrier Illustrious and both ships attacked Italian airbases on Rhodes on 9 September . Eagle 's 12 Swordfish were late in taking off and attacked the airfield at Maritza after the Italians had been alerted by the earlier attack by Illustrious ' aircraft on the nearby airbase at <unk> . Four aircraft were shot down by the defending Fiat <unk> and Fiat CR.42 fighters , but two SM.79s were destroyed on the ground and four other aircraft were damaged . These losses were the ship 's heaviest in any single mission of the war . 
 While covering another convoy to Malta on 12 October , she was damaged by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily . The damage to her aviation fuel system was not immediately apparent and she covered another convoy later that month . While returning to Alexandria , her aircraft attacked <unk> seaplane base on Rhodes on 27 October . Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour . The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250 @-@ pound bombs , while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines . On 28 October , Eagle and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece , but no contact was made . 
 When the ship was examined on 5 November , her aviation fuel system was leaking and required repairs . Five of her aircraft were transferred to Illustrious for an attack on 11 November on Taranto ( Operation Judgement ) , whilst Eagle remained in Alexandria . One of Eagle 's Swordfish was shot down by the intense Italian anti @-@ aircraft fire . The ship covered multiple convoys to Greece and Malta during the rest of November . Six of her aircraft bombed Tripoli harbour during the night of 24 / 25 November without loss . Eagle spent most of December in Alexandria , but her aircraft supported the ground war , most notably when they spotted for the battleships Warspite and Barham during the bombardment of Bardia on 2 January 1941 . In mid @-@ January , the ship covered a convoy to Greece , but bad weather foiled plans to attack Italian bases en route . After her return , her aircraft complement was reorganised to include more fighters , as Eagle now had sole responsibility for fighter cover over the fleet after the crippling of Illustrious by German dive bombers on 11 January . In order to make room for the fighters , one of the Swordfish squadrons was disembarked and used to support the ground war . When Eagle was covering another convoy to Malta in mid @-@ February , the ship carried nine Fairey Fulmars of 805 Squadron , five Sea Gladiators and six Swordfish . 
 After the carrier Formidable arrived on 9 March to relieve Illustrious , orders were cancelled that would have transferred Eagle to the South Atlantic to hunt for German commerce raiders and the ship did not leave Alexandria until 9 April . In the meantime , both Swordfish squadrons were transferred to Port Sudan to operate against Italian shipping in Massawa , in Italian East Africa , on 25 March . They were very successful and returned to the ship on 13 April after she had passed through the Suez Canal . After she reached Mombasa , Kenya , on 26 April , she was ordered to sea on 29 April on an unsuccessful search for a raider in the Indian Ocean . The ship was then ordered on 1 May to proceed to Durban , South Africa , to rendezvous with the battleship Nelson and to proceed to Gibraltar . After the two ships arrived in Freetown , Sierra Leone , on 25 May to refuel , Nelson was ordered to continue to Gibraltar , but Eagle 's orders changed and she was now charged with hunting for German supply ships in the South Atlantic . Captain A. R. M. Bridge was relieved by E. G. H. <unk> at this time . 
 Eagle began searching the South Atlantic on 29 May , usually accompanied by Dorsetshire or the light cruiser Dunedin . The carrier 's Swordfish discovered , bombed and sank the blockade runner Elbe on 6 June . The oil tanker Lothringen was captured on 15 June by Dunedin after it had been bombed and strafed by several Swordfish . The ship continued patrolling without incident except for a hangar fire that killed one aircraft mechanic on 20 September . All but four of the ship 's Swordfish were damaged by the spray used to put out the fire , but the ship herself was undamaged . 
 In October 1941 , Eagle was ordered to return to Britain for a refit at Gladstone Dock , Liverpool . She arrived off Greenock on 26 October and was docked at Liverpool on 1 November . The quadruple .50 machine guns were replaced by 12 manually operated automatic 20 mm Oerlikon light anti @-@ aircraft guns , six in sponsons on each side of the flight deck , and the crews of the four @-@ inch AA guns were given protection from splinters by the addition of <unk> around each weapon . The HACS was moved to the front of the control top and fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar . A Type 290 air warning radar was also installed . The ship 's oil fuel capacity was reduced to 2 @,@ 990 long tons ( 3 @,@ 040 t ) in exchange for an increase in her petrol storage of 3 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 14 @,@ 000 l ; 3 @,@ 600 US gal ) . This reduced her range to 2 @,@ 780 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 150 km ; 3 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . 
 Eagle 's refit was completed on 9 January 1942 and she was working up for the next five weeks . She joined the convoy <unk> en route to Gibraltar on 16 February and reached it a week later . 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Hawker Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron . Because their wings could not fold , they could not use either lift and remained on the flight deck at all times . The ship reached Gibraltar on 23 February and was assigned to Force H. 
 = = = = Battle of Malta = = = = 
 Upon Eagle 's arrival in Gibraltar , 824 Squadron transferred to RAF North Front and the ship loaded 15 Supermarine Spitfire fighters brought to Gibraltar by the carrier Argus . These aircraft were partly assembled dockside and hoisted aboard for final assembly . They were too big to fit below deck and remained on the flight deck , where they impeded the operations of Eagle 's aircraft , except for those few also carried on the flight deck , until the ferried aircraft were flown off . On 27 February 1942 , she sailed to deliver the Spitfires to Malta , escorted by the battleship Malaya , Argus , the cruiser Hermione , and nine destroyers , but the operation had to be cancelled when the long @-@ range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective . The problems were not rectified until 7 March , when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off to Malta . Upon her return , the ship 's engines required repairs that lasted until 13 March . Nine more Spitfires were delivered to Malta on 21 March and an additional seven on 29 March . After her return , her steering gear required extensive repairs that lasted until the end of April . 
 As part of Operation Bowery , Eagle rendezvoused on the night of 7 / 8 May with the American carrier USS Wasp , carrying 47 Spitfires , while Eagle had landed her entire aircraft complement to make room for 17 Spitfires of her own . Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta . For the next operation on 17 May , the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers destined for Malta . The fighters flew off without incident , but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return . After they had landed , the ship was attacked by a half @-@ dozen SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits . The radar @-@ guided guns of the escorting light cruiser , HMS Charybdis , were instrumental in driving off the determined Italian aircraft . 
 Eagle disembarked all of her aircraft , except for her four Sea Hurricanes , to make room for 31 Spitfires and flew them off on 3 June during Operation Style . Another 32 were flown off on 9 June during Operation Salient . Later in the month , the ship provided air cover for another convoy , Operation Harpoon , which departed for Malta at the same time as the Operation Vigorous convoy did , from the opposite direction . A dozen Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron and four Fulmars from 807 Squadron reinforced the four Sea Hurricanes of 813 's Fighter Flight to deal with the heavy air attacks anticipated . The convoy was subject to heavy air attacks by both the German and Italian Air Forces ; Eagle 's Sea Hurricanes managed to disrupt many attacks , claiming nine aircraft destroyed and a further two probably destroyed for the loss of one Sea Hurricane from 813 Squadron and three Fulmars . The escorts reached Gibraltar on 17 June and did not make the next delivery of aircraft until 14 July when 32 Spitfires were flown off to Malta ( Operation Pinpoint ) . During this time , the carrier 's aircraft complement consisted solely of six Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron .

 = Vermont gubernatorial election , 2014 = 
 The 2014 Vermont gubernatorial election took place on November 4 , 2014 , to elect the Governor of Vermont , concurrently with elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections . Incumbent Democratic Governor Peter Shumlin ran for re @-@ election to a third term in office against Republican businessman Scott Milne , Libertarian businessman Dan Feliciano and several other minor party and independent candidates . 
 Based on election polling , Shumlin 's large financial advantage and the state 's strong Democratic lean , Shumlin was expected to win easily , but he received only a plurality , not a majority , of the vote and polled only 2 @,@ 434 votes more than Milne out of 193 @,@ 087 cast . The Constitution of Vermont requires that the 180 @-@ member Vermont General Assembly choose the winner when no candidate receives over 50 % of the popular vote . On January 8 , 2015 , the Assembly chose Shumlin over Milne by a vote of 110 to 69 , with one abstention . 
 The result prompted much debate and analysis among commentators and the political parties . It took place among the 2014 U.S. elections , which saw Republicans make sweeping gains in federal , state and local offices across the country . In the nearby Democratic states of Maryland and Massachusetts , Republicans won unexpected gubernatorial victories . On June 8 , 2015 , Shumlin announced that he would not seek re @-@ election in 2016 .

 Four @-@ term Republican Governor Jim Douglas did not run for re @-@ election in 2010 . In the race to succeed him , Democratic nominee Peter Shumlin , the President Pro Tempore of the Vermont Senate , received 49 @.@ 5 % of the vote while Republican nominee Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie received 47 @.@ 7 % . As neither candidate received a majority , the General Assembly was required to pick the winner in January 2011 . Dubie did not contest the vote ; he conceded the race on election night and called for Vermont to " unite " around Shumlin . Shumlin won the Assembly vote 145 to 28 , with 7 legislators not voting . 
 Shumlin was re @-@ elected in 2012 against Republican State Senator and former Vermont Auditor of Accounts Randy Brock by a landslide , 57 @.@ 8 % to 37 @.@ 6 % .

 The Republicans initially struggled to recruit a candidate . Former Governor Douglas and Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott announced early on that they would not run and it was not until March 2014 that a candidate entered the race : marijuana legalization activist and former Independent gubernatorial candidate Emily Peyton . This spurred Republicans to recruit a serious candidate , but they struggled to do so . Former Wall Street banker Bruce Lisman announced in May 2014 that he was not running , and attention turned to former State Senator and 2012 nominee Randy Brock , State Representative Heidi Scheuermann and businessman Scott Milne . 
 In May , Scheuermann said that she would not run , leaving the party with a month until the June 12 filing deadline to find a candidate . Milne , who was traveling in Africa , announced that he would decide shortly before the deadline . Brock was urged to run and considered doing so , but revealed on June 8 that he would not . On the morning of filing deadline day , Milne announced that he would run . He was joined in the Republican primary by Peyton and retired marketer and self @-@ described " modern @-@ day Mark Twain " Steve Berry . Also running but not appearing on the ballot was Dan Feliciano , who ran as a write @-@ in candidate for the Republican nomination and was uncontested for the Libertarian nomination .

 A general election debate , attended by party nominees Shumlin , Milne , Diamondstone and Feliciano and Independent candidates Ericson , Peters and Peyton , was held on October 9 . It attracted considerable media attention and was described variously as " funny " , " strange " , " crazy " , " one of the strangest of this election cycle " , " very , very special " and " beard @-@ filled " . Comments by all of the candidates apart from Shumlin drew media attention and laughter from the studio audience , such as Milne describing himself as " third @-@ generation , born in Vermont " , only to correct himself and state that he was born in Brooklyn ; Ericson , who sported a large bow @-@ topped hat , suggesting that poor Vermonters use their food stamps to buy lottery tickets and decrying " chemtrails " ; Diamondstone , who wore jean shorts with suspenders and long socks and sported a large beard , calling for revolutionary socialism , the legalisation of all drugs and secession from the union , as well as comparing students to " slaves " because of the cost of higher education and responding to a question about the Department of Children and Families by railing against the U.S. military and the " Zionist regime " ; Peters answering a question about the affordability of college in Vermont by saying that he had " no idea " ; and self @-@ described " light worker " Peyton shouting at Shumlin for allegedly closing highway restrooms and using her closing remarks to ask Vermonters if they 'd rather choose money or love . 
 Additional debates among the candidates were held , which also drew attention . Former Governor Howard Dean described the debates as a " good thing for the state " and Time magazine 's Denver Nicks called them a " breath of fresh air " and " pure entertainment " . There was a final debate on October 29 with just the top three candidates : Shumlin , Milne and Feliciano .

 Of Vermont 's 275 " polling places " that report results separately — corresponding to the state 's 255 towns and cities , with some larger municipalities broken into multiple precincts — Milne won a plurality in 162 precincts , or 58 @.@ 9 % . Shumlin won 112 , or 40 @.@ 7 % , and they were tied in one other . Shumlin won the state 's biggest voting area , Burlington ( representing 9 @,@ 604 gubernatorial voters ) , by a margin of 66 % to 23 % . Of the state 's 10 largest municipalities , Shumlin also won South Burlington , Bennington , Montpelier , Hartford and Middlebury . Milne won Essex , Colchester , Rutland City , Williston and Barre Town . Of Vermont 's 13 multi @-@ member Senate districts , aligning roughly with the state 's 14 counties , Milne won eight ( 61 @.@ 5 % ) and Shumlin five ( 38 @.@ 5 % ) . Milne won the popular vote in 53 House districts ; Shumlin won in 51 . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 As no candidate received a majority of the vote , the Vermont General Assembly was required to decide the election , choosing among the top three vote @-@ getters , Shumlin , Milne and Feliciano . The result came as a surprise to most observers , who had expected Shumlin to win easily . RealClearPolitics rated the race " Likely Democratic " and The Cook Political Report , Daily Kos Elections , Governing , The Rothenberg Political Report and Sabato 's Crystal Ball all rated the race " Safe Democratic " . RealClearPolitics reported an average lead in the polls of 15 @.@ 2 % for Shumlin and HuffPost Pollster 's model estimated Shumlin would beat Milne 51 @.@ 1 % to 37 % with the probability that Shumlin would win the election at 95 % . 
 Analyzing the results , The Burlington Free Press pointed to Shumlin 's relatively soft numbers in opinion polls – he was in the mid @-@ 40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single @-@ payer health care , with rising property taxes , and with the unsuccessful roll @-@ out of Vermont Health Connect , the state 's federal health care exchange . Shumlin 's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from popular U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try and put him over 50 % . By comparison , Milne lagged in fundraising and spending , with just $ 100 @,@ 000 available compared to Shumlin 's $ 1 @.@ 1 million , which meant that he could not even afford to pay for polling . 
 The presence of Libertarian nominee Dan Feliciano on the ballot divided opinion , with Milne and former Republican Governor Jim Douglas saying that he split the anti @-@ Shumlin vote . By contrast , the Free Press said that Feliciano was likely to have drawn many voters dissatisfied with Shumlin but who would not have otherwise have voted for Milne . Feliciano agreed with this assessment , saying that he was " not a spoiler " . Republicans wondered whether they should have done more to push Feliciano out , whether Milne should have run more strongly against single @-@ payer , whether 2012 nominee and former State Auditor Randy Brock should have run again , and whether the state party should have been less focused on state legislative races . 
 Analysis by political experts pointed to the record low voter turnout – around 43 @.@ 6 % – and the fact that 39 @,@ 000 more people voted for Democratic Congressman Peter Welch than voted for Shumlin as a sign of dissatisfaction with Shumlin . University of Vermont political science professor Garrison Nelson said that " the people who showed up are the angry ones " and that , unlike Shumlin , " Welch demonstrated an appeal far beyond just the Democratic base . " 
 In a news conference on November 12 , Shumlin stated that the result was " humbling " and said that he would " listen , learn , reflect [ and ] be more inclusive . " He also pledged to move ahead with single @-@ payer health care and to address school spending , property taxes and the $ 100m budget gap . 
 = = General Assembly vote = = 
 Since 1853 , the General Assembly has selected the first @-@ place finisher in every gubernatorial election that has come before it , most recently in 2010 , when Shumlin received 49 @.@ 5 % of the vote and was chosen over Republican Brian Dubie , and in 2002 , when the Democratic @-@ controlled legislature picked Republican Jim Douglas , who had received 44 @.@ 9 % , over Democrat Doug Racine , who received 42 @.@ 4 % . The Assembly most recently reversed a plurality vote in the 1976 lieutenant gubernatorial election , when the Republican @-@ controlled legislature picked Republican T. Garry Buckley rather than Democrat John Alden , who was suspected , and later convicted , of insurance fraud . 
 Although the second @-@ place finisher usually concedes the race , as happened in 2002 and 2010 , Milne refused to concede . He considered requesting a recount , but did not do so , reasoning that it was " extremely unlikely , almost unfathomable , that a recount would put either candidate above the 50 percent mark . " Before the election , Milne said that if Shumlin won a plurality , he would support him and would expect Shumlin to do the same if the situation were reversed . After the election , however , he said , " it 's clear that 54 % of Vermonters want a new governor , and a new path forward . " 
 As 91 votes are needed to elect the Governor from the 180 @-@ member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats , it was considered unlikely that Milne would win . Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted . Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district , the vote would result in a 90 – 90 tie . Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93 – 87 . 
 Republican legislative leaders said that they would not whip their members to vote for Shumlin , leaving them free to vote their consciences . Though Republican Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott did not have a vote , he said that he would vote for Shumlin , and Republican State Representative Kurt Wright said that he would do so . Initially , no Democrats indicated that they would vote for Milne . Indeed , several Democrats whose districts voted for Milne over Shumlin said that they would vote for Shumlin , citing his plurality win . 
 For almost a month , Milne made no further comment as he considered whether to lobby for legislators ' votes . Former Governor Douglas cautioned Milne against waging a legislative campaign for Governor , saying that it was " unlikely " to be an effective strategy and that Milne should seek to preserve the " good will that he has accrued " and " acknowledge the result and come back and fight another day . " 
 Then , on December 8 , Milne held a press conference in which he defied suggestions that he would concede by officially announcing that he was asking state legislators to vote for him . He went on to say that he would not be " pro @-@ actively " trying to convince legislators to vote for him , nor would he start " twisting arms " , but that his " door is open " and called on legislators to " consider the record of the incumbent " and what was " best " for Vermont . Shumlin responded that he was " honored to have received the most votes in this election and would not want to serve as governor if I did not . " He went on to say that he believed that " the Legislature will honor the long democratic tradition of electing the candidate who received the most votes . " 
 After Milne 's announcement , Independent State Representative Paul Poirier , a liberal whose district voted for Milne by a 2 @-@ to @-@ 1 margin , announced that he would vote for Milne . One Democrat , State Representative Jim Condon , said that he would vote for Milne , also citing his district 's support for Milne over Shumlin . Political science professors Eric Davis and Garrison Nelson and House Minority Leader Don Turner expected the General Assembly vote to roughly follow party lines , with Milne receiving about one @-@ third of the votes , including most of the Republicans and a few Democrats and Independents . 
 On December 17 , Shumlin announced that he was dropping his plan to implement single @-@ payer healthcare . The reforms , which required business and personal tax increases , had never advanced beyond the framework stage . Shumlin , who had missed two earlier financing deadlines , said that " this is not the right time " because the federal government had offered less funding than expected and " the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses , working families and the state 's economy . " The media also cited controversy surrounding comments made by economist Jonathan Gruber , who was involved in crafting and advocating for the plan , and Shumlin 's failure to win a majority in the election as reasons for the cancellation . The decision , which Shumlin called the " biggest disappointment " of his career , drew a mixed response . Business groups lauded his " pragmatic " move but supporters of health care reform organized protests and said that it would end his political career . 
 At the end of December , the newly formed group " Vermonters for Honest Government " raised $ 30 @,@ 000 to air television advertisements aimed at pressuring legislators to vote for Milne . The group 's founder , retired United States Navy Captain Bill Round , said that legislators should vote against Shumlin because " he 's promised a lot and failed to deliver . " Round did not reveal the source of the group 's funding . Milne said that while he had no connection to the group , he appreciated the sentiment . By contrast , Shumlin said that he would " absolutely not " run any advertisements , nor would he campaign for legislators ' votes or spend any money . He added that he was " not worried " about the vote . 
 In early January , Milne reiterated that he was not actively campaigning for legislators ' votes but said that he felt that his odds of victory were " getting better on a weekly basis , if not a daily basis . " Shumlin said that if Milne were to win , Vermont would be " paralyzed " , as the new administration lacked the time needed to assemble a new staff and draft a budget for the 2016 fiscal year . He also offered his support for amending the state constitution so that as long as a plurality winner received at least 40 % of the vote , the Assembly would not be required to decide the election . 
 On January 8 , the General Assembly voted to re @-@ elect Shumlin by 110 votes to 69 , with one legislator not voting . Shumlin stated that he was " grateful for the opportunity to continue serving this state I love . I expect this will be a productive session addressing the issues Vermonters care about so deeply . " Milne said that it was " a good day for Vermont ... I was happy to be a part of it . I think the road that 's led us here has a lot of people feeling like one person can make a difference . " Milne did not rule out running again in 2016 .

 On June 8 , 2015 , Shumlin announced that he would not run for a fourth term in 2016 . He said that he had " never seen politics as a lifelong career " and " decided to make this decision now because I want these next 18 months to be about the work that we still have to do . " He said that his decision was " not driven by poll numbers ; [ nor ] driven by politics " and that after leaving office in January 2017 , he would return to his family business in Putney . 
 Several candidates have announced their intention to run : for the Democrats , former State Senator and 2010 gubernatorial candidate Matt Dunne , former Secretary of the Vermont Agency of Transportation and former State Representative Sue Minter and Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives Shap Smith ; for the Republicans , retired banker Bruce Lisman and Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott . Milne is not running again . After saying that he was " unlikely " to run when Scott entered the race , it was later reported that he " would only get in the governor 's race if Scott was to falter . " Milne later clarified that he expected Scott to win the nomination and , in September 2015 , officially endorsed him . Libertarian nominee Dan Feliciano , who joined the Republican Party in mid @-@ January 2015 , is considering running for the Republican nomination . 
 = The Thrill Book = 
 The Thrill Book was a U.S. pulp magazine published by Street & Smith in 1919 . It was intended to carry " different " stories : this meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable , which in practice often meant that the stories were fantasy or science fiction . The first eight issues , edited by Harold Hersey , were a mixture of adventure and weird stories . Contributors included Greye La Spina , Charles Fulton Oursler , J. H. Coryell , and Seabury Quinn . Hersey was replaced by Ronald Oliphant with the July 1 issue , probably because Street & Smith were unhappy with his performance . 
 Oliphant printed more science fiction and fantasy than Hersey had done , though this included two stories by Murray Leinster which Hersey had purchased before being replaced . The most famous story from The Thrill Book is The Heads of Cerberus , a very early example of a novel about alternate time tracks , by Francis Stevens . Oliphant was given a larger budget than Hersey , and was able to acquire material by popular writers such as H. Bedford @-@ Jones , but he was only able to produce eight more issues before the end came . The last issue was dated October 15 , 1919 ; it was probably cancelled because of poor sales , although a printers ' strike at that time may have been a factor . 
 Although The Thrill Book has been described as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction , this description is not supported by recent historians of the field , who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to Weird Tales and Amazing Stories , the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 In the late 19th century popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content ; they would include non @-@ fiction articles and poetry as well . In October 1896 , the Frank A. Munsey company 's Argosy magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction , and in December of that year it switched to using cheap wood @-@ pulp paper . This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the pulp magazine era . For twenty years pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre , but in 1915 the influential magazine publisher Street & Smith began to issue titles that focused on a particular niche , such as Detective Story Magazine and Western Story Magazine , thus pioneering the specialized and single @-@ genre pulps . In the midst of these changes , some time in 1918 , Street & Smith 's circulation manager , Henry Ralston , decided to launch a new magazine to publish " different " stories : " different " meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable in some way , which in most cases meant that they included either fantasy or science fiction elements . In The Fiction Factory , Quentin Reynolds ' history of Street & Smith , Reynolds asserts that the magazine was the brainchild of Ormond G. Smith , one of the publishers , but pulp historian Will Murray regards this as unlikely to be the full story , given that Reynolds ' book was written almost forty years later and was an " approved " history . Murray asserts that Ralston was certainly involved in the creation of The Thrill Book . Walter Adolphe Roberts , the editor of Street & Smith 's <unk> 's Magazine , told a friend of his , Harold Hersey , that Ralston was looking for an editor for a new magazine . Hersey had sold some writing to the pulps but his editorial experience was limited to no more than a year 's work on several little magazines . He met with Ralston in early 1919 and was immediately hired on the basis of the interview . It is possible that Eugene A. Clancy , the editor of Street & Smith 's The Popular Magazine , was originally intended to be the editor of The Thrill Book , but was unable to take on the additional work , though Clancy did assist Hersey on some issues of The Thrill Book . Bringing Hersey on as editor was unfortunate ; historians of the field describe Hersey as lacking talent both as a writer and an editor . 
 The first issue of The Thrill Book was dated March 1 , 1915 , and was published in a format similar to that of a dime novel . The choice of format was probably a mistake , as it was associated in the minds of the buying public with low @-@ quality fiction aimed at readers with very low standards . The plan to publish twice a month indicated that Street & Smith were confident that the new magazine would be successful . 
 With the ninth issue , dated July 1 , 1919 , Hersey was replaced by Ronald Oliphant . The reason he was replaced is not clear , though several explanations have been suggested . Murray Leinster claimed that Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine ; according to Leinster , some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey 's mother rather than by Hersey himself . Pulp historian Richard Bleiler regards this theory as unlikely , since although up to eighteen of the twenty @-@ five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey , only two stories in those issues are definitely by him , and there are only four other stories which may have been Hersey 's work published under a pseudonym . Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey , and that the real reason for his dismissal is more likely to be that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with The Thrill Book under his editorship . Bleiler also suggests that Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material , as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure . Hersey himself claimed that he was not fired , but quit : " I wasn 't fired , but I should have been ... I saw the ' handwriting on the wall ' ahead of time . I asked to be relieved of my duties ... and my request was promptly accepted ! " 
 At the same time that Oliphant was appointed editor , the layout of the magazine was changed to that of a standard pulp . At 160 pages , this offered readers much better value for money than the 48 @-@ page dime novel format of the first eight issues , even with a price increase from 10 to 15 cents . A question and answer department , " Cross @-@ Trails " , was begun , in imitation of a similar feature in Adventure , the most successful pulp magazine of the day , and the format change may also have been done to increase the resemblance of the two magazines , along with a change to the appearance of The Thrill Book 's contents page to resemble that of Adventure . 
 Street & Smith cancelled the magazine after the sixteenth issue , dated October 15 . A printers ' strike has often been suggested as the reason , though Hersey denied it in his reminiscences , and it is clear that poor sales were at least part of the reason for the cancellation . Stories were still being acquired for the magazine by Street & Smith in November , and since the final issue would have appeared on newsstands some time in September , this implies that the magazine went on hiatus ( possibly because of the printers ' strike ) with the expectation of returning , perhaps on a less frequent schedule . A note in Street & Smith 's files records the cancellation date as December 1 , 1919 , which may indicate the point at which the delay caused by the strike convinced Street & Smith to finally kill the magazine . 
 = = Contents and reception = = 
 Hersey began by making himself familiar with the work of writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted . He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material . The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top @-@ quality writers , nor even to reprint the best @-@ known stories of the kind he was looking for , and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon . Hersey distributed a " Notice to Writers " that described what he was looking for : " strange , bizarre , occult , mysterious tales ... mystic happenings , weird adventures , feats of <unk> @-@ de @-@ main , spiritualism , et cetera ... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write , too weird or strange , let us see it . " This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction , and as a result Hersey received ( and printed ) all kinds of fiction , including mysteries , adventures , and love stories , though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine . Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts : " As a result of the notices in the writers ' magazines , I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten ! " 
 The first issue included " Wolf of the Steppes " , a werewolf story by Greye La Spina . This had been submitted to The Popular Magazine but purchased by Clancy for The Thrill Book in 1918 , when Street & Smith began making plans for the new magazine . The story was the first by La Spina , whose real name was Fanny Greye Bragg ; she would go on to publish several more stories in The Thrill Book , and later became a regular contributor to Weird Tales . Another first story was " The Thing That Wept " , by Charles Fulton Oursler , who later went on to edit Liberty and to write novels under the name Anthony Abbot . Two serials were begun in the first issue : " The Jeweled Ibis " by J.C. Kofoed , and " In the Shadows of Race " , by J. Hampton Bishop . Both contained enough fantastic or science @-@ fictional elements to fit the original plans for the magazine : " The Jeweled Ibis " was about worshippers of the ancient Egyptian gods , and Bishop 's story was about a lost race in Africa , and included intelligent apes . The cover for the first issue was by Sidney H. <unk> ; Bleiler describes it as " shabby and second @-@ rate " by comparison to cover art in successful magazines of the day such as Adventure and Detective Story Magazine . The May 1 issue included an early short story by Seabury Quinn , " The Stone Image " , which features a character named Dr. <unk> , who would later appear ( renamed Dr. Trowbridge ) in Quinn 's popular occult detective stories about Jules de Grandin , though Quinn had not yet invented de Grandin . Tod Robbins , a well @-@ regarded writer of fantasy , supplied several short pieces , all " shallow mood sketches " without much substance , in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley . The contributors included Sophie Louise Wenzel , who later published stories in Weird Tales under the name Sophie Wenzel Ellis , but most of the writers from Hersey 's editorship , such as George C. Jenks and John R. Coryell — both authors of dime novels — are no longer well @-@ known names . 
 When Oliphant took over the editorship , he placed notices in writers ' magazines looking for more submissions . Much of the material published under Oliphant 's editorship would have been bought by Hersey , making it hard to judge Oliphant 's impact . However , it is clear that Oliphant bought more science fiction and fantasy stories than Hersey had done : in particular , Hersey had published almost no stories that were straightforward science fiction , though two he did purchase , Murray Leinster 's " A Thousand Degrees Below Zero " and " The Silver Menace " , appeared in the first few issues of Oliphant 's editorship . Stories such as " The Lost Days " by Trainor Lansing , which dealt with perceptions of time , and " The Ultimate Ingredient " by Greye La Spina , about invisibility , published in August and October respectively , were more evidence of this change in emphasis . The most famous science fiction to appear in The Thrill Book was Francis Stevens ' novel The Heads of Cerberus , which was one of the earliest fictional depictions of alternate timelines . In addition to increasing the science fiction content , Oliphant also brought in authors who were better known than those published under Hersey 's editorship , including H. Bedford @-@ Jones and William Wallace Cook . It seems likely that the fiction budget increased when Oliphant took control , and he used this to pay higher word @-@ rates to the better writers . Hersey had paid about a cent per word for fiction , but Bedford @-@ Jones received $ 800 for " The Opium Ship " , which was a rate of between 2 @.@ 5 and 3 cents per word . However , Francis Stevens was paid only $ 400 , or less than a cent per word , for the much longer novel The Heads of Cerberus . Poetry continued to appear , including several more poems by Hersey , and also including " Dissonance " by Clark Ashton Smith , whom Hersey had contacted in March asking for submissions in what Will Murray describes as " a rare instance of Hersey 's editorial foresight " . 
 When The Thrill Book ceased publication , Street & Smith had numerous manuscripts in inventory that had been purchased for the magazine . These were offered to other Street & Smith magazines such as Sea Stories over the next few years . Greye La Spina bought back her manuscript to " The Dead Wagon " in 1927 and re @-@ sold it to Weird Tales . Francis Stevens had sold three serials and three short stories to The Thrill Book that remained unpublished : one of the serials , Serapion , was published in Argosy in 1920 , but the fate of the other two is not known — they may have been earlier titles for known works of hers . The three short stories are not known to have been published elsewhere . In 1940 , John L. Nanovic , the editor of Doc Savage and The Shadow , reviewed the remaining Thrill Book manuscripts , and suggested to Ralston that a few stories might be publishable in Love Story Magazine , and also suggested a few stories that John W. Campbell might be interested in for Unknown . The following year Oliphant reviewed ten of the manuscripts and returned them to Nanovic with his recommendations . Campbell reviewed three of them and declined to take any ; he also declined to take Murray Leinster 's " The Great Catastrophe " , which had been submitted to The Thrill Book and found independently of Nanovic 's review . Other magazines that considered and rejected the stories Oliphant recommended included Clues , Mystery , and Detective Story Magazine . The only story from The Thrill Book 's inventory that was used from this review was Clyde Broadwell 's " The Speed Demon 's Vendetta " , which was rewritten and published in The Avenger in March 1942 under the pseudonym " Denby Brixton " , which Broadwell had used for a story he had sold to The Thrill Book . 
 In 1976 the manuscripts were reviewed again by Will Murray . By this time they had been donated to Syracuse University by Condé Nast , which had acquired Street & Smith in 1961 . The ten stories reviewed by Oliphant were found and plans were made for Odyssey Publications to publish a paperback edition of Thrill Book material including these stories along with some reprints . The following year another group of Thrill Book manuscripts was found in the Syracuse collection , including Leinster 's " The Great Catastrophe " and La Spina 's " The Bracelet " , and the planned contents of the anthology were revised to include some of this material . None of the Francis Stevens stories were found in either group of manuscripts . One story , " As It Is Written " , by De <unk> <unk> Cass , was misidentified by Murray as the work of Clark Ashton Smith , and this led to delays in publication as Odyssey made separate plans to publish the story under Smith 's name . The misidentification was not discovered until after the story appeared in print in 1982 . Four years later , Odyssey went out of business , and the anthology of Thrill Book material never appeared . 
 Because The Thrill Book was only sold in selected parts of the US , copies of the magazine are very scarce and are highly prized by pulp magazine collectors . Despite its rarity , or perhaps because of it , it has been often described as the first science fiction and fantasy magazine ever published , though more recent assessments by science fiction and pulp historians agree instead that the magazine was a failed attempt at specialization . In the words of Will Murray , the view that The Thrill Book is the first such magazine is " erroneously held by many " , and he adds that it was " merely a prologue to the Golden Era of periodical weird fiction " . In Murray 's opinion it might well have become a dominant force in the genre had it continued publication . Richard Bleiler comments that " it was a magazine that somehow became a symbol to a generation of pulp readers ... it was the first <unk> flash of a dream that would later come into being with Weird Tales " , and in Mike Ashley 's opinion it was just " a step towards a full @-@ blown fantasy magazine " . 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 The Thrill Book was published by Street & Smith . Initially the magazine was saddle @-@ stapled , 10 3 ⁄ 4 in by 8 in , 48 pages long , and priced at 10 cents . This changed with the ninth issue , dated July 1 , 1919 , to pulp format , with 160 pages , priced at 15 cents . The editor was Harold Hersey from March 1 , 1919 to June 15 , 1919 , and Ronald Oliphant thereafter . There were eight issues to the first volume , six in the second , and two in the third and final volume . Hersey later recalled that he had heard of a Thrill Book Quarterly being issued , but no evidence of such a magazine has been found . 
 Two issues of The Thrill Book have been reprinted in facsimile editions , both by Wildside Press : the September 1 , 1919 issue , published in 2005 , and the first issue , March 1 , 1919 , which appeared in 2011 . 
 = Dive Coaster = 
 The Dive Coaster is a steel roller coaster manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience a moment of free @-@ falling with at least one 90 @-@ degree drop . Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop , a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop . After a few seconds , the train is released into the drop . 
 Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers opening on March 14 , 1998 , making it the world 's first Dive Coaster . The trains for this type of coaster are relatively short consisting of two to three cars . Bolliger & Mabillard have recently begun to also use floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience . As of May 2016 , ten Dive Coasters have been built , with the newest being Valravn at Cedar Point .

 According to Walter Bolliger , development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 . On March 14 , 1998 , the world 's first Dive Coaster , Oblivion , opened at Alton Towers . Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster , it does not have a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 88 @.@ 8 @-@ degrees . Two years later , the second Dive Coaster built , Diving Machine G5 , opened at <unk> <unk> and also does not have a vertical drop . In 2005 , SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90 @-@ degree drop and a splashdown element . In 2007 , Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones . In 2011 , the first ' mini ' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort , named Krake . Unlike other Dive Coasters , Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design of a Dive Coaster can vary slightly from one to another . Depending on the amusement park 's request , one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders . Stadium seating is also used to give every rider a clear view . Next , compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars , because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster , the size of the track must be larger than other B & M models ( such as the Hyper Coaster ) to support the weight . At the top of the primary vertical drop , a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds , giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop . 
 In the station , Dive Coasters that use non @-@ floorless trains simply use a standard station . With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains , in order to allow riders to load and unload the train , a movable floor is necessary . Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking over the edge of the station , a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening . Once all the over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraints are locked , the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station . When the next train enters the station , the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board .

 = Nathu La = 
 Nathu La ( Devanagari <unk> <unk> ; Tibetan : <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ , IAST : <unk> <unk> , Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) is a mountain pass in the Himalayas . It connects the Indian state of Sikkim with China 's Tibet Autonomous Region . The pass , at 4 @,@ 310 m ( 14 @,@ 140 ft ) above mean sea level , forms a part of an offshoot of the ancient Silk Road . Nathu means " listening ears " and La means " pass " in Tibetan . On the Indian side , the pass is 54 km ( 34 mi ) east of Gangtok , the capital of Sikkim . Only citizens of India can visit the pass , and then only after obtaining a permit in Gangtok . 
 Nathu La is one of the three open trading border posts between China and India ; the others are <unk> in Himachal Pradesh and <unk> ( or <unk> ) at the <unk> point of Uttarakhand – India , Nepal and China . Sealed by India after the 1962 Sino @-@ Indian War , Nathu La was re @-@ opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements . The opening of the pass shortens the travel distance to important Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the region and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing a key role in the growing Sino @-@ Indian trade . However , trade is limited to specific types of goods and to specific days of the week . 
 It is also one of the four officially agreed BPM ( Border Personnel Meeting ) points between the Indian Army and People 's Liberation Army of China for regular consultations and interactions between the two armies , which helps in defusing stand @-@ offs . The four BPM are : <unk> in Ladakh , Nathu La in Sikkim , Bum La Pass in Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh , and <unk> Pass in Uttarakhand , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) from the Chinese town of <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Nathu La is located on the 563 km ( 350 mi ) Old Silk Route , an offshoot of the historic Silk Road . The Old Silk Route connects Lhasa in Tibet to the plains of Bengal to the south . In 1815 , trade volume increased after the British annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese , Nepalese , and Bhutanese . The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873 , after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet . In December 1893 , the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations . The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened . 
 Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903 – 1904 British expedition to Tibet , which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region . In 1904 , Major Francis Younghusband , serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet , led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa . This led to the setting up of trading posts at <unk> and <unk> in Tibet , and gave control of the surrounding <unk> Valley to the British . The following November , China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet . 
 In 1947 and 1948 , a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim . Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders , including Nathu La . During this period , more than 1 @,@ 000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross @-@ border trade through Nathu La . In 1949 , when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there , most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La – Sikkim – Kolkata route . 
 The current Dalai Lama , Tenzin Gyatso , used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha , which was held between November 1956 and February 1957 . Later , on 1 September 1958 , Nehru , his daughter Indira Gandhi , and Palden <unk> Namgyal ( son of — and internal affairs adviser to — Tashi Namgyal , the Chogyal of Sikkim ) used this pass to travel to nearby Bhutan . 
 After the People 's Republic of China took control of Tibet in 1950 and suppressed a Tibetan uprising in 1959 , the passes into Sikkim became a conduit for refugees from Tibet . During the 1962 Sino @-@ Indian War , Nathu La witnessed skirmishes between soldiers of the two countries . Shortly thereafter , the passage was sealed and remained closed for more than four decades . Between 7 and 13 September 1967 , China 's People 's Liberation Army and the Indian Army had six @-@ day " border skirmishes " , including the exchange of heavy artillery fire . In 1975 , Sikkim acceded to India and Nathu La became part of Indian territory . China , however , refused to acknowledge the accession at that time . 
 In 2003 , with the thawing of Sino @-@ Indian relations , Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's visit to China led to the resumption of talks on opening the border . Later in 2004 , the Indian Defence Minister 's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass . The opening , originally scheduled for 2 October 2005 , was postponed due to last @-@ minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side . Finally , after a decade of talks , Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006 . The date of the reopening , which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim 's accession to India , coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama . In the years before the reopening , the only person permitted to cross the barbed @-@ wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort , who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border . 
 The opening of the pass was marked by a ceremony on the Indian side that was attended by officials from both countries . A delegation of 100 traders from India and 100 Tibetans crossed the border to respective trading towns . Despite heavy rain and chilly winds , the ceremony was marked by the attendance of many officials , locals , and international and local media . The barbed wire fence between India and China was replaced by a 10 m ( 30 ft ) wide stone @-@ walled passageway . It was also decided to mark the year 2006 as the year of Sino @-@ Indian friendship . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The pass is 54 km ( 34 mi ) east of Gangtok , the capital of Sikkim and 430 km ( 270 mi ) from Lhasa , the capital of Tibet . In the winter , the pass is blocked by heavy snowfall . Because there is no meteorological centre in Nathu La , systematic measurements of meteorological data ( such as temperature and rainfall ) are not available for the region . However , it is known that in the higher reaches of the Himalayas around the region , summer temperature never exceeds 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) . 
 Nathu La has moderately shallow , excessively drained , coarse , and loamy soil on a steep slope ( 30 – 50 % ) with gravelly loamy surface , moderate erosion , and moderate stoniness . It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to landslides . To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side , the government of India regulates the flow of tourists . Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation , a wing of the Indian Army . On the Chinese side the pass leads to the <unk> Valley of the Tibetan Plateau . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Because of the steep elevation increase around the pass , the vegetation graduates from sub @-@ tropical forest at its base , to a temperate region , to a wet and dry alpine climate , and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation . Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side , the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs . Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons ( Rhododendron <unk> , R. <unk> ) and junipers . The meadows include the genera Poa , <unk> , Pedicularis , Primula , and <unk> . The region has a four @-@ month growing season during which grasses , sedges , and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects , wild and domestic herbivores , larks , and finches . The nearby <unk> Alpine Sanctuary has rare , endangered ground <unk> and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs . 
 There are no permanent human settlements in the region , though it has a large number of defence personnel who man the borders on both sides . A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or <unk> herd yak , sheep and <unk> @-@ type goats in the region . There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land . <unk> are found in these parts , and in many hamlets they serve as beasts of burden . The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species , including Tibetan gazelle , snow leopard , Tibetan wolf , Tibetan <unk> , lammergeier , raven , golden eagle , and ruddy shelduck . Feral dogs are considered a major hazard in this region . The presence of landmines in the area causes casualties among yak , <unk> , kiang , and Tibetan wolf . 
 The avifauna consists of various types of laughing thrushes , which live in shrubs and on the forest floor . The blue whistling @-@ thrush , redstarts , and <unk> are found near waterfalls and hill @-@ streams . The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers , tit @-@ babblers , treecreepers , white @-@ eyes , wrens , and rose finches . Raptors such as black eagle , black @-@ winged kite and kestrels ; and pheasants such as <unk> and blood pheasant are also found . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Up until 1962 , before the pass was sealed , goods such as pens , watches , cereals , cotton cloth , edible oils , soaps , building materials , and dismantled scooters and four @-@ wheelers were exported to Tibet through the pass on mule @-@ back . Two hundred mules , each carrying about 80 kilograms ( 180 lb ) of load , were used to ferry goods from Gangtok to Lhasa , which used to take 20 – 25 days . Upon return , silk , raw wool , musk pods , medicinal plants , country liquor , precious stones , gold , and silverware were imported into India . Most of the trade in those days was carried out by the Marwari community , which owned 95 % of the 200 authorised firms . 
 Since July 2006 , trading is open Mondays through Thursdays . Exports from India exempted from duty include agricultural implements , blankets , copper products , clothes , cycles , coffee , tea , barley , rice , wheat , flour , dry fruits , vegetables , vegetable oil , tobacco , snuff , spices , shoes , kerosene oil , stationery , utensils , milk processed products , canned food , dyes , and local herbs . Chinese exports to India exempted from duty include goat skin , sheep skin , wool , raw silk , yak tail , yak hair , china clay , borax , butter , common salt , horses , goats , and sheep . Restrictions are placed on traders , with permits only given to those who were Sikkimese citizens before the kingdom merged with India in 1975 . 
 There were fears among some traders in India that Indian goods would find a limited outlet in Tibet , while China would have access to a ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal . The reopening of the pass was expected to stimulate the economy of the region and bolster Indo @-@ Chinese trade , but this has not happened . Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006 , only US $ 186 @,@ 250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La . 
 On the Indian side , only citizens of India can visit the pass on Wednesdays , Thursdays , Saturdays , and Sundays , after obtaining permits one day in advance in Gangtok . The pass is particularly useful for pilgrims visiting monasteries in Sikkim such as Rumtek , one of the holiest shrines in Buddhism . For Hindus , the pass reduces the journey time to Mansarovar Lake from fifteen to two days . 
 A major concern of the Indian government is the trafficking of wildlife products such as tiger and leopard skins and bones , bear gall bladders , otter pelts , and <unk> wool into India . The Indian government has undertaken a program to <unk> the police and other law enforcement agencies in the area . Most of such illicit trade currently takes place via Nepal . 
 = = = Transport = = = 
 On the Tibetan side two highways — from <unk> to Yadong and from Yadong to Nathu La — were listed in the 2006 construction plans . Plans are also underway to extend the Qinghai @-@ Tibet Railway to Yadong over the next decade . 
 The nearest railheads are New Jalpaiguri ( Siliguri ) in India and <unk> in China . 
 The Chinese government is planning to extend its rail service to Yadong , a few kilometers ( miles ) from Nathu La . In addition , the Government of India is planning an extension of rail services from <unk> in Darjeeling district to Sikkim 's capital Gangtok , 38 miles ( 61 km ) from Nathu La .

 " Rajiin " is the 56th episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the fourth episode of season three . It first aired on October 1 , 2003 , on the UPN network in the United States . The episode was written by Brent V. Friedman and Chris Black from a story idea from Friedman and Paul Brown , and was directed by Mike Vejar . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi . In this episode , Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) and the crew visit an alien bazaar seeking a formula to help protect the ship against the anomalies in the Delphic Expanse . They bring back on board a former slave called Rajiin ( Nikita Ager ) , whose motivations are not what the crew initially believe . 
 Several sets were built for the episode , including the alien bazaar . Filming took longer than the normal seven days , with secondary shoots taking an additional day and a half . It was the highest @-@ rated episode of the season so far , with 4 @.@ 52 million viewers watching the first broadcast . However , the critical reception was mixed with criticism levelled at the " <unk> " female sexuality seen but the reviewers were pleased that it showed a sense of continuity in the overall Xindi arc with it described as a " space opera " .

 The Xindi Council meet to discuss the progress of Enterprise . Although the Reptilians and <unk> want to attack the humans , Degra advises them to continue with the plan to build the superweapon . On Enterprise , Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol continues to help Commander Tucker with Vulcan <unk> sessions . The ship , seeking the formula for a compound to reinforce its hull against spatial anomalies , then approaches a planet with a vast floating alien bazaar . Captain Archer leads an away team to meet with B 'Rat Ud , a chemist who they have met before . 
 After bartering , he sells them the formula for liquid <unk> @-@ D , and also informs them that the Xindi recently visited a merchant nearby . Archer meets the merchant , <unk> , a slaver who tries to sell him a female called Rajiin . Archer refuses and leaves , but Rajiin chases after him . Following a fight between Archer and <unk> , the away team leave with Rajiin , and Archer promises to return her to her home planet . Later she approaches Archer in his quarters , and as she nears him she puts him in a trance , and he no longer remembers her visit . Meanwhile , T 'Pol and Tucker attempt to replicate the chemical from B 'Rat 's formula but the first attempt fails . 
 Afterwards , T 'Pol returns to her cabin and is surprised to find Rajiin inside . She tries to resist , but is soon overcome . Rajiin attempts to flee using the transporter , but is quickly captured and placed in the brig . As Archer attempts to question her , Lieutenant Reed informs him that two Reptilian ships are on an intercept course . Rajiin admits she was gathering information for the Xindi . Reptilians , after running battles with the crew , retrieve Rajiin and take her back to one of the ships . Enterprise attempts to pursue , but the Xindi enters a subspace vortex . Afterwards , the Council convenes again to discuss the development and construction a new bio @-@ weapon , a project helped by Archer 's bio @-@ data that was stolen by Rajiin .

 Filming on " Rajiin " began on July 30 , 2003 , and primary shooting concluded after seven days filming on August 7 . The second unit continued on August 8 , with a further half day of shooting taking place the following week during the filming of the following episode " Impulse " . This was the first episode to be worked on by Brent V. Friedman , who had joined the staff as a Consulting Producer . He had previously been a producer on other similar genre television series such as Dark Skies and The Twilight Zone . " Rajiin " was directed by Mike Vejar , who had previously directed episodes of The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine and Voyager . This was his fifth episode of Enterprise , and his first of season three . 
 Several sets were built for this episode , including an alien bazaar and a chemical laboratory . As the Xindi council returned in Rajiin for the first time after the first episode of the season " The Xindi " , the guest stars who had appeared as their members returned . These included Tucker Smallwood , Randy Oglesby , Rick Worthy and Scott MacDonald . The titular character , Rajiin , was played by Nikita Ager . She had recently appeared in the television film Mermaids which had also been co @-@ written by Friedman . Main cast member Dominic Keating described Ager , saying " This girl is HOT ! Oh my word . I forgot my lines a couple of times . " Dell Yount appeared as B 'Rat ; he had previously appeared in the Deep Space Nine episode " Sons of Mogh " .

 " Rajiin " was first aired on October 1 , 2003 on UPN . It received a 2 @.@ 7 / 4 % share , meaning that it was seen by 2 @.@ 6 percent of all households , and 4 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast . This translated to approximately 4 @.@ 52 million viewers . It was the highest rated episode of season three at that point , despite it going up against Smallville on The WB for the first time this season . 
 In her review for TrekNation , Michelle Erica Green said that she was pleased with the continuity seen in " Rajiin " but felt that the female sexuality seen in this episode was the " most gratuitous ... I can remember on Trek " . She thought that the Rajiin character was a cliché , calling her a " trained slut who comes on to everyone around her " . Green described the overall plot as " feeble " , but praised the alien bazaar set . Jamahl Epsicokhan , on his website " Jammer 's Reviews " , said that " Rajiin " demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story @-@ arc to be a fully fledged space opera . He thought that the episode was average for the third season , and wasn 't as good as " Anomaly " . However , he felt that the scenes were reminiscent of comic books , saying that " There 's nothing really wrong with that . Nothing great about it either . " He gave it a score of 2 @.@ 5 / 4 . 
 The only home media release of " Raijin " has been as part of the season three DVD box set , released in the United States on September 27 , 2005 . The Blu @-@ ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013 , and released on January 7 , 2014 . 
 = Charles Barkley = 
 Charles Wade Barkley ( born February 20 , 1963 ) is an American retired professional basketball player and current analyst on the television program Inside the NBA . Nicknamed " Chuck " , " Sir Charles " , and " The Round Mound of Rebound " , Barkley established himself as one of the National Basketball Association 's most dominating power forwards . He was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the 5th pick of the 1984 NBA draft . He was selected to the All @-@ NBA First Team five times , the All @-@ NBA Second Team five times , and once to the All @-@ NBA Third Team . He earned eleven NBA All @-@ Star Game appearances and was named the All @-@ Star MVP in 1991 . In 1993 , he was voted the league 's Most Valuable Player and during the NBA 's 50th anniversary , named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History . He competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States ' " Dream Team " . Barkley is a two @-@ time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame , being inducted in 2006 for his individual career , and in 2010 as a member of the " Dream Team " . 
 Barkley was popular with the fans and media and made the NBA 's All @-@ Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league . He was frequently involved in on- and off @-@ court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy , as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler , and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures should not be considered role models . Short for a power forward , Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness to become one of the NBA 's most dominant rebounders . He was a versatile player who had the ability to score , create plays , and defend . In 2000 , he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20 @,@ 000 points , 10 @,@ 000 rebounds and 4 @,@ 000 assists . 
 Since retiring as a player , Barkley has had a successful career as a television NBA analyst . He works with Turner Network Television ( TNT ) alongside of Shaquille O 'Neal as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games and is a spokesman for <unk> . In addition , Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics ; in October 2008 , he announced that he would run for Governor of Alabama in 2014 , but he changed his mind in 2010 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Barkley was born and raised in Leeds , Alabama , ten miles ( 16 km ) outside Birmingham , and attended Leeds High School . As a junior , Barkley stood 5 ' 10 " ( 1 @.@ 78 m ) and weighed 220 pounds ( 99 @.@ 8 kg ) . He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve . However , during the summer Barkley grew to 6 ' 4 " ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) and earned a starting position on the varsity team in his senior year . He averaged 19 @.@ 1 points and 17 @.@ 9 rebounds per game and led his team to a 26 – 3 record en route to the state semifinals . Despite his improvement , Barkley garnered no attention from college scouts until the state high school semifinals , where he scored 26 points against Alabama 's most highly recruited player , Bobby Lee Hurt . An assistant to Auburn University 's head coach , Sonny Smith , was at the game and reported seeing , " a fat guy ... who can play like the wind " . Barkley was soon recruited by Smith and majored in business management while attending Auburn University . 
 = = College = = 
 Barkley played collegiate basketball at Auburn for three seasons . Although he struggled to control his weight , he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year . He became a popular crowd @-@ pleaser , exciting the fans with dunks and blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame . It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and , instead of passing , dribble the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two @-@ handed dunk . His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname " The Round Mound of Rebound . " 
 During his college career , Barkley played the center position , despite being shorter than the average center . His height , officially listed as 6 ft 6 in ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) , is stated as 6 ft 4 in ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) in his book , I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It . He became a member of Auburn 's All @-@ Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal percentage with 62 @.@ 6 % . He received numerous awards , including Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) Player of the Year ( 1984 ) , three All @-@ SEC selections and one Second Team All @-@ American selection . Later , Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the Birmingham Post @-@ Herald . 
 In Barkley 's three @-@ year college career , he averaged 14 @.@ 8 points on 68 @.@ 2 % field goal shooting , 9 @.@ 6 rebounds , 1 @.@ 6 assists and 1 @.@ 7 blocks per game . In 1984 , he made his only appearance in the NCAA Tournament and finished with 23 points on 80 % field goal shooting , 17 rebounds , 4 assists , 2 steals and 2 blocks . Auburn retired Barkley 's No. 34 jersey on March 3 , 2001 . 
 In 2010 , just two years removed from announcing he had a serious interest in becoming a candidate for Governor of Alabama , Barkley admitted that he asked for , and had been given , money from sports agents during his career at Auburn University . Barkley called the sums he had requested from agents as being " chump change " , and went on to say , " Why can 't an agent lend me some money and I 'll pay him back when I graduate ? " According to Barkley , he paid back all of the money he had borrowed after signing his first NBA contract .

 Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself eligible for the 1984 NBA draft . He was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers , two slots after the Chicago Bulls drafted Michael Jordan . He joined a veteran team that included Julius Erving , Moses Malone and Maurice Cheeks , players who took Philadelphia to the 1983 NBA championship . Under the tutelage of Malone , Barkley was able to manage his weight and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a game . He averaged 14 @.@ 0 points and 8 @.@ 6 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned a berth on the All @-@ Rookie Team . In the postseason , the Sixers advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals but were defeated in five games by the Boston Celtics . As a rookie in the postseason , Barkley averaged 14 @.@ 9 points and 11 @.@ 1 rebounds per game . 
 During his second year , Barkley became the team 's leading rebounder and number two scorer , averaging 20 @.@ 0 points and 12 @.@ 8 rebounds per game . He became the Sixers ' starting power forward and helped lead his team into the playoffs , averaging 25 @.@ 0 points on <unk> shooting from the field and 15 @.@ 8 rebounds per game . Despite his efforts , Philadelphia was defeated 4 – 3 by the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals . He was named to the All @-@ NBA Second Team . 
 Before the 1986 – 87 season , Moses Malone was traded to the Washington Bullets and Barkley began to assume control as the team leader . He earned his first and only rebounding title , averaging 14 @.@ 6 rebounds per game and also led the league in offensive rebounds with 5 @.@ 7 per game . He averaged 23 @.@ 0 points on <unk> shooting , earning his first trip to an NBA All @-@ Star game and All @-@ NBA Second Team honors for the second straight season . In the playoffs , Barkley averaged 24 @.@ 6 points and 12 @.@ 6 rebounds in a losing effort , for the second straight year , to the Bucks in a five @-@ game first round playoff series . 
 The following season , Julius Erving announced his retirement and Barkley became the Sixers ' franchise player . Playing in 80 games and getting 300 more minutes than his nearest teammate , Barkley had his most productive season , averaging 28 @.@ 3 points on <unk> shooting and 11 @.@ 9 rebounds per game . He appeared in his second All @-@ Star Game and was named to the All @-@ NBA First Team for the first time in his career . His celebrity status as the Sixers ' franchise player led to his first appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated . For the first time since the 1974 – 75 season , however , the 76ers failed to make the playoffs . In the 1988 – 89 season , Barkley continued to play well , averaging 25 @.@ 8 points on <unk> shooting and 12 @.@ 5 rebounds per game . He earned his third straight All @-@ Star Game appearance and was named to the All @-@ NBA First team for the second straight season . Despite Barkley contributing 27 @.@ 0 points on <unk> shooting , 11 @.@ 7 rebounds and 5 @.@ 3 assists per game , the 76ers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Knicks . 
 During the 1989 – 90 season , despite receiving more first @-@ place votes , Barkley finished second in MVP voting behind the Los Angeles Lakers ' Magic Johnson . He was named Player of the Year by The Sporting News and Basketball Weekly . He averaged 25 @.@ 2 points and 11 @.@ 5 rebounds per game and a career high .600 shooting . He was named to the All @-@ NBA First Team for the third consecutive year and earned his fourth All @-@ Star selection . He helped Philadelphia win 53 regular season games , only to lose to the Chicago Bulls in a five @-@ game Eastern Conference Semifinals series . Barkley averaged 24 @.@ 7 points and 15 @.@ 5 rebounds in another postseason loss . His exceptional play continued into his seventh season , where he averaged 27 @.@ 6 points on <unk> shooting and 10 @.@ 1 rebounds per game . His fifth straight All @-@ Star Game appearance proved to be his best yet . He led the East to a 116 – 114 win over the West with 17 points and 22 rebounds , the most rebounds in an All @-@ Star Game since Wilt Chamberlain recorded 22 in 1967 . Barkley was presented with Most Valuable Player honors at the All @-@ Star Game and , at the end of the season , named to the All @-@ NBA First Team for the fourth straight year . In the postseason , Philadelphia lost again to Jordan 's Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semifinals , with Barkley contributing 24 @.@ 9 points and 10 @.@ 5 rebounds per game . 
 The 1991 – 92 season was Barkley 's final year in Philadelphia . In his last season , he wore number 32 instead of his 34 to honor Magic Johnson , who had announced prior to the start of the season that he was HIV @-@ positive . Although the 76ers initially retired the number 32 in honor of Billy Cunningham , it was <unk> for Barkley to wear . Following Johnson 's announcement , Barkley also apologized for having made light of his condition . Responding to concerns that players may contract HIV by contact with Johnson , Barkley stated , " We 're just playing basketball . It 's not like we 're going out to have unprotected sex with Magic . " 
 In his final season with the Sixers , averaging 23 @.@ 1 points on .552 shooting and 11 @.@ 1 rebounds per game , Barkley earned his sixth straight All @-@ Star appearance and was named to the All @-@ NBA Second Team , his seventh straight appearance on either the first or second team . He ended his 76ers career ranked fourth in team history in total points ( 14 @,@ 184 ) , third in scoring average ( 23 @.@ 3 ppg ) , third in rebounds ( 7 @,@ 079 ) , eighth in assists ( 2 @,@ 276 ) and second in field @-@ goal percentage ( .576 ) . He led Philadelphia in rebounding and field @-@ goal percentage for seven consecutive seasons and in scoring for six straight years . However , Barkley demanded a trade out of Philadelphia after the Sixers failed to make the postseason with a 35 – 47 record . Barkley was initially traded to the Los Angeles Lakers before the end of the season , but the 76ers wound up retracting their deal a few hours later . On July 17 , 1992 , he was officially traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Jeff <unk> , Tim Perry and Andrew Lang . 
 During Barkley 's eight seasons in Philadelphia , he became a household name and was one of the few NBA players to have a figure published by Kenner 's Starting Lineup toy line . He also had his own signature shoe line with Nike . His outspoken and aggressive play , however , also caused a few scandals ; notoriously a fight with Detroit Pistons center Bill Laimbeer in 1990 , an event which drew a record total $ 162 @,@ 500 fine , and the infamous spitting incident . 
 = = = = Spitting incident = = = = 
 In March 1991 , during a game in New Jersey , Barkley attempted to spit on a fan that had been heckling with racial slurs ; however , his spit instead hit a young girl nearby . Rod Thorn , the NBA 's president of operations at the time , suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $ 10 @,@ 000 for spitting and using abusive language at the fan . It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it . Barkley , however , eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family . He apologized and , among other things , provided tickets to future games . 
 Upon retirement , Barkley was later quoted as stating , in regards to his career , " I was fairly controversial , I guess , but I regret only one thing — the spitting incident . But you know what ? It taught me a valuable lesson . It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game . It let me know I wanted to win way too bad . I had to calm down . I wanted to win at all costs . Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game , I only thought about winning . " 
 = = = Phoenix Suns = = = 
 The trade to Phoenix in the 1992 – 93 season went well for both Barkley and the Suns . He averaged 25 @.@ 6 points on .520 shooting , 12 @.@ 2 rebounds and a career high 5 @.@ 1 assists per game , leading the Suns to an NBA best 62 – 20 record . For his efforts , Barkley won the league 's Most Valuable Player Award , and was selected to play in his seventh straight All @-@ Star Game . He became the third player ever to win league MVP honors in the season immediately after being traded , established multiple career highs and led Phoenix to their first NBA Finals appearance since 1976 . Despite Barkley 's proclamation to Jordan , that it was " destiny " for the Suns to win the title , they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Bulls . He averaged 26 @.@ 6 points and 13 @.@ 6 rebounds per game during the whole postseason , including 27 @.@ 3 points , 13 @.@ 0 rebounds and 5 @.@ 5 assists per game throughout the championship series . In the fourth game of the Finals , Barkley recorded a triple @-@ double after collecting 32 points , 12 rebounds and 10 assists . 
 As a result of severe back pains , Barkley began to speculate his last year in Phoenix during the 1993 – 94 season . Playing through the worst injury problems of his career , Barkley managed 21 @.@ 6 points on <unk> shooting and 11 @.@ 2 rebounds per game . He was selected to his eighth consecutive All @-@ Star Game , but did not play because of a torn right quadriceps tendon , and was named to the All @-@ NBA Second Team . With Barkley fighting injuries , the Suns still managed a 56 – 26 record and made it to the Western Conference Semifinals . Despite holding a 2 – 0 lead in the series , however , the Suns lost in seven games to the eventual champions , the Houston Rockets , who were led by Hakeem Olajuwon . Despite his injuries , in Game 3 of a first @-@ round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors , Barkley hit 23 of 31 field @-@ goal attempts and finished with 56 points , the then @-@ third @-@ highest total ever in a playoff game . After contemplating retirement in the offseason , Barkley returned for his eleventh season and continued to battle injuries . He struggled during the first half of the season , but managed to gradually improve , earning his ninth consecutive appearance in the All @-@ Star Game . He averaged 23 points on <unk> shooting and 11 @.@ 1 rebounds per game , while leading the Suns to a 59 – 23 record . In the postseason , despite having a 3 – 1 lead in the series , the Suns once again lost to the defending and eventual two @-@ time champion Rockets in seven games . Barkley averaged 25 @.@ 7 points on .500 shooting and 13 @.@ 4 rebounds per game in the postseason , but was limited in Game 7 of the semifinals by a leg injury . 
 The 1995 – 96 season was Barkley 's last with the Phoenix Suns . He led the team in scoring , rebounds and steals , averaging 23 @.@ 3 points on .500 shooting , 11 @.@ 6 rebounds and a career high <unk> free throw shooting . He earned his tenth appearance in an All @-@ Star Game as the top vote @-@ getter among Western Conference players and posted his 18th career triple @-@ double on November 22 . He also became just the tenth player in NBA history to reach 20 @,@ 000 points and 10 @,@ 000 rebounds in their career . In the postseason , Barkley averaged 25 @.@ 5 points and 13 @.@ 5 rebounds per game in a four @-@ game first round playoff loss to the San Antonio Spurs . After the Suns closed out the season with a 41 – 41 record and a first @-@ round playoff loss , Barkley was traded to Houston in exchange for Sam Cassell , Robert Horry , Mark Bryant and Chucky Brown . 
 During his career with the Suns , Barkley excelled as a player , earning All @-@ NBA and All @-@ Star honors in each of his four seasons . The always outspoken Barkley , however , continued to stir up controversy during the 1993 season , when he claimed that sports figures should not be role models . 
 = = = Role model controversy = = = 
 Throughout his career , Barkley had been arguing that athletes should not be considered role models . He stated , " A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail ; should they be role models ? " In 1993 , his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his " I am not a role model " Nike commercial . Dan Quayle , the former Vice President of the United States , called it a " family @-@ values message " for Barkley 's oft @-@ ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to " raise your kids " and instead be role models themselves . 
 Barkley 's message sparked a great public debate about the nature of role models . He argued , 
 I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there 's some jealousy involved . It 's as if they say , this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money , so we 're going to make it tough on him . And what they 're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can 't become , because not many people can be like we are . Kids can 't be like Michael Jordan . 
 = = = Houston Rockets = = = 
 The trade to the Houston Rockets in the 1996 – 97 season was Barkley 's last chance at capturing an NBA championship title . He joined a veteran team that included two of the NBA 's 50 Greatest Players , Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler . To begin the season , Barkley was suspended for the season opener and fined $ 5 @,@ 000 for fighting Charles Oakley during an October 25 , 1996 preseason game . After Oakley committed a flagrant foul on Barkley , Barkley responded by shoving Oakley . In his first game with the Houston Rockets , Charles Barkley had a career @-@ high 33 rebounds . He continued to battle injuries throughout the season and played only 53 games , missing fourteen because of a laceration and bruise on his left pelvis , eleven because of a sprained right ankle and four due to suspensions . He became the team 's second leading scorer , averaging 19 @.@ 2 points on .484 shooting ; the first time since his rookie year that he averaged below 20 points per game . With Olajuwon taking most of the shots , Barkley focused primarily on rebounding , averaging 13 @.@ 5 per game , the second best in his career . The Rockets ended the regular season with a 57 – 25 record and advanced to the Western Conference Finals , where they were defeated in six games by the Utah Jazz . Barkley averaged 17 @.@ 9 points and 12 @.@ 0 rebounds per game in another postseason loss . 
 The 1997 – 98 season was another injury @-@ plagued year for Barkley . He averaged 15 @.@ 2 points on .485 shooting and 11 @.@ 7 rebounds per game . The Rockets ended the season with a 41 – 41 record and were eliminated in five games by the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs . Limited by injuries , Barkley played four games and averaged career lows of 9 @.@ 0 points and 5 @.@ 3 rebounds in 21 @.@ 8 minutes per game . During the league @-@ lockout @-@ shortened season , Barkley played 42 regular @-@ season games and managed 16 @.@ 1 points on .478 shooting and 12 @.@ 3 rebounds per game . He became the second player in NBA history , following Wilt Chamberlain , to accumulate 23 @,@ 000 points , 12 @,@ 000 rebounds and 4 @,@ 000 assists in his career . The Rockets concluded the shortened season with a 31 – 19 record and advanced to the playoffs . In his last postseason appearance , Barkley averaged 23 @.@ 5 points on .529 shooting and 13 @.@ 8 rebounds per game in a first @-@ round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Lakers . He concluded his postseason career averaging 23 points on .513 shooting , 12 @.@ 9 rebounds and 3 @.@ 9 assists per game in 123 games . 
 The 1999 – 2000 season would be Barkley 's final year in the NBA . Initially , Barkley averaged 14 @.@ 5 points on .477 shooting and 10 @.@ 5 rebounds per game . Along with Shaquille O 'Neal , Barkley was ejected from a November 10 , 1999 game against the Los Angeles Lakers . After O 'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley , O 'Neal shoved Barkley , who then threw the ball at O 'Neal . Barkley 's season and career seemingly ended prematurely at the age of 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8 , 1999 in Philadelphia , where his career began . Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career , Barkley returned after four months for one final game . On April 19 , 2000 , in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies , Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback , a common trademark during his career . He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list , and walked off the court to a standing ovation . He stated , " I can 't explain what tonight meant . I did it for me . I 've won and lost a lot of games , but the last memory I had was being carried off the court . I couldn 't get over the mental block of being carried off the court . It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own . " After the basket , Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen @-@ year Hall of Fame career . 
 = = Olympics = = 
 Barkley was invited by Bobby Knight to try out for United States men 's basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics . He made it all the way to final cuts , but wasn 't selected for the team , despite outplaying almost all of the front @-@ court players there . According to Knight , Barkley was cut because of poor defense . 
 Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men 's basketball team . International rules which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992 , allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time . The result was the " Dream Team " , which went 6 – 0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8 – 0 against Olympic opponents . The team averaged an Olympic record 117 @.@ 3 points a game and won games by an average of 43 @.@ 8 points . Barkley led the team with 18 @.@ 0 points on 71 @.@ 1 % field goal shooting and set a then @-@ Olympic single game scoring record with 30 points in a 127 – 83 victory over Brazil . He also set a U.S. Men 's Olympic record for highest three @-@ point field goal percentage with 87 @.@ 5 % and added 4 @.@ 1 rebounds and 2 @.@ 6 steals per game . Barkley was also part of an ugly moment in the 1992 Olympics when he intentionally elbowed Angola player <unk> Coimbra in the chest during a 116 – 48 rout of that team . 
 At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games , Barkley led the team in scoring , rebounds , and field goal percentage . He averaged 12 @.@ 4 points on 81 @.@ 6 % field goal shooting , setting a U.S. Men 's Olympic record . In addition , he also contributed 6 @.@ 6 rebounds per game . Under Barkley 's leadership , the team once again compiled a perfect 8 – 0 record and captured gold medal honors . 
 = = Player profile = = 
 Barkley played the power forward position ; but on some occasions , he would play the small forward and center positions . He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player , stockier than most small forwards , yet shorter than most power forwards he faced . However , Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his strength and agility . 
 Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22 @.@ 1 points @-@ per @-@ game during the regular season for his career and 23 @.@ 0 points @-@ per @-@ game in the playoffs for his career . Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force , leading the NBA in 2 @-@ point field goal percentage every season from the 1986 @-@ 87 season to the 1990 @-@ 91 season . He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986 @-@ 87 and 1987 @-@ 88 seasons as well , and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988 @-@ 89 and 1989 @-@ 90 seasons . He was one of the NBA 's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA 's premier clutch players . During his NBA career , Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions . He would use all facets of his game in a single play ; as a scorer , he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post , using an array of spin moves and <unk> , or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk . He was one of the most efficient scorers of all @-@ time , scoring at 54 @.@ 13 % total field goal percentage for his season career and 51 @.@ 34 % total field goal shooting for his playoff career ( including a career @-@ high season average of 60 % during the 1989 – 90 NBA season ) . 
 Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career high 14 @.@ 6 rebounds per game during the 1986 – 87 season . His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between 284 pounds ( 129 kg ) and 252 pounds ( 114 kg ) helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history , averaging 11 @.@ 7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12 @.@ 9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12 @,@ 546 rebounds for his season career . Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound , dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk . 
 Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor , foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals , a reason why he established his career as the second All @-@ Time leader in steals for the power forward position and leader of the highest all @-@ time steal per game average for the power forward position . Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions , he also finished among the all @-@ time leaders in blocked shots . His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase @-@ down block . 
 In a SLAM magazine issue ranking NBA greats , Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All @-@ Time . In the magazine , NBA Hall @-@ of @-@ Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley 's ability . Walton stated , " Barkley is like Magic [ Johnson ] and Larry [ Bird ] in that they don 't really play a position . He plays everything ; he plays basketball . There is nobody who does what Barkley does . He 's a dominant rebounder , a dominant defensive player , a three @-@ point shooter , a dribbler , a playmaker . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 During his 16 @-@ year NBA career , Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial , outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball . His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles , assists , scoring and physical play . His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court , and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it , such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared , " I am not a role model . " Although his words often led to controversy , according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth . He stated , " I don 't create controversies . They 're there long before I open my mouth . I just bring them to your attention . " 
 Besides his on @-@ court fights with other players , he has exhibited confrontational behavior off @-@ court . He was arrested for breaking a man 's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks and also for throwing a man through a plate @-@ glass window after being struck with a glass of ice . Barkley continues to be popular with the fans and media because of his sense of humor and honesty . 
 As a player , Barkley was a perennial All @-@ Star who earned league MVP honors in 1993 . He employed a physical style of play that earned him the nicknames " Sir Charles " and " The Round Mound of Rebound " . He was named to the All @-@ NBA team eleven times and earned two gold medals as a member of the United States Olympic Basketball team . He led both teams in scoring and was instrumental in helping the 1992 " Dream Team " and 1996 Men 's Basketball team compile a perfect 16 – 0 record . He retired as one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 20 @,@ 000 points , 10 @,@ 000 rebounds and 4 @,@ 000 assists in their career , although a fifth player , Kevin Garnett , has since accomplished that feat . 
 In recognition of his collegiate and NBA achievements , Barkley 's number 34 jersey was officially retired by Auburn University on March 3 , 2001 . In the same month , the Philadelphia 76ers also officially retired Barkley 's jersey . On March 20 , 2004 , the Phoenix Suns honored Barkley as well by retiring his jersey and including him in the " Suns Ring of Honor " . In recognition of his achievements as a player , Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 .

 Since 2000 , Barkley has served as a studio analyst for Turner Network Television ( TNT ) . He appears on the network 's NBA coverage during pre @-@ game and halftime shows , in addition to special NBA events . He also occasionally works as an onsite game analyst . He is part of the crew on Inside the NBA , a post @-@ game show during which Barkley , Ernie Johnson Jr . , Kenny Smith and Shaquille O 'Neal recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs . During the broadcast of a game , in which Barkley was courtside with Marv Albert , Barkley poked fun at NBA official Dick Bavetta 's age . Albert replied to Barkley , " I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace . " In response to that remark , Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the 2007 NBA All @-@ Star Weekend for $ 5 @,@ 000 . The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated . The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $ 50 @,@ 000 , and TNT threw in $ 25 @,@ 000 . The pair raced for three and a half lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won . After the event , the two embraced in a show of good sportsmanship . 
 Additionally , since 2011 , Barkley has served as a studio analyst for the joint coverage of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament between Turner Sports and CBS . Barkley has broadcast every Final Four since 2011 . 
 He also served as a guest commentator for NBC 's coverage of the NFL Wild Card playoffs on January 7 , 2012 ; the same night he hosted Saturday Night Live , which is taped next door to the Football Night in America studio in Manhattan 's GE Building . In April 2012 , Barkley won a Sports Emmy Award for " Outstanding Studio Analyst " for his work on TNT . 
 Barkley announced in November 2012 that he was contemplating retirement from broadcasting . " [ N ] ow I 'm like , ' Dude , you have been doing this for 13 years and if I make it to the end of the contract it will be 17 years . ' Seventeen years is a long time . It 's a lifetime in broadcasting . I personally have to figure out the next challenge for me , " he said . 
 = = = Gambling = = = 
 Barkley is known for his compulsive gambling . In an interview with ESPN 's Trey Wingo , Barkley revealed that he lost approximately $ 10 million through gambling . In addition , he also admitted to losing $ 2 @.@ 5 million , " in a six @-@ hour period " , while playing blackjack . Although Barkley openly admits to his problem , he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit . When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue , Barkley replied , " It 's not a problem . If you 're a drug addict or an alcoholic , those are problems . I gamble for too much money . As long as I can continue to do it I don 't think it 's a problem . Do I think it 's a bad habit ? Yes , I think it 's a bad habit . Am I going to continue to do it ? Yes , I 'm going to continue to do it . " 
 Despite suffering big losses , Barkley also claims to have won on several occasions . During a trip to Las Vegas , he claims to have won $ 700 @,@ 000 from playing blackjack and betting on the Indianapolis Colts to defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI . He went on to state , however , " No matter how much I win it ain 't a lot . It 's only a lot when I lose . And you always lose . I think it 's fun , I think it 's exciting . I 'm gonna continue to do it but I have to get to a point where I don 't try to break the casino ' cause you never can . " 
 In May 2008 , the Wynn Las Vegas casino filed a civil complaint against Barkley , alleging that he had failed to pay a $ 400 @,@ 000 debt stemming from October 2007 . Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino . After repaying his debt , Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT , " I 've got to stop gambling ... I am not going to gamble anymore . For right now , the next year or two , I 'm not going to gamble ... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn 't mean I should do it . "

 Barkley spoke for many years of his Republican Party affiliation . In 1995 , he considered running as a Republican candidate for Alabama 's governorship in the 1998 election . However , in 2006 , he altered his political stance , stating " I was a Republican until they lost their minds . " At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin , Florida , Barkley lent credence to the idea of running for Governor of Alabama , stating : 
 I 'm serious . I 've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it . Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that 's not important , like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration ... When I run — if I run — we 're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools , cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people . 
 In September 2006 , Barkley once again reiterated his desire to run for Governor . He noted , " I can 't run until 2014 ...

In 2010 , he confirmed that he was not running in 2014 . 
 Barkley is an outspoken supporter of gay rights . In 2006 , he told Fox Sports : " I 'm a big advocate of gay marriage . If they want to get married , God bless them . " Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later , he said : " Every time I hear the word ' conservative , ' it makes me sick to my stomach , because they 're really just fake Christians , as I call them . That 's all they are . ... I think they want to be judge and jury . Like , I 'm for gay marriage . It 's none of my business if gay people want to get married . I 'm pro @-@ choice . And I think these Christians , first of all , they 're not supposed to judge other people . But they 're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country . And it bugs the hell out of me . They act like they 're Christians . They 're not forgiving at all . " During a 2011 Martin Luther King , Jr . Day double @-@ header on TNT , Barkley responded to a statement by Dr. King 's daughter Bernice by saying , " People try to make it about black and white . [ But ] he talked about equality for every man , every woman . We have a thing going on now , people discriminating against homosexuality in this country . I love the homosexuality people . God bless the gay people . They are great people . "
