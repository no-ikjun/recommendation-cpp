 American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport ; the National Football League ( NFL ) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world , and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally . Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century , with Major League Baseball ( MLB ) being the top league . Basketball and ice hockey are the country 's next two leading professional team sports , with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . These four major sports , when played professionally , each occupy a season at different , but overlapping , times of the year . College football and basketball attract large audiences . In soccer , the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup , the men 's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women 's team has won the FIFA Women 's World Cup three times ; Major League Soccer is the sport 's highest league in the United States . The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $ 69 billion , roughly 50 % larger than that of all of Europe , the Middle East , and Africa combined . 
 Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States . As of 2014 , the United States has won 2 @,@ 400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games , more than any other country , and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games , the second most behind Norway . While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices , basketball , volleyball , skateboarding , and snowboarding are American inventions , some of which have become popular in other countries . Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact . The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing , particularly NASCAR . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) , Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS ) , the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) and Fox . The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities . Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches . Americans listen to radio programming , also largely commercial , on average just over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours a day . 
 In 1998 , the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4 @,@ 793 AM stations and 5 @,@ 662 FM stations . In addition , there are 1 @,@ 460 public radio stations . Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds , subscriptions and corporate underwriting . Much public @-@ radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR ( formerly National Public Radio ) . NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 ; its television counterpart , PBS , was also created by the same legislation . ( NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other . ) As of September 30 , 2014 , there are 15 @,@ 433 licensed full @-@ power radio stations in the US according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) . 
 Well @-@ known newspapers are The New York Times , USA Today and The Wall Street Journal . Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years , the price of newspapers has generally remained low , forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service , such as the Associated Press or Reuters , for their national and world coverage . With very few exceptions , all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned , either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy , which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers ; by small chains that own a handful of papers ; or in a situation that is increasingly rare , by individuals or families . Major cities often have " alternative weeklies " to complement the mainstream daily papers , for example , New York City 's The Village Voice or Los Angeles ' LA Weekly , to name two of the best @-@ known . Major cities may also support a local business journal , trade papers relating to local industries , and papers for local ethnic and social groups . Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century . In 1938 , Superman , the comic book superhero of DC Comics , developed into an American icon . Aside from web portals and search engines , the most popular websites are Facebook , YouTube , Wikipedia , Yahoo.com , eBay , Amazon and Twitter . 
 More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish , the second most widely spoken mother tongue behind English .

 Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles , which operate on a network of 4 million miles ( 6 @.@ 4 million km ) of public roads , including one of the world 's longest highway systems at 57 @,@ 000 miles ( <unk> km ) . The world 's second largest automobile market , the United States has the highest rate of per @-@ capita vehicle ownership in the world , with 765 vehicles per 1 @,@ 000 Americans . About 40 % of personal vehicles are vans , SUVs , or light trucks . The average American adult ( accounting for all drivers and non @-@ drivers ) spends 55 minutes driving every day , traveling 29 miles ( 47 km ) . 
 Mass transit accounts for 9 % of total U.S. work trips . Transport of goods by rail is extensive , though relatively low numbers of passengers ( approximately 31 million annually ) use intercity rail to travel , partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior . However , ridership on Amtrak , the national intercity passenger rail system , grew by almost 37 % between 2000 and 2010 . Also , light rail development has increased in recent years . Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal . 
 The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978 , while most major airports are publicly owned . The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based ; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways . Of the world 's 50 busiest passenger airports , 16 are in the United States , including the busiest , Hartsfield – Jackson Atlanta International Airport , and the fourth @-@ busiest , O 'Hare International Airport in Chicago . 
 = = = Energy = = = 
 The United States energy market is about 29 @,@ 000 terawatt hours per year . Energy consumption per capita is 7 @.@ 8 tons ( 7076 kg ) of oil equivalent per year , the 10th highest rate in the world . In 2005 , 40 % of this energy came from petroleum , 23 % from coal , and 22 % from natural gas . The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources . The United States is the world 's largest consumer of petroleum . 
 For decades , nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries , in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident . In 2007 , several applications for new nuclear plants were filed . The United States has 27 % of global coal reserves . It is the world 's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil . 
 = = = Water supply and sanitation = = = 
 Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West , water scarcity , pollution , a backlog of investment , concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest , and a rapidly retiring workforce . Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding , with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows . 
 = = Science and technology = = 
 The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid 20th century . Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal <unk> during the first half of the 19th century . This technology , along with the establishment of a machine tool industry , enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines , bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing . Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production . 
 In 1876 , Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone . Thomas Edison 's research laboratory , one of the first of its kind , developed the phonograph , the first long @-@ lasting light bulb , and the first viable movie camera . The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry . In the early 20th century , the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line . The Wright brothers , in 1903 , made the first sustained and controlled heavier @-@ than @-@ air powered flight . 
 The rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists , including Albert Einstein , Enrico Fermi , and John von Neumann , to immigrate to the United States . During World War II , the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons , ushering in the Atomic Age , while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry , materials science , and aeronautics . 
 The invention of the transistor in the 1950s , a key active component in practically all modern electronics , led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry . This in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the county such as Silicon Valley in California . Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) , and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems , Apple Computer , IBM , GNU @-@ Linux , Microsoft , and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer . The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements , and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet . 
 These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use . As of 2013 , 83 @.@ 8 % of American households owned at least one computer , and 73 @.@ 3 % had high @-@ speed Internet service . 91 % of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013 . The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet . 
 In the 21st century , 64 % of research and development funding comes from the private sector . The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor . 
 = = Health = = 
 The United States has a life expectancy of 79 @.@ 8 years at birth , up from 75 @.@ 2 years in 1990 . Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering the country 's rank in life expectancy from 1987 , when it was 11th in the world . Obesity rates in the United States are amongst the highest in the world . 
 Approximately one @-@ third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight ; the obesity rate , the highest in the industrialized world , has more than doubled in the last quarter @-@ century . Obesity @-@ related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals . The infant mortality rate of 6 @.@ 17 per thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224 countries , with the 224th country having the lowest mortality rate . 
 In 2010 , coronary artery disease , lung cancer , stroke , chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases , and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain , depression , musculoskeletal disorders , neck pain , and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability . The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet , tobacco smoking , obesity , high blood pressure , high blood sugar , physical inactivity , and alcohol use . Alzheimer 's disease , drug abuse , kidney disease and cancer , and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age @-@ adjusted 1990 per @-@ capita rates . U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations , especially among blacks and Hispanics . U.S. underage drinking among teenagers is among the lowest in industrialized nations . 
 The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation . America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians , while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five . Since 1966 , more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined . From 1989 to 2002 , four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe . The U.S. health @-@ care system far <unk> any other nation , measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP . 
 Health @-@ care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal . In 2014 , 13 @.@ 4 % of the population did not carry health insurance . The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue . In 2006 , Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance . Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near @-@ universal health insurance system around the country by 2014 , though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of controversy .

 = Spice Up Your Life = 
 " Spice Up Your Life " is a song by the British pop group Spice Girls . It was written by the group members , with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard , at the same time as the group was filming scenes for their movie Spice World . The song was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group 's second album Spiceworld , released in November 1997 . 
 " Spice Up Your Life " is a dance @-@ pop Latin song . The lyrics are inspired by Bollywood films and reflects the group desire to " write a song for the world " . The music video , directed by Marcus Nispel , features the Spice Girls in a futuristic setting , inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner , controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic cityscape . The group promoted the song heavily , performing it on many television programmes and award shows . 
 Despite the lukewarm reception from music critics , it was a commercial success . Released as the album 's lead single in October 1997 , it topped the UK Singles Chart on 19 October 1997 for one week , becoming the group 's fifth consecutive chart @-@ topper . This made the Spice Girls the first act to have its first five singles reach number one in the United Kingdom . It performed almost as well internationally , peaking inside the top five on the majority of the charts that it entered . In the United States , the song did not perform as well as their previous releases , peaking at number eighteen on the Billboard Hot 100 .

 In June 1997 , the group began filming scenes for their movie Spice World . At the same time , Virgin Records started the first marketing meetings for the promotional campaign for the album Spiceworld , set to be released in November . No song had been written for the album at this point , so the group had to do all the song @-@ writing and recording at the same time as they were filming the movie . Between takes and at the end of each filming day , the group usually went straight into a mobile recording studio set up in a Winnebago , which followed them between film sets . The schedule was physically arduous with logistical difficulties , as Melanie Brown commented on in her autobiography : " doing the two full @-@ time jobs at the same time took its toll and within a couple on weeks , exhaustion set in . " 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 A session with the production and songwriting duo Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe was booked to record the group 's next single . During the recording of the Spiceworld tracks , the group was so busy with the filming schedule that the quality of their contributions became more erratic and piecemeal . About the writing process during the session Rowe recalls : 
 I remember when they came to record ' Spice Up Your Life ' . It was in the middle of the chaos . It had been booked in , that they were coming in to record their next single , and write it , with us . It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this , which there was . Well , how on earth can you possibly do this ? You can 't write and record a song in half @-@ an @-@ hour with a film crew watching . 
 The session was interrupted constantly , with people entering the building , phoning them , or throwing things through the window . Eventually , when the filming crew left the room , the group managed to finish the song . <unk> commented about the inspiration behind it to Music Week : " We were talking about Bollywood films , the colours and how the Spice Girls could present themselves . It was a matter of how do we get everything in to one song ? " All the writing and the vocal recording was completed in one afternoon , and instead of taking turns , the five members went inside the vocal booths and recorded the chorus together . Brown commented that for this reason the final mix sounds " spontaneous and full of energy " . 
 = = = B @-@ side = = = 
 " Spice Up Your Life " was already finished and ready to be released , but nothing was recorded for the B @-@ side . Every other song available had been used in the Spice album , and the group needed a new track for their next single . A session with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins — the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute — was booked . Because of the limited time and the scarce creative inspiration at that point , Virgin told the duo to make anything they liked . 
 The duo created " Spice Invaders " by placing four microphones and telling the group to just talk about anything they wanted , the conversation was recorded and as Wilson described it , a " hideous bubblegum " backing track was added behind the voices . After the group left , Watkins and the mix engineer finished the track during the night . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Spice Up Your Life " is an uptempo dance @-@ pop song , with influences of Latin rhythms such as salsa and samba . It is written in the key of F minor , with a time signature set on common time ( 4 / 4 ) , and moves at a fast tempo of 126 beats per minute . 
 The song is constructed in a verse @-@ pre @-@ chorus @-@ chorus form , with a bridge before the third and fourth chorus , and uses a simple chord progression of Fm – C7 . It opens with an introduction , which consists of the repeated use of the word la . The first verse follows , the lyrics are an international rally cry , targeted to a global market , as Melanie Chisholm described it : " We always wanted to do a carnival tune and write a song for the world . " After the first verse , the group sings the pre @-@ chorus and the chorus . The same pattern occurs , leading to the second chorus . A spoken bridge , in which the girls mention different dance styles , — flamenco , <unk> , hip @-@ hop , moonwalk , foxtrot , polka , salsa and haka — precedes the third chorus . The group closes the song repeating the chorus for a fourth time .

 " Spice Up Your Life " received mostly negative reviews from music critics , with many of them criticizing the lyrics and the Latin @-@ inspired music . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described it as a " ha @-@ cha @-@ cha slice of tropical @-@ boat @-@ cruise frivolity " . In a review of Spiceworld , The Miami Herald said that " the busy Latin @-@ styled first single is a condescending dud " . George Varga of The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune believed that the song " does for Latin music what Hanson has done for death metal " , while Andy Gill of The Independent called it a " pseudo @-@ salsa [ ... ] pop pastiche " . However , Scott Schinder of Newsday was pleased with the track , referring to it as a " silly but irresistible uplift " . South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel 's Sean Picolli described it as a " salsa @-@ lite hootenanny " . Rolling Stone magazine 's David Wild called it " a global call to arms and legs with a distinct <unk> flavor and a message of Up With Spice People positivity " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic , commented that the song added Latin rhythms that " consolidates and expands the group 's style " . 
 The song drew comparisons to the work of other artists . The Contra Costa Times said that the song have shades of Gloria Estefan . The Daily Mirror went even further , commenting that it was a rehash of Estefan 's ' 80s music , and called it a " throwaway <unk> song " . Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch believed that the song was a copy of Miami Sound Machine 's " Conga " , and added that it had a " zingy mariachi @-@ flavored rhythm and infectious chorus chant " , while Ann Powers of The New York Times said that it " skates over Latin hip hop from Lisa Lisa to the Lambada . " The Dallas Morning News noted influences of ABBA , Bananarama and Bow Wow Wow in the song , and added that it " doesn 't quite reach the pop heights of ' Wannabe ' " . 
 Some of the reviewers criticized the lyrics . Dele Fadele of the NME called it " the <unk> pop single ever invented " , adding that it contained " a brilliant line in nonsense lyrics . As such it is the Spice Girls ' message of peace to the world " . The Reading Eagle reviewer , David Bauder , said that it " sounds like it was written by a focus group who told them to add a Latin flavor " . The Telegram & Gazette commented that its lyrics were " concerned more with shaking hips than moving social consciousness " . Larry Flick of Billboard magazine was mixed on the track . Although he described it as " insanely catchy and devilishly fun " , he also felt that it was not a real song , saying that it is " just a festive cha @-@ cha groove and a lyrical command to add some ' spice ' to your life by way of countless dance moves . A runaway hit . " The Hartford Courant music critic Roger Catlin , believed that the song " recognizes and embraces the group 's worldwide audience with savvy Latin rhythms and a self @-@ promoting lyric of dizzy Esperanto " . Chicago Sun @-@ Times ' critic Jim DeRogatis was unimpressed with the lyrics , yet when comparing it to Aqua 's " Barbie Girl " , he found that its " unifying sentiment is more admirable " .

 The music video for " Spice Up Your Life " was directed on 6 September 1997 , by Marcus Nispel in a two @-@ day shoot located in New York City . The video features the group in a futuristic setting , inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner , controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic cityscape . Nispel came up with the concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed " Ginger Spice " . He recalls : " I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and tried to imagine how the Spice Girls would transform it , as their career seemed to have no limits — at the time . " The group was not consulted about the concept . According to Brown 's autobiography , they wanted a carnival party theme , but were too tired to fight about it with the label , and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination . Brown commented : " It wasn 't right . I don 't think any of us liked it much , even though we enjoyed making it . I still can 't understand what 's going on in it half the time . " The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997 . 
 The video featured the group as <unk> masters , in a spaceship going through a dark city , looking at themselves on various billboards , while shoots of rooms and bars with televisions plays the videos for " Say You 'll Be There " and " Wannabe " , live footage of the girls inside the spaceship is also broadcast . The group then zoom aimlessly around the city on flying surfboards .

 Halloween is a 2007 American slasher film written , directed , and produced by Rob Zombie . The film is a remake / reimagining of the 1978 horror film of the same name ; the first in the rebooted Halloween film series and the ninth installment of the Halloween franchise . The film stars Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers , Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis , and Scout Taylor @-@ Compton as Laurie Strode ; Daeg Faerch portrays a ten @-@ year @-@ old Michael Myers . Rob Zombie 's " reimagining " follows the premise of John Carpenter 's original , with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night . Zombie 's film goes deeper into the character 's psyche , trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people , whereas in Carpenter 's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing . 
 Working from Carpenter 's advice to " make [ the film ] his own " , Zombie chose to develop the film as both a prequel and a remake , allowing for more original content than simply re @-@ filming the same scenes . Despite mostly negative reviews , the film , which cost $ 15 million to make , went on to gross $ 80 @,@ 208 @,@ 039 worldwide , making it the highest @-@ grossing film in the Halloween franchise in unadjusted U.S. dollars . Zombie followed the film with a sequel , Halloween II , in 2009 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On Halloween in Haddonfield , Illinois , having already shown signs of psychopathic tendencies , ten @-@ year @-@ old Michael Myers ( Daeg Faerch ) murders a school bully ( Daryl Sabara ) . Later that evening , he murders his older sister Judith ( Hanna R. Hall ) , his mother ’ s boyfriend Ronnie ( William Forsythe ) , and Judith 's boyfriend Steve ( Adam Weisman ) . Only his baby sister , Angel Myers , is spared . After one of the longest trials in the state ’ s history , Michael is found guilty of first degree murder and sent to Smith 's Grove Sanitarium under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis ( Malcolm McDowell ) . 
 Michael initially cooperates with Dr. Loomis , claiming no memory of the murders . His mother , Deborah ( Sheri Moon Zombie ) , visits him regularly . Over the following year , Michael becomes fixated on his papier @-@ mâché masks , closing himself off from everyone , even his mother . When Michael kills a nurse as Deborah is leaving from one of her visits , she can no longer handle the situation and commits suicide . 
 For the next fifteen years , Michael ( Tyler Mane ) continues making his masks and not speaking to anyone . Loomis , having continued to treat Michael over the years , attempts to move on with his life and closes Michael 's case . Later , while being prepared for transfer to maximum security , Michael escapes Smith 's Grove , killing the sanitarium employees and a truck driver for his clothes , and makes his way back to Haddonfield . On Halloween , Michael arrives at his now abandoned childhood home , where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister .

 On June 4 , 2006 , Dimension announced that Rob Zombie , director of House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil 's Rejects , would be creating the next installment in the Halloween film series . The plan was for Zombie to hold many positions in the production ; he would write , direct , produce , and serve as music supervisor . Bob Weinstein approached him about making the film . Zombie , who was a fan of the original Halloween and a friend of John Carpenter , jumped at the chance to make a Halloween film for Dimension Studios . Before Dimension went public with the news , Zombie felt obligated to inform John Carpenter , out of respect , of the plans to remake his film . Carpenter 's request was for Zombie to " make it his own " . During a June 16 , 2006 interview , Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept . He insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film , as opposed to mere rehashed material . The BBC reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed Halloween . 
 Zombie 's intention was to reinvent Michael Myers because , in his opinion , the character , along with Freddy Krueger , Jason Voorhees and Pinhead , has become more familiar to audiences , and as a result , less scary . The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael Myers ' back story . A deeper back story would add " new life " to the character , as Zombie put it . Michael 's mask will be given its own story , to provide an explanation as to why he wears it , instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store , as in the original film . Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a psychopath really is , and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide . He wants the young Michael to have charisma , which would be projected onto the adult Michael . Zombie has decided that Michael 's motives for returning to Haddonfield should be more ambiguous . As Zombie explains , " was he trying to kill Laurie , or just find her because he loves her ? " 
 Moreover , Michael would not be able to drive in the new film , unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis ' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield . Zombie also wants the Dr. Loomis character to be more intertwined with that of Michael Myers ; Zombie said that the character 's role in the original was " showing up merely to say something dramatic " . Although Zombie has added more history to the Michael Myers character , hence creating more original content for the film , he chose to keep the character 's trademark mask and Carpenter 's theme song intact for his version ( despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched ) . Production officially began on January 29 , 2007 . Shortly before production began , Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael 's signature mask . Zombie commented , " It looks perfect , exactly like the original . Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good " . Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original Halloween . 
 On December 19 , 2006 , Zombie announced to Bloody @-@ Disgusting that Daeg Faerch would play the part of ten @-@ year @-@ old Michael Myers . On December 22 , 2006 , Malcolm McDowell was officially announced to be playing Dr. Loomis . McDowell stated that he wanted a tremendous ego in Loomis , who is out to get a new book from the ordeal . On December 24 , 2006 , Zombie announced that Tyler Mane , who had previously worked with Zombie on The Devil 's Rejects , would portray the adult Michael Myers . Mane stated that it was very difficult to act only with his eyes . Scout Taylor @-@ Compton endured a long audition process , but as director Zombie explains , " Scout was my first choice . There was just something about her ; she had a genuine quality . She didn 't seem actor @-@ y . " She was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after Faerch , Mane , McDowell , Forsythe , and Harris . A contest was held for a walk on role in the film , at the time called Halloween 9 ; it was won by Heather Bowen . She played a news reporter who covered Michael 's arrest but her scene was cut from the film and does not appear in the deleted scenes .

 Approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film , a workprint version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites . Upon hearing of the leaked copy , Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film , unlike what was about to be released in theaters . The leak of Zombie 's workprint led to speculation that the film 's box office success could be damaged , as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film , Hostel : Part II , to the leaking of a workprint version . Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007 . For example , one particular scene — the rape of one of the Smith 's Grove female inmates — was replaced in the final version . Halloween was officially released on August 31 , 2007 , to 3 @,@ 472 theaters in North America , giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films .

 Based on 109 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , Halloween received an average 25 % overall approval rating based on 110 reviews , with the consensus " Rob Zombie doesn 't bring many new ideas to the table in Halloween , making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise . " By comparison , Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , calculated a 47 out of 100 from the 18 reviews it collected . CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was " B @-@ minus " on an A + to F scale ; it also reported that 62 % of the audience was male , with 57 % being 25 years or older . 
 Peter Hartlaub , of the San Francisco Chronicle , felt Zombie was successful in both " [ putting ] his own spin on Halloween , while at the same time paying tribute to Carpenter 's film " ; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost " sympathetic " as a child , but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with Halloween slipping into " slasher @-@ film logic " . Nathan Lee of The Village Voice disagreed in part with <unk> , feeling that Halloween may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers , but that it succeeded in " [ deepening ] Carpenter 's vision without rooting out its fear " . The film critic Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film , which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child , were better played than the remake elements of the second half . In short , Turner stated that performances from the cast were " superb " , with Malcolm McDowell being perfectly cast as Dr. Loomis , but that the film lacked the scare value of Carpenter ’ s original . Jamie Russell from the BBC agreed that the first half of the film worked better than the last half ; she stated that Zombie ’ s expanded backstory on Michael was " surprisingly effective " — also agreeing that McDowell was perfectly cast as Loomis — but that Zombie failed to deliver the " supernatural dread " that Carpenter created for Michael in his 1978 original . 
 New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension , and went more for cheap shocks — focusing more on enhancing the " imagery of violence " — than real attempts to scare the audience ; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five . Dennis Harvey , from Variety magazine , echoed Matthew 's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense ; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next , whereas in Carpenter 's original each teenager had real personalities . In contrast , Rossiter Drake of The Examiner applauded Michael 's backstory , feeling that it was a " compelling take on the mythology " that managed to be " unique " and " shocking " at the same time . In agreement with other critics , Empire magazine 's Kim Newman felt that , because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael , the film " [ fell ] flat " when it came to delivering suspense or anything " remotely scary " ; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the " dogged psychiatrist " . Ben Walter , of Time Out London , felt Zombie added " surprising realism " to the development of Michael Myers ’ psychopathic actions , but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film ’ s " suspense and playfulness " with a convincing display of " black @-@ blooded brutality " . 
 Frank Scheck , of the Hollywood Reporter , believed that even though Zombie 's remake of Carpenter 's Halloween was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original . For Scheck , Zombie replaced Carpenter 's building suspense , which made it so " brilliant " , with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity ; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character . By contrast , TV Guide 's Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a " scary horror movie " , not by copying Carpenter , but by making the film his own . Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper 's " savage , greasy @-@ haired ' 70s " films , which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent " torture porn " horror films . Bill Gibron , of PopMatters , believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter 's film to Zombie 's remake ; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield — with Michael acting as a true " boogeyman " — Zombie focuses more on Michael himself , successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his " desire for death " . 
 Halloween won the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award for Best Film of 2007 , drawing in 550 votes , the most ever in the history of the award . The film also won the ' Best Remake Award ' at the 2008 Spike TV Scream Awards . Dan Mathews , vice president of PETA , sent Rob Zombie a thank @-@ you letter for what he perceived as Zombie sending a message to audiences when he depicted the young Michael Myers torturing animals , something he felt demonstrated that people who commit acts of cruelty to animals are likely to move on to humans . Mathews went on to say , " Hopefully , with the attention focused by your movie on the link between cruelty to animals and human violence , more people will recognize the warning signs among people they know and deal with them more forcefully . We wish you continued success ! "

 The film 's soundtrack was released on August 21 , 2007 ; it includes 24 tracks , consisting of 12 dialogue tracks and 12 instrumentals . The album contained both new tracks , as well as ones recycled from the original Halloween and its sequel . Tyler Bates ' interpretation of John Carpenter 's original Halloween theme is the first musical track , with " ( Don 't Fear ) The Reaper , " which appeared in the original Halloween , and " Mr. Sandman " , which appeared in Halloween II and Halloween H20 : 20 Years Later , performed by Nan Vernon . Writing about its selection from the 1981 film , one reviewer for the BBC commented that it worked well to " mimic Laurie ’ s situation ( sleeping a lot ) " , making " the once innocent sounding lyrics seem threatening in a horror film " . The album also includes Kiss 's " God of Thunder " , Rush 's " Tom Sawyer " , Alice Cooper 's " Only Women Bleed " , Peter Frampton 's " Baby , I Love Your Way " , Nazareth 's " Love Hurts " , Bachman – Turner Overdrive 's " Let It Ride " , Misfits ' " Halloween II " , and an Iggy Pop live version of The Stooges ' " 1969 " among others .

 Backspacer is the ninth studio album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam , released on September 20 , 2009 . The bandmembers started writing instrumental and demo tracks in 2007 , and got together in 2008 to work on an album . It was recorded from February through April 2009 with producer Brendan O 'Brien , who had worked on every Pearl Jam album except their 1991 debut Ten and 2006 's self @-@ titled record — although this was his first production credit since 1998 's Yield . Material was recorded in Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles , California and O 'Brien 's own Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta , Georgia . The music on the album — the shortest of the band 's career — features a sound influenced by pop and new wave . The lyrics have a more optimistic look than the ones in the politic @-@ infused predecessors Riot Act and Pearl Jam , something frontman Eddie Vedder attributed to the election of Barack Obama . 
 The band released the album through their own label Monkeywrench Records with worldwide distribution by Universal Music Group via a licensing agreement with Island Records . Physical copies of the record were sold through Target in North America , and promotion included a deal with Verizon , a world tour , and moderately successful singles " The Fixer " and " Got Some " / " Just Breathe " . Reviews for Backspacer were positive , praising the sound and composition , and the album became Pearl Jam 's first chart topper at the United States ' Billboard 200 since 1996 's No Code , while also topping the charts in Canada , Australia and New Zealand .

 In 2007 , after Pearl Jam 's 2006 tour had ended , the band members began recording demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e @-@ mail . Guitarist Mike McCready revealed at the time that he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well . After the band was invited to record The Who 's " Love , Reign o 'er Me " for the Reign Over Me soundtrack , they opted to call long @-@ time collaborator Brendan O 'Brien to produce their cover . During the experience , O 'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album . This ninth album would mark O 'Brien 's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998 's Yield . The band allowed O 'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer . " At this point , I think we 're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit , " says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder . " In the past , Brendan would say , ' It 's a great song , but I think you should do it in a different key ' , and we 'd say no . But now that we 've heard Bruce [ Springsteen ] has listened to his suggestions , I think we will too . " Bassist Jeff Ament said , " He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn 't , and it really moves things along ... We don 't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren 't even that good . He 's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music , and we 're really , really looking forward to making this record . " 
 The band begun working on the album on May 2008 , making demos in Seattle , Washington before recording sessions at Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles , California , where O 'Brien usually works . Ament said it was " the first time since the first record that we 've really rehearsed instead of just going to the studio with a handful of ideas . " On May the band had " about five ideas that have been worked on " , which were given some instrumental beds later in the summer . Additional demos were put to tape in December , following a trip by all bandmembers but Vedder to Ament 's home in Montana . The singer later proceeded to put rough vocals on those tracks , and also brought in his own material for the band members to work on . 
 In February 2009 , Pearl Jam went for a two @-@ week session at Henson . It was the first time the band spent a considerable amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996 's No Code . McCready said , " [ When ] we got together with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive , we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan ... It was a great idea to get us out of Seattle . You 've gotta get out [ of ] your comfort zone , and we 've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven 't , so we trusted Brendan 's judgment . " In April 2009 , the band went for a two @-@ week session to finish the album with O 'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta , Georgia . The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished , and O 'Brien stated " we had 90 % of the record cut in the first nine days " . 
 The album title was chosen in part because of nostalgia for the historical name of the <unk> key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one 's life . Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters . Vedder said , " Backspacer [ means ] actually you kind of have to go back and look at your mistake . " Gossard said , " There 's some retrospective moods on this record , where Ed is looking at both his past and his future . " The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic 's Great Turtle Race .

 McCready said , " I 'd sum it up as kind of a tight , concise , rock ' n ' roll record with kind of pop or maybe new wave elements to it ... It 's a really quick record , but I like that element to it . I like the sparseness of the songs and the way that Brendan pulled us together and made us play as good as we could . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that " prior to Backspacer , Pearl Jam wouldn 't or couldn 't have made music this unfettered , unapologetically assured , casual , and , yes , fun . " Vedder stated , " The new record feels good so far — really strong and uptempo , stuff we can sink our teeth into " , and added that the band 's live performances inspired the album 's sound : " At one of our gigs , without <unk> and electricity , there 's only so much room for those difficult listening songs . That 's one reason we kept the arrangements lean . " The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer . Gossard said that Backspacer is " what we could have done for the last five records , in terms of re @-@ engaging with the roots of why this band works " , and that " there 's plenty of ballads , too ... and there 's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating — I think this record 's got a chance to sound significantly different . " Ament said , " There 's a couple of great things that Ed brought in that could be real departures for us . Whatever wave Ed caught with [ his soundtrack for ] Into the Wild has taken him to different places . " 
 Lyrically , Backspacer displays a more positive outlook than the band 's last few albums . Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics . Regarding the lyrics , Vedder said , " I 've tried , over the years , to be hopeful in the lyrics , and I think that 's going to be easier now . " Gossard stated , " We 've made a couple of political and pointed records , the last two in particular , and just to move away from that is great , because it allows you to go back to that when you need to and it refreshes everybody , and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that 's important to you . " Vedder stated he did not spend " more than half hour " writing the lyrics to each song : " If it ’ s not gonna happen quick then I don ’ t wanna do it , because it means there ’ s another one out there that is gonna happen quick , and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt . " 
 Vedder called " Gonna See My Friend " a " drug song , " but elaborated that the song is about going to see a friend to stay off drugs , and he stated that " Got Some " is about a " drug dealer , " but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song . " Johnny Guitar " , described by Vedder as " almost an Elvis Costello homage " , had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted on the bathroom wall of the band 's rehearsal space . Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny " Guitar " Watson 's 1979 album , What the Hell Is This ? , and imagined a man who becomes attracted to one of the various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson 's many girlfriends instead of his only one . Vedder described " Just Breathe " as " as close to a love song as we 've ever gotten , " and said that the subject of the song is the happiest times of people 's lives when they should just take in the moment and " breathe for a minute . " He also said that " <unk> Known " concerns the human psyche , and " Supersonic " is about the love for music . According to Vedder , " Speed of Sound " is a song taken from the perspective of a man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left , but he added that even though the song is sad it became more " confident " when played with the whole band . He said " Force of Nature " is " about the strength of one person in the relationship , when they can withstand some of the faults in another . " " The End " has been described as an " aching love song . "

 The artwork for the album was handled by editorial cartoonist Dan Perkins , who goes by the pen name Tom Tomorrow . Perkins spent six months working on the artwork . In 2009 , Village Voice Media , publishers of 16 alternative weeklies , suspended all syndicated cartoons across their entire chain . Perkins lost twelve client papers in cities including Los Angeles , Minneapolis , New York City and Seattle , prompting his friend Vedder to post an open letter on the Pearl Jam website in support of the cartoonist . Perkins referred to the artwork as " dreams and memories , " while Gossard referred to the artwork as a " bizarro <unk> dreamscape . " The album 's cover art features nine images created by Perkins , and was revealed through a contest on the band 's official website . The nine images were hidden on various websites , and the contest asked Internet users to search for the websites containing the images , whereby the images would be placed on a grid on the Pearl Jam website after clicking on them . After finding all of the images , users were rewarded with a demo version of the song " Speed of Sound " . On the cover and spine of the limited edition gatefold sleeve version , the " Backspacer " keys glow in the dark .

" Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times gave the album four out of four stars , describing it as " 11 breakneck rockers and candidly emotional ballads , adding up to barely more than a half hour of optimally toned catharsis " and praising the " lightness and dexterity of the playing " and " Vedder 's hard @-@ driving , often playful vocals " . Rolling Stone staff writer Rob Sheffield gave Backspacer four out of five stars , saying that it contains " the shortest , tightest , <unk> tunes they 've ever banged out , " and that " Eddie Vedder 's heart @-@ on @-@ fire vocals are the main attraction , as always .

" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B , saying that Backspacer is " the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked @-@ leather booths and $ 2 beers , " and that it " grows same @-@ y , but tracks like the surfing @-@ as @-@ life @-@ metaphor anthem ' Amongst the Waves ' do indeed make something old feel , if not new , good again . " The New York Times said that " Pearl Jam ...

Pearl Jam 's music doesn 't align well with satisfaction . " Joshua Love of Pitchfork Media said that the album " seems to suggest in its tossed @-@ off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster , " and he added that " with the spotlights long since extinguished , Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book .

 = Pedro Álvares Cabral = 
 Pedro Álvares Cabral ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] or Brazilian Portuguese : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; c . 1467 or 1468 – c . 1520 ) was a Portuguese nobleman , military commander , navigator and explorer regarded as the discoverer of Brazil . Cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of South America and claimed it for Portugal . While details of Cabral 's early life are unclear , it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education . He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500 , following Vasco da Gama 's newly opened route around Africa . The object of the undertaking was to return with valuable spices and to establish trade relations in India — bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of Arab , Turkish and Italian merchants . Although the previous expedition of Vasco da Gama to India , on its sea route , recorded signs of land west of the southern Atlantic Ocean ( in 1497 ) , Cabral is regarded as the first captain who ever touched four continents , leading the first expedition that united Europe , Africa , America , and Asia . 
 His fleet of 13 ships sailed far into the western Atlantic Ocean , perhaps intentionally , where he made landfall on what he initially assumed to be a large island . As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas , Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown . He explored the coast , realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent , and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory . The continent was South America , and the land he had claimed for Portugal later came to be known as Brazil . The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India . 
 A storm in the southern Atlantic caused the loss of several ships , and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India . Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights , but Arab merchants saw Portugal 's venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt . The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed . Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack . From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin , another Indian city @-@ state , where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe . Despite the loss of human lives and ships , Cabral 's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal . The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown 's finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East . 
 Cabral was later passed over , possibly as a result of a quarrel with Manuel I , when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India . Having lost favor with the King , he retired to a private life of which few records survive . His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years . Decades after Brazil 's independence from Portugal in the 19th century , Cabral 's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil . Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil 's discoverer , and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional . The first question has been settled by the observation that the few , cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil , the sole Portuguese @-@ speaking nation in the Americas . On the second question , no definite consensus has been formed , and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof . Nevertheless , although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers , Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little is certain regarding Pedro Álvares Cabral 's life before , or following , his voyage which led to the discovery of Brazil . He was born in 1467 or 1468 — the former year being the most likely — at Belmonte , about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from present @-@ day Covilhã in central Portugal . He was a son of Fernão Álvares Cabral and Isabel Gouveia — one of five boys and six girls in the family . Cabral was christened Pedro Álvares de Gouveia and only later , supposedly upon his elder brother 's death in 1503 , did he begin using his father 's surname . The coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver . Purple represented fidelity , and the goats were derived from the family name ( <unk> pertains to goats in English ) . However , only his elder brother was entitled to make use of the family arms . 
 Family lore said that the <unk> were descendants of <unk> , the legendary first king of Macedonia . <unk> was , in turn , a supposed 7th @-@ generation scion of the demigod Hercules . Myths aside , the historian James McClymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of Cabral 's family . According to that tradition , the <unk> derive from a Castilian clan named the <unk> ( <unk> is Spanish for goat ) who bore a similar coat of arms . The Cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th century . Álvaro Gil Cabral ( Cabral 's great @-@ great @-@ grandfather and a frontier military commander ) was one of the few Portuguese nobles to remain loyal to Dom João I , King of Portugal during the war against the King of Castile . As a reward , João I presented Álvaro Gil with the hereditary fiefdom of Belmonte . 
 Raised as a member of the lower nobility , Cabral was sent to the court of King Dom Afonso V in 1479 at around age 12 . He received an education in the humanities and learned to bear arms and fight . He would have been roughly age 17 on 30 June 1484 when he was named <unk> fidalgo ( young nobleman ; a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles ) by King Dom João II . Records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary , but Cabral may have campaigned in North Africa , as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day . King Dom Manuel I , who had acceded to the throne two years previously , awarded him an annual allowance worth 30 @,@ 000 reais on 12 April 1497 . He was concurrently given the title fidalgo ( nobleman ) in the King 's Council and was named a Knight of the Order of Christ . There is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of Cabral . It is known that he had a strong build and matched his father 's height of 1 @.@ 90 meters ( 6 ft 2 @.@ 8 in ) . Cabral 's character has been described as well @-@ learned , courteous , prudent , generous , tolerant with enemies , humble , but also vain and too concerned with the respect he felt his honor and position demanded .

 = = = Fleet commander @-@ in @-@ chief = = = 
 On 15 February 1500 , Cabral was appointed <unk> @-@ mor ( literally Major @-@ Captain , or commander @-@ in @-@ chief ) of a fleet sailing for India . It was then the custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands , regardless of experience or professional competence . This was the case for the captains of the ships under Cabral 's command — most were nobles like himself . The practice had obvious pitfalls , since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro . 
 Scant details have survived regarding the criteria used by the Portuguese government in its selection of Cabral as head of the India expedition . In the royal decree naming him commander @-@ in @-@ chief , the only reasons given are " merits and services " . Nothing more is known about these qualifications . Historian William Greenlee argued that King Manuel I " had undoubtedly known him well at court " . That , along with the " standing of the Cabral family , their unquestioned loyalty to the Crown , the personal appearance of Cabral , and the ability which he had shown at court and in the council were important factors " . Also in his favor may have been the influence of two of his brothers who sat on the King 's Council . Given the political intrigue present at court , Cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment . The historian <unk> <unk> subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of Cabral " was a deliberate attempt to balance the interests of rival factions of noble families , for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major expeditions . " 
 Cabral became the military chief , while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters . The most important of these were Bartolomeu Dias , Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho . They would , along with the other captains , command 13 ships and 1 @,@ 500 men . Of this contingent , 700 were soldiers , although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat . 
 The fleet had two divisions . The first division was composed of nine <unk> ( carracks ) and two round caravels , and was headed to Calicut ( today more often known as Kozhikode ) in India with the goal of establishing trade relations and a factory ( trading post ) . The second division , consisting of one nau and one round caravel , set sail for the port of Sofala in what is today Mozambique . In exchange for leading the fleet , Cabral was entitled to 10 @,@ 000 <unk> ( an old Portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35 kg of gold ) and the right to purchase 30 tonnes ( 33 short tons ; 30 long tons ) of pepper at his own expense for transport back to Europe . The pepper could then be resold , tax @-@ free , to the Portuguese Crown . He was also allowed to import 10 boxes of any other kind of spice , duty @-@ free . Although the voyage was extremely hazardous , Cabral had the prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to Portugal with the cargo . Spices were then rare in Europe and keenly sought @-@ after . 
 An earlier fleet had been the first to reach India by circumnavigating Africa . That expedition had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499 . For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East , in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was under the control of the Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire . Portugal 's expansionism would lead first to a route to India , and later to worldwide colonization . A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration . There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims , which stemmed from Portugal 's fight for nationhood against the Moors . The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent . An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical Prester John — a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged . Finally , the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold , and India 's spice trade . 
 = = = Departure and arrival in a new land = = = 
 The fleet under the command of the 32 – 33 @-@ year old Cabral departed from Lisbon on 9 March 1500 at noon . The previous day it had been given a public send @-@ off which included a Mass and celebrations attended by the King , his court and a huge crowd . On the morning of 14 March , the flotilla passed Gran Canaria , in the Canary Islands . It sailed onward to Cape Verde , a Portuguese colony situated on the West African coast , which was reached on 22 March . The next day , a nau commanded by Vasco de Ataíde with 150 men disappeared without a trace . The fleet crossed the Equator on 9 April , and sailed westward as far as possible from the African continent in what was known as the volta do mar ( literally " turn of the sea " ) navigational technique . Seaweed was sighted on 21 April , which led the sailors to believe that they were nearing the coast . They were proven correct the next afternoon , Wednesday 22 April 1500 , when the fleet anchored near what Cabral christened the Monte <unk> ( " Easter Mount " , it being the week of Easter ) . The spot is on the northeast coast of present @-@ day Brazil . 
 The Portuguese detected inhabitants on the shore , and all ships ' captains gathered aboard Cabral 's lead ship on 23 April . Cabral ordered Nicolau Coelho , a captain who had experience from Vasco da Gama 's voyage to India , to go ashore and make contact . He set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous people . After Coelho returned , Cabral took the fleet north , where after traveling 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) along the coast , it anchored on 24 April in what the commander @-@ in @-@ chief named Porto <unk> ( Safe Port ) . The place was a natural harbor , and Afonso Lopes ( pilot of the lead ship ) brought two natives aboard to confer with Cabral . 
 As in the first contact , the meeting was friendly and Cabral presented the locals with gifts . The inhabitants were stone age hunter @-@ gatherers , to whom the Europeans assigned the generic label " Indians " . The men collected food by stalking game , fishing and foraging , while the women engaged in small @-@ scale farming . They were divided into countless rival tribes . The tribe which Cabral met was the <unk> . Some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentary — having a knowledge of fire but not metalworking . A few tribes engaged in cannibalism . On 26 April , as more and more curious and friendly natives appeared , Cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a Christian Mass was held — the first celebrated on the soil of what would later become Brazil . He , along with the ships ' crews , participated . 
 The following days were spent stockpiling water , food , wood and other provisions . The Portuguese also built a massive — perhaps 7 metres ( 23 ft ) long — wooden cross . Cabral ascertained that the new land lay east of the demarcation line between Portugal and Spain that had been specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas . The territory was thus within the sphere allotted to Portugal . To <unk> Portugal 's claim to the land , the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service held on 1 May . In honor of the cross , Cabral named the newly discovered land Ilha de Vera Cruz ( Island of the True Cross ) . The next day a supply ship under the command of either Gaspar de Lemos or André Gonçalves ( the sources conflict on who was sent ) returned to Portugal to apprise the King of the discovery .

 The fleet resumed its voyage on either 2 or 3 May 1500 and sailed along the east coast of South America . Cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent , rather than an island . Around 5 May , the fleet veered eastwards towards Africa . On 23 or 24 May they encountered a storm in the South Atlantic 's high @-@ pressure zone , resulting in the loss of four ships . The exact location of the disaster is unknown — speculations range from near the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of the African continent to " within sight of the South American coast " . Three <unk> and a caravel commanded by Bartolomeu Dias — the first European to reach the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 — foundered , and 380 men were lost . 
 The remaining vessels , hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging , were separated . One ship that had been separated , commanded by Diogo Dias , wandered onward alone , and the other six ships were able to regroup . They gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each , and Cabral 's group sailed east , past the Cape of Good Hope . Fixing their position and sighting land , they turned north and landed somewhere in the <unk> and <unk> Archipelago , off East Africa and north of Sofala . The main fleet remained near Sofala ten days undergoing repairs . The expedition then went north , and on 26 May reached Kilwa Kisiwani , where Cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its king . 
 From Kilwa Kisiwani , the fleet departed to Malindi , which was reached on 2 August . Cabral met with its king , with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts . Pilots were recruited at Malindi for the last leg to India and the fleet set sail . Land was reached at <unk> , an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to Calicut . Here the ships were beached , recaulked and painted . Final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of Calicut . 
 = = = Massacre in Calicut = = = 
 The fleet departed <unk> and arrived in Calicut on 13 September . Cabral successfully negotiated with the Zamorin ( the title of the ruler of Calicut ) and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse . In hopes of further improving relations , Cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the Zamorin 's request . However , on 16 or 17 December , the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 ( according to other accounts , perhaps as many as several thousand ) Muslim Arabs and Hindu Indians . Despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen , more than 50 Portuguese were killed . The remaining defenders retreated to the ships , some by swimming . Thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous Arab merchants , Cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from the ruler of Calicut , but no apology was forthcoming . 
 The Portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 Arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor . Around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire . Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement . The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims , which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa . Moreover , the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish . The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices . The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade . The letter from King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut , which was translated by the ruler 's Arab interpreters , sought the exclusion of Arab traders . The Muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods , and attempted to sway the Hindu ruler against the Portuguese . The Portuguese and Arabs were extremely suspicious of each other 's every action . 
 Historian William Greenlee has argued that the Portuguese realized that " they were few in numbers and that those who would come to India in the future fleets would always be at numerical <unk> ; so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the Portuguese would be feared and respected in the future . It was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end . " Thus , they created a precedent for European behavior in Asia during the following centuries . 
 = = = Return to Europe = = = 
 Warnings in reports from Vasco da Gama 's voyage to India had prompted King Manuel I to brief Cabral regarding another port to the south of Calicut where he could also trade . This city was Kochi and the fleet set sail , reaching it on 24 December . Kochi was nominally a vassal of Calicut , as well as being dominated by other Indian cities . Kochi was eager to achieve independence , and the Portuguese were willing to exploit Indian disunity — as the British would three hundred years later . This tactic eventually ensured Portuguese hegemony over the region . Cabral forged an alliance with Kochi 's ruler , as well with rulers of other Indian cities , and was able to establish a factory . At last , loaded with precious spices , the fleet went to Kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to Portugal on 16 January 1501 . 
 The expedition headed for the east coast of Africa . One of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder . As there was no space in the other ships , its cargo was lost and Cabral ordered the carrack to be set on fire . The fleet then proceeded to the Island of Mozambique ( northeast of Sofala ) , in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the Cape of Good Hope . One caravel was sent to Sofala — another of the expedition 's goals . A second caravel , considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by Nicolau Coelho , was sent ahead to give the King advance notice of the voyage 's success . A third vessel , commanded by Pedro de Ataíde , became separated from the fleet after leaving Mozambique . 
 On 22 May , the fleet — now reduced to only two ships — rounded the Cape of Good Hope . They arrived in Beseguiche ( present @-@ day Dakar , located near Cape Verde ) on 2 June . There they found not only Nicolau Coelho 's caravel but also the nau captained by Diogo Dias — which had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the South Atlantic . The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard — one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades . Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche . After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of present @-@ day Brazil , he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it . One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci ( for whom the Americas would be named ) , who told Cabral of his exploration , confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island . 
 Nicolau Coelho 's caravel departed first from Beseguiche and arrived in Portugal on 23 June 1501 . Cabral stayed behind , waiting for Pedro de Ataíde 's missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to Sofala . Both eventually appeared and Cabral arrived in Portugal on 21 July 1501 , with the other vessels coming home during the following days . In all , two ships returned empty , five were fully loaded and six were lost . Nonetheless , the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800 % profit to the Portuguese Crown . Once sold , the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet , covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost , and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those costs . " Undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained " , asserts historian James McClymont , when Cabral " reached the East African coast , pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like courage . " " Few voyages to Brazil and India were so well executed as Cabral 's " , affirmed historian Bailey Diffie , which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement " of a Portuguese seagoing empire from Africa to the far East " , and eventually to " a land empire in Brazil " . 
 = = Later years and death = = 
 Upon Cabral 's return , King Manuel I began planning another fleet to make the journey to India and to avenge the Portuguese losses in Calicut . Cabral was selected to command this " Revenge Fleet " , as it was called . For eight months Cabral made all preparations , but for reasons which remain uncertain , he was relieved of command . It had apparently been proposed to give another navigator , Vicente Sodré , independent command over a section of the fleet , and Cabral strongly opposed this . Whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command , the result was that when the fleet departed in March 1502 , its commander was Vasco da Gama — a maternal nephew of Vicente Sodré — and not Cabral . It is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da Gama and another supporting Cabral . At some point , Cabral left the court permanently . The King was greatly irritated by the feud , to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment , as it did for one of da Gama 's supporters . 
 Despite the loss of favor with Manuel I , Cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503 to Dona ( Lady ) Isabel de Castro , a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of King Dom Fernando I of Portugal . Her mother was a sister of Afonso de Albuquerque , one of the greatest Portuguese military leaders during the Age of Discovery . The couple had at least four children : two boys ( Fernão Álvares Cabral and António Cabral ) and two girls ( Catarina de Castro and Guiomar de Castro ) . There were two additional daughters named Isabel and Leonor according to other sources , which also say that Guiomar , Isabel and Leonor joined religious orders . Afonso de Albuquerque attempted to intercede on Cabral 's behalf and on 2 December 1514 asked Manuel I to forgive him and allow his return to court , but to no avail . 
 Suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor ( possibly malaria ) since his voyage , Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509 . He spent his remaining years there . Only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time . According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509 , Cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him . Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service . In 1518 , or perhaps previously , he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the King 's Council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2 @,@ 437 reais . This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497 , and still being paid . Cabral died of unspecified causes , most probably in 1520 . He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the Convento da Graça in Santarém .

 The first permanent Portuguese settlement in the land which would become Brazil was São Vicente , which was established in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa . As the years passed , the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward , conquering more lands from both indigenous Americans and the Spanish . Brazil had secured most of its present @-@ day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal as the most important part of its far @-@ flung maritime Empire . On 7 September 1822 , the heir of Portuguese King Dom João VI secured the independence of Brazil from Portugal and , as Dom Pedro I , became its first Emperor . 
 Cabral 's discovery , and even his resting place in the land of his birth , had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition . This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II , successor and son of Pedro I , sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral 's life and expedition through the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute . This was part of the Emperor 's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil 's diverse citizenry — giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique Portuguese @-@ speaking empire , surrounded by Hispanic @-@ American Republics . The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery , in 1839 , of his resting place by the Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen ( later Viscount of Porto <unk> ) . The completely neglected state in which Cabral 's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal — the latter then ruled by Pedro II 's eldest sister , Maria II . 
 In 1871 the Brazilian Emperor — then on a trip to Europe — visited Cabral 's gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study , which was carried out in 1882 . In a second exhumation during 1896 , an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed . Although his remains still lay in Portugal , the urn was eventually brought to the old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on 30 December 1903 . Cabral has since become a national hero in Brazil . In Portugal , however , he has been much overshadowed by his rival Vasco da Gama . Historian William Greenlee argued that Cabral 's exploration is important " not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period . " Though he acknowledges that few voyages have " been of greater importance to posterity " , he also says that " few have been less appreciated in their time . " Nevertheless , historian James McClymont affirmed that " Cabral 's position in the history of Portuguese conquest and discovery is <unk> despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate men . " He concluded that Cabral " will always be remembered in history as the chief , if not the first discoverer of Brazil . " 
 = = = Intentional discovery hypothesis = = = 
 A controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether Cabral 's discovery was by chance or intentional . If the latter , that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west . The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute , when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional . 
 Until the 1854 conference , the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident . Early works on the subject supported this view , including História do <unk> e Conquista da Índia ( History of the Discovery and Conquest of India , published in 1541 ) by Fernão Lopes de <unk> , Décadas da <unk> ( Decades of Asia , 1552 ) by João de Barros , <unk> do <unk> Rei D. Manuel ( Chronicles of the most fortunate D. Manuel , 1558 ) by Damião de Góis , <unk> da Índia ( Legends of India , 1561 ) by Gaspar Correia , História do Brasil ( History of Brazil , 1627 ) by friar Vicente do Salvador and História da América Portuguesa ( History of Portuguese America , 1730 ) by Sebastião da Rocha Pita . 
 The first work to advocate the idea of intentionality was published in 1854 by Joaquim <unk> de Sousa e Silva , after Pedro II had opened the debate . Since then , several scholars have subscribed to that view , including Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen , Capistrano de Abreu , Pedro Calmon , Fábio Ramos and Mário Barata . Historian Hélio Vianna affirmed that " although there are signs of the intentionality " in Cabral 's discovery , " based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands at the edge of the South Atlantic " , there are no irrefutable proofs to support it . This opinion is also shared by historian Thomas Skidmore . The debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered " irrelevant " by historian Charles R. Boxer . Historian Anthony Smith concludes that the conflicting contentions will " probably never be resolved " . 
 = = = Forerunners = = = 
 Cabral was not the first European to stumble upon areas of present @-@ day Brazil , not to mention other parts of South America . Roman coins have been found in today 's Venezuela , northwest of Brazil , presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times . Norsemen reached North America and even established settlements , though these ended in failure sometime before the end of the 15th century . Christopher Columbus , on his third voyage to the New World in 1498 , traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela . 
 In the case of Brazil , it was once considered probable that the Portuguese navigator Duarte Pacheco Pereira had made a voyage to the Brazilian coast in 1498 . This belief has since been dismissed , however , and it is now thought that he voyaged to North America instead . There is more certain evidence that two Spaniards , Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Diego de Lepe , traveled along the northern coast of Brazil between January and March 1500 . Pinzón went from what is today Fortaleza ( capital of the Brazilian state of Ceará ) to the mouth of the Amazon River . There he encountered another Spanish expedition led by Lepe , which would reach as far as the <unk> River in March . The reason Cabral is credited with having discovered Brazil , rather than the Spanish explorers , is because the visits by Pinzón and Lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact . Historians Capistrano de Abreu , Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen , Mário Barata and Hélio Vianna concur that the Spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only Portuguese @-@ speaking nation in the Americas — with a unique history , culture and society which sets it apart from the Hispanic @-@ American societies which dominate the rest of the continent .

 Dexter 's Laboratory ( commonly abbreviated as Dexter 's Lab ) is an American comic science fiction animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network , and the first of the network 's Cartoon Cartoons . The series follows Dexter , a boy @-@ genius and inventor with a secret laboratory , who constantly battles his sister Dee Dee in an attempt to keep her out of the lab . He also engages in a bitter rivalry with his neighbor and fellow @-@ genius Mandark . The first two seasons contained additional segments : Dial M for Monkey , which focuses on Dexter 's pet lab @-@ monkey / superhero , and The Justice Friends , about a trio of superheroes who share an apartment . 
 Tartakovsky pitched the series to Hanna @-@ Barbera 's animated shorts showcase What a Cartoon ! , basing it on student films he produced while attending the California Institute of the Arts . A pilot aired on Cartoon Network in February 1995 and another pilot also aired on the network in March 1996 ; viewer approval ratings convinced Cartoon Network to order a half @-@ hour series , which premiered on April 28 , 1996 . On December 10 , 1999 , a television movie titled Dexter 's Laboratory : Ego Trip aired as the intended series finale , and Tartakovsky left to begin work on his new series , Samurai Jack . However , in 2001 , the network revived the series under a different production team at Cartoon Network Studios . It ended on November 20 , 2003 , with a total of four seasons and 78 episodes . 
 Dexter 's Laboratory received high ratings and became one of Cartoon Network 's most popular and successful original series . During its run , the series won three Annie Awards , with nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards , four Golden Reel Awards , and nine additional Annie Awards . The series is notable for helping launch the careers of several cartoonists , such as Craig McCracken , Seth MacFarlane , Butch Hartman , and Rob Renzetti . Spin @-@ off media include comic books , DVD and VHS releases , music albums , collectible toys , and video games . 
 = = Premise = = 
 The series revolves around Dexter ( voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1 – 3 ; Candi Milo in seasons 3 – 4 ) , a bespectacled boy @-@ genius who possesses a secret laboratory hidden behind a bookcase in his bedroom . The laboratory is filled with Dexter 's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on Dexter 's bookshelf ( e.g. pulling out a specific book ) . Though highly intelligent , Dexter often fails at what he has set out to do when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices . Although he comes from a typical all @-@ American family , Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin . Cavanaugh described it as " an affectation , some kind of accent , we 're not quite sure . A small Peter Lorre , but not . Perhaps he 's Latino , perhaps he 's French . He 's a scientist ; he knows he needs some kind of accent . " Genndy Tartakovsky explained , " He considers himself a very serious scientist , and all well @-@ known scientists have accents . " 
 Dexter manages to keep the lab a secret from his clueless , cheerful Mom ( Kath Soucie ) and Dad ( Jeff Bennett ) , who never take notice of it . However , he is frequently in conflict with his hyperactive older sister , Dee Dee ( Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3 ; Kathryn Cressida in seasons 2 and 4 ) . In spite of Dexter 's advanced technology , Dee Dee eludes all manner of security , and once inside her brother 's laboratory , she delights in playing haphazardly , often wreaking havoc with his inventions . Though seemingly dim @-@ witted , Dee Dee often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice . For his part , Dexter , though annoyed by his intrusive sibling , feels a reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled . 
 Dexter 's nemesis is a rival boy @-@ genius from his school named Susan " Mandark " <unk> ( Eddie Deezen ) . Just like Dexter , Mandark also has his own laboratory , but his schemes are generally evil and designed to gain power while downplaying or destroying Dexter 's accomplishments . In the revival seasons , Mandark becomes significantly more evil , becoming Dexter 's enemy rather than his rival and his laboratory changing from brightly @-@ lit with rounded features to gothic @-@ looking , industrial , and angular . Because Dexter 's inventions are often better than his , Mandark tries to make up for this by stealing Dexter 's plans . Mandark 's weakness is his love for Dee Dee , though she ignores him and never returns his affections . 
 = = = Recurring segments = = = 
 Almost every episode of Dexter 's Laboratory is divided into three different stories / segments , each one being approximately 8 minutes in length . Occasionally , the middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter 's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family . Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season : Dial M for Monkey and The Justice Friends . Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season one , and The Justice Friends took its place for the rest of the season . 
 The Dial M for Monkey shorts feature Dexter 's pet laboratory monkey , Monkey ( Frank Welker ) , whom Dexter believes is an ordinary monkey and nothing more . However , Monkey secretly has superpowers and fights evil as the superhero Monkey . Monkey is joined by his partner Agent Honeydew ( Kath Soucie ) , the Commander General ( Robert Ridgely ; Earl Boen ) , and a team of assembled superheroes . Dial M for Monkey was created by Genndy Tartakovsky , Craig McCracken , and Paul Rudish . 
 The Justice Friends consists of Major Glory ( Rob Paulsen ) , <unk> ( Tom Kenny ) , and the <unk> Krunk ( Frank Welker ) , three superheroes who are all roommates living in an apartment complex called Muscular Arms . Most of the trio 's adventures deal less with their lives as superheroes and more with their inability to get along as roommates ; it is presented as a sitcom , including a laugh track . Genndy Tartakovsky 's inspiration for The Justice Friends came from reading Marvel Comics when he was learning how to speak English . Tartakovsky stated in an interview with IGN that he was somewhat disappointed with how The Justice Friends turned out , saying , " it could have been funnier and the characters could have been fleshed out more . " 
 Between the three main segments in seasons one and two are brief mini @-@ segments , many of which feature only Dexter and Dee Dee . Other characters from the series may star in them also , such as " The Puppet Pals " , two live @-@ action puppets named Puppet Pal Mitch ( Rob Paulsen ) and Puppet Pal Clem ( Tom Kenny ) .

 Dexter 's Laboratory was inspired by one of Genndy Tartakovsky 's drawings of a ballerina . After drawing Dee Dee 's tall , thin shape , he decided to pair her with a short and blocky opposite , Dexter , inspired by Tartakovsky 's older brother Alex . After enrolling at the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 to study animation , Tartakovsky wrote , directed , animated , and produced two short films that would become the basis for the series . 
 Dexter 's Laboratory was then made into a seven @-@ minute pilot as a part of Cartoon Network 's What a Cartoon ! project , promoted as World Premiere Toons , which debuted on February 26 , 1995 . Viewers worldwide voted through phone lines , the Internet , focus groups , and consumer promotions for their favorite short cartoons ; the first of 16 animated shorts to earn that vote of approval was Dexter 's Laboratory . Mike Lazzo , then @-@ head of programming for the network , said that it was his favorite of the 48 shorts , commenting " We all loved the humor in brother @-@ versus @-@ sister relationship " . In August 1995 , Turner ordered six half @-@ hours of the series , which would include two cartoons around one spin @-@ off segment titled Dial M for Monkey . 
 = = = Original run = = = 
 Dexter 's Laboratory premiered as a half @-@ hour series on TNT on April 27 , 1996 , and on April 28 on Cartoon Network and TBS <unk> . The series , along with Cow and Chicken , Johnny Bravo , The Powerpuff Girls , and Courage the Cowardly Dog , became responsible for pushing Cartoon Network in a new direction focusing on original programming and " character @-@ driven " cartoons . A second season was ordered , and premiered on Cartoon Network on July 16 , 1997 . 
 Dexter 's Laboratory ended its initial run in 1998 after two seasons , with the second season lasting 39 episodes ; a notable record for a single TV production season on Cartoon Network . The initial series finale was " Last But Not Beast " , which differed from the format of the other episodes in that it was not a collection of cartoon shorts , but was a single 25 @-@ minute episode . 
 In 1999 , Tartakovsky returned to direct Dexter 's Laboratory : Ego Trip , an hour @-@ long television movie . This was the last Dexter 's Laboratory production that Tartakovsky was involved with and was originally intended to be the conclusion to the series . The special was hand @-@ animated , though the character and setting designs were subtly revised . The plot follows Dexter on a quest through time as he finds out his future triumphs . 
 = = = Revival = = = 
 After the series ended , Tartakovsky began work on his new projects , Samurai Jack and Star Wars : Clone Wars . MacFarlane and Hartman had left Time Warner altogether at this point , focusing on Family Guy and The Fairly OddParents , respectively . 
 On February 21 , 2001 , Cartoon Network announced Dexter 's Laboratory had been revived for a 13 @-@ episode third season . The series was given a new production team at Cartoon Network Studios , with Chris Savino taking over as the creative director in Tartakovsky 's absence . Later in season four , Savino was also promoted to producer giving him further control over the show , such as the budget . The revival episodes featured revised visual designs and sound effects , recast voice actors , continuity <unk> , and the transition from traditional cel animation , which was used in the first two seasons and " Ego Trip " , to digital ink and paint , which was used permanently beginning with the third season <unk> ; entitled " Streaky Clean , which aired in 2001 , when many other programs made the switchover to digital coloring .

 Christine Cavanaugh voiced Dexter for the first two seasons and early episodes of the third , but retired from voice acting in 2001 for personal reasons . She was replaced by Candi Milo . 
 Allison Moore , a college friend of Tartakovsky , was cast as Dee Dee . She left the show after the first season because she was no longer interested in voice acting . The role was subsequently recast with Kathryn Cressida . In season three , Moore briefly returned as Dee Dee 's voice before Cressida once again assumed the role for season four . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 The series was animated in a stylized way , which Tartakovsky says was influenced by the Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University . Dexter 's Laboratory , however , was staged in a cinematic way , rather than flat and close to the screen , to leave space and depth for the action and gags . Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons , Hanna @-@ Barbera , Japanese mecha anime , and the UPA shorts . 
 Tartakovsky has said the character Dexter was designed " as an icon " — his body is short and squat and his design is simple , with a black outline and relatively little detail . Since he knew that he was designing the show for television , he purposely limited the design to a certain degree , designing the nose and mouth , for instance , in a Hanna @-@ Barbera style to animate easily . 
 = = Episodes = = 
 Dexter 's Laboratory broadcast 78 half @-@ hour episodes over 4 seasons during its 7 @-@ year run . Two pilot shorts were produced for What a Cartoon ! that aired from 1995 to 1996 , and were reconnected into the series ' first season in later airings . Fifty @-@ two episodes were produced over the original run from 1996 to 1998 , which was followed by the TV movie Ego Trip in 1999 . 
 An additional 26 episodes were produced and broadcast from 2001 to 2003 . The short " Chicken Scratch " debuted theatrically with The Powerpuff Girls Movie in 2002 , and was later broadcast as a segment in the series ' fourth and final season .

 After the series ended , reruns continued to air prominently on Cartoon Network from November 21 , 2003 , to July 29 , 2005 . From September 12 , 2005 , to June 1 , 2008 , it was reran in segments on The Cartoon Cartoon Show , along with other Cartoon Cartoons from that era . On March 30 , 2012 , the series returned to the network in reruns on the revived block , Cartoon Planet . 
 On January 16 , 2006 , the series began airing in reruns on Cartoon Network 's sister channel Boomerang ; the occasion was marked by a 12 @-@ hour Martin Luther King , Jr . Day marathon . Reruns of the series have been removed from Boomerang on January 4 , 2015 before the rebrand , but returned on June 27 , 2016 . 
 The Canadian version of Cartoon Network airs reruns as well , with the series being featured on the channel 's launch on July 4 , 2012 . The launch was commemorated by parent network Teletoon , which aired Cartoon Network @-@ related programming blocks and promotions in the weeks leading up to the event , including episodes of Dexter 's Laboratory . 
 = = = Controversial episodes = = = 
 The segment " Dial M for Monkey : <unk> " ( season one , 1996 ) was removed from rotation after a few years of being broadcast in the United States for two reasons . First , the short features a character named the Silver Spooner ( a spoof of the Silver Surfer ) , which was perceived by Cartoon Network as a stereotype of gay men . Second , Krunk appears to become drunk , has a hangover , and vomits off @-@ camera . In later broadcasts and on the Season One DVD ( Region 1 ) , the banned segment has been replaced with " Dexter 's Lab : A Story " , an episode from season two . 
 During the initial run of Dexter 's Lab , a segment titled " Rude Removal " ( season two , 1997 ) was produced . The short involves Dexter creating a " rude removal system " to diminish Dee Dee and Dexter 's rudeness ; however , it instead creates highly rude clones of both siblings . The episode was only shown during certain animation festivals and was never aired on Cartoon Network or any television channel due to the characters swearing , even though the swear words were censored . Tartakovsky commented that " standards didn 't like it . " Linda Simensky , then @-@ vice president of original programming for Cartoon Network , said " I still think it 's very funny . It probably would air better late at night . " Fred Seibert , president of Hanna @-@ Barbera Cartoons from 1992 to 1996 , has attested to the existence of the short . 
 In October 2012 , Genndy Tartakovsky was asked about the episode during an AMA on Reddit , and he replied " Next time I do a public appearance I 'll bring it with me ! " . Adult Swim later asked fans on Twitter if there was still any interest in the episode , and the response was " overwhelming " . The episode was finally uploaded on <unk> via YouTube on January 22 , 2013 .

 = Roslin Castle = 
 Roslin Castle ( sometimes spelt Rosslyn ) is a partially ruined castle near the village of Roslin in Midlothian , Scotland . It is located around 9 miles south of Edinburgh , on the north bank of the North Esk , only a few hundred metres from the famous Rosslyn Chapel . 
 There has been a castle on the site since the early 14th century , when the Sinclair family , Earls of Caithness and Barons of Roslin , fortified the site , although the present ruins are of slightly later date . Following destruction during the War of the Rough Wooing of 1544 , the castle was rebuilt . This structure , built into the cliffs of Roslin Glen , has remained at least partially habitable ever since . The castle is accessed via a high bridge , which replaced an earlier drawbridge . Roslin was renovated in the 1980s and now serves as holiday accommodation . 
 = = History = = 
 The first castle was built in either the late 14th or in early 15th century , perhaps begun by Henry Sinclair , Earl of Orkney , Baron of Roslin ( c . 1345 – 1400 ) . The Sinclair , or St Clare , family were of French origin , and have held Roslin since 1280 . The castle was built on a rocky promontory near the site of the Battle of Roslin , where the Scots defeated the English in 1303 . Henry 's son Henry , 2nd Earl of Orkney ( c . 1375 @-@ 1422 ) built a new rectangular , round @-@ cornered keep at the south @-@ west corner . The courtyard was entered via a drawbridge over an artificial ditch , giving access to a <unk> in the small north range . 
 The castle contained a scriptorium during the 15th century , and five St Clair manuscripts , dating back to 1488 , are in the National Library of Scotland . These include the Rosslyn @-@ Hay manuscript , believed to be the earliest extant work in Scots prose . The castle was damaged by a domestic fire in 1452 . Legend has it that during the domestic fire the Earl was in consternation because of his valuable manuscripts but they were lowered to safety from a window by his chaplain . 
 Roslin was more severely damaged by the Earl of Hertford , who burned the castle during the War of the Rough Wooing in 1544 . The keep was almost totally destroyed , although its one remaining ruined wall can still be seen . 
 The castle was rebuilt in the late 16th century . A new five @-@ storey east range was built into the side of the rock , and the gatehouse was rebuilt , this time with a permanent stone bridge . The upper part of the east range was renovated in 1622 , with renaissance details and carving to door and window surrounds . Roslin suffered again from the artillery of Cromwell ’ s commander in Scotland , General Monck , in 1650 . It was further damaged by a Reforming mob in 1688 . By the 18th century the structure was dilapidated , though part of the east range has always remained habitable . 
 James Erskine inherited the Rosslyn and Dysart estates in 1789 , from his cousin James Paterson St Clair , upon which he adopted the surname of St Clair @-@ Erskine . In 1805 , he inherited the title of Earl of Rosslyn ( created 1801 for Alexander Wedderburn ) ; since that date , the Rosslyn estate has been in possession of the Earl of Rosslyn . 
 From 1982 to 1988 the east range was restored by architects Simpson and Brown . The current owner , the Earl of Rosslyn , a descendant of the Sinclairs , leases the castle as holiday accommodation via the Landmark Trust . The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument , and a Category A listed building .

 The castle stands precipitously above a loop of the River North Esk , which protects it on three sides . This rocky promontory was breached on the north side to form a ditch giving further protection . The castle is approached from Roslin across this ditch , via a precipitous bridge and through the ruined gatehouse . 
 = = = Ruins = = = 
 The remains of the gatehouse and north range comprise only fragments of walls and one side of the entrance arch , with the remains of a bartizan above . Along the west side of the castle , the 15th @-@ century curtain wall remains standing to a considerable height . This section of wall has six openings at the base , one of which served as a postern gate . On the outer face , the six bays are divided by rounded buttresses . Old sketches of Roslin show bartizans above each of these buttresses , with a wall @-@ walk connecting them . 
 To the south of this wall is the remaining wall of the keep . The mound beneath is formed from the collapsed remnants of the other three walls . The ruin suggests that the keep was around 16m by 12m , with walls <unk> thick rising to a machicolated parapet . 
 = = = East range = = = 
 The restored east range measures around 31m by 10m , with a pitched roof and crow @-@ step gables . It is entered through a richly carved doorway , dated 1622 and initialled <unk> for Sir William Sinclair , which gives access to the third floor . The three lower floors are cut into the rock , and each has four vaulted rooms , with a fifth in the south @-@ east tower . These lower levels were used for service rooms , with the principal rooms in the two upper floors . At the lowest level was a kitchen , with a bakehouse above . On the exterior , gunloops are found on the south wall , with several shot @-@ holes on the east . 
 All five floors are connected by a central scale @-@ and @-@ <unk> staircase , added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south @-@ west . The rooms of the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings . The main hall , in the south part of the block , has been divided , but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE , for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone , and the date 1597 .

 Roslin Castle is one of the places featuring in Sir Walter Scott 's poem <unk> . A ballad named Roslin Castle was written in the 18th century by Richard Hewitt of Cumberland , the lyrics and music of which are recorded in volume one of the Scots Musical Museum collection of Scottish songs . The castle was also used as a location for Ron Howard 's film adaptation of Dan Brown 's book , The Da Vinci Code .

 Even the Stars Look Lonesome is Maya Angelou 's second book of essays . Stars , together with her first book of essays Wouldn 't Take Nothing for My Journey Now ( 1993 ) , is one of the volumes writer Hilton Als called Angelou 's " wisdom books " and " homilies strung together with autobiographical texts " , published during the long period between her fifth and sixth autobiographies , All God 's Children Need Traveling Shoes ( 1986 ) and A Song Flung Up to Heaven ( 2002 ) . She had published several volumes of poetry , including Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ( 1971 ) , which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize . She had recited her poem On the Pulse of Morning at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993 , making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy 's inauguration in 1961 . In 1997 , when Stars was published , The Heart of a Woman ( 1981 ) , Angelou 's fourth installment of her series of autobiographies , was chosen as an Oprah 's Book Club selection , helping it become a bestseller and increasing its total printing to over one million copies , 16 years after its publication . Also in 1997 , Angelou was in the middle of accomplishing her long @-@ standing goal : becoming the first African @-@ American woman to direct a major motion picture , Down in the Delta . 
 By the time Stars was published , Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women . She was , as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated , " without a doubt ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " . She had also become , as reviewer Richard Long stated , " a major autobiographical voice of the time " . Angelou was one of the first African @-@ American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life , and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books . Writer Julian Mayfield , who called her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings " a work of art that eludes description " , stated that Angelou 's series set a precedent not only for other Black women writers , but for the genre of autobiography as a whole . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Even the Stars Look Lonesome is a collection 20 short personal essays , most of which are autobiographical . All but one essay , " Those Who Really Know , Teach " , previously appeared in other publications . The book is dedicated to " the children who will come to maturity in the twenty @-@ first century " and lists more than 35 of them she knew , charging them to " make this a perfect world " . 
 Angelou discusses a wide range of topics in Stars , including Africa , aging and the young 's misconceptions of it , sex and sensuality , self @-@ reflection , independence , and violence . She explores her early career as a nightclub performer . She writes about African art and " the importance of understanding both the historical truth of the African American experience and the art that truth inspired " . She salutes Black women , calling them " precious jewels all " , and profiles her friend Oprah Winfrey , who she compares to " the desperate traveler who teaches us the most profound lesson and affords us the most exquisite skills " . Angelou defends her controversial support of Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice in one of her essays . In her final essay in the book , Angelou uses the story of the prodigal son to emphasize the value of solitude : " In the silence we listen to ourselves . Then we ask questions of ourselves . We describe ourselves to ourselves , and we may even hear the voice of God . "

 Like Angelou 's previous book of essays , Wouldn 't Take Nothing for My Journey Now , this book received mostly positive reviews .

Burns also stated : " Her take on aging is downright amusing ; her tribute to sensuality , enlightening ; and her salute to black women , a treasure " . Megan Harlan of Entertainment Weekly noted Angelou 's " ease with both highbrow and middlebrow culture " , as evidenced in her discussion of poetry and of Winfrey , and praised how Angelou " balances lofty language with keenly self @-@ aware wit " , but found the first essay incomplete . The reviewers writing for Publishers Weekly found Stars " narrower in scope " than Journey , but thought that her racial pride in Stars stronger and more compelling . They also stated , " ...

 = Used to Love You = 
 " Used to Love You " is a song recorded by American singer Gwen Stefani for her third studio album , This Is What the Truth Feels Like ( 2016 ) . It was written by Stefani , Justin Tranter , Julia Michaels , Jonathan " J.R. " Rotem and Teal <unk> , and produced by Rotem . After scrapping the album and its two singles , " Baby Don 't Lie " and " Spark the Fire " , in favor to start over , Interscope Records released " Used to Love You " as the album 's first official single on October 20 , 2015 . It was then serviced to mainstream radio on October 27 , 2015 . 
 " Used to Love You " is an emotional midtempo synthpop ballad , with its instrumentation consisting of a piano , restrained synths and drum taps . Lyrically , the song talks about a painful break @-@ up , with the protagonist questioning why she fell in love . Stefani described the song as being inspired by the end of her 13 @-@ year marriage with Bush lead singer , Gavin Rossdale . 
 " Used to Love You " was critically acclaimed for its lyrical content and Stefani 's emotional delivery , with most critics calling it a heartbreaking song . Critics viewed the single as an improvement over her 2014 releases , which Stefani herself later described as " rushed " . Stefani first premiered the song during a concert on October 17 , 2015 and its music video was released three days later . The music video is a single shot of Stefani on a black background , displaying her emotions , and occasionally mouthing some of the words of the song . The song received its first televised performance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 26 , 2015 .

 In October 2014 , Stefani released her first solo single in six years , " Baby Don 't Lie " , and following its moderate impact and reception , a new single , " Spark the Fire " , was released in December of the same year . However , both singles underperformed on the charts , prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release . After months with no updates on the album , Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over , since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project . Stefani started writing new material in June 2015 , and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later , she felt very inspired . In the same interview , Stefani claimed : " I needed to go through what I needed to go through to write the record that I needed to write . [ ... ] These songs are really natural — they ’ re from not worrying about what happened or what ’ s going to happen but about living in the moment , from trying to be present and trying to feel . " 
 A & R President Aaron Bay @-@ Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and producers J.R. Rotem , Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels to work with Stefani on the album . Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session : " ' Listen , I don ’ t care about anything . I don ’ t care about hits . I don ’ t care about anything except for coming in this room right now … all I want to do is just say the truth . I just want the truth to come out ' . " Michaels , revealed that " Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment . There was this one phrase that read , ' I don 't know why I cry but I think it 's because I remembered for the first time since I hated you that I used to love you . ' I said , ' Whoa , what a crazy line that is . ' She just goes , ' Cool , make it a melody . Let 's go . " The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release ; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs . The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album , " Used to Love You " , and they approved it . 
 On October 17 , 2015 , Stefani performed at a MasterCard Priceless Surprises concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City . Prior performing the show 's encore , she wrote on her official Twitter account , " Ready for the encore ? Hold tight — new single in 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 ! " . Before performing " Used to Love You " , she said , " I just want to share a song that I wrote recently . This song is really special . " On October 19 , 2015 , Stefani revealed the single 's cover art featuring a close @-@ up picture of herself . A day later , October 20 , 2015 , the song was released to digital download on iTunes and other online platforms , while on October 27 , 2015 , Interscope Records serviced the song to mainstream radio as the official lead @-@ single from the album .

 " Used to Love You " was written by Stefani , Justin Tranter , Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem ; Rotem is also one of the song 's producers . The song is a vulnerable and " emotional " midtempo synthpop ballad , having a " driving piano melody " , with a length of three minutes and forty @-@ seven seconds . Spin 's James Grebey wrote that the song " largely showcases her passionate , conflicted vocals over restrained , electropop @-@ leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps . " Lyrically , " Used to Love You " is a break @-@ up anthem , where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place . The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani 's divorce from Gavin Rossdale , after a 13 @-@ year marriage . In an interview for Today 's Matt Lauer , Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage , claiming : " I ’ ve never put a record out where I ’ m actually going through things in real time . [ But t ] his is like , I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago . " According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus , " I don 't know why I cry / But I think it 's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I used to love you . " In other poignant lyrics , she sings , " I guess nobody taught you , nobody taught you how to love . " Kreps further compared the lyrical content of " Used to Love You " to " Dreaming the Same Dream " , a song from No Doubt 's sixth album Push and Shove . Alex <unk> of Bustle claimed that the song " recalls some of [ her ] best ballads , like ' Cool ' , ' Early Winter ' , and ' 4 in the Morning ' . "

 Since its release , " Used to Love You " has received critical acclaim from contemporary music critics . Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly felt the song 's " hyper @-@ personal lyrics " were " immediate and affecting " . Immediately following its release , Maeve McDermott from USA Today awarded the track " Song of the Week " in October , further adding that " [ t ] he song 's spiritual sibling is another of Stefani 's best works : 1996 's No Doubt classic ' Don 't Speak ' , " but noting that " this time around , coming from a more mature artist with fewer things to prove , the pain feels dizzyingly fresh . " Bianca Gracie of Idolator praised the fact that the singer was " stepping away from the pumped @-@ up vibes of previous tracks like ' Spark The Fire ' & ' Baby Don ’ t Lie ' , also noting that " [ h ] <unk> is immediately relatable ( just ask Adele ) and Gwen is often praised for her underrated slow songs [ ... ] , so it is refreshing to witness her jumpstart this current album era with a new vibe . " Alex <unk> of Bustle called it " a fantastic ' comeback single ' — a tremendous improvement over ' Baby Don 't Lie ' , " praising that " when she repeatedly sings , ' I don 't know why I used to love you , ' during the climax , you feel it . " Music Times 's Carolyn Menyes agreed , noting that " we haven 't heard a breakup anthem from this girl since her Tragic Kingdom days . After a series of less @-@ than @-@ stellar singles , it 's safe to say Stefani is back . " In a later review of the parent album , Menyes stated she was " impressed with the vulnerability [ ... ] displayed " , comparing it to Stefani 's previous singles " Cool " and " Ex @-@ Girlfriend " . Menyes concluded by saying the potential on This Is What the Truth Feels Like is evident on tracks like " Used to Love You " . 
 Sean Fitz @-@ Gerald of Vulture wrote that " the song veers toward Stefani 's more mellifluous , sentimental fare , " calling it a " heartrending track " . Amanda <unk> of AltWire praised the track , stating : " [ it ] reaches through , wraps its acrylic @-@ nailed fingers around your pulsating heart , rips it from your chest , throws it on the floor , and stomps all over it . " Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that " Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it " ; she continued with : " It ’ s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers . " Mapes concluded by claiming that " Used to Love You " was her greatest song since " Don 't Speak " , comparing its effect to Madonna 's 1989 single " Like a Prayer " . Sean Fitz @-@ Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this " <unk> track " that " tissues are a must " . Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track , calling it a " recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble " . Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the " somber [ ness ] " of the track , while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , claiming that " every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you " . Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged " Used to Love You " as one of the strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like , calling it " unexpectedly heartfelt " . 
 Spencer Kornhaber , writing for The Atlantic , called " Used to Love You " the " most heartbreaking " on the parent album , due to " its sentiment and execution " . However , Kornhaber stated : " A raw observation and vocal squeak in the chorus might prompt tears like the ones in the accompanying video , but the rest of the song struggles . " In a mixed review , Adam R. Holz of Plugged In found Stefani 's " loiter [ ing ] precariously close to bitterness " . However , Holz complimented the singer for " <unk> [ ing ] the beautiful sanctity of matrimony [ ... ] when its sacredness is violated " . Mesfin Fekadu , a critic for The National , claimed the single " do [ es ] n 't feel connected to Stefani – it 's as if another pop star could sing the track and you wouldn 't notice the difference " .

 Jack David Clancy ( born June 18 , 1944 ) is a former American football wide receiver who played for the Miami Dolphins in 1967 and 1969 and for the Green Bay Packers in 1970 . He also played in college for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1963 to 1966 . 
 At Michigan , Clancy started as a quarterback , switched to halfback , returned punts and kickoffs , and became a star as an end . In two seasons as an end ( 1965 – 1966 ) , Clancy rewrote the Michigan receiving record book . At the time of his graduation , he held the school records for most receptions and receiving yards in a career , season and game . His 1966 total of 197 receiving yards against Oregon State remained Michigan 's single @-@ game receiving record until November 6 , 2010 . He was named an All @-@ American and also set the Big Ten Conference record for most receptions in a single season of conference play . Though most of his records have since been broken , Clancy continues to rank among the leading receivers in Michigan history . 
 Clancy was drafted by the Miami Dolphins of the American Football League ( AFL ) . In 1967 , quarterback Bob Griese and Clancy were both rookies for the Dolphins . Clancy caught 67 passes that year , setting an AFL rookie record . He was third in the AFL in receptions in 1967 and eighth in receiving yards . He was named to the 1967 AFL All @-@ star game . After a sensational rookie season , Clancy suffered a serious knee injury in a 1968 exhibition game and missed the entire season . While making a comeback in 1969 , Clancy suffered an injury to his other knee . Traded to the Green Bay Packers in 1970 , Clancy was unable to return to his prior form after the knee injuries . He made only 16 receptions in 14 games and was released by the Packers before the start of the 1971 season . 
 = = College = = 
 A native of Humboldt , Iowa , Clancy 's family moved to the Green Bay , Wisconsin area , where Clancy attended elementary school . His family next moved to Garden City , Michigan , where Clancy attended Garden City schools , then the family moved to Detroit where he graduated in 1962 from St. Mary of Redford High School in Detroit , Michigan . Clancy then enrolled at the University of Michigan . As a freshman in 1962 , Clancy was on the roster as a quarterback but did not play . 
 = = = 1963 season = = = 
 In 1963 , Clancy appeared in nine games as a halfback and also returned punts and kickoffs . He generated 520 yards of total offense : 228 yards on kickoff returns , 109 yards rushing , 105 yards on punt returns , and 78 yard receiving . Against Minnesota in 1963 , he fumbled a punt at Michigan 's 35 @-@ yard line ; the ball rolled toward the Michigan goal line and was recovered by Michigan at its own 16 @-@ yard line . Michigan punted from deep in its own territory on second down , and Minnesota cashed in on the field position with the game 's only touchdown in a 6 – 0 Minnesota victory .

 Clancy was named the starting halfback before the start of the 1964 season . However , he suffered a back injury in September 1964 and spent more than two weeks in the University Hospital before being released on September 17 , 1964 . As a result of the injury , Clancy missed Michigan 's Big Ten championship season in 1964 , as Jim Detwiler took over his halfback spot . Clancy was given an extra year of eligibility for missing the 1964 season . Quarterback Dick Vidmer also missed the 1964 season with a broken leg ; Vidmer and Clancy would return from their injuries as a powerful passing and receiving combination in 1966 .

 In 1965 , Clancy switched to end and became the first Michigan Wolverine with 50 receptions in a season , and set Michigan single @-@ season records with 52 receptions and 762 yards . In his first game at the end position , Clancy made what was described as " a circus catch " in the endzone on a pass from quarterback Dick Vidmer . Clancy set the Big Ten receiving record in against Wisconsin , catching a 52 @-@ yard touchdown pass from quarterback Wally Gabler on Michigan 's first offensive play . At the time , the Associated Press reported : " What makes Clancy 's record so much more impressive is the fact that he came to Michigan as a quarterback , switched to halfback and won a spot there two years ago and then turned to end this season . And with Michigan 's reputation for always having talented ends — Benny Oosterbaan , Lowell Perry , Ron Kramer and John Henderson among them — Clancy 's feat takes on even more brilliance . " At the end of the season , Clancy 's teammates chose him as captain for the 1966 season . He was also named a second @-@ team All @-@ Big Ten player by the United Press International ( UPI ) . 
 = = = 1966 season = = = 
 Before the 1966 season , Clancy spent the summer in Ann Arbor , Michigan practicing with Michigan 's quarterback Dick Vidmer , cornerback Mike Bass and safety Rick Volk . Clancy and Vidmer worked as a unit through the summer , trying to outmaneuver Bass and Volk . Clancy noted , " If I could catch three or four passes against those guys I 'd be doing good . " The summer sessions paid off , as both Clancy and Volk were named All @-@ Americans in 1966 . Michigan opened the season with a 41 – 0 win over Oregon State . In that game , Vidmer threw 10 passes to Clancy for 197 yards . Vidmer 's first completion to Clancy went for 49 yards and set up Michigan 's first touchdown .

 Clancy was drafted in the third round of the 1966 AFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins and the ninth pick of the fifth round of the 1966 NFL Draft ( 73rd overall ) by the St. Louis Cardinals . However , he opted to redshirt for an extra season at Michigan where he played the 1966 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season . He joined the Dolphins for the 1967 AFL season . In 1967 , the Dolphins ' rookie quarterback Bob Griese combined with rookie receiver Clancy for 67 receptions — an American Football League rookie record for pass receptions . That year , Clancy led the Dolphins in receiving yardage and receptions , and finished eighth in the AFL in reception yards and third in receptions . He compiled three 100 @-@ yard receiving games , and he was named to the AFL All @-@ Star Game . 
 In their second season together , Griese and Clancy were roommates in the pre @-@ season and appeared ready to have a big year . The young " Griese @-@ Clancy combine " was expected to be " a major drawing card " for the young AFL franchise in 1968 . In the first three pre @-@ season games in 1968 , they connected for 19 receptions and 284 yards . However , Clancy suffered a ruptured ligament in his left knee shortly after catching a pass against the Baltimore Colts in the final pre @-@ season game on August 31 , 1968 . Clancy underwent surgery and missed the 1968 season . Clancy watched the Dolphins from the sidelines with his leg in a cast , as Karl Noonan took over at split end and led the AFL in touchdown catches in 1968 . 
 In April 1969 , Clancy got married and went on a honeymoon trip around the world , swimming , surfing and " getting some sun . " He said , however , marriage had not reduced his desire to play football . " Just the opposite , " he said . " I 'm more hungry than ever . I want to make that money . " After a season on crutches , the UPI reported : " The former rookie wonder wants to get back under quarterback Bob Griese 's passes , to reclaim his billing as the Miami Dolphins ' top receiver . Despite a scar on his knee , Clancy was dashing , cutting and jumping for passes during summer workouts . However , even Clancy acknowledged the injury had slowed him down : " I 'm still a couple of steps slower than before the operation . But I 'm optimistic . It doesn 't pain me . I figure I have a month to work the way I want to , I 'll be all right . " Clancy 's comeback appeared to be on track in early November , as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards . However , the comeback was cut short on November 2 , 1969 , when he suffered torn ligaments , this time to his right knee in a loss to the New York Jets . Clancy missed the final six games of the 1969 season due to the injury . 
 = = = Green Bay Packers = = = 
 In May 1970 , Clancy was traded by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming . Clancy had begun a business selling real estate in Miami during the offseason , but he also had ties to Green Bay . He had attended St. Matthew 's Grade School there in the 1950s . Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade : " I don 't like to leave Miami . You hate to have to pick up and move and I definitely plan to come back ( to Miami ) in the offseason . But most of my dad 's family are still up in Green Bay . He 's always wanted me to play for the Packers . " Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938 . Wisconsin columnist Lee Remmel said Clancy " surveys the football scene with a pair of cool , calculating blue eyes and a computer @-@ type mind . " 
 In an August 1970 exhibition game against the New York Giants , Clancy caught four passes for 110 yards . Packers coach Phil Bengtson said after the game , " He has a knack of knowing where the ball will be . Clancy doesn 't have great speed , but he has the ability to recognize defenses and take advantage of them . " While Clancy played in all 14 games for the Packers in 1970 , he caught only 16 passes , leading one Green Bay writer to conclude that Clancy 's " anemic production " resulted in double @-@ teaming of flanker Carroll Dale and an unbalanced passing offense . Clancy finished fifth in receptions on the 1970 Packers , behind Dale , tight end John Hilton , running back Donny Anderson , and even fullback Jim Grabowski . 
 Clancy tried out for the Packers again in 1971 , but he was cut in August before the season started . While attempting to make a comeback with the Dolphins in July 1972 , Clancy suffered another injury , this time to his back , resulting in Clancy being placed in traction for ten days in a Miami hospital . In all , Clancy played in 36 games for the Dolphins and Packers , compiling professional career totals of 104 receptions for 1 @,@ 301 yards . Rick Norton was Clancy 's teammate both in Miami and Green Bay .

 Pre @-@ production work on Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu began in 2010 when Karan Johar announced his plans of making a new project with debutant Shakun Batra . Following the success of their previous collaboration I Hate Luv Storys ( 2010 ) , Khan was contracted by Johar to play the male lead . In an attempt to sign in an actress who had never worked with Khan before , Kapoor was confirmed to play the female lead several days later . She had to cut her hair short and sport red streaks for her role . On casting Khan and Kapoor , Johar commented , " They could get their real life personality onto the film . Imran is meant to be this very perfectionist young man . So while he is a very stuffy kind of a character , he is also very focused and doesn 't let himself go . On the other hand Kareena plays this woman who is like a modern version of Geet from Jab We Met . " 
 Batra mentioned , " It 's a slice of life film , driven by characters . The plot is not primary , emotions of the characters are at the forefront . It is set on two weeks of the life of two characters , played by Imran and Kareena . " On the other hand , Johar said it was inspired by the Woody Allen style of film @-@ making . He added that there would be " lot more conversation happening here " and there would be " these walk @-@ talk sequences where it is just you and the camera in motion . " 
 Principal photography commenced in November 2010 in Las Vegas , Nevada after Khan had completed working on Mere Brother Ki Dulhan and later continued in Los Angeles . After completing the film 's first schedule , the crew shifted to shoot in Pataudi , in the Indian state of Haryana , followed by Mumbai . As photography began in Vegas , media sources began to report that it could be an adaptation of the American romantic comedy , What Happens in Vegas ( 2008 ) . Johar , however , went on to deny these reports , claiming that , if he wanted to remake the film , he would have bought the rights to it . Originally referred to as Short Term Shaadi , the title and first look was launched by Johar in August 2011 via Twitter . According to him , " Short Term Shaadi was just a working title that attached itself to this film through the making . Neither the director nor I were happy with it from the start . " The name Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu was derived from a song from the Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh <unk> Khel Khel Mein ( 1975 ) . 
 On deciding to set the stot in Vegas , Batra said that " the character of the place is very well defined and we need to show it as Las Vegas . It can 't be shown as any other city . Since most films are not set there , it gets difficult . In case of Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu , our film is set in Las Vegas and Mumbai . " As filming took place during the winter in Vegas , the production team shot for double shifts to be cost effective .

 The Sugababes performed " Red Dress " in Turin , Italy , in February 2006 for Top of the Pops at the Winter Olympics . To promote the song 's release , they performed it on 6 March 2006 at the HMV store on Oxford Street , London . The single appeared in the set list for the group 's Taller in More Ways tour in 2006 , and served as the shows ' encore in conjunction with " Push the Button " . According to Craig Hope of Chronicle Live , the song " came amid a sea of manic applause " . " Red Dress " was featured in the set list for their 2007 tour in support of Overloaded : The Singles Collection . The Sugababes performed the single at the Aintree Pavilion in July 2007 as part of the Liverpool Summer Pops music event . It was the opening song of the gig , and the trio was backed by a five @-@ piece band . The single was performed on 14 September 2007 during their gig at <unk> , a live club for smaller music events . Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the performance as " one of the night 's pulsating highlights " . 
 " Red Dress " was also included on the set list for the Sugababes ' Change Tour in 2008 . During the performance , the song was mashed with Frankie Goes to Hollywood 's 1984 single " Two Tribes " . Corresponding with the title of the song , the trio wore red , cellophane dresses for the performance . Berrabah named the outfit one of her favourites to wear during the tour . " Red Dress " was performed at the 2008 Oxygen Festival as part of a set list which included numerous of the group 's previous singles .

 = Piel Castle = 
 Piel Castle , also known as <unk> Castle or the Pile of <unk> , is a castle situated on the south @-@ eastern point of Piel Island , off the coast of the Furness Peninsula in north @-@ west England . Built in the early @-@ 14th century by John Cockerham , the Abbot of neighbouring Furness Abbey , it was intended to oversea the trade through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids . The castle was built using stones from the local beach , and featured a large keep with surrounding inner and outer baileys . It was used as a base by the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487 , but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed into the hands of the Crown . Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century . In the 1870s the castle 's owner , the Duke of Buccleuch , carried out extensive restoration work and erected outworks to protect it against further damage from the sea . In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness and is now in the care of English Heritage . 
 = = History = = 
 Piel Castle was built on Piel Island , overlooking the deep water port of Piel Harbour outside of Barrow Haven , now called Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness . There may have been an earlier 12th @-@ century fortification on the island , possibly built by the local monks in the reign of King Stephen , but this is uncertain . The castle was built by the John Cockerham , the Abbot of Furness Abbey around 1327 , when Edward III gave the abbey a licence to crenellate on the site . Comprising a keep with an inner and outer bailey , the castle was intended to oversee the trade through the harbour , and to provide defence , as the Abbey had faced raids from Scotland in 1316 and 1322 . 
 Architectural historian Anthony Emery argues that the castle was built in three phases , starting with the central keep , which he believes was intended as a largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot . With the increased threat from Scotland and the granting of the licence to crenellate , Emery suggests that the inner bailey wall was then constructed to better defend the keep , followed by the outer bailey wall in a final phase of work . 
 In 1408 , the Abbot John Bolton decided that the cost of maintaining the castle was excessive , and attempted to pull down the defences , but was prevented from doing so by Henry IV ; this was followed by a period of rebuilding around 1429 . The castle was used for smuggling by the Abbey , leading to complaints from merchants in English @-@ controlled Calais that they were illegally trafficking wool , which in this period could only legally be sold through the French port . In 1487 the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel landed on Piel Island . He sought help from potential local supporters and held court at the castle , before advancing inland and ultimately being defeated at the Battle of Stoke Field . By 1534 the castle had fallen in ruin and was described in a report as " sore decayed " . In 1537 , on the dissolution of the Abbey , it became the property of the Crown , and after 1660 , was given to the Duke of Albermarle . 
 By the late 18th century , the island had become used as a base for maritime pilots , and the castle passed into the possession of the Dukes of Buccleuch . In 1811 , the poet William Wordsworth visited the area and wrote a poem entitled " Peele Castle " describing the site . The sea caused significant erosion during this period , and one side of the keep collapsed in the early 19th century . Walter Scott , the Duke of Buccleuch , purchased the rest of the island and carried out an extensive and expensive restoration of the castle between 1877 and 1878 , destroying most traces of the medieval occupation of the site in the process . The restoration involved constructing outworks to prevent further sea erosion , replacing damage to the ashlar stone features of the castle and protecting the tops of the stone walls . 
 In 1919 John Scott decided to sell the island and castle ; the local mayor , Alfred Barrow , intervened and the following the year the Duke instead agreed to give the castle and island to the local authorities as a memorial to those who had lost their life in World War I. The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973 , and is now controlled by English Heritage , who operate the site as a tourist attraction . An archaeological survey was commissioned by English Heritage in 1984 , carried out by Rachel Newman of Lancaster University ; the findings of the survey led to a program of restoration work , completed in 1991 . It is protected by law as a grade I listed building . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The castle is built to an Edwardian concentric design , with a keep in the south @-@ eastern corner , protected by an inner and outer bailey with stone curtain walls extending out to the north @-@ west . The castle is built using stones from the local beach bonded with a liquid mortar , with the finer stonework , such as the doorways and windows , made from red ashlar sandstone imported from the mainland . Much of the surrounding island has been eroded by the sea and some of the castle has been lost , with fallen stone fragments still visible on the beach below . 
 The three @-@ storey keep stands on a low mound of clay , similar to that making up the base of the rest of the castle , and is 45 @-@ foot ( 14 m ) high , 76 feet ( 23 m ) by 74 feet ( 23 m ) across , reinforced with protruding buttresses , and a tower on the south @-@ eastern corner . The original entrance would have been at ground level , but a gatehouse , 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) by 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) , was then built along on the north side , raising this to the first floor . A carved female figure can be seen above the entrance arch , which may have been a representation of Salome . The keep had large windows on the first and second floors , although the lower level of these was later blocked up , and was unusually divided into three sections , creating a central hallway on each level . The eastern side of the keep has collapsed as a consequence of land erosion . Anthony Emery argues that the term " keep " is inappropriate for the building , which should be seen more as a residential tower house , similar to that at Langley Castle . 
 The inner and outer bailey walls have also been damaged by sea erosion , but they originally formed concentric squares around the keep and were protected by ditches . The outer bailey wall , 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) thick in places , is no longer very substantial , but even when first built it may have been quite weak ; it is protected by a moat , up to 13 metres ( 43 ft ) wide and 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . Both the baileys are protected by towers ; the outer bailey towers are each 15 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 7 m ) wide . The inner bailey wall is 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) thick , protected by a 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) wide moat . Its towers were a later addition to the original design , and a gatehouse in the inner bailey wall was also built shortly after the construction of the castle . The fortifications would have been slightly old fashioned for the period . The outer bailey holds a stone building called " the chapel " , 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) by 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) in size . Its original use is unknown and it appears to have been built late in the castle 's history , possibly after it became ruinous . 
 Local legends exist of a tunnel between the castle and Furness Abbey , allegedly used by the monks as escape route from the mainland . No such passageway exists . 
 = Typhoon Mireille = 
 Typhoon Mireille , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was the costliest typhoon on record , striking Japan in September 1991 . The 20th named storm of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season , Mireille formed on September 13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands . It moved westward for several days as a small system , steered by the subtropical ridge to the north . The storm rapidly intensified to typhoon status on September 16 , and several days later passed north of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands . Mireille intensified further after deleterious effects from a nearby tropical storm subsided . On September 22 , the American @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated maximum 1 ‑ minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , and on the next day , the official Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The typhoon weakened slightly while turning northward , passing just east of Miyako @-@ jima and later to the west of Okinawa . On September 27 , Mireille made landfall near Nagasaki in southwestern Japan with winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , the strongest since Typhoon Nancy in 1961 . The storm accelerated to the northeast through the Sea of Japan , moving over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 28 . The remnants of Mireille continued to the east , passing through the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October 1 . 
 The typhoon first threatened Guam , although it passed well to the north of the island , bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan . The first part of Japan affected was Miyako @-@ jima , where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops . Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves , while strong winds up to 189 km / h ( 118 mph ) damaged power lines and trees . The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan , with overall damage estimated at $ 10 billion ( USD ) , making it the costliest typhoon on record as of 2014 . Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26 locations , with a peak gust of 218 km / h ( 136 mph ) in western Honshu . The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7 @.@ 36 million people , or about 13 % of total customers . Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $ 3 billion , mostly to the apple industry , after 345 @,@ 000 tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43 @,@ 000 were damaged on the trees . The storm damaged over 670 @,@ 000 houses , of which 1 @,@ 058 were destroyed , and another 22 @,@ 965 were flooded . Throughout Japan , Mireille killed 66 people and injured another 2 @,@ 862 people , including ten deaths on a capsized freighter . Elsewhere , the typhoon killed two people in South Korea , and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Mireille were from a poorly @-@ organized area of convection , or thunderstorms , associated with the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands on September 13 . That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began tracking the system as a tropical depression . The system moved westward , developing a large increase in thunderstorms over the center on September 15 . That day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert , and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression <unk> at 00 : 00 UTC , estimating 1 ‑ minute sustained winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . About six hours later , the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mireille , after satellite imagery indicated the storm was very compact and intensifying quickly . The JTWC later determined in a post @-@ storm analysis that Mireille had attained tropical storm status 12 hours earlier on the previous day . Also at the time of it attaining tropical storm status , Mireille was one of three storms in the basin , along with Tropical Storm Luke to the northwest and Typhoon Nat to the west in the South China Sea . 
 Only 12 hours after the JTWC issued the first warning , Mireille attained typhoon status at 12 : 00 UTC on September 16 , and several hours later reached an initial peak intensity of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . The small storm moved west @-@ northwestward due to the influence of the subtropical ridge to the north . On September 17 , the track shifted to the west @-@ southwest , threatening Guam . The small typhoon turned more to the west , passing about 20 km ( 12 mi ) north of Saipan on September 19 , part of the Northern Marianas Islands north of Guam . For several days , Mireille failed to intensify due to wind shear from the larger Tropical Storm Luke to the north . After Luke weakened and progressed northward , Mireille was able to strengthen more gradually , as well as increase in size . On September 22 , the typhoon strengthened into a super typhoon , which is an unofficial category used by the JTWC for storms reaching 1 ‑ minute winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) . According to the JMA , Mireille attained 10 ‑ minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) on September 23 . 
 Around the time of reaching peak intensity , Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge . The increasing size began to impart wind shear in Typhoon Nat to the west , and the two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect , in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan . After maintaining peak winds for about 30 hours , Mireille began weakening , passing just east of Miyako @-@ jima on September 26 with 10 ‑ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , according to the JMA . That day , the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due to increasing mid @-@ level winds from the southwest , passing west of Okinawa . According to the JMA , Mireille re @-@ intensified slightly on September 27 to a secondary peak of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea . The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07 : 00 UTC between <unk> and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu . The pressure at landfall was 940 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , the lowest in the country since Typhoon Trix in 1971 . 
 The typhoon quickly weakened while continuing northeastward through Kyushu and western Honshu , and started to become an extratropical cyclone ; during the process , the wind field expanded , aided by moist air from the southwest and cold air from the northwest . It accelerated further over the Sea of Japan , and late on September 27 , Mireille made a second landfall in Japan along southwestern Hokkaido at 22 : 00 UTC , with 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) still at typhoon status . Crossing the island , the typhoon weakened to tropical storm status early on September 28 , and shortly thereafter became fully extratropical in the Sea of Okhotsk . The powerful remnants of Mireille continued eastward , crossing the Aleutian Islands on September 29 and crossed the International Date Line shortly thereafter . That day , a pressure of 954 mb ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 17 inHg ) was observed in the Pribilof Islands of Alaska . Powerful winds battered vessels in the region , with the Merchant Pride reporting peak sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) . After crossing the dateline , Mireille 's remnants turned northeast and struck the Seward Peninsula on October 3 before moving over Arctic Alaska . The system then moved over the Arctic Ocean where it was last noted on October 4 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Early tropical cyclone computer models anticipated Mireille would pass close to Guam , prompting officials to undergo preparations for the storm . The storm ultimately passed north of Saipan , causing damage along the island 's northern portion . Mireille knocked over trees and damaged over 70 % of Saipan 's crops while also eroding coastal roads . 
 In South Korea , two people were killed with two others reported missing . A South Korean freighter rode out the storm at the port in Hakata Bay . It breached along the breakwater , causing it to sink , killing all 10 crew members . The Japan Coast Guard launched a search and rescue mission for two days . 
 Later , the remnants of Mireille moved through the Aleutian Islands toward the end of September , bringing strong winds to the islands , including gusts over 112 km / h ( 70 mph ) at Amchitka . 
 = = = Japan = = = 
 Ahead of the storm , the JMA issued 99 typhoon bulletins , warning residents about Mireille . There were 236 warnings related to storm surge , high winds , waves , and flooding . In Hiroshima , most residents were aware of the approaching storm , about 70 % of residents did not expect significant effects . In general , residents were unprepared for the storm , partly due to the lack of recent storms . Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480 domestic flights cancelled , stranding 58 @,@ 000 , and road , rail , and ferry traffic was halted . In Hokkaido , 207 schools were closed due to the storm . 
 Mireille was the strongest typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961 , causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures . It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks . Damage was heaviest on Kyushu where the storm made landfall . Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan , the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed over much of the country , which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located . The high winds downed trees , damaged roofs , and left record power outages , affecting 7 @.@ 36 million people , or about 13 % of total customers . In some areas , the power outages lasted as little as three minutes . The storm damaged over 670 @,@ 000 houses , of which 1 @,@ 058 were destroyed , and another 22 @,@ 965 were flooded . Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production . Along the coast , the typhoon damaged 930 ships , with dozens sunk or blown ashore . Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests . Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies . Crop damage amounted to $ 3 billion , mostly to the apple industry , after 345 @,@ 000 tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43 @,@ 000 were damaged on the trees . Most farms lost 80 % of their crop , potentially taking 10 years to regrow . Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50 % , furthering crop damage . There were 62 deaths in Japan and 2 @,@ 862 injuries , including the deaths on the South Korean freighter , making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10 years . About 80 % of the deaths were male , and 70 % were over 60 years old . Most of the deaths were related to wind @-@ blown debris , falling due to the wind , or being trapped or struck by fallen objects . The $ 6 billion in insured losses and $ 10 billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of May 2014 , according to Munich Re . 
 When Mireille moved through western Japan , it brought strong winds and heavy rainfall . The highest sustained wind was 162 km / h ( 101 mph ) at <unk> , Nagasaki , and gusts nearby peaked at 218 km / h ( 136 mph ) . Misawa Air Base along northern Honshu reported winds of at least 93 km / h ( 58 mph ) for five hours , with a peak gust of 152 km / h ( 94 mph ) . This was the highest wind report at the station since records began in 1946 . The strongest wind gusts occurred concurrently with a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure , primarily from Kyushu and extending east @-@ northeastward into the Chūgoku region of Honshu . Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26 locations and record sustained winds at 12 locations . At landfall , Mireille produced winds of at least 54 km / h ( 34 mph ) across a diameter of 600 km ( 375 mi ) . About two @-@ thirds of the wind stations reported the strongest winds from the west after Mireille passed the area . Winds were lightest in eastern Honshu , Mireille also dropped heavy rainfall , mostly on Shikoku , peaking at 406 mm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) at Kito , Tokushima . In nearby Kōchi Prefecture , the heaviest hourly rainfall total was 72 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) , the highest in the nation for the storm . The rains caused at least 13 landslides and flooded rivers in four locations . However , effects from rainfall were limited due to the storm 's fast forward motion . Mireille also struck around the time of high tide , causing extensive storm surge along the coast . 
 Mireille first passed near Miyako @-@ jima , dropping 273 mm ( 10 @.@ 7 in ) of rainfall there . Wind gusts on the island reached 176 km / h ( 110 mph ) , which caused some crop damage to sugar cane and vegetables . All flights were canceled as Mireille passed the island . Later , the typhoon bypassed Okinawa to the west . The island experienced winds of at least 93 km / h ( 58 mph ) for 27 hours , with gusts of 152 km / h ( 92 mph ) at Kadena Air Base . The capital city , Naha , reported gusts of 180 km / h ( 112 mph ) , while the highest gust in the region was 189 km / h ( 118 mph ) on <unk> Island . Mireille produced heavy rainfall on Okinawa , totaling 258 mm ( 10 @.@ 14 in ) , which allowed water restrictions there to be lifted for the rest of the year . The precipitation fell in a short amount of time ; 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 43 in ) dropped in just 10 minute , and 34 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) dropped in an hour , both at Naha . Waves reached 13 @.@ 7 m ( 50 ft ) along the coast of Okinawa . On <unk> Island , the combination of high waves and tides produced damaging storm surge . The storm flooded 74 houses and damaged another 37 . Mireille damaged roads in two locations , while winds damaged 157 power lines , which cut communications to 3 @,@ 123 people . The storm also left heavy damage to the agriculture and forest industries . In the region , Mireille caused 44 flights to be canceled . Two people were injured on Okinawa , and overall damage in the prefecture totaled ¥ 1 @.@ 5 billion ( $ 11 @.@ 4 million USD ) . 
 In Kyushu , the heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides , which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75 people to evacuate . The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees , totaling <unk> hectares ( 55 @,@ 670 acres ) and accounting for ¥ 64 billion ( $ 530 million USD ) in damage in Ōita Prefecture alone . Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki , where 16 people were killed , including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm . A construction worker in nearby Isahaya was killed when the winds struck him with a <unk> hut , and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture . Throughout Kyushu , about 2 million people lost power . High winds and waves in Kagoshima Prefecture overturned several cars , killing one person in Ōshima . Throughout Kyushu , about 2 million people lost power . On nearby Shikoku island , high winds and rains caused ¥ 4 @.@ 7 billion ( $ 35 @.@ 7 million USD ) in damage in Tokushima , mostly related to fisheries , crops , and houses . A record storm surge , in conjunction with high winds , damaged a school in Sakaide , as well as a floating pier and coastal road in nearby Ehime Prefecture . Rough surf swept away a women in Matsuyama . 
 The storm track brought Mireille west of the most populated island of Honshu , limiting damage there compared to Kyushu . At Misawa Air Base , the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses , and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation . Ahead of the storm , advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population . Damage was estimated between $ 500 @,@ 000 – $ 1 @.@ 5 million . Two of Mazda 's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed , affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929 's until the end of November 1991 . Also in the city , 1 @.@ 1 million residents , or 80 % of households , lost power due to winds and storm surge . In Yamaguchi Prefecture , the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0 @.@ 6 m ( 2 ft ) of waters , forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States . The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and <unk> @-@ en northwest of Tokyo . In Okayama Prefecture , salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days . High winds in Naka @-@ ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage , and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down . There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu . In Toyama Prefecture , the winds destroyed 192 greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage . 
 Striking Hokkaido with much of its former intensity , Mireille produced strong winds across the island . Hakodate Airport reported a peak gust of 124 km / h ( 77 mph ) , and the highest sustained wind was 79 km / h ( 49 mph ) in Urakawa . Along the coast , waves reached 7 @.@ 7 m ( 25 ft ) high at Matsumae , killing one person in Kushiro who was mooring his boat . Light rains occurred on the island , reaching 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) in Hidaka . In Hakodate , the storm damaged five buildings , and about 3 @,@ 000 houses lost power . There was scattered roof damage across Hokkaido , and flying glass injured one person . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By a day after the storm made landfall , the record power outages were largely restored . However , salt damage prevented restoration in some areas for several days . The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down . In Hiroshima , lack of power caused traffic congestion , shut down banks , and disrupted hospitals . The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer , or wind measurement devices . Following the storm , insurance companies paid $ 6 billion to policy holders in Japan , which was a world record related to wind damage ; this was surpassed less than a year later by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida . The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non @-@ Atlantic hurricane . 
 Due to the severity of damage and loss of life caused by the storm , the name Mireille was retired and replaced with Melissa . 
 = Johns Hopkins – Maryland rivalry = 
 The Johns Hopkins – Maryland rivalry is an intercollegiate sports rivalry between the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays , which represent Johns Hopkins University , and the Maryland Terrapins , which represent the University of Maryland . The most prominent event has been the men 's lacrosse series , which is widely regarded as the greatest rivalry in the sport . More than 100 contests in the series have been played since the schools first met in 1895 . The competition is intensified by each programs ' status as a traditional lacrosse powerhouse . As such , the game has often held national championship implications , and twice the teams played to represent the United States in the Olympics . 
 The schools currently meet only in lacrosse , as all other Johns Hopkins athletics fall under NCAA Division III and all Maryland athletics are Division I. From the late 19th into the 20th century , however , their football teams also competed regularly . More recently , the schools have played in women 's lacrosse . 
 = = NCAA alignment = = 
 In 1971 , the National Collegiate Athletic Association instituted a three @-@ tier classification system , which created Division I , Division II , and Division III . The third tier , Division III , is the one in which no athletic scholarships are awarded to student @-@ athletes . Johns Hopkins , as a perennial lacrosse power , chose to continue competition in Division I in that sport , while all of its other athletic teams were relegated to Division III . In 2004 , the NCAA upheld the decision to allow Division III schools to " play up " , and grant scholarships , in a sport at the Division I level ( usually ice hockey ) . Since Maryland competes strictly at the Division I level , the two schools currently meet only in men 's and women 's lacrosse .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The media and both schools have called Johns Hopkins – Maryland the greatest and most historic rivalry in men 's lacrosse . Sports Illustrated ranked it among the best all @-@ time college rivalries , and before the teams ' 100th meeting , called it " the equivalent of Michigan – Ohio State in football . " A 2003 Harris Interactive poll found that Marylanders considered it the state 's fourth biggest rivalry after the Cowboys – Redskins , Ravens – Redskins , and Duke – Maryland . The Hopkins – Maryland all @-@ time record differs based upon whether games played before Maryland had a varsity team are counted . Johns Hopkins recognizes those games and records the series as 68 – 38 – 1 in its own favor . Maryland , however , recognizes only games played since the formation of their varsity team in 1924 , which puts the all @-@ time record at 61 – 38 – 1 , also in favor of Hopkins . 
 The rivalry , which is the oldest in the sport , is fueled by history , competitiveness , and cultural reasons . Both schools are located in the state of Maryland , a historical hotbed for lacrosse , and have traditionally been two of the sport 's powerhouses . Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school , high school , or youth club sports . Hopkins ' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said , " Everybody knew each other ; we had all played together at some point or another . It was a fierce , intense game and there was no love lost on the field . " Additionally , Johns Hopkins is a private university , while Maryland is a public institution . Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said : 
 " To get the juices flowing before the game , [ we 'd tell the Maryland ] kids that it was the blue @-@ collar guys against the future executives — that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world . Plus , you have all the kids who came from the same high school , or worked the camps together , so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days , no matter who wins .

 The two teams first played in 1895 and met six more times through 1923 . In those early matches , Johns Hopkins scored a combined sixty points to Maryland 's three . In 1924 , Maryland fielded its first varsity @-@ level lacrosse team , which defeated Hopkins , 4 – 2 , but the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association ( USILA ) awarded the Blue Jays the co @-@ national championship ( along with Syracuse ) . Since that season , the teams have met annually with the exception of a two @-@ year hiatus due to World War II . Johns Hopkins won three straight national titles from 1926 to 1928 , where each season culminated with a victory over Maryland . In 1928 , Maryland had a perfect 9 – 0 record until Johns Hopkins defeated the Terps in the season finale , 6 – 3 . At season 's end , a single @-@ elimination tournament was held to determine which team would represent the United States in a trial lacrosse competition during the Summer Olympics . Maryland defeated Navy and Rutgers to advance to the final game , where they were again bested by Johns Hopkins . 
 The following season , the Terrapins embarked upon a three @-@ year run in which they lost only four games , and they defeated the Blue Jays each season including a shutout , 6 – 0 , in 1930 . In 1932 , however , Hopkins defeated Maryland twice during the regular season and once more in a postseason game to decide participation in the Olympics . Between 1930 and 1934 , the Blue Jays won three national championships and lost only two games , both of which were to the Terrapins . Maryland captured national titles in 1936 , 1937 , and 1939 . That year , however , Hopkins managed to break a four @-@ game losing streak against them . The Terrapins won the 1940 title by beating the undefeated Blue Jays , 7 – 6 , in the series ' first game decided by one goal . Maryland finished the season with a perfect 10 – 0 record . The following year , Hopkins finished 12 – 0 and captured the national championship after a convincing victory over Maryland , 10 – 3 . Johns Hopkins secured four more national titles from 1947 to 1950 , and defeated Maryland each year , three times by a margin of at least six goals . 
 Several days before the game in 1947 , Hopkins supporters stole " Testudo " , a 300 @-@ pound bronze statue of a diamondback terrapin , from the Maryland campus . Approximately 200 Terrapins fans drove to Baltimore to retrieve it , and a riot erupted before the city police intervened . The Hopkins dean ordered the students to return the statue , which they did after painting a blue ' H ' on its back .

 In the 1950s , the two teams won a combined six national championships , with Maryland dominating the first part of the decade and Johns Hopkins the latter . Between 1951 and 1956 , Maryland posted a 5 – 0 – 1 record against Hopkins , with three games won by at least six points . The Terps won consecutive national titles in 1955 and 1956 , while posting a combined record of 21 – 0 . In 1957 , the Blue Jays snapped the Terrapins ' 31 @-@ game winning streak with an upset win , 15 – 10 . Two years later , both teams shared the national title with Army . Between 1955 and 1959 , Maryland compiled a 48 – 3 record , with all three losses at the hands of Johns Hopkins . 
 In 1960 , Navy became the first team other than Hopkins to defeat Maryland since 1954 . That same year marked the start of Navy 's eight @-@ year national championship streak that lasted through 1967 . That season , Navy beat Maryland 10 – 8 , before traveling to Homewood Field . There , Johns Hopkins upset Navy , 9 – 6 , for the first time in their last ten meetings . The Blue Jays and Terrapins met for the season finale where Hopkins needed a victory to win the national title outright . Maryland acted as a spoiler , however , and beat Johns Hopkins , 9 – 5 , to take a share of the championship . Hopkins went on to win or share the next four national titles . 
 = = = Advent of the NCAA tournament = = = 
 In 1971 , the NCAA replaced the USILA as the awarding authority for the men 's lacrosse championship with the introduction of a tournament . Since then , the Blue Jays and Terrapins have appeared in the finals a combined 27 times and have met each other in the finals three times . In 1972 , Maryland beat Johns Hopkins in the regular season , 13 – 12 , to earn the number @-@ one seed . The two teams met again in the semifinals , where Hopkins eliminated Maryland , 9 – 6 , and advanced to the finals before losing to Virginia by one goal . The following two years , Hopkins and Maryland met in the finals . 
 In 1973 , Maryland routed Hopkins during the regular season , 17 – 4 . That year 's Terrapins , led by future Hall of Fame inductee and four @-@ time All @-@ American Frank Urso , are considered one of the all @-@ time best college lacrosse teams and averaged almost 18 goals a game . When the teams met in the championship game , however , the Blue Jays employed a possession game to offset Maryland 's offensive firepower , and the first shot on goal did not take place until 8 : 38 . At halftime , Johns Hopkins had taken a 5 – 2 lead . Time expired with the score tied , 9 – 9 , which forced the game into overtime . Urso scored for the Terrapins to take a 10 – 9 lead and Maryland goalie Bill O 'Donnell made several impressive saves to secure the win . 
 The following year , Maryland was again named the top @-@ seed , despite having lost to second @-@ seed Johns Hopkins during the regular season . In the championship game , Hopkins quickly took the lead , led by Hall of Fame attackman Jack Thomas and entered halftime with a 10 – 4 advantage . In the second half , Maryland outscored them 8 – 7 , but the effort fell short . In 1975 , Maryland defeated Hopkins , 19 – 11 , before winning the national title , and won again the following year , 21 – 13 , on their way to finish as national championship runners @-@ up after an overtime loss to Cornell in the final . In 1977 , the Blue Jays edged the Terrapins , 21 – 20 , in the regular season and began a run in the series . Hopkins eliminated Maryland in the tournament semifinals in both 1977 and 1978 , before beating them in the 1979 championship game at home in College Park , Maryland . During that game , the Blue Jays were able to limit the Terrapins ' second all @-@ time leading scorer and 1979 attackman of the year Bob <unk> . During the 1970s , Maryland participated in six NCAA title games , including four in a row from 1973 to 1976 . During that span , the Terps won two national titles and lost four .

 During the 1980s , Johns Hopkins dominated the series , winning 12 of 13 games , including nine by an average margin of 5 @.@ 6 points . During this period Hopkins , led by head coach Henry <unk> , won three national titles . By 1987 , Maryland 's fourth @-@ year head coach Dick Edell had helped revitalize the Terrapins as a national power . Maryland posted an 11 – 0 record during the regular season , where the win over Hopkins , 11 – 7 , was the only game decided by less than six goals . In the NCAA tournament , Maryland defeated Penn in the quarterfinals , 12 – 8 , and advanced to again meet Hopkins in the semifinals . Despite having recorded its first three @-@ loss season in over a decade , and having edged North Carolina in the quarterfinals , the Blue Jays upset the Terrapins , 13 – 8 . Hopkins , led by goalkeeper Quint Kessenich , advanced to win the national title against then undefeated Cornell in the final .

 In 1995 , Johns Hopkins narrowly retained an undefeated regular season by winning four one @-@ goal games , which included an edging of Maryland , 16 – 15 . Hopkins entered the tournament as the number @-@ one seed , and again met Maryland in the semifinals . Edell helped guide the Terps to an early lead , and they ended the half with an advantage , 10 – 4 , with the final result a rout , 16 – 8 . The performance of Maryland goalie Brian Dougherty earned him the title of the tournament 's Most Outstanding Player , despite the Terps ' loss in the final against Syracuse . 
 The following season , Maryland earned a number @-@ two seeding after defeating Hopkins , 12 – 9 . The teams met again in the tournament quarterfinals , where , playing at home , Hopkins gained a 7 – 0 lead against heavily favored Maryland . The Terrapins rallied , but the Blue Jays held them off to preserve victory , 9 – 7 . In 1998 at Homewood Field , Hopkins upset first @-@ ranked Maryland , 10 – 6 during the regular season . This time when they met in the tournament quarterfinals , Maryland had the homefield advantage at Byrd Stadium . The Terps led 10 – 6 in the fourth quarter before the Blue Jays rallied to force overtime . Maryland , however , won the ensuing faceoff and scored after several shots on goal , never allowing Hopkins to gain possession of the ball . The Terps eventually advanced to the final , where they were defeated by Princeton . 
 = = = Recent years = = = 
 From 2001 to 2003 , each match @-@ up was decided by one goal . Maryland won coach Dick Edell 's final , and Hopkins coach Dave Pietramala 's first , game of the series in 2001 . The Blue Jays won the following two seasons , with both games decided in overtime . In 2004 , the teams played their 100th anniversary game and both sides wore special " throwback " jerseys . Hopkins scored five times before the first television timeout , then took an 8 – 1 first period lead on the way to a victory , 14 – 10 . Hopkins extended their streak to four wins in 2005 , before Maryland 's new head coach Dave Cottle took away his first victory in 2006 . In 2009 , the teams played in the inaugural Day of Rivals double @-@ header , where Hopkins preserved victory , 10 – 9 , when a final @-@ second Maryland shot on the crease was deflected . The two met for the event again in 2010 , with Maryland coming out on top , 10 – 9 , due in part to a perfect four @-@ for @-@ four extra @-@ man offense . 
 The rivalry became a conference matchup in the 2014 – 15 academic year when both schools joined the new men 's lacrosse league formed by Maryland 's new all @-@ sports home , the Big Ten Conference , with Johns Hopkins as an associate member . The first Big Ten game between the two was an upset for Johns Hopkins 15 @-@ 12 with a rematch in NCAA semi @-@ finals May 22 , 2015 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia which went to Maryland 12 @-@ 11 .

 In 1892 , the Maryland Agricultural College fielded its first officially @-@ recognized football team . In the third game of that season , they played Johns Hopkins at Clifton Park in Baltimore , and the more experienced " Hoppies " routed the " Aggies " , 62 – 0 . In 1894 , both schools became charter members of the Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association , which formed for the purpose of awarding the official Maryland state football championship . The Hoppies and Aggies , however , did not meet again until 1897 , when Johns Hopkins defeated Maryland in College Park , 30 – 0 . Johns Hopkins won the series ' first eight games without allowing a single Maryland score , for a combined margin of 190 – 0 . 
 The Aggies broke the losing streak in 1910 with a stalemate , 11 – 11 . In the final minutes of the game , Hopkins was on the Maryland eight @-@ yard line , second down with two yards to go . A Johns Hopkins guard named Schrieber then ran from the field to their bench to leave a knocked @-@ out tooth for safekeeping . The referee penalized the Blue and Black ten yards , and when their field goal attempt was blocked , the game ended in a tie . 
 In 1915 , the teams played their first game on Thanksgiving , which thereafter became an annual tradition . That game was held in front of 13 @,@ 000 fans , the largest crowd in the history of Homewood Field . It was a defensive struggle with both teams having great difficulty in gaining yardage . A Johns Hopkins halfback named Hoffman missed eight field goal attempts in succession before the ninth met its mark for a Blue Jays win , 3 – 0 . From that day forward , Johns Hopkins and Maryland played all but two Thanksgiving Days through 1934 . Eleven of the series ' last twelve games were held in Baltimore Municipal Stadium . By 1928 , the series ' tide had turned heavily in Maryland 's favor , and H.C. " Curley " Byrd coached the Terrapins to convincing victories in each of the final seven games .

The following year , the teams met and played each season through 2009 , but did not play again until 2015 . As of the last meeting between the teams in 2016 , the Maryland women held a perfect record against Hopkins , having won all 13 meetings by a combined margin of 212 – 105 . 
 Hopkins and Maryland will become conference rivals in women 's lacrosse in the 2017 season ( 2016 – 17 school year ) when Hopkins joins the Big Ten in women 's lacrosse .

 William " Willie " Middleton Wallace ( 23 September 1892 – 22 August 1915 ) was a rugby union player . He played fullback for Cambridge University RFC and was capped for Scotland in 1913 – 14 . 
 Having grown up in Edinburgh , Willie Wallace went to King 's College , Cambridge in 1912 , where he was immediately noticed for his rugby @-@ playing ability . He was selected to play against Oxford in the Varsity Match in his first term . Later in the season , in March 1913 , Scotland picked him to play away against England , in a close game , which England won by just three points . The following season he played in all three Home Nations matches against Wales , Ireland and England . 
 He was commissioned second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade ( Prince Consort 's Own ) at the start of the First World War and departed for the Western Front a few weeks later . In February 1915 , he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps and soon became No. 2 Squadron 's senior observer . In August 1915 , while on a photographic reconnaissance mission , his aircraft was shot down in northern France , near Lille . At the time of his death , it was suggested that he might have been the first undergraduate to see action in the war .

 Wallace was born in Edinburgh , the son of Robert and Mary Wallace , on 23 September 1892 . He went to school at Edinburgh Academy from 1899 to 1912 then studied at King 's College , Cambridge until 15 July 1914 . At school , he was in the rugby team for his final three years and vice @-@ captain in the final year . He also played cricket , captaining the school team in 1911 , as wicket @-@ keeper . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 According to the rugby journalist and author E. H. D. Sewell , Wallace was the best fullback in the United Kingdom between 1912 and 1914 . On arriving at Cambridge in 1912 , his performance in the freshers ' rugby match earned him his place on the Cambridge XV to play Oxford in the Varsity Match . 
 He was selected to play for Scotland against England in 1913 ; and Wales , Ireland , and England in 1914 . 
 Scotland 's first Five Nations Championship match of 1914 was on 7 February , played away to Wales at Cardiff . Scotland had not won in Cardiff since 1890 and Wales were favourites , having ' lost so unluckily ' against England . The match pitted Welsh forward strength against the swift threequarter line of the Scots . The first points came from a try for Scotland by W. A. Stewart , converted by Hamilton , giving the visitors a five @-@ point lead after four minutes . These were the only points they scored . Wales then attacked repeatedly and Wallace was kept busy in defence . With a 7 – 5 lead at half time , the Welsh pressed their advantage and ended the game 24 – 5 winners . 
 In the country 's final game before the outbreak of the First World War , on 21 March Scotland played host to an English team that had already defeated Wales and Ireland . The Scots , with the wind behind them , opened the scoring in the first half with a try but England equalised just before half time . After the break , England got up a lead of 6 – 16 and the visitors seemed certain to win . Scotland responded and closed the gap to one point . The English were then playing with fourteen men after Cherry Pillman 's leg was broken in a tackle , since substitutions at the time were not allowed . They managed to hold on , beating Scotland 15 – 16 , thereby winning both the Triple Crown and the Calcutta Cup , as well as the Five Nations . It was England 's last international test on British soil before the First World War : of the 30 players in the match , 11 went on to be killed in it , including the Englishman Arthur James Dingle , who died the same day as Wallace .

 Wallace , who was a cadet of the Officers Training Corps , was commissioned second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion , The Rifle Brigade ( Prince Consort 's Own ) on 5 August 1914 , while still an undergraduate . There were suggestions at the time that he was the first undergraduate to go into action but they were not substantiated . After two weeks ' training at Sheppey , he departed for France on 30 August . There , he participated in the First Battle of the Aisne and was active on the Western Front at <unk> and Ploegsteert Wood . 
 Wallace was attached to No. 2 Squadron , 1st Wing Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) on 14 February 1915 as an observer , alongside William Barnard Rhodes @-@ Moorhouse , the first serviceman of the RFC to be awarded the Victoria Cross . By July he was the squadron 's senior observer and was made up to lieutenant on 21 July 1915 . On 22 August 1915 , Wallace was on a photographic reconnaissance mission in a B.E.2c piloted by his friend <unk> Charles Gallie . The plane was hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire and came straight down at <unk> , near Lille , northern France . 
 Both men were buried near to where they fell , but after the war their bodies were reinterred at the Cabaret @-@ Rouge British Cemetery ( Grave reference XII . D. 11 ) , Souchez , near Arras , France .

 Joseph " Joe " Maxwell , VC , MC & Bar , DCM ( 10 February 1896 – 6 July 1967 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest decoration for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth armed forces . Often described as Australia 's second most decorated soldier of the First World War , he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 8 February 1915 , and served at Gallipoli before being transferred to the Western Front . In just over twelve months he was commissioned and decorated four times for his bravery . 
 An apprentice boilermaker before the war , Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 and worked as a gardener . In 1932 , he published Hell 's Bells and <unk> , a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his war experiences . Attempting to enlist for service during the Second World War , Maxwell was rejected on the grounds of his age before enlisting under an alias in Queensland ; his identity was discovered , and after a short period in a training position , he sought discharge . In 1967 , aged 71 , he died of a heart attack .

 Maxwell was born in the Sydney suburb of Forest Lodge , New South Wales , on 10 February 1896 to John Maxwell , a labourer , and his wife Elizabeth , née Stokes . A member of the Senior Australian Army Cadets for three years , he worked as an apprentice boilermaker at an engineering works near Newcastle upon leaving school . For two years , he served as a member of the Citizens Military Forces , and on 6 February 1915 , he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force enticed by the prospects of better pay .

 Having received his initial training at Liverpool Camp , Maxwell was allotted to " B " Company of the 18th Battalion as a lance corporal , and embarked for Egypt aboard HMAT Ceramic on 25 May 1915 . The 18th Battalion trained in Egypt from mid @-@ June until mid @-@ August , before proceeding to Gallipoli , where they landed at Anzac Cove on 22 August . The battalion fought its first battle on the same day , staging an attack on the Turkish @-@ held Hill 60 . The engagement lasted until 29 August , with half of the battalion becoming casualties , and Maxwell briefly assuming the duties of a stretcher bearer . 
 Maxwell served at Gallipoli with his unit until 2 December , when he was admitted to 5th Field Ambulance and evacuated from the peninsula suffering from jaundice . Admitted to 3rd Auxiliary Hospital , Heliopolis , he remained there until 11 December , when he was posted to a convalescent camp at Ras el Tin . He rejoined the 18th Battalion on 5 January 1916 , which had been evacuated from the Gallipoli Peninsula on 20 December the previous year and posted to Egypt . On 4 February , Maxwell was admitted to the Australian <unk> Hospital , Abbassia with venereal disease . He returned to his battalion four days before it embarked for France , and the Western Front on 18 March . 
 Arriving in Marseilles , France , Maxwell was admitted to 7th Australian Field Ambulance and then transferred to the 3rd Canadian General Hospital following wounds sustained during battle . He was moved to the 1st Convalescent Depot on 2 May , and then discharged to Base Details eleven days later . He was later found guilty of breaking ranks at the 07 : 30 parade on the same day and being absent without leave from 08 : 00 until 13 : 00 on 24 May ; for this transgression , he was reduced to the ranks . Rejoining his battalion on 1 June , he took part in the Battle of Pozières and received a promotion to sergeant in October . 
 Suffering <unk> to his right knee , Maxwell was hospitalised for two days and posted to a training battalion in England on 28 November 1916 . He stayed there for five months before embarking for France on 9 May 1917 and rejoining the 18th Battalion five days later . Maxwell was only briefly in France before being selected for officer training . Shortly after arriving in England , he attended a boisterous party with a group of soldiers . The military police raided the party and called the local police for assistance after confronting Maxwell 's group . Maxwell was fined £ 20 and sent back to his unit for his actions .

 Maxwell was again selected for officer training , and on 5 July , he was posted to No. 6 Officers ' Cadet Battalion . He was promoted to company sergeant major on 7 August , before rejoining the 18th Battalion on 11 September . Nine days later , he was engaged in action near <unk> during the Third Battle of Ypres when he performed the deeds that earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal . In the battle , the commander of a platoon was killed ; Maxwell took command and led it into attack . Noticing that one of the newly captured positions was under heavy fire , Maxwell dashed to it and led the men to a safer and more tactically secure position , thus minimizing casualties . 
 Commissioned in the field as a second lieutenant on 29 September 1917 , Maxwell took part in the engagements around Poelcappelle , Belgium , the following month . He earned promotion to lieutenant on 1 January 1918 and was admitted to the 7th Australian Field Ambulance on 10 January suffering scabies . Having been discharged from the hospital , he rejoined the 18th Battalion on 17 January . 
 On 8 March 1918 , Maxwell commanded a scouting patrol that was operating to the east of Ploegsteert . Having obtained the required information , he ordered the patrol to withdraw . He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby . Recalling the patrol , he led an attack against the party , which had sheltered in an old trench ; the Germans quickly withdrew , leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war . Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement , news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918 . 
 Throughout the spring of 1918 , the 18th Battalion was involved in operations to repel the German offensive . Maxwell took part in these actions until he was granted leave and went back to England on 17 July . He returned to France and rejoined the 18th Battalion on 1 August , before taking part in the Battle of Amiens where he was to earn a Bar to his Military Cross . On 9 August , the battalion was preparing to attack near <unk> . Maxwell took command of the company after all of its other officers became casualties . Under his leadership , the company was able to attack on time , despite being subjected to heavy fire . A tank that preceded the advance immediately became the object of enemy fire and was knocked out by a 77 mm gun . Maxwell , who was in close proximity , rushed over and opened the hatch , allowing the crew to escape . After escorting the tank commander to safety , Maxwell returned to lead the company in the attack , which succeeded in reaching and consolidating their objective . The award of the bar was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 1 February 1919 .

 On 3 October 1918 , the 5th Brigade — of which the 18th Battalion was part — became engaged in its last battle of the First World War when breaching the Hindenburg Line close to Beaurevoir and Montbrehain . While taking part in this battle , Maxwell was a member of the attacking party along the Beaurevoir @-@ <unk> line when he performed the acts for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 Early in the advance , Maxwell 's company commander was severely wounded , resulting in Maxwell assuming control . Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine @-@ gun fire , the company suffered heavy casualties , including all of the officers except Maxwell . Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire , Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun , killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners ; thereby enabling the company to move through the wire and reach their objective . Shortly afterwards , it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance . Gathering a party of men , Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear . They soon came under heavy machine gun fire , and , single @-@ handedly , Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun . Firing his revolver , he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun . 
 Later in the advance , Maxwell learnt from an English @-@ speaking prisoner that a group of Germans in the adjacent post wished to surrender , but were afraid to give themselves up . Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner — who was to act as an interpreter — Maxwell approached the post . The three Australians , however , were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed . They seemed set to become prisoners themselves , before an artillery barrage fell on the position . Taking advantage of the resulting confusion , Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire ; one of the privates was subsequently wounded . Organising a party of men , he immediately attacked and captured the post . 
 The full citation for Maxwell 's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 6 January 1919 , it read : 
 War Office , 6th January , 1919 
 His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers , Non @-@ commissioned Officers and Men : — 
 Lt. Joseph Maxwell , M.C. , <unk> , 18th Bn . , A.I.F. 
 For most conspicuous bravery and leadership in attack on the Beaurevoir @-@ <unk> line near Estates , North of St. Quentin , on the 3rd October , 1918 . 
 His company commander was severely wounded early in the advance , and Lt. Maxwell at once took charge . The enemy wire when reached under intense fire was found to be exceptionally strong and closely supported by machine guns , whereupon Lt. Maxwell pushed forward single @-@ handed through the wire and captured the most dangerous gun , killing three and capturing four enemy . He thus enabled his company to penetrate the wire and reach the objective . Later , he again dashed forward and silenced , single @-@ handed , a gun which was holding up a flank company . Subsequently , when with two men only he attempted to capture a strong party of the enemy , he handled a most involved situation very skilfully , and it was due to his resource that he and his comrades escaped . 
 Throughout the day Lt. Maxwell set a high example of personal bravery , coupled with excellent judgment and quick decision . 
 The 18th Battalion was training away from the frontline when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 . On 8 March 1919 , Maxwell was invested with his Victoria Cross by King George V in the ballroom of Buckingham Palace . He headed for Australia on 1 May aboard HT China , disembarking at Melbourne on 8 June and proceeding to Sydney , where he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 20 August .

 Following demobilisation , Maxwell worked as a gardener in Canberra , Moree and the Maitland district . Having described himself as a reporter , Maxwell married 19 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> Mabel Maxwell ( unrelated ) in a Catholic ceremony at Bellevue Hill , Sydney on 14 February 1921 . The marriage produced a daughter , Jean , before being dissolved in 1926 upon Mabel 's instigation . 
 On 11 November 1929 , Maxwell attended the New South Wales Dinner for recipients of the Victoria Cross in Sydney , and 1932 saw the publication of Hell 's Bells and <unk> , a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his experiences in the war . At the time , Maxwell was working as a gardener with the Department of the Interior in Canberra . The book was a success , but Maxwell soon spent what money he made from it . In the late 1930s , he wrote the manuscript for a second book entitled From the Hindenburg Line to the Breadline . The book was never published and the manuscript was lost when it was lent to someone to read . 
 In 1933 , Maxwell acted as a defence witness in the trial of Alfred Jamieson , who was accused of housebreaking . Maxwell was Jamieson 's former platoon commander and testified that Jamieson had been of good character but had been strongly affected by the war . 
 After the outbreak of the Second World War , Maxwell made several attempts to enlist , but was unsuccessful due to his age , and deteriorating health . He eventually travelled to Queensland , where he enlisted under the alias of Joseph Wells on 27 June 1940 . However , his identity was soon discovered and he was given a training position ; dissatisfied , he took his discharge on 9 September 1940 . 
 In 1952 , Maxwell joined the contingent of Victoria Cross recipients invited to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . On 6 March 1956 , describing himself as a journalist from Bondi , Maxwell married widow Anne Martin , née Burton , in Sydney . Three years later , he attended the Victoria Cross centenary celebrations in London , before later re @-@ visiting the battlefields in France .
