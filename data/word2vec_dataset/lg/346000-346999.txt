 Conan is the protagonist in many of Howard 's stories : a franchise has been built around the character , and Frank Frazetta 's paintings have further elevated the barbarian 's profile in pop culture . Howard presented his barbarian hero as a strong , shrewd , barbaric , and ambitious man in a primitive world of magic . His stories are simple and portray Conan overcoming a series of obstacles to defeat the antagonists with his physical prowess . Nihilistic originally intended to stay faithful to the literature , but the writers strayed from the canon by showing the barbarian as willing to use magic . The literary Conan abhors magic , but Nihilistic reasoned that , in order to restore his armor to its original non @-@ magical state , he is willing to use the magic it has been cursed with . 
 The developers did , however , stay true to the physical depictions of the barbarian . Reflecting how fights are described in the stories , players can kill foes in the goriest manner — dismembering and disemboweling them . Nihilistic wanted to show that the brutal killings are considered natural by Conan and not executed out of a thirst for blood . The inspiration for Conan 's moves came from several sources , but mostly from Frazetta 's artwork . The animators took several of Conan 's poses straight from the paintings and modeled his movements after those of the characters in the feature animation Tarzan and the action films Troy and Ong Bak . The names of several fighting techniques such as " <unk> 's Leap " , " Bel 's Gambit " , and " Camel Punch " were also based on names and events from the Conan stories and films . To garner extra publicity , the publisher THQ hired Golden Globe @-@ winning actor Ron Perlman to provide the voice for Conan . 
 Typical Conan stories by Howard featured leading females who were occasionally damsels in distress . However , they were also strong and fearless women who would rescue the hero at crucial moments . Nihilistic cast the game 's leading female character , A 'kanna , in this mold ; the warrior queen and Conan aid each other in several parts of the game . By contrast , there are topless , chained @-@ up women scattered across the game 's levels . However , these are only in the game because of the developer 's belief that nudity was integral to a Conan story . Showing their breasts and acting in a burlesque manner , these damsels @-@ in @-@ distress reward players with red runes when rescued . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Howard 's short story , " Queen of the Black Coast " , served as the inspiration for the game 's plot . In the short story , Conan has a brief romance with Bêlit , a pirate queen . Near the end of the story a demonic creature kills Bêlit and Conan seeks revenge . The creature , however , is stronger than Conan , overpowers him , and is about to kill him when Bêlit 's spirit startles it and inspires Conan to kill the beast . The game 's story follows a similar theme with A 'kanna in the role of Bêlit . Told as a campfire story , cut scenes — in the form of static artwork or animation rendered by the game engine — open and close each level with narratives from an elderly A 'kanna . 
 The story starts at <unk> Isle where Conan is raiding a tomb . Instead of finding treasure , he unknowingly frees Graven , a wizard who had been confined in a magical prison for his transgressions . Showing no gratitude , the wizard curses Conan 's armor , scatters it across the world , and teleports the barbarian away . Vowing to retrieve his armor , Conan meets A 'kanna while he is fighting through a pirate base . Teaming up with the barbarian to find his armor , the warrior queen hopes to use its magic to end the curse — the Black Death — that is causing her people to kill each other . Their quest leads players through several locations and boss creatures such as dragons , undead elephants , and <unk> . Flashbacks are shown when retrieving a piece of armor after killing certain bosses ; these back @-@ stories tell of Graven 's imprisonment of the gods , his plan to sacrifice his daughter A 'kanna , and his creation of the Black Death to transform the world to his liking . 
 In the last level , Conan has retrieved all of his armor and returns to <unk> Isle to rescue A 'kanna from her father . After a long boss fight and several button @-@ pressing sequences , Conan slays the wizard at the bottom of the ocean . Graven 's defeat frees the gods he had imprisoned , and they bring him back to life for eternal punishment . The story ends with the separation of the barbarian and the warrior queen . Conan goes on to fulfill his destiny to be a king as written in Howard 's stories . A 'kanna , however , grows old in a village , telling stories to children and never forgetting Conan . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 2005 , THQ acquired the rights to produce a series of video games featuring Conan the Barbarian and the world of Hyboria . This news came to the attention of Nihilistic Software who had just completed the action game Marvel Nemesis : Rise of the <unk> . The video game developer was looking to develop an action game similar to God of War for its next project and saw the world of Conan as a good setting . The team quickly built a prototype to demonstrate its concept to THQ and received approval for the project . The video game publisher officially announced the game to the industry on February 26 , 2007 . 
 Nihilistic decided to use the features of other action games for Conan . While God of War was its inspiration for the camera system , Ninja Gaiden was a great influence on the combat engine . The team wanted to emulate the complexity of Ninja Gaiden 's combat system , with many attacking options and an equal emphasis on being alert to the actions of enemies . Nihilistic also wanted the game to appeal to button mashing players as well as those who want to control their character with finesse . In addition , it designed the game to increase the frequency and difficulty of encounters as players advance through the levels . 
 Conan was developed to be released on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 . Although the architectures of the two consoles were very different , Nihilistic designed its product to perform equally on both of them , using force feedback and motion sensing to enhance the playing experience . Conan was originally scheduled for an early 2008 release , but was brought forward to the second half of 2007 because of THQ 's poor performance in that fiscal year . After the game was released in Europe , Nihilistic made demos of the game available for downloading over Xbox Live and PlayStation Network . 
 = = = Visual style = = = 
 The appearance of Howard 's Conan and Hyboria in the popular imagination owes much to Frazetta 's distinctive oil paintings . While Nihilistic 's writers tried to tell a story in Howard 's style , its artists attempted to emulate Frazetta 's style on the electronic display screen . Instead of making each computer representation as realistic as possible , they created models based mainly on their perception of each object 's intrinsic nature . The artists used video graphics technology such as normal mapping technique to emulate brush strokes on the models ' textures . These digital brush strokes were visible on the cliffs in the game . The character models were outlined with light colors instead of dark ones , creating the subtle blend of object and background found in oil paintings , and fog effects allowed the team to recreate Frazetta 's use of shadows in the middle area of the image . To complete the game 's appearance , the artists used darker color palettes , motifs , and themes to present a more serious mood , in harmony with the gore and nudity in the game . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Mike Reagan , a music composer noted for his work in video games such as Darkwatch and God of War , was hired by THQ to write the music for Conan . To begin , he wanted to compose simple but powerful melodies , and looked to Basil Poledouris 's score for the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian for inspiration . As Reagan played development copies of the game , he was influenced by two other works : Igor Stravinsky 's barbaric and sensual ballet music The Rite of Spring , and Bernard Hermann 's score from the 1958 action film The 7th Voyage of Sinbad . Each week , Nihilistic and Reagan updated each other with copies of their work @-@ in @-@ progress , synchronizing their efforts . Reagan also studied with noted percussion artists Denny Seiwell , Emil Richards , and Michael Duffy to gain further insight on the use of drums to accompany the game 's bloody and violent plot . After mastering the soundtrack , he brought the music of Conan to an October 2007 Video Games Live show , performing it live in Los Angeles , United States . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Conan received fair @-@ to @-@ good ratings from critics . In 2008 , review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings selected around 80 reviews and calculated average scores of 69 ( out of 100 ) and 70 % for the game , respectively . Most critics agreed that the game 's best selling point was its variety in combat . They had a lot of fun with its easy @-@ to @-@ learn controls , skill customization , and most of all , the varied brutal depictions of Conan 's kills . TeamXbox said that the combat system " blossoms into a complex string of commands that will reward the user ( with gore ) for pressing the right buttons at the right time " . The pounding , militaristic orchestra tunes accompanying the action further enhanced the critics ' experience with the game . 
 = = = God of war clone = = = 
 Many critics complained that Conan copied many ideas from God of War . Game Informer referred to this imitation as " [ Conan ] groveling at Kratos ' feet , begging for gameplay wisdom " . A few reviewers , however , found this forgivable and stated that the game was made to be fun without any higher ambitions . Conan 's camera system irritated several critics for failing to provide an adequate view of the situation at certain critical moments . Its puzzles were <unk> and lacked clear directions for proceeding to the next step . The artificial intelligence for the adversaries in the game was found to be predictable and flawed by a few critics . In addition , they found the final encounter with Graven to be overlong and frustrating . Calling the fight " as painful as a trip to the <unk> " , IGN and Game Informer judged it to be one of the worst boss fights in video game history . 
 = = = Game features = = = 
 The critics had mixed opinions about three prominent features of the game : voice acting , artwork , and faithfulness to Howard 's writings . Perlman earned acclaim for his vocal performance and gravely voice that matched the game 's dialogue , but he also received criticism for not sounding like a barbarian . A few applauded Nihilistic for capturing the oil painting feel of Frazetta 's art , but several others said that the graphics consisted of drab @-@ looking environments that were jagged @-@ edged and pixelated when zoomed in . Although the animations were rated to be smooth and vivid , the lack of variety among enemy character models was criticized . Several critics also praised Nihilistic for recreating the atmosphere of Howard 's stories . The decision to have Conan use magic was , however , called a " blasphemy " by IGN . G4techTV Canada disagreed and forgave the game on the grounds that it was mostly faithful to the books . Ray Huling of The Escapist said that the game 's developers misunderstood Conan 's appeal to the masses . In the journalist 's opinion , Howard 's depiction of Conan 's brutal physical nature called attention to the dull nature of their lives and offered them a temporary escape . Furthermore , Huling said that Nihilistic used the characteristics of Conan for superficial purposes , and that , in copying the mechanics of another game without any groundbreaking innovations of its own , Nihilistic missed the essence of Howard 's stories and created a shell of what its game could have been . 
 Despite the generally favorable reviews and success of Howard 's franchise , Critics enjoyed Conan 's combat system and gory kills , but said that the game failed to match the experience offered in God of War . Reactions varied on the game 's depiction of the Conan universe ; several critics praised the emulation of Frank Frazetta 's famous artwork , but others found the game 's graphics drab and of low resolution . Regarding the audio , Golden Globe @-@ winning actor Ron Perlman was both praised and criticized for his voice work as Conan . Composer Mike Reagan received acclaim for the game 's music and later gave live performances of the game 's soundtrack at Video Games Live shows . 
 = = = Sales = = = 
 Despite the generally favorable reviews and commercial success of the Conan franchise , Conan sold poorly and failed to recoup THQ 's investment . The publisher publicly announced that the game 's poor sales contributed to their US $ 20 million write @-@ off in fiscal year 2008 . 
 = = = Mature content = = = 
 Although the game 's violence was praised by the gaming industry , it was condemned by the National Institute on Media and the Family , which placed Conan on a list of games that parents were urged to avoid buying for their children . Conan 's Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board , largely due to its violent content , made the game a target for a law being pushed in California , United States . Proposed in 2005 , the law was intended to regulate sales of Mature @-@ rated games . It was blocked by a legal challenge from the gaming industry in 2007 , but California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , who played Conan in the 1982 film , appealed the judgment , seeking to ensure that Conan and other games with similar levels of violence would be sold only to those above the age of 17 . On February 20 , 2009 , His appeal was rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , who ruled that such a restriction violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . 
 = SMS Geier = 
 SMS Geier ( " His Majesty 's Ship Geier — Vulture " ) was an unprotected cruiser of the Bussard class built for the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . She was laid down in 1893 at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven , launched in October 1894 , and commissioned into the fleet a year later in October 1895 . The ship was designed for service in Germany 's overseas colonies , which required the comparatively heavy armament of eight 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and a long cruising radius . She had a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 kn ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) . 
 Geier spent the majority of her career on foreign stations , including tours in the Americas , East Asia , and Africa . In 1897 , she was deployed to the Caribbean , and the following year she became involved in the Spanish – American War , crossing the blockade lines around Cuban ports to ferry Europeans out of the war zone to Mexico . After being transferred to the western coast of the Americas in 1899 , Geier was reassigned to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 . She remained in East Asian waters through 1905 before being recalled to Germany for major repairs . In 1911 , the ship was assigned to the colony in German East Africa , though she served little time in the area , as the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 1912 and the Balkan Wars of 1912 – 13 required German warships in the Mediterranean to safeguard German interests . Geier returned to East Africa in early 1914 , but in June that month , the new light cruiser Königsberg arrived , relieving Geier for a second deployment to China . 
 Geier was still en route to the German base in Tsingtao when war broke out in Europe in August 1914 . She slipped out of still @-@ neutral British Singapore days before Britain declared war on Germany and crossed the central Pacific in an attempt to link up with Maximilian von Spee 's East Asia Squadron . While at sea , she captured one British freighter , but did not sink her . In need of engine repairs and coal , Geier put into the neutral United States port at Honolulu , Hawaii in October 1914 , where she was eventually interned . After the American entrance into the war in April 1917 , the US Navy seized Geier and commissioned her as USS Schurz and placed her on convoy duty . She was ultimately sunk following a collision with a freighter off the coast of North Carolina , with one man killed and twelve injured . She rests at a depth of 115 feet ( 35 m ) and is a popular scuba diving site . 
 = = Design = = 
 Geier was 83 @.@ 9 meters ( 275 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 10 @.@ 6 m ( 35 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 74 m ( 15 @.@ 6 ft ) forward . She displaced 1 @,@ 918 t ( 1 @,@ 888 long tons ; 2 @,@ 114 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by four coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . These provided a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 kn ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) and a range of approximately 3 @,@ 610 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 690 km ; 4 @,@ 150 mi ) at 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with eight 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns in single pedestal mounts , supplied with 800 rounds of ammunition in total . They had a range of 10 @,@ 800 m ( 35 @,@ 400 ft ) . Two guns were placed side by side forward , two on each broadside , and two side by side aft . The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon . She was also equipped with two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes , both of which were mounted on the deck . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Geier was ordered under the contract name " F " and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in 1893 . She was launched on 18 October 1894 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . During her launching ceremony , Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Victor Valois christened the ship . She was commissioned into the German Navy on 24 October 1895 for sea trials . Her trials were completed on 21 January 1896 , and she was decommissioned temporarily in Kiel . During construction , her design was slightly modified based on experience from her sister ships that had already completed their sea trials . Geier 's displacement was increased slightly by around 50 t ( 49 long tons ; 55 short tons ) compared to the other ships of the class and her stern was modified . 
 = = = First deployment abroad = = = 
 Geier was recommissioned on 1 December 1897 for her first deployment abroad , to the West Indies . Until then , Germany had relied on school ships to protect German nationals in the region . Rising tensions in Haiti prompted the Admiralstab ( Admiralty Staff ) to send Geier to the Caribbean , replacing the old ironclad Oldenburg that had been scheduled to deploy there . The ironclad König Wilhelm , which had recently been rebuilt into an armored cruiser , was sent to strengthen the German naval contingent . Geier departed Kiel on 9 December and arrived in Charlotte Amalie in the Danish West Indies on 3 January 1898 , where she rendezvoused with the school ships Charlotte and Stein . Charlotte and Stein had already taken care of the situation in Haiti , so Geier went to Santiago de Cuba , where she stayed from 24 March to 6 April . She then received an order to visit Brazilian and Argentinian ports ; stops included Pernambuco in Brazil ( 16 – 20 April ) and Bahía Blanca in Argentina ( 23 April ) . While she was in the latter port , her tour of South America was cut short due to the outbreak of the Spanish – American War . 
 On 6 May she arrived in Saint Thomas . She thereafter made trips to Santiago de Cuba and San Juan . While in San Juan on 13 – 14 May , Geier witnessed an American squadron under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson bombard the city . The US government permitted Geier to cross the blockade line outside Havana to evacuate twenty civilians of various nationalities and take them to Veracruz in Mexico , arriving on the 29th . There , the governor of the city and the artillery officer from the training ship Zaragoza visited Geier for some practice torpedo launches . While Geier was in Mexico , the German ambassador invited her commander and 27 men to visit Mexico City , where they were received by President Porfirio Díaz . Geier thereafter returned to Cuba . On 16 June , the ship called on the port of Cienfuegos in Cuba . She passed through the American blockade of Santiago de Cuba twice , on 22 – 29 June and 1 – 4 August . 
 After the war ended , Geier visited New Orleans on 14 October , departing eleven days later for the Caribbean . She then resumed her tour of South America that had been interrupted by the war . She typically stopped in ports where significant numbers of Germans had emigrated . While in Buenos Aires , she received an order to proceed to the west coast of the continent . She transited the Straits of Magellan on 20 – 23 February 1899 and made stops in Valparaiso , Chile , Callao , Peru , and Panama . From 11 to 17 May , she stopped in Puerto San José , Guatemala , where she met a British cruiser ; the two ships were sent there to settle financial disputes with the Guatemalan government . Geier 's tour continued , with stops in Corinto , Nicaragua , Guayaquil , Ecuador , and <unk> , Costa Rica While in Corinto , she received orders to proceed further north , to the western coast of the United States and Canada . She stopped in Acapulco before arriving in San Francisco on 14 August , where she underwent a boiler overhaul . On 18 September , she departed San Francisco bound for Vancouver , stopping in Esquimalt en route . On 18 October , she left Vancouver and began her return voyage south . She visited Chilean harbors in January and February 1900 , including Puerto Montt on 14 February , before turning back north , as she had been assigned to the newly @-@ created West American station . 
 While in Acapulco on 9 July , Geier was ordered to cross the Pacific to join the forces of the Eight Nation Alliance fighting the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China . She left port on 11 July for Yokohama , Japan , by way of Honolulu , Hawaii . She arrived in Chefoo on 29 August , where she joined the ships of the East Asia Squadron . Geier first patrolled the Bohai Sea before docking in Tsingtao at the German @-@ held Kiautschou Bay concession in October . On 28 October , she steamed to Shanghai , where she remained until February 1901 . Geier then steamed up the Yangtze to Chungking , where she replaced her sister ship Bussard . On 5 April , Geier returned to Tsingtao ; on the 29th , she was transferred to the coast of central China , where she replaced another sister , Seeadler . Geier returned to Tsingtao on 18 July , and began a tour of Korean and Japanese ports four days later with the flagship of the East Asia Squadron , Fürst Bismarck . The next twelve months were filled with cruises in the region . 
 On 15 October 1902 , Geier began a long cruise south to the Dutch East Indies , which also included a stop in Singapore . The ship entered the dry dock in Nagasaki , Japan , for a major overhaul on 2 March 1903 , which lasted until 26 April . At this time , Geier was formally assigned to the East Asia Squadron . The ship resumed its normal routine of cruises in East Asian waters with stops in various ports . In February 1904 , the Russo @-@ Japanese War broke out ; from April to August , Geier was in Chemulpo , which had been captured by the Japanese . By 1905 , the ship was worn out , having spent over seven years on foreign stations . The repair facilities in Tsingtao were insufficient for the amount of work that needed to be done , and so Geier was ordered to return to Germany . She left Tsingtao on 14 January and arrived in Kiel on 16 March , where she was decommissioned for a significant period of repair work . Her three @-@ masted schooner barque rig was reduced to a two @-@ masted topsail schooner rig . 
 = = = Second overseas deployment = = = 
 In early 1911 , Geier was recommissioned to replace the unprotected cruiser Sperber on the East African Station , based in German East Africa . On 2 May she left Danzig , arriving in Kiel the following day . There , she was equipped for the deployment abroad . The ship left Kiel on 8 May and arrived in Dar es Salaam on 9 July , where she joined Seeadler . She cruised the colony 's coast , but at the end of September she was ordered to the Mediterranean Sea , as the Italo @-@ Turkish War had broken out on the 29th . At the time , the only German warship in the Mediterranean was the old aviso Loreley , the station ship in Constantinople ; this was a result of the heightened tensions in Europe following the Agadir Crisis in July , as most German warships in European waters had been recalled to Germany . 
 Geier 's departure for the Mediterranean was delayed by a coal fire in Dar es Salaam , which required her crew to put out . She left East Africa on 2 October and arrived in Piraeus , Greece on 16 October , where she remained until January 1912 . She was then formally assigned to the Mediterranean Division , along with the recently @-@ arrived battlecruiser Goeben . From mid @-@ April to mid @-@ July , she made trips to provide humanitarian assistance in Libya , Palestine , and the Red Sea . These were interrupted by the arrival of Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht Hohenzollern ; the two ships cruised to the island of Corfu in early May . On 17 July , Geier went to Trieste in Austria @-@ Hungary for an overhaul that lasted until 30 September . She thereafter went on a cruise of the eastern Mediterranean and visited several ports . 
 While she was loading coal in Haifa on 31 January 1913 , a coal dust explosion killed two crew members . While cruising Turkish waters in August , she was ordered to replace the light cruiser Breslau in the international naval blockade of Montenegro during the Second Balkan War . She arrived off the mouth of the Bojana River in Montenegro on 11 August , which she patrolled until 14 October , when she was released for a major overhaul in <unk> . After repairs were completed on 4 January 1914 , she was ordered to return to the East Africa Station . She arrived there on 22 February and conducted a survey of the harbor at Tanga . On 6 May , the ship was formally reclassified as a gunboat . The light cruiser Königsberg arrived on 5 June to replace Geier , which was then reassigned to the South Seas Station , where she would in turn replace her sister Condor . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Geier 's captain learned of the rising tensions in Europe following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria while en route to the Pacific . The ship coaled in Singapore on 25 – 29 July , departing the day after Austria @-@ Hungary declared war on Serbia . Geier thereafter proceeded southeast through the Gaspar Strait , rather than north to Tsingtao , where he would be expected to go . While off Batavia on 1 August , Geier received the order from Maximilian von Spee , the commander of the East Asia Squadron , to join him at Yap . On 3 . August , she received word of the German mobilization and the order to begin cruiser warfare . She coaled at <unk> from the steamer Elmshorn of the Deutsch @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ Gesellschaft ( <unk> ) on 6 August before steaming north through the Buton Strait . Off Celebes she rendezvoused with the <unk> steamer Bochum , which acted as her collier . 
 Geier 's crew made temporary repairs to the ship 's engines and boilers before proceeding north to the Palau Islands . Bochum took Geier under tow to conserve coal . On 20 August , she managed to contact the cruiser Emden , which was detached from the East Asia Squadron and operating as a commerce raider . Emden instructed Geier to rendezvous at the island of Anguar , but she was unable to reach the island before Emden departed . Nevertheless , the two ships met at sea the following day ; one of Geier 's cutters took her commander , Lieutenant Commander Curt Graßhoff , aboard Emden to meet with her captain . Emden then departed for the Molucca Strait , while Geier proceeded to Anguar . After arriving , Geier coaled from the HAPAG steamer Tsingtau . Graßhoff intended to rendezvous with the East Asia Squadron in the central Pacific , and proceeded through the Bismarck Archipelago before turning north to <unk> . There , on 4 September , Geier captured the British freighter Southport and disabled the ship 's engines before departing . The freighter 's crew repaired the damage , however , and Southport made for Australia where she reported the German gunboat 's presence . 
 On 11 September , Geier arrived in Majuro , though the East Asia Squadron had already departed the island on 30 August . By this time , the ship 's engines were in such bad shape that she would have been unable to reach Tsingtao , though the point was moot , as Japanese forces had already besieged the port . In addition , opportunities for commerce raiding in the area were slim , and there were no suitably fast steamers available to arm as auxiliary cruisers . Graßhoff therefore decided to follow the East Asia Squadron to South America , despite the slow speed of his ship , which was reduced to 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . The Norddeutscher Lloyd ( NDL ) steamer <unk> towed Geier to the Marshall Islands , where further repairs were made from 17 to 20 September . By this time , the ship 's coal and water supplies were so low that the ship would not be able to continue past Hawaii . She arrived in Honolulu on 15 October , where the then @-@ neutral Americans requested that Geier be interned . Two Japanese ships — the battleship , Hizen , and the armored cruiser , Asama — had been patrolling in the area . Upon learning of the arrival of Geier , the two ships remained just outside the three mile limit to await Geier 's departure . Graßhoff was able to delay the internment request until 7 November owing to damage to the ship and poor weather . The following day , the US Navy interned Geier . 
 = = = Service as USS Schurz = = = 
 The United States entered the war on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917 . The US Navy seized Geier and refitted her for service in the Navy . The ship was renamed USS Schurz on 9 June , and commissioned on 15 September 1917 , under the command of Commander Arthur Crenshaw . Schurz departed Pearl Harbor on 31 October and escorted Submarine Division 3 to San Diego . Arriving on 12 November , she continued on with the submarines K @-@ 3 , K @-@ 4 , K @-@ 7 , and K @-@ 8 , in early December . At the end of the month , the convoy transited the Panama Canal and proceeded to Honduras . On 4 January 1918 , Schurz was relieved of escort duty . She carried the American consul from Puerto Cortes to <unk> and back , after which she sailed for Key West . From Florida , she was transferred to New Orleans and then sailed for Charleston , South Carolina on 1 February where she entered dry dock for periodic maintenance . 
 Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment , Schurz departed Charleston toward the end of April and , for the next two months , conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean . On 19 June , she departed New York for Key West . At <unk> on the 21st , southwest of Cape Lookout lightship , she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida . The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side , crumpling that wing of the bridge , penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet , and cutting through bunker no . 3 to the forward fire room . One of Schurz 's crewmen was killed instantly ; twelve others were injured . Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later . The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918 .

 The wreckage rests at a depth of 115 feet ( 35 m ) with the top of the wreck situated at 95 feet ( 29 m ) . In 2000 , the ship was subject of a Phase II archaeological investigation headed by East Carolina University . The wreck is protected by sovereign immunity and it is therefore illegal to recover artifacts from the site without permission . In 2013 , Scuba Diving magazine named USS Schurz as one of the top ten wreck dives in North Carolina .

 " Antes de las Seis " ( English : " Before Six O 'Clock " ) is a song recorded by Colombian singer @-@ songwriter Shakira for her ninth studio album Sale el Sol ( 2010 ) . Written and produced by the singer and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez , " Antes de las Seis " is one of the " romantic " songs from the album and is musically a Latin pop ballad . It features a simple piano and acoustic guitar @-@ supplemented beat over which Shakira delivers sad and emotional vocals . Epic Records released the song as the fourth single from Sale el Sol on 21 October 2011 . 
 Critics gave positive reviews to " Antes de las Seis " , complimenting its lyrical content . The song performed poorly on singles charts , but was moderately successful on airplay charts . It reached number 1 on the Spanish Airplay Chart and peaked at number 14 on the Monitor Latino chart in Mexico . In the United States , it peaked at numbers 21 and 4 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Airplay charts , respectively . In 2013 , " Antes de las Seis " was certified gold in Mexico . 
 The song was performed during the encore segment of the concert shows of Shakira 's The Sun Comes Out World Tour in 2010 and 2011 . A recording of its performance at the show in Paris , France , served as the promotional music video of the song . It was also used to promote Shakira 's fourth live album Live from Paris .

The album was positively received by most music critics and was praised for its distinguished nature and Shakira 's experimentation with electropop . Commercially , She Wolf was a success , topping charts and attaining gold and platinum certifications in several South American and European territories . However , it performed poorly in the United States and became Shakira 's first studio album since Dónde Están los Ladrones ? ( 1998 ) to miss charting inside the top 10 after it peaked at number 15 on the US Billboard Hot 200 chart . In May 2010 , she wrote and recorded " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " , the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup , which became a worldwide hit . 
 Following the global success of the song , Shakira began work on her ninth studio album Sale el Sol . She split the album into three " directions , " one of which she described as " romantic " in nature . Shakira felt it was something she had not " tapped into for the past three years , " and its inclusion in the album resulted in " very intense , very romantic " songs . " Antes de las Seis " is one such song from the album . The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez , who had previously worked with her on songs including " Underneath Your Clothes " ( 2002 ) and " La Tortura " ( 2005 ) . The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar . According to Jennifer Schaffer from the The Stanford Daily , its " softer " production helps in putting the focus on Shakira 's voice , which she opined had been " stripped to its sensitive core . " The singer delivers sad and emotional vocals that address issues of " longing , regrets and loneliness . " Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it , saying : " We all go through hard moments . Whatever happened , it 's right there in the songs . I 've decided that I 'm not going to explain every song this time . It 's hard to explain a song . These songs explain me better than I can explain them . "

 " Antes de las Seis " received generally positive reviews from music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic highlighted it as an example of Shakira 's versatility and commented that the album " catches its breath on the ballad . " Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly termed the song a " gorgeous ballad " and encouraged readers to download it . Jesus Yanez @-@ Reyes from Northern Arizona News gave " Antes de las Seis " a very positive review and praised its lyrics and Shakira 's " heartfelt " vocal delivery as having the ability " to overcome whatever language barriers may exist between the artist and the listener , truly making it a song of note within the release . " Jennifer Schaffer from the Stanford Daily complimented the sensitivity of the song and commented that " Shakira offers her listeners a far more vulnerable persona " through it . Carlos Macias from Terra Music picked " Antes de las Seis " as his favourite track from the album and commended its lyrics , calling them " classic Shakira " and concluding that " It 'd been a while since the Colombian superstar offered us an insight into her heart . " At the Premios Nuestra Tierra awards ceremony in 2012 , " Antes de las Seis " was nominated for " Mejor <unk> Pop Del Año " ( " Best Pop Performance of the Year " ) .

 Commercially , the song was moderately successful in Hispanic regions . In Mexico , " Antes de las Seis " peaked at number 14 on the Monitor Latino airplay chart . In Spain , it topped the PROMUSICAE airplay chart , although it failed to chart on the main singles chart . Similarly , the song was successful on the Billboard Latin Pop Airplay chart in the United States , on which it peaked at number 4 , but performed poorly on the main Hot Latin Songs chart , reaching only number 21 . " Antes de las Seis " is the only single from Sale el Sol to not chart inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart . In 2013 , the Mexican Association of Phonograph Producers ( AMPROFON ) certified " Antes de las Seis " gold for selling 30 @,@ 000 units in Mexico .

 The song was included on the set list of Shakira 's The Sun Comes Out World Tour in 2010 and 2011 , and was performed as the opening song of the encore segment of the concert shows . She sang it dressed in a large " feathery " royal blue dress , and towards the end of the performance artificial snow flakes started falling from the sky . A recording of the performance during the concert held at the Palais Omnisports de Paris @-@ Bercy arena in Paris , France , served as the music video of " Antes de las Seis " . The video was also used to promote Shakira 's fourth live album Live from Paris .

 State Route 339 ( SR 339 ) was a 8 @.@ 5 @-@ nautical @-@ mile @-@ long ( 9 @.@ 8 mi ; 15 @.@ 7 km ) ferry route designated as a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington . It connected Vashon Island 's Vashon Heights ferry terminal to downtown Seattle 's Pier 50 , via a passenger @-@ only ferry , the MV Skagit . The ferry was financed by the King County Ferry District ( KCFD ) and tolls collected at Pier 50 . Despite being part of the KCFD , the ferry was operated by Washington State Ferries ( WSF ) . SR 339 was one of only four ferry routes providing access to and from Vashon Island , and had the lowest annual average ridership of the four routes . The state of Washington took over the operation of the ferry route in 1951 , and designated it SR 339 in 1994 . The ferry was discontinued in 2006 and was replaced by a King County Water Taxi route . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The entire route of SR 339 was in Puget Sound and was served by the MV Skagit . The passenger @-@ only ferry started out from the Vashon Heights ferry terminal on Vashon Island and headed in a northerly direction , passing Blake Island State Park on the west . It briefly sailed into Kitsap County before the route turned east and passed the Alki Point Light and Alki Point before entering Elliott Bay , and docking at WSF 's Pier 50 , just south of Colman Dock , where the rest of the WSF operated ferries dock in Seattle . 
 Traveling at a top speed of 25 knots ( 29 mph ) , the MV Skagit made the crossing in about 35 minutes . There were three crossings each direction Monday – Friday , and no service on Saturday or Sunday . 
 Vashon Island is only connected to the rest of the region via three different WSF ferries departing from the Vashon dock , the other route departing from the Tahlequah dock on the south end of the island . SR 339 was the only passenger @-@ only ferry that served the island ; the other three ferries are auto ferries . 
 = = History = = 
 Ferries have provided transportation to and from Vashon Island since the days of the Seattle Mosquito Fleet , but the state government took over the operation of the Vashon Island ferry on June 1 , 1951 . The MV Skagit was built in 1989 , and the ferry began service on the Seattle – Vashon Island route on April 23 , 1990 . The route was designated as a state highway , along with the rest of the state ferry system , in 1994 . In 2003 the average daily ridership was 827 passengers per day , based on a five @-@ day week , compared to 1 @,@ 015 passengers on average when the route operated on a six @-@ day schedule in 1999 . This number has decreased in 2004 , with an average of 529 passengers per day traveling on the ferry . The passenger @-@ only service between <unk> Island and Seattle ended in 2006 . WSF operated and maintained the MV Skagit , but by July 2009 the KCFD was to assume all responsibilities of the operation . The route no longer received state funding , and King County was to be responsible for all costs of the route to be funded by property taxes . The MV Skagit was sold in 2011 to a ferry operator in Tanzania , where it connected Zanzibar to the mainland until it sank on July 18 , 2012 . 
 The Seattle – Vashon Island run was transferred to the King County Ferry District in 2007 , now operated as a King County Water Taxi route .

 = Colbert @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Colbert class were a pair of armored frigates built for the French Navy during the 1870s . The ships served as the flagships of the commander and deputy commander of the Mediterranean Squadron for most of their careers . The sister ships took part in the French conquest of Tunisia , notably shelling and landing troops in Sfax in 1881 . They were relegated to second @-@ line roles in 1894 – 95 before being condemned in 1900 . The ships were finally sold for scrap in 1909 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Colbert @-@ class ships were designed by Constructor Sabattier as improved versions of the ironclad Richelieu and were the last ships authorized by the 1857 Naval Program . They reverted to a single propeller shaft to improve their sailing qualities and to lessen the chance of the propellers being fouled by fallen rigging . As central battery ironclads , they had their armament concentrated amidships . Like most ironclads of their era , they were equipped with a plough @-@ shaped ram . The ships ' crew numbered 774 officers and men . Their metacentric height was low , a little above 0 @.@ 6 meters ( 2 ft ) . 
 The ships measured 101 @.@ 1 – 102 @.@ 1 meters ( 331 ft 8 in – 335 ft 0 in ) overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 57 – 17 @.@ 7 meters ( 57 ft 8 in – 58 ft 1 in ) .

 While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known , it is believed that reduction of the French Navy 's budget after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 and out @-@ of @-@ date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes .

 = ATLiens = 
 ATLiens is the second studio album by American hip hop duo OutKast , released on August 27 , 1996 , by LaFace Records . The duo wanted to improve on their 1994 debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik and gain respect for their growing Southern hip hop scene . OutKast recorded ATLiens in sessions at several Atlanta studios — Bosstown Recording Studios , Doppler Recording Studios , PatchWerk Recording Studio , Purple Dragon Studios , and Studio LaCoCo — as well as Chung King Recording Studio and Sound On Sound Recording in New York City . 
 The record features outer space @-@ inspired production sounds , with OutKast and producers Organized Noize incorporating elements of dub , reggae , and gospel into the compositions . Several songs feature the duo 's first attempts at producing music by themselves . Lyrically , the group discusses a wide range of topics including urban life as hustlers , existential introspection , and extraterrestrial life . The album 's title is a portmanteau of " ATL " ( an abbreviation of Atlanta , Georgia ) and " aliens " , which has been interpreted by critics as a commentary about the feeling of being isolated from American culture . 
 ATLiens debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart , and it sold nearly 350 @,@ 000 copies in its first two weeks of release . The album was very well received by music critics upon its release , who praised the record 's lyrical content . It has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , for shipments of two million copies in the United States . The album spawned the singles " Elevators ( Me & You ) " , " ATLiens " , and " Jazzy Belle " . Since its release , ATLiens has been listed by several magazines and critics as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1994 , OutKast released their debut album , Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik , which was recorded when members Big Boi and André 3000 were eighteen years old . Bolstered by the success of the single " Player 's Ball " , the record established OutKast as prominent figures in the Southern hip hop scene . After the album was certified platinum , LaFace Records gave OutKast more creative control and advanced money for their 1996 follow @-@ up album ATLiens . The duo took the opportunity to recreate their image . On a trip to Jamaica with producer Mr. DJ , the two decided to abandon their <unk> hairstyles in favor of a more natural aesthetic , vowing to stop combing their hair . Dungeon Family member Big Rube observed an increase in the duo 's confidence after returning from their first tour , remarking , " They started understanding the power they had in their music . They started showing a swagger that certain artists have — the ones that are stars . " The members also underwent changes in their personal lives ; in 1995 , Big Boi 's girlfriend gave birth to their first child and André 3000 and Total 's Keisha Spivey ended their two @-@ year relationship . 
 Despite its success , Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik had some detractors , including hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album 's style . As the East Coast and West Coast hip hop scenes were already well @-@ established at the time , many did not view the South as a legitimate and respectable scene . At the 1995 Source Awards , an award ceremony held by The Source magazine , OutKast won in the " Best Newcomer " category , but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech ; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs , while André 3000 was nervous and said , " The South got somethin ' to say . " The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners , " People thought that the South basically only had bass music . At first people were looking at us like ' Um , I don 't know . ' " Taken aback by the backlash , André 3000 and Big Boi channelled their frustration in the studio to improve upon their debut . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 After acquiring their own recording studio , the duo immediately started working on new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and studio equipment , as they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers . The two also became more accustomed to playing live , particularly Big Boi , and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle , as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense , became a vegetarian , and stopped smoking marijuana . Having dropped out months before graduation , André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens . 
 Before beginning work on ATLiens , André 3000 purchased an <unk> drum machine , an MPC3000 sampler , a <unk> mixing board , and turntables with stacks of classic records . Although he had never produced a song before , he used techniques learned from observing the Dungeon Crew at work . " Elevators ( Me & You ) " was the first song the duo created together for the album . The duo refrained from sampling on the album , with Big Boi explaining " I feel like you cheat the listener when you sample . If it 's an old school jam , leave it to the old . We wanna have our own school of music . " 
 OutKast recorded the album in sessions at several Atlanta studios — Bosstown Recording Studios , Doppler Recording Studios , PatchWerk Recording Studio , Purple Dragon Studios , and Studio LaCoCo — as well as Chung King Recording Studio and Sound On Sound Recording in New York City . For ATLiens , the band aimed for a consistent set of songs in which a listener would not need to skip tracks ; OutKast wrote around 35 songs for the album and reduced them to fourteen . The duo 's songwriting style for the album had no solid structure and was mostly spontaneous ; Big Boi noted , " Stuff 'll just come to you . I 'll be sittin ' in the truck , and I 'll start <unk> ' . People look at me like I 'm crazy , but that 's how it starts . "

 Two @-@ thirds of the album is produced by Organized Noize , OutKast 's primary production team . The rest is produced by Earthtone III , a production team that includes OutKast themselves and Mr. DJ . André 3000 and Big Boi produced the songs " Jazzy Belle " and " Elevators ( Me & You ) " . It also has a notably more laid @-@ back , spacey production sound , which they expanded upon on their follow @-@ up album Aquemini . Although the group drew from George Clinton 's outer @-@ space inspired compositions , the band utilizes a more laid @-@ back style as opposed to Clinton 's hard funk leanings . Many tracks feature strong echo and reverb , taking influence from dub and reggae . Andrea Comer of The Hartford Courant perceives an " extraterrestrial feel " in the record 's production . 
 OutKast also incorporated elements of gospel into the music ; being from the South , the group felt obligated to " stay close to [ their ] slave roots " . The album 's introduction track " You May Die " has been described as " churchy " . " Elevators ( Me & You ) " contains atmospheric elements including echoes , dub @-@ influenced bass , organ riffs , and telephone tones . " 13th Floor / Growing Old " contains a spoken word introduction from Big Rube , somber soul vocals from Debra Killings , and a " Prince @-@ ish " piano riff , while " <unk> of Steel " features " furious " turntable scratching by Mr. DJ . " Extraterrestrial " offers a break in the continuity of the record as it features no drum beat . 
 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 Lyrically , André 3000 and Big Boi abandon the " hard @-@ partying playa characters " of their debut album in favor of more spacey , funky , and futuristic personas on ATLiens . With their lyrics , the duo hoped to reflect on maturity in the wake of the birth of Big Boi 's daughter . André 3000 explained , " It 's like everybody 's talking about sipping champagne and being big time , so we just took it upon ourselves to do something new ... I want my children to say , ' Daddy really said something , he wasn 't just trying to brag on himself . ' " Many songs on ATLiens feature more unconventional subject matter for hip hop . The lyrical content ranges from addressing urban life as hustlers and pimps to extraterrestrial life and space travel . The title track 's chorus expresses Southern pride , while its verses feature André 3000 explaining his newly adopted drug @-@ free lifestyle . 
 " Elevators ( Me & You ) " illustrates OutKast 's rise to fame , and was inspired by a show the band played at Howard University with P. Diddy in the audience . The song also discusses the unlikely partnership of André 3000 and Big Boi , and uses the metaphor of an elevator for the ups and downs of fame . The final verse illustrates André 3000 dealing with a fan who pretends to have been childhood friends with him . It also references Southern culture , including mentions of Cadillacs and extended family gatherings . " Babylon " reflects on religious attitudes towards sex and illustrates André 3000 's upbringing and his forbidden attractions throughout childhood . " Jazzy Belle " discusses the group 's " increasingly enlightened " view regarding women : " Went from <unk> ' ... bitches and hoes to queen <unk> " . The album 's closer " 13th Floor / Growing Old " is a meditation on aging and emphasizes Southern hip hop 's legitimacy .

 ATLiens was released on August 27 , 1996 , by LaFace Records . In September , LaFace created a promotion for the record in conjunction with Blockbuster in which customers could enter to win a 1970s Cadillac car , emphasizing OutKast and Cadillac 's connection with the Southern lifestyle . The record 's inner booklet features a 24 @-@ page comic strip foldout starring the members , who must defend " positive music " against the villain <unk> . The strip continues in the artwork for each single released from ATLiens except for " Elevators ( Me & You ) " . 
 The album 's title is a portmanteau of " ATL " ( an abbreviation of Atlanta , Georgia ) and " aliens " . In his book Icons of Hip Hop : An Encyclopedia of the Movement , Music , and Culture , author Mickey Hess interprets the album 's title as " partly a statement about being from Atlanta , while also signifying on the theme of the group 's name ( by using the term aliens ) framing themselves as societal outcasts . " Mark Bould , author of The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction , observes that the title symbolizes OutKast 's " estrangement from American society " , suggesting that " the inner city of their formative years is out of this world and its hostile conditions .

 ATLiens received critical acclaim from contemporary music critics . Andrea Comer of The Hartford Courant felt that OutKast 's " lyrical acumen shines through " despite " Heltah @-@ Skeltah mumbling and Southern slang " , and stated , " after a few rotations , the alien feeling wears away , and [ the album is ] just out of this world . " Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution called the album " more thoughtful " than its predecessor , noting , " What the second album lacks in adventurous arrangements it more than makes up for in lyrical dominance . " The Source observed " growth " from OutKast and Organized Noize , and stated , " Big Boi and Dre have gone out of this world into a new dimension of sight , sound and mind " . 
 Kevin Powell of Rolling Stone felt that , like OutKast 's debut album , ATLiens is " a gritty document of what 's happening here and now , an up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute briefing on Southern black ghetto life on which OutKast members Andre and Big Boi cast their feelings of alienation in familiar , realistic characterizations " . Powell asserted that unlike East Coast hip hop 's " hedonistic materialism " or " the gunplay and <unk> " of West Coast hip hop , " Andre and Big Boi display a unique ability to describe ghetto life while offering up life @-@ affirming possibilities , something all too rare in today 's hip @-@ hop nation . " Richard Harrington of The Washington Post enjoyed the record 's " more serious and focused lyrical sensibility " , explaining , " The raps are generally inventive , clever without being cloying , more proof ( if any were needed ) that hip @-@ hop innovation isn 't just an East @-@ West thang .

 In a retrospective review , Allmusic editor Steve Huey viewed the album as OutKast 's " most focused work " and commented that " In addition to the striking musical leap forward , Dre and Big Boi continue to grow as rappers ; their flows are getting more tongue @-@ <unk> complex , and their lyrics more free @-@ associative " . RapReviews critic Steve Juon recommended it to listeners who " want to be challenged by [ their ] hip @-@ hop " and wrote of the album 's aesthetic : 
 It 's deep . So deep that listening to ATLiens you might feel like drowning , but the smooth vo @-@ <unk> of Big Boi and the earthy flows of Andre always push you back up to the surface . They are players in the truest sense of the word ; not just playing for ends but playing to win in the ultimate battle of life over death , good over bad , and righteousness over evil . Yet , it 's not that heavy either . This album is nod your head music , shake your ass music . It makes you think and groove at the same time . 
 In The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , Roni Sarig felt that , strong rapping notwithstanding , the album 's music " suffers as the duo make their first attempt at self @-@ producing " and stated , " Although ATLiens promised expanded vistas with its interstellar motif , the record delivered something of a sophomore slump ... At best , ATLiens is the sound of an ambitious group searching for its voice . " 
 In 1998 , the album was selected as one of The Source 's " 100 Best Rap Albums " . In 2000 , Exclaim ! listed the album on their " 100 Records That Rocked 100 Issues of Exclaim ! " list .

 Dara Grace Torres ( born April 15 , 1967 ) is an American former competitive swimmer who is a twelve @-@ time Olympic medalist and former world record @-@ holder in three events . Torres is the first swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games ( 1984 , 1988 , 1992 , 2000 and 2008 ) , and , at age 41 , was the oldest swimmer ever to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team .

 On August 1 , 2007 , at age 40 and just 16 months after giving birth to her first child , Torres won the 100 @-@ meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis . On August 4 , she set a new American record in the 50 @-@ meter freestyle of 24 @.@ 53 seconds , breaking her own record of 24 @.@ 63 seconds set at the 2000 Summer Olympics . She lowered her initial American record by 1 @.@ 62 seconds . Torres has broken or lowered her own American record in the 50 @-@ meter freestyle ten times , which is the most by any American swimmer in any event . 
 At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials , Torres returned to the pool and qualified for a spot in her fifth Olympic Games at the age of 41 , a first for an American female swimmer . She became the oldest U.S. Olympic swimmer in history and the first American swimmer to appear in five Olympic Games . 
 At the trials , she qualified for the event finals in the 50 @-@ meter freestyle and broke the American record with a time of 24 @.@ 38 seconds in the semifinal . In the 50 @-@ meter finals , she broke that record for the ninth time , setting it at 24 @.@ 25 seconds and winning the top American women 's spot in the event . Torres also qualified in the 100 @-@ meter freestyle , but later withdrew from the individual 100 @-@ meter freestyle event to focus her efforts on the 50 @-@ meter freestyle and 4 × 100 @-@ meter relay events . On July 30 , at the U.S. swim team 's final training in Singapore , Torres , Amanda Beard and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women 's swimming team . 
 In order to pre @-@ empt any speculation that she might be taking performance @-@ enhancing drugs , Torres volunteered for a new enhanced drug @-@ testing program by the U.S. Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( USADA ) . " I want to be an open book " , she said . " I want people to know that I 'm 41 , and I 'm doing this right . I 'm clean . " In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael <unk> , a sprint coach , a chiropractor and two <unk> , Torres used resistance stretching trainers , calling it her " secret weapon " for continued success . Her $ 100 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo , Toyota and Bloomberg L.P. 
 At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , Torres won a silver medal as the anchor swimmer of the second @-@ place U.S. team in the 4 × 100 @-@ meter freestyle relay . It was the fifth time in five tries she earned an Olympic medal in the 4 × 100 @-@ meter freestyle relay . With the American relay team 's second @-@ place finish , she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history , surpassing British swimmer William Robinson , who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics . 
 On August 17 , 2008 , she won the silver medal in the 50 @-@ meter freestyle , finishing in a new American record time of 24 @.@ 07 seconds , one one @-@ hundredth ( 0 @.@ 01 ) of a second behind the winner , Britta Steffen .

 École L 'Odyssée ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] , English : " Odyssey School " ) is a public francophone high school in Moncton , New Brunswick , Canada . It is part of the province 's Francophone Sud School District , offering education to students from grade nine to twelve . The school opened on September 30 , 2005 as part of a $ 24 @.@ 2 million project , alongside the adjoining middle school , École Le <unk> . École L 'Odyssée was conceived as a way to alleviate the overcrowding problem at École Mathieu @-@ Martin in nearby Dieppe , a problem the district has had in the past . The <unk> @-@ <unk> project , as well as the future Carrefour de l <unk> middle school , replaced the former École Beauséjour and École Vanier complexes . This move allowed the Moncton Hospital to expand , while the Vanier establishment made way for medical offices . On September 9 , 2009 , the school was given permission to begin an $ 884 @,@ 000 expansion for its far side , allowing for a larger space to be reserved for its infirmary and orientation center . 
 As of September 2010 , the school holds 767 students out of its capacity of 850 , compared to 971 students at École Mathieu @-@ Martin . It is the only French high school in Moncton . 
 = = History = = 
 As Moncton 's population grew over the years , overcrowding in high schools soon became a problem : in the 2004 – 05 school year , École Mathieu @-@ Martin – the sole francophone high school in the area – had an enrolment of 1 @,@ 609 students , well above the 2009 – 2010 enrolment of 1 @,@ 025 . When the city 's growth rate climbed from 5 % in the years 1991 – 96 to 6 @.@ 5 % in the years 2001 – 06 , the problem became even more apparent . In fact , prior to construction , the idea of a second francophone complex had been in the minds of the New Brunswick Department of Education since as early as December 20 , 2002 . This idea was later confirmed in New Brunswick 's record @-@ breaking $ 809 million budget for the 2003 – 04 fiscal year , where $ 100 @,@ 000 was allocated to " develop the educational specifications " of the complex . Originally , the project was code named " Moncton School Complex " ( French : Complexe Scolaire de Moncton ) . 
 On January 12 , 2004 , the two schools were revealed to be attached side @-@ to @-@ side , occupying a combined area of 16 @,@ 000 square meters ( 170 @,@ 000 square feet ) about 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 miles ) from the nearby Université de Moncton . When commenting on the new facility , New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord said that " [ this ] project offers numerous advantages , from several points of view " , and that " it reflects [ the government 's ] commitment to equipping New Brunswick with a high @-@ calibre education system . " The names for the two schools were picked from submissions sent by the education councils of District 01 and District 03 on March 14 , 2005 . Both schools were announced to be replacing École Beauséjour and École Vanier , two francophone middle schools , which made way for the expansion of the Moncton Hospital and for medical offices , respectively . 
 A final $ 11 @.@ 2 million was allocated on January 6 , 2005 , which was 23 @.@ 3 % of the $ 48 million Department of Education budget for that fiscal year . On July 15 , 2005 , the school was awarded a $ 60 @,@ 000 federal fund for energy efficiency 39 % below the national energy threshold ; this would save the New Brunswick government $ 115 @,@ 193 per year , or an eventual $ 2 million over 20 years . The province 's educational minister , Madelaine Dubé , said : " It is good to know that our schools can also contribute to protecting our environment . " The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30 , 2005 , despite its delayed opening a few days after the beginning of the 2005 – 06 school year . Lord spoke of his government 's intention to add schools to the growing number of Francophone institutions in New Brunswick , as well as advancing the state of the province 's education . " Today 's inauguration represents an historic moment for Moncton 's Francophone community , " he said in his speech . " Parents , students and teaching staff now have modern , state of the art facilities . I feel very proud about this project and I am delighted that it is now a reality . " On September 9 , 2009 , a new , $ 884 @,@ 100 permit was awarded to extend L 'Odyssée 's total area by 390 m2 ( 4 @,@ 200 sq ft ) for the expansion of its new infirmary and orientation center . 
 The city went under scrutiny after the death on November 30 of Erika <unk> , a student at L 'Odyssée , who was struck by a car after crossing an intersection near the school in poor weather conditions . Parents began petitions to install street lights near what they deemed to be a " dangerous [ street corner ] " , and on May 4 , the request was approved . 
 = = Academics = = 
 = = = Curriculum = = = 
 The school 's curriculum is based on a 30 @-@ credit system , requiring a student to receive all 17 mandatory credits and seven optional credits to graduate . Examples of notable courses are law , Esperanto , German , Auto mechanics , carpentry , entrepreneurship , world religions , cooperative education , and leadership . L 'Odyssée also offers exclusive courses in work @-@ life development and speaking Acadian . 
 A partnership with the Université de Moncton and <unk> Dieppe allows students to take and be credited for select courses off @-@ campus one period per semester at no cost during their senior year . Additionally , Cisco offers a course in server and information sustainment , and the school offers access to ten online courses , including astronomy and world geography . Sports programs are available and credited , including hockey and soccer . 
 There are two curricular programs , called " <unk> " , for students wishing to graduate with honours in science and engineering or art and social sciences . The main differences between the standard curriculum and the two " <unk> " programs are the addition of mandatory courses in the domain of the chosen program , and the requirement to complete thirty hours of volunteer duty . A student must gain an average of 80 % in the additional mandatory courses to graduate with honours . 
 = = = Schedule = = = 
 École L 'Odyssée operates on a modified version of the controversial concept of block scheduling . Instead of the traditional seven- or eight @-@ period school day , every day students attend four out of the five classes for that semester . The following semester , students attend their remaining five courses in the same fashion , totalling ten courses per year . School days are labelled 1 to 5 , instead of Monday to Friday , with each " day " having a predetermined layout . This type of scheduling prevents courses being cancelled for holidays and school vacations , since in such a case , the schedule resumes with the days shifted forward by the length of the school break . For example , if Monday was designated as Day 1 , and Tuesday was a holiday , Wednesday would be Day 2 , and Thursday would be Day 3 . This type of scheduling , however , does not cover unexpected school cancellations ( for example , school closure due to poor weather ) , due to problems it would cause with the predetermined calendar . 
 Wednesdays , regardless of the " day " , are cut by one hour throughout the district to compensate for Community of Practice ( French : Communauté d <unk> <unk> , or " CAP " ) meetings between teachers at the end of the day , to " direct [ the district 's efforts ] towards the educational success of students . " Study hall ( known as the " <unk> " period , which stands for " <unk> de l <unk> et de l <unk> de <unk> " ) is reserved between the first and second period of the day , except for Wednesdays , where the period is removed to compensate for the CAP meetings . 
 Another difference between L 'Odyssée and other schools is the amount of time allotted between classes . Instead of the usual five @-@ minute intermission , students are given 14 minutes between every period – except for the intermission between the first period and <unk> , and between lunch and the third period , where students are given five minutes . They receive 57 minutes for their lunch every day , except for Wednesdays , when they get a 55 @-@ minute lunch ( both excluding the five @-@ minute intermission ) . 
 Although the schedule is identical throughout the school , students must fill in their courses – A through E – as defined by their schedule : 
 = = = Rankings = = = 
 Outside rankings for the school have been low compared to the district 's average . In 2010 , a report published by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies put L 'Odyssée at the bottom of the district 's 22 @-@ school list overall ( one school being unranked ) , based on data from 2005 to 2008 . 
 In 2005 , the province began including the school in their reports on student dropout rates . At the time , its rates were the highest in the province , with a total of six dropouts for every 100 students enrolled . In contrast , the district average was 0 @.@ 9 dropouts per 100 enrolments , and the provincial average was 2 @.@ 4 dropouts . The following year , the school 's rate dropped to 5 @.@ 4 , remaining three percentage points above the provincial average . In 2007 , it fell 2 @.@ 2 points , down to 3 @.@ 2 dropouts per 100 students , and finally settled at 2 % , 0 @.@ 2 percentage points below the provincial average of 2 @.@ 2 % . 
 In terms of academic performance , the province releases report cards based on yearly exams to track the progress toward a goal set for 2013 . The exams are held for English classes in the tenth grade , for French classes in the eleventh grade , and for mathematics in the eleventh grade . The report card rates schools based on how many students pass each exam , instead of rating on the average mark on the exam . L 'Odyssée , according to the report , is below both the district and the provincial success rate :

 The 2013 World Financial Group Continental Cup of Curling was held from January 10 to 13 at the South Okanagan Events Centre in Penticton , British Columbia . The Continental Cup , based on the Ryder Cup of golf , pitted teams from North America against teams from the rest of the World . The tournament featured team events , mixed doubles events , singles competitions , and skins competitions , and the brunt of available points was awarded in the skins competitions . TSN broadcast the event , as it had in previous years . 
 Team North America was represented by Canada Cup champions Jennifer Jones and Kevin Martin , Tournament of Hearts champion Heather Nedohin , Brier champion Glenn Howard , and the United States men 's and women 's champions Heath McCormick and Allison Pottinger , respectively . Team World was represented by reigning world champion Mirjam Ott , world silver medalist Margaretha Sigfridsson , four @-@ time world junior champion Eve Muirhead , two @-@ time world bronze medalist Niklas Edin , two @-@ time world silver medalist Tom Brewster , and two @-@ time European champion Thomas Ulsrud . 
 Team World entered the event as the defending champions , but were unseated by Team North America . Team World took an early lead in the first day of the event , but Team North America roared back in the next few days , dominating in the team , mixed doubles , and singles competitions to hold a large lead . Team North America clinched the cup in the second round of skins play after holding back a late Team World comeback , giving Team North America a 5 – 4 edge in the overall cup record . Team North America 's win ensured that no defending champion to date would successfully defend its title from the previous Cup . 
 = = Competition format = = 
 Six teams from North America and six teams representing the rest of the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points . The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup . Teams compete in four formats : team games , mixed doubles games , singles competitions , and skins games . Team games are regular curling games , with two teams of four playing against each other . Mixed doubles games involve two teams , each consisting of one male and one female , playing against each other . Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end , one of which is positioned prior to the start of the end . This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games . The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other . There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions . Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot . Points are given based on how well the shot is made . After all of the shots have been thrown , the team with the most points wins the competition . Skins games involve two teams playing against each other , where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer . The points for the skins games , which go toward the total points for the cup , are distributed throughout the game , and the teams earn these points by winning skins . 
 A new points system was implemented in the 2013 Continental Cup of Curling . The total of points available was 60 points , compared to the total of 400 points used in previous years . The mixed doubles , singles , and team games were worth one point each , and ties were worth one half point each to both teams . The skins games were worth a total of five points . All games were eight ends long , and there were no extra ends . Also , six mixed doubles games and six singles competition games were played , as before .

 = Otto Graham = 
 Otto Everett Graham , Jr . ( December 6 , 1921 – December 17 , 2003 ) was an American football quarterback who played for the Cleveland Browns in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) and National Football League ( NFL ) . Graham is regarded by critics as one of the most dominant players of his era , having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955 , winning seven of them . With Graham at quarterback , the Browns posted a record of 114 wins , 20 losses and four ties , including a 9 – 3 win – loss record in the playoffs . While most of Graham 's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era , he still holds the NFL record for career average yards gained per pass attempt , with 8 @.@ 98 . He also holds the record for the highest career winning percentage for an NFL starting quarterback , at 0 @.@ 814 . Long @-@ time New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner , a friend of Graham 's , once called him " as great of a quarterback as there ever was . " He is also known for being one of only two people ( the other being Gene Conley — Milwaukee Braves in the 1957 World Series and three Boston Celtics championships from 1959 – 61 ) to win championships in two of the four major American sports — 1946 NBL ( became NBA ) and AAFC Championship , plus 3 more AAFC and 3 NFL championships . 
 Graham grew up in Waukegan , Illinois , the son of music teachers . He entered Northwestern University in 1940 on a basketball scholarship , but football soon became his main sport . After a brief stint in the military at the end of World War II , Graham played during the 1946 season for the National Basketball League 's Rochester Royals , who won the league championship that year . Paul Brown , Cleveland 's coach , signed Graham to play for the Browns , where he thrived . After he retired from playing football in 1955 , Graham coached college teams in the College All @-@ Star Game and became head football coach at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut . After seven years at the academy , he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the Washington Redskins . Following his resignation , he returned to the Coast Guard Academy , where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984 . He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965 . 
 = = Early life and college career = = 
 Born in Waukegan , Illinois , Graham 's first interest growing up was music . Encouraged by his parents , both of whom were music teachers , he took up several instruments : the piano , violin , cornet and French horn . Graham also excelled in athletics , and attended Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship in 1940 . There he played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and continued to study music . Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year , when Northwestern coach Pappy Waldorf saw him throwing in an intramural game and invited him to practice with the team . Northwestern 's coaches were impressed with his running and passing , and Waldorf convinced him to sign up . Although football became Graham 's primary sport , he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team . As a senior , he was named a first @-@ team basketball All @-@ American , part of a squad selected by news outlets comprising the best players at each position . 
 Graham 's first game for the Northwestern Wildcats football team was on October 4 , 1941 , when he caught a Kansas State punt and returned it 90 yards for a touchdown . He ran and passed for two more touchdowns in the 51 – 3 victory . After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against Wisconsin , Graham passed to his wide receivers for two touchdowns in a victory over the Ohio State , coached by Paul Brown , the team 's only loss of the 1941 season . Northwestern ended the year with an 11th @-@ place showing in the AP Poll of the best college teams in the country . 
 As America 's involvement in World War II intensified after the December 7 , 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor , Graham signed up for service alongside many fellow student @-@ athletes , entering the U.S. Navy Air Corps . He was able to stay at Northwestern as he waited to be called for active duty . The Wildcats struggled in 1942 as their players joined the war effort , winning only one game . Graham still had 89 completions , setting a single @-@ season passing record in the Big Ten Conference , a division of major college teams from the Midwestern United States . 
 The following year , Graham and some of his teammates enlisted in the military but continued to play for Northwestern . <unk> from other schools also enrolled at Northwestern , where the U.S. Navy had a training station . The 1943 season was a strong one for Northwestern . The team beat the Ohio State , the defending national champions , and a good military team at Great Lakes Naval Station . The Wildcats lost to Notre Dame and Michigan , however , and finished the season with an 8 – 2 record and a ninth @-@ place ranking in the AP Poll . Graham set another Big Ten passing record , was named the conference 's Most Valuable Player , received All @-@ American honors and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting . By the end of his college career , he held a Big Ten Conference record for passing yards with 2 @,@ 132 . 
 Graham 's career at Northwestern officially ended in February 1944 , when he moved to Colgate University in Hamilton , New York , in the Navy 's V @-@ 5 cadet program , a pilot training course . He played basketball for Colgate before moving to North Carolina Pre @-@ Flight later in 1944 , where he played on the <unk> football team under coaches Glenn <unk> and Bear Bryant . 
 Impressed by Graham 's performances in Northwestern 's wins over the Ohio State in 1941 and 1943 , Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $ 7 @,@ 500 per year ( $ 98 @,@ 581 in 2016 dollars ) in 1945 to play for a professional team he was coaching in Cleveland in the new All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing , however , and Brown added a monthly stipend of $ 250 ( $ 3 @,@ 286 in 2016 ) until the end of the war . It was a large amount of money at the time . " All I asked was , where do I sign ? " Graham said later . " Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever . " Graham was also drafted by the National Football League 's Detroit Lions , but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on . 
 Large numbers of athletes came home as the conflict wound down in Europe following Germany 's surrender in mid @-@ 1945 . The AAFC 's first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946 , and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the Rochester Royals of the National Basketball League ( NBL ) , a forerunner of the National Basketball Association . In March 1946 , the Royals swept a best @-@ of @-@ five series against the Sheboygan Redskins to win the NBL title .

 By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946 , training camp for Brown 's new team , the Cleveland Browns , had already begun . Concerned that Graham was not ready to start , Brown put in Cliff Lewis at quarterback in the first game of the season . Graham , however , soon replaced Lewis in Brown 's T formation offense . Handing the ball to fullback Marion Motley and throwing to ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie , Graham led the team to a 12 – 2 regular @-@ season record and a spot in the championship game against the AAFC 's New York Yankees . The Browns won that game , touching off a period of dominance . The team won each of the AAFC 's four championships between 1946 and 1949 , and had professional football 's second perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied . 
 Graham 's play was crucial to Cleveland 's success . He averaged 10 @.@ 5 yards per pass and had a quarterback rating of 112 @.@ 1 in 1946 , a professional football record until Joe Montana surpassed it in 1989 . Graham was named the AAFC 's Most Valuable Player in 1947 and shared the Most Valuable Player award with Frankie Albert of the San Francisco 49ers in 1948 . He led the league in passing yards between 1947 and 1949 . The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season , and three of its teams , including the Browns , merged into the more established National Football League . Graham was the AAFC 's all @-@ time leading passer , throwing for 10 @,@ 085 yards and 86 touchdowns . 
 Graham became the Browns ' uncontested leader , but he was also " just one of the guys , " tackle Mike McCormack said in 1999 . " He was not aloof , which you see a lot of times today . " He was good at spinning and moving in the pocket , skills he learned playing basketball . In his autobiography , Paul Brown praised Graham 's ability to anticipate his receivers ' route @-@ running by watching their shoulders . " I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill , as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm , " Brown said . His short passes were hard and accurate , teammates later said , and his long balls were soft . " I used to catch a lot of them one @-@ handed , " Lavelli said . " He had great touch in his hands . " He was nicknamed " Automatic Otto " for his consistency and toughness . 
 = = = Cleveland Browns in the NFL ( 1950 – 1955 ) = = = 
 With Graham at the helm , the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950 . Graham led the Browns to a 10 – 2 record , which set up a playoff against the New York Giants for a spot in the championship game . The Browns ' only two losses of the season had come against the Giants , but in a frozen Cleveland Stadium on December 17 , Cleveland beat New York . With the game tied 3 – 3 in the fourth quarter , Graham gained 45 yards by running with the ball on a long drive to set up a 28 @-@ yard Lou Groza field goal that put the Browns ahead 6 – 3 . A safety after the ensuing kickoff made the final score 8 – 3 . 
 The win put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the Los Angeles Rams . Graham 's rushing and passing were again key to the Browns ' 30 – 28 victory . He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last @-@ minute Groza field goal that sealed the win . Graham had 99 yards rushing in the game , adding 298 yards of passing and four touchdowns . 
 Cleveland posted an 11 – 1 record in 1951 , losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers in the season opener . That gave the Browns another spot in the championship game , again against the Rams . This time , however , the Rams won 27 – 17 . Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter , setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14 – 10 . Three of his throws were intercepted , but he put up 280 yards of passing and a touchdown . After the season , Graham was named the league 's Most Valuable Player . 
 With Graham at quarterback , Cleveland finished the 1952 season with a 9 – 3 record and faced the Detroit Lions in the NFL championship game . Despite gaining 384 total yards to Detroit 's 258 , Graham and the Browns lost their second straight championship , 17 – 7 . Cleveland had several long drives that ended with missed field goals , and a fourth @-@ quarter touchdown was negated because Graham 's throw to Pete Brewster was first tipped by receiver Ray Renfro ; under rules in place at the time , balls deflected by offensive teammates were automatic incompletions . After the season , as Graham was practicing for the Pro Bowl in Los Angeles on January 2 , 1953 , his six @-@ week @-@ old son Stephen died from a severe cold . 
 The 1953 season began with a 27 – 0 win over the Green Bay Packers in which Graham passed for 292 yards and ran for two touchdowns . It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns , whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the Philadelphia Eagles . Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers , Graham took a forearm to the face from Art Michalik that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches . Graham 's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask , and he came back into the game ; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask . Despite an 11 – 1 record , Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third year in a row , falling to the Detroit Lions 17 – 16 . Two of Graham 's passes were intercepted . He said after the game that he wanted to " jump off a building " for letting his teammates down . " I was the main factor in losing , " he said . " If I had played my usual game , we would have won . " Still , Graham finished the season as the NFL 's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award . 
 Before the start of the Browns ' 1954 training camp , Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case . Sheppard , an osteopath , was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death , and Graham and his wife , Beverly , were friends with the couple . Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards , they did not know much about their relationship . 
 The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns . Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers . Graham , meanwhile , told Brown that he would retire after the season . After losing the first three games , Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the championship , again against the Lions . This time , the Browns won 56 – 10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more . He announced his retirement after the game . 
 After Graham 's potential replacements struggled during the 1955 training camp and preseason , Brown convinced Graham to come back and play one more year . He was offered a salary of $ 25 @,@ 000 ( $ 220 @,@ 839 today ) , making him the highest @-@ paid player in the NFL . The Browns lost the opener against the Washington Redskins , but went on to a 9 – 2 – 1 regular @-@ season record and another chance at a championship . Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38 – 14 . When Brown took Graham out of the game in the fourth quarter , the crowd in the Los Angeles Coliseum gave him a standing ovation . It was the final performance of a 10 @-@ year career in which Graham 's team reached the championship each year and won seven . " Nothing would induce me to come back , " he said later . He was the NFL 's passing leader and Most Valuable Player in 1955 . He also won the Hickok Belt , awarded to the best professional athlete of the year . Without Graham , the Browns floundered the following year and posted a 5 – 7 record , their first @-@ ever losing season . 
 The Browns ' record with Graham as starting quarterback was 114 – 20 – 4 , including a 9 – 3 record in the playoffs . He still holds the NFL career record for yards per pass attempt , averaging nine . He also holds the record for the highest career winning percentage for an NFL starting quarterback , with 0 @.@ 814 . Graham was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965 . Having won seven championships in 10 seasons and reached the championship game in every year he played , Graham is regarded by sportswriters as one of the greatest winners of all time and one of the best professional quarterbacks ever to play the game . He never missed a game in his career . 
 Graham wore number 60 for much of his career , but he was forced to change it to 14 in 1952 after the NFL passed a rule requiring offensive linemen to wear jersey numbers 50 – 79 so referees could more easily identify ineligible receivers . The Browns retired his number 14 , while 60 remains in circulation . While at Northwestern , Graham wore number 48 . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 When Graham retired from football , he planned to focus on managing the insurance and appliance businesses he owned . In 1957 , however , Graham signed on as an assistant coach for the college squad in the annual College All @-@ Star Game , a now @-@ defunct exhibition contest between the NFL champion and a selection of the best collegiate players from around the country . The next year , he was named head coach of the team . With Graham coaching the all @-@ stars in 1958 , the team beat the Detroit Lions 35 – 19 .

 Following his convincing win in the all @-@ star game , Graham 's friend George Steinbrenner helped get him a job as the head football coach for the Coast Guard Academy in New London , Connecticut . Graham , by then 37 years old , was also named athletic director and given a salary " in five figures " . School officials said the hiring did not mean Coast Guard would " go big time " ; the Division III school played a relatively short schedule at the time against smaller schools in New England . The Coast Guard team had a 3 – 5 record in Graham 's first year as coach in 1959 , but improved steadily over the ensuing three years . The team went undefeated in 1963 , earning the academy its first @-@ ever post @-@ season bowl appearance . Coast Guard lost to Western Kentucky 27 – 0 in the Tangerine Bowl . Graham continued to coach in the College All @-@ Star Game while at Coast Guard , and his college team beat Vince Lombardi 's Green Bay Packers in a 20 – 17 upset in 1963 . Graham was offered coaching jobs in the NFL numerous times during his tenure at Coast Guard , but he said in 1964 that he was content to stay at the small school on a $ 9 @,@ 000 salary . He said he deplored the " win at all costs philosophy " that was necessary to be successful in the professional ranks .

 Despite his reservations about the professional game , Graham , who <unk> as a television and radio commentator for the American Football League 's New York Jets in 1964 and 1965 , left Coast Guard after seven years in 1966 to become head coach of the NFL 's Washington Redskins . Graham 's tenure as the Redskins ' coach between 1966 and 1968 was unsuccessful ; the team 's record during that span was 17 – 22 – 3 . In his last season as the coach of the Redskins , calls for his firing had intensified as the team 's performance worsened from a 7 – 7 record to a 5 – 9 record in his third year . The Washington Daily News called for his firing in a front @-@ page editorial in November 1968 . Lombardi took over as the Redskins ' coach in 1969 .

 After being dismissed as the Redskins ' coach , Graham returned to the Coast Guard Academy as athletic director and said he planned to stay there until he retired . He coached the college team in the College All @-@ Star Game in 1970 for his tenth and final time . The college stars lost for the seventh time in a row that year , falling 24 – 3 to the Kansas City Chiefs . He was replaced in 1971 by Blanton Collier , who had retired after succeeding Brown as Cleveland 's head coach . 
 In 1974 , Graham was named Coast Guard 's football coach once again , although he resigned two years later to focus on his duties as athletic director . In nine years of coaching , Graham 's Coast Guard teams had a combined record of 44 – 32 – 1 . After eight more years as the school 's athletic director , Graham retired in 1984 .

 An avid golfer and tennis player , Graham partnered with New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio in numerous golf tournaments later in life . He retired to a house on a golf course in Florida . Graham overcame colon cancer in 1977 , but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems . He was diagnosed as being in the early stages of Alzheimer 's disease in 2001 , and died of a heart aneurysm in Sarasota , Florida , on December 17 , 2003 . He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly . In 2013 , Northwestern 's fundraising department created The Otto Graham Society to honor his achievements at the school and support its athletics programs . In 2014 a new gymnasium at Waterford Country School was dedicated to Otto Graham 's memory .

 = Petroleum industry in Iran = 
 Iran is an energy superpower and the Petroleum industry in Iran plays an important part in it . In 2004 Iran produced 5 @.@ 1 percent of the world ’ s total crude oil ( 3 @.@ 9 million barrels ( 620 @,@ 000 m3 ) per day ) , which generated revenues of US $ 25 billion to US $ 30 billion and was the country ’ s primary source of foreign currency . At 2006 levels of production , oil proceeds represented about 18 @.@ 7 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) . However , the importance of the hydrocarbon sector to Iran ’ s economy has been far greater . The oil and gas industry has been the engine of economic growth , directly affecting public development projects , the government ’ s annual budget , and most foreign exchange sources . 
 In FY 2009 , the sector accounted for 60 percent of total government revenues and 80 percent of the total annual value of both exports and foreign currency earnings . Oil and gas revenues are affected by the value of crude oil on the international market . It has been estimated that at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) quota level ( December 2004 ) , a one @-@ dollar change in the price of crude oil on the international market would alter Iran ’ s oil revenues by US $ 1 billion . 
 In 2012 , Iran , which exports around 1 @.@ 5 million barrels of crude oil a day , was the second @-@ largest exporter among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . In the same year , officials in Iran estimated that Iran 's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $ 250 billion by 2015 . However , the industry was disrupted by an international embargo from July 2012 through January 2016 . Iran plans to invest a total of $ 500 billion in the oil sector before 2025 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = The era of international control , 1901 – 1979 = = = 
 The history of Iran ’ s oil industry began in 1901 , when British speculator William D ’ Arcy received a concession from Iran to explore and develop southern Iran ’ s oil resources . The discovery of oil in 1908 led to the formation in 1909 of the London @-@ based Anglo @-@ Persian Oil Company ( <unk> ) . By purchasing a majority of the company ’ s shares in 1914 , the British government gained direct control of the Iranian oil industry , which it would not relinquish for 37 years . After 1935 the <unk> was called the Anglo @-@ Iranian Oil Company ( <unk> ) . A 60 @-@ year agreement signed in 1933 established a flat payment to Iran of four British pounds for every ton of crude oil exported and denied Iran any right to control oil exports . 
 In 1950 ongoing popular demand prompted a vote in the Majlis to nationalize the petroleum industry . A year later , the government of Prime Minister Mohammad <unk> formed the National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) . A 1953 coup d ’ état led by British and U.S. intelligence agencies ousted the <unk> government and paved the way for a new oil agreement . In 1954 a new agreement divided profits equally between the NIOC and a multinational consortium that had replaced the <unk> . In 1973 Iran signed a new 20 @-@ year concession with the consortium . 
 Beginning in the late 1950s , many of Iran ’ s international oil agreements did not produce the expected outcomes ; even those oil companies that managed to extract oil in their designated areas contributed very little to the country ’ s total oil production . By the time of the Islamic Revolution of 1978 – 79 , the five largest international companies that had agreements with the NIOC accounted for only 10 @.@ 4 percent of total oil production . During this period , Iran ’ s oil industry remained disconnected from other industries , particularly manufacturing . This separation promoted inefficiencies in the country ’ s overall industrial economy . 
 In 1973 , at a time when Iran was the second @-@ largest oil exporter in the world and the Arab @-@ Israeli War of October 6 – 25 was pressurizing the price of oil , the Shah of Iran told the New York Times , " Of course the world price of oil is going to rise .... Certainly ! And how ... ; You [ Western nations ] increased the price of wheat you sell us by 300 % , and the same for sugar and cement ... ; You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us , refined as petrochemicals , at a hundred times the price you 've paid to us ... ; It 's only fair that , from now on , you should pay more for oil . Let 's say ten times more . " 
 = = = The era of nationalized oil , 1979 – present = = = 
 Following the Revolution , the NIOC took control of Iran ’ s petroleum industry and canceled Iran ’ s international oil agreements . In 1980 the exploration , production , sale , and export of oil were delegated to the Ministry of Petroleum . Initially Iran ’ s post @-@ revolutionary oil policy was based on foreign currency requirements and the long @-@ term preservation of the natural resource . Following the Iran – Iraq War , however , this policy was replaced by a more aggressive approach : maximizing exports and accelerating economic growth . From 1979 until 1998 , Iran did not sign any oil agreements with foreign oil companies . Early in the first administration of President Mohammad Khatami ( in office 1997 – 2005 ) , the government paid special attention to developing the country ’ s oil and gas industry . Oil was defined as inter @-@ generational capital and an indispensable foundation of economic development . Thus , between 1997 and 2004 Iran invested more than US $ 40 billion in expanding the capacity of existing oil fields and discovering and exploring new fields and deposits . These projects were financed either in the form of joint investments with foreign companies or domestic contractors or through direct investment by the NIOC . In accordance with the law , foreign investment in oil discovery was possible only in the form of buyback agreements under which the NIOC was required to reimburse expenses and retain complete ownership of an oil field . Marketing of crude oil to potential buyers was managed by the NIOC and by a government enterprise called <unk> . <unk> marketed Iranian oil to Africa , and the NIOC marketed to Asia and Europe . According to IHS CERA estimate , oil revenue of Iran will increase by a third to USD 100 billion in 2011 even though the country is under an extended period of U.S. sanctions . 
 = = Oil production and reserves = = 
 Total oil production reached a peak level of 6 @.@ 6 Mbbl / d ( 1 @,@ 050 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) in 1976 . By 1978 , Iran had become the second @-@ largest OPEC producer and exporter of crude oil and the fourth @-@ largest producer in the world . After a lengthy decline in the 1980s , production of crude oil began to increase steadily in 1987 . In 2008 Iran produced 3 @.@ 9 @-@ million @-@ barrels ( 620 @,@ 000 m3 ) per day ( bpd ) and exported 2 @.@ 4 Mbbl / d ( 380 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . Accounting for 5 percent of world production , it returned to its previous position as OPEC ’ s second @-@ largest producer . According to estimates , in 2005 Iran had the capacity to produce 4 @.@ 5 Mbbl / d ( 720 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) ; it was believed that production capacity could increase to 5 Mbbl / d ( 790 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) to 7 Mbbl / d ( 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) , but only with a substantial increase in foreign investment . Iran ’ s long @-@ term sustainable oil production rate is estimated at 3 @.@ 8 Mbbl / d ( 600 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . According to the Iranian government , Iran has enough reserves to produce oil for the next 100 years while oil reserves of other Middle Eastern countries will be depleted in the next 60 years and most other oil @-@ rich countries will lose their reserves within the next 30 years . 
 In 2006 Iran reported crude oil reserves of 132 @.@ 5 billion barrels ( 2 @.@ 107 × 1010 m3 ) , accounting for about 15 percent of OPEC ’ s proven reserves and 11 @.@ 4 percent of world proven reserves . While the estimate of world crude oil reserves remained nearly steady between 2001 and 2006 , at 1 @,@ 154 billion barrels ( 1 @.@ 835 × 1011 m3 ) , the estimate of Iran ’ s oil reserves was revised upward by 32 percent when a new field was discovered near Bushehr . Market value of Iran 's total oil reserves at international crude price of $ 75 per barrel stands at ~ US $ 10 trillion . 
 In the early 2000s , leading international oil firms from China , France , India , Italy , the Netherlands , Norway , Russia , Spain , and the United Kingdom had agreements to develop Iran ’ s oil and gas fields . In 2004 China signed a major agreement to buy oil and gas from Iran , as well as to develop Iran ’ s <unk> oil field . The value of this contract was estimated at US $ 150 billion to US $ 200 billion over 25 years . In 2009 , China National Petroleum Corp ( CNPC ) signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company whereby the former took ownership of a 70 % stake upon promising to pay 90 percent of the development costs for the South <unk> oil field , with the project needing investment of up to $ 2 @.@ 5 billion . Earlier that year , CNPC also won a $ 2 billion deal to develop the first phase of the North <unk> oilfield . 
 A more modest yet important agreement was signed with India to explore and produce oil and natural gas in southern Iran . In 2006 the rate of production decline was 8 percent for Iran ’ s existing onshore oil fields ( furnishing the majority of oil output ) and 10 percent for existing offshore fields . Little exploration , upgrading , or establishment of new fields occurred in 2005 – 6 . However , the threat of American retaliation kept the investment way below the desired levels . It only allowed Iran to continue to keep its oil export at or below its OPEC determined quota level . Today , much of the equipment needed for oil industry are being produced by local manufacturers in Iran . Besides , Iran is among the few countries that has reached the technology and " know @-@ how " for drilling in the deep waters . 
 = = Oil refining and consumption = = 
 In 2011 Iran ’ s refineries had a combined capacity of 1 @.@ 457 Mbbl / d ( 231 @,@ 600 m3 / d ) . The largest refineries have the following capacities : Abadan , 350 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 56 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) ; <unk> , 284 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 45 @,@ 200 m3 / d ) ; Bandar @-@ e Abbas , 232 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 36 @,@ 900 m3 / d ) ; Tehran , 220 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 35 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) ; Arak , 170 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 27 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) ; and Tabriz , 100 @,@ 000 bbl / d ( 16 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . In 2004 pipelines conveyed 69 percent of total refined products ; trucks , 20 percent ; rail , 7 percent ; and tankers , 4 percent . Oil refining produces a wide range of oil products , such as liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) , gasoline , kerosene , fuel oil , and lubricants . As of 2011 Iran is a net exporter of petroleum products thanks to large exports of residual fuel oil , but the refineries cannot meet domestic demand for lighter distillates such as gasoline . 
 Between 1981 and 2010 , domestic consumption of oil products increased from 0 @.@ 6 Mbbl / d ( 95 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) to 1 @.@ 8 Mbbl / d ( 290 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) — an average annual growth rate of 3 @.@ 7 percent . Between 1981 and 2004 , consumption of gasoline grew by 6 percent annually , but domestic production met only 75 percent of demand for this product . In 2004 the country imported US $ 1 @.@ 6 billion worth of gasoline . By 2006 it imported 41 percent of its gasoline , but by 2010 imports were down to 19 @.@ 5 % of gasoline consumption and heavy investment in new refining capacity may see Iran exporting gasoline by 2015 . Refining capacity increased 18 % in 2010 and the target is to increase refining capacity to 3 @.@ 5 million barrels per day . 
 = = Trade in oil and oil products = = 
 In 2006 exports of crude oil totaled 2 @.@ 5 Mbbl / d ( 400 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) , or about 62 @.@ 5 percent of the country ’ s crude oil production . The direction of crude oil exports changed after the Revolution because of the U.S. trade embargo on Iran and the marketing strategy of the NIOC . Initially , Iran ’ s post @-@ revolutionary crude oil export policy was based on foreign currency requirements and the need for long @-@ term preservation of the natural resource . In addition , the government expanded oil trade with other developing countries . While the shares of Europe , Japan , and the United States declined from an average of 87 percent of oil exports before the Revolution to 52 percent in the early 2000s , the share of exports to East Asia ( excluding Japan ) increased significantly . In addition to crude oil exports , Iran exports oil products . In 2006 it exported 282 @,@ 000 barrels ( 44 @,@ 800 m3 ) of oil products , or about 21 percent of its total oil product output . Iran plans to invest a total of $ 500 billion in the oil sector before 2025 . 
 In 2010 , Iran , which exports around 2 @.@ 6 million barrels of crude oil a day , was the second @-@ largest exporter among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . Several major emerging economies depend on Iranian oil : 10 % of South Korea ’ s oil imports come from Iran , 9 % of India ’ s and 6 % of Chinese . Moreover , Iranian oil makes up 7 % of Japan ’ s and 30 % of all Greek oil imports . Iran is also a major oil supplier to Spain and Italy . In the same year , officials in Iran estimate that Iran 's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $ 250 billion by 2015 once the current projects come on stream . 
 According to IHS CERA estimate , oil revenue of Iran will increase by a third to USD 100 billion in 2011 even though the country is under an extended period of U.S. sanctions . As of January 2012 , Iran exports 22 % of its oil to China , 14 % to Japan , 13 % to India , 10 % to South Korea , 7 % to Italy , 7 % to Turkey , 6 % to Spain and the remainder to France , Greece ( & other European countries ) , Taiwan , Sri Lanka , South Africa . 
 = = Natural gas = = 
 In addition to the natural gas associated with oil exploration and extraction , an estimated 62 percent of Iran ’ s 32 @.@ 3 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves in 2006 were located in independent natural gas fields , an amount second only to those of Russia . In 2006 annual production reached 105 billion cubic meters , with fastest growth occurring over the previous 15 years . In 2006 natural gas accounted for about 50 percent of domestic energy consumption , in part because domestic gas prices were heavily subsidized . Natural gas production will reach 700 million cubic meter / day by 2012 and 900 million cubic meter / day by 2015 . 
 Since 1979 , infrastructure investment by Iranian and foreign oil firms has increased pipeline capacity to support the Iranian gas industry . Between 1979 and 2003 , pipelines to transport natural gas to refineries and to domestic consumers increased from 2 @,@ 000 kilometers to 12 @,@ 000 kilometers . In the same period , natural gas distribution pipelines increased from 2 @,@ 000 kilometers to 45 @,@ 000 kilometers in response to growing domestic consumption . Gas processing plants are located at Ahvaz , Dalan , Kangan , and <unk> , in a corridor along the northern Persian Gulf close to the major gas fields . South Pars , Iran ’ s largest natural gas field , has received substantial foreign investment . With its output intended for both export and domestic consumption , South Pars is expected to reach full production in 2015 . However , delays and lower production in the Iranian side due to sanctions is resulting in migration of gas to the Qatari part and a loss for Iran . 
 The output of South Pars is the basis of the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone , a complex of petrochemical and natural gas processing plants and port facilities established in 1998 on the Persian Gulf south of Kangan . Iran is able to produce all the parts needed for its gas refineries . Iran is now the third country in the world to have developed Gas to liquids ( GTL ) technology . 
 In the 1980s , Iran began to replace oil , coal , charcoal , and other fossil @-@ fuel energy sources with natural gas , which is environmentally safer . The share of natural gas in household energy consumption , which averaged 54 percent in 2004 , was projected to increase to 69 percent by 2009 . Overall , natural gas consumption in Iran was expected to grow by more than 10 percent per annum between 2005 and 2009 . 
 With international oil prices increasing and projected to continue increasing , international demand for natural gas and investment in production and transportation of natural gas to consumer markets both increased in the early 2000s . Iran set a goal of increasing its natural gas production capacity to 300 billion cubic meters by 2015 while keeping oil production stable . To achieve this capacity , the government has planned a joint investment worth US $ 100 billion in the oil and gas industry through 2015 . 
 Market value of Iran 's total natural gas reserves at comparative international energy price of $ 75 per barrel of oil stands at ~ US $ 4 trillion . Following the discovery of a large gas deposit in the Caspian sea ( The Sardar <unk> gas field ) in 2011 estimated at 50 trillion cubic feet ( some 1 @.@ 4 trillion cubic meters ) , Iran could rank first in the world in terms of gas reserves . In addition , Iranian media have reported in 2012 the discovery of gas field " as big as South Pars gas field " in the oil @-@ rich Khuzestan province . In 2011 , Iran signed a contract with Baghdad and Damascus in order to export Iran ’ s gas to Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , the Mediterranean region and eventually Europe . Oman and Kuwait were negotiating an import agreement in 2014 . Once all pipelines become operational , Iran can potentially export a total of more than 200 million cubic meter of natural gas every year to Iraq , India , Pakistan , and Oman . 
 = = = Major foreign projects = = = 
 In 2004 Iran signed a contract with France and Malaysia for production and export of natural gas and another agreement with European and Asian companies for expansion and marketing of its natural gas resources . In 2005 Iran exported natural gas to Turkey and was expected to expand its market to Armenia , China , Japan , other East Asian countries , India , Pakistan , and Europe . The first section of a new line to Armenia opened in spring 2007 , as a much @-@ discussed major pipeline to India and Pakistan remained in the negotiation stage . 
 Among some more recent deals , Switzerland ’ s energy company EGL , signed a 25 @-@ year LNG export deal with Iran ’ s National Iranian Gas Export Company on March 17 , 2007 , reportedly valued at 18 billion . Switzerland will buy 5 @.@ 5 billion cubic meters of Iranian natural gas each year , beginning in 2011 . In April 2007 , OMV , the Austrian partially state @-@ owned energy company , signed letters of intent with Iran , worth an estimated $ 22 @.@ 8 billion ( 22 billion euros ) , for Iran to supply Europe with gas . The United States has expressed strong opposition to both the Swiss and Austrian deals with Iran . 
 The National Iranian Gas Company ( <unk> ) is expected to finalize a natural gas export deal with Pakistan , with exports set to begin in 2011 . The gas would be transported through a “ Peace pipeline ” , worth about $ 7 @.@ 4 billion . The plan initially also included exporting gas to India , but negotiations have stalled over pricing . Iran also is discussing a gas production and export deal with Turkey . Under the plan , Turkey would assist in developing Iran ’ s South Pars field in exchange for cash or natural gas . Gas would be shipped from Iran to Turkey and Europe via a new pipeline that Turkey plans to build . 
 Other notable petroleum sector development deals include those with Russia and China . On February 19 , 2008 , Russian state gas company <unk> announced a deal to establish a joint venture company to develop the offshore Iranian South Pars gas field . A China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) investment deal , valued at $ 16 billion , to develop Iran ’ s North Pars gas field and to build a liquid natural gas ( LNG ) plant , was supposed to be signed on February 27 , 2008 but has been delayed . The state @-@ operated National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) and CNOOC signed a memorandum of understanding in December 2006 for the project , under which CNOOC would purchase 10 million metric tons per year of LNG for 25 years . 
 = = Petrochemicals = = 
 In the early 2000s , an ambitious state petrochemicals project called for expansion of annual output in that industry from 9 million tons in 2001 to 100 million tons in 2015 . Output capacity in 2006 was estimated at 15 million tons . The goal of this expansion is to increase the percentage of Iran ’ s processed petroleum @-@ based exports , which are more profitable than raw materials . In 2005 Iran exported US $ 1 @.@ 8 billion of petrochemical products ( about one @-@ third of total <unk> exports in that year ) . Receiving 30 percent of Iran ’ s petrochemical exports between them , China and India were the major trading partners in this industry . Iran ’ s domestic resource base gives it a unique comparative advantage in producing petrochemicals when international crude oil prices rise . The gain has been greatest in those plants that use liquid gas as their main input . For FY 2006 , the petrochemical industry ’ s share of GDP was projected to be about 2 percent . Iran plans to invest a total of $ 500 billion in the oil sector before 2025 . 
 Iran ’ s petrochemical industries have absorbed a large amount of private and public investment . In the early 2000s , 43 percent of these investments was financed by Iran ’ s National Petrochemical Company , a subsidiary of the Ministry of Petroleum , which administers the entire petrochemical sector . Another 53 percent is owned by foreign creditors ( more than 100 foreign banks and foreign companies ) , 3 percent by banks , and 1 percent by the capital market . Most of the petrochemical industry ’ s physical capital is imported , and the industry does not have strong backward linkages to manufacturing industries . In 2006 new petrochemical plants came online at <unk> and <unk> , and construction began on three others . Iran National Petrochemical Company 's output capacity will increase to over 100 million tpa by 2015 from an estimated 50 million tpa in 2010 thus becoming the world ' second largest chemical producer globally after Dow Chemical with Iran housing some of the world 's largest chemical complexes . 
 = Eastbourne manslaughter = 
 The Eastbourne manslaughter was an 1860 legal case in Eastbourne , England , concerning the death of 15 @-@ year @-@ old Reginald Cancellor ( some sources give his name as Chancellor and his age as 13 or 14 ) at the hands of his teacher , Thomas Hopley . Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor 's part , but instead beat the boy to death . 
 An inquest into Cancellor 's death began when his brother requested an autopsy . As a result of the inquest Hopley was arrested and charged with manslaughter . He was found guilty at trial and sentenced to four years in prison , although he insisted that his actions were justifiable and that he was not guilty of any crime . The trial was sensationalised by the Victorian press and incited debate over the use of corporal punishment in schools . After Hopley 's release and subsequent divorce trial , he largely disappeared from the public record . The case became an important legal precedent in the United Kingdom for discussions of corporal punishment in schools and reasonable limits on discipline . 
 = = Background = = 
 Thomas Hopley , aged 41 at the time of the incident , was a schoolmaster in Eastbourne who ran a private boarding school out of his home at 22 Grand @-@ parade . He was well educated and from a middle @-@ class family , the son of a Royal Navy surgeon and brother of artist Edward Hopley . His household was fairly well off , and he and his wife kept several servants . Hopley was described by Algernon Charles Swinburne as " a person of high attainments and irreproachable character " . He expressed " utopian " educational ideals shared by many Victorian educational theorists . He wrote pamphlets on education topics which included " Lectures on the Education of Man " , " Help towards the physical , intellectual and moral elevation of all classes of society " , and " Wrongs which cry out for redress " advocating the abolition of child labour . 
 In October 1859 , he was offered £ 180 a year ( compared to an average annual salary of £ 94 for a male public elementary school teacher in 1860 ) to teach Reginald Channell Cancellor , a " robust " boy who had been " given up as <unk> " . Reginald was the son of John Henry Cancellor ( 1799 – 1860 ) , a court master and a " man of fair position " from Barnes , Surrey . The boy had previously been a student at a private school in St. Leonards and under a private tutor . He was not a good student , with contemporary sources suggesting he " had water on the brain " and describing him as " stolid and stupid " . Hopley attributed Cancellor 's failure to learn to stubbornness . On 18 April 1860 he asked the boy 's father for permission to use " severe corporal punishment " to obtain compliance , with permission being granted two days later . Hopley did not possess the cane traditionally used to administer corporal punishment to students , so instead he used a skipping rope and a walking stick . 
 = = Death = = 
 Cancellor was found dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April . His body was covered , with long stockings over his legs and <unk> gloves on his hands . The only visible part of the body was his face . A medical man of Hopley 's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes . When questioned , Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately . He wrote to the boy 's father requesting the body 's immediate removal and interment . After viewing his son 's dressed body , Cancellor 's father accepted Roberts ' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial . 
 Rumours began to circulate among the <unk> ' servants , suggesting that Hopley 's wife had spent the night prior to the body 's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband 's murder of the boy . Reginald 's older brother , Reverend John Henry Cancellor , Jr . ( 1834 – 1900 ) , arrived in Eastbourne from Send , Surrey , on 25 April . He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother 's death and requested an autopsy . Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock , an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen , to examine the body and verify death by natural causes ; Locock believed that Hopley was responsible for the death . 
 A complete inquest into Cancellor 's death was initiated . His body was taken for autopsy on 28 April and was found to be covered in blood under the gloves and stockings . His thighs were " reduced to a perfect jelly " and his body was covered in bruises and cuts , including two inch @-@ deep holes in his right leg , deep enough to allow the medical examiner , Robert Willis , to touch the bone underneath . Willis reported that other than these injuries , the boy was healthy and his internal organs ( including the heart ) were free of disease . He thus concluded that Cancellor had not died of natural causes , as Hopley had suggested , and noted that the boy had obviously been beaten shortly before his death . A female servant named Ellen Fowler , when questioned by investigators , reported that she had heard Cancellor screaming and being beaten from 10 pm until midnight and that , shortly thereafter , he abruptly fell silent . She also noted traces of blood in the house and on Hopley 's candlestick , which was left outside Cancellor 's bedroom , and evidence that Cancellor 's and Hopley 's clothes had been washed soon before the former was pronounced dead . Two other servants testified in the inquiry and gave similar accounts . 
 The inquest was unable to determine Cancellor 's exact cause of death , but noted several inconsistencies in Hopley 's explanation of events . He had failed to summon a doctor immediately and , upon questioning , had given outlandish excuses for his failure to do so . Hopley attempted to explain away the blood on the candlestick by attributing it to a broken blister on his hand , but did not offer an explanation for Cancellor 's injuries . Hopley aroused further suspicion when he asked journalists present at the inquest not to include details of the corporal punishment in their stories , " in order to spare the feelings of the deceased family as of my own " . Cancellor 's family was deeply affected by the case , as they had been " disinclined " to see Cancellor beaten ; his father died shortly after the inquest of a " broken heart " . 
 = = Trial = = 
 Hopley was arrested in early May and , after a seven @-@ hour preliminary hearing , was released on 16 June on a £ 2 @,@ 000 bail . He and his then @-@ pregnant wife spent the period between the initial hearing and the trial at Uckfield . Hopley was confident that he would be found not guilty . He began composing a pamphlet titled Facts Bearing on the Death of Reginald Channell Cancellor , to be published after the trial ; it was published by an associate of Hopley 's after his conviction and detailed Hopley 's explanation of Cancellor 's death and his justification for his treatment of the boy . The press was extremely hostile , calling for a murder charge to be laid against him . He received a large amount of hate mail from anonymous members of the public . 
 Hopley 's trial took place at Lewes Assizes on 23 July 1860 . The prosecutors were Parry and Knapp ; Hopley was defended by the serjeant @-@ at @-@ law William Ballantine , who subsequently described Hopley as " distorted " . Throughout his trial , Hopley described himself as reluctant to use corporal punishment . In describing the events preceding Cancellor 's death , Hopley stated that he started crying while beating Cancellor , after which Cancellor presented his lesson and " Hopley took his head on his breast and prayed with him " . Hopley presented testimonials from past students who described him as " kindly " and who noted an infrequent use of violence . Hopley claimed to be a <unk> follower of John Locke , who had decried the use of corporal punishment except in cases of extreme obstinacy on the part of the student . He argued that , through the application of this theory , the beating that killed Cancellor had been a necessary one . 
 Robert Willis testified at the trial that there was no possibility that Cancellor 's death had been a result of natural causes . He presented a detailed description of the boy 's injuries , suggesting that they had been sustained over several hours . He also revealed that Cancellor 's skull cavity contained six to eight ounces of fluid , attributing to this fluid the boy 's seeming inability to learn as described by Hopley , but rejected any suggestions that it may have contributed to Cancellor 's death . Cancellor 's brother , Fowler , and Locock all testified against Hopley ; Locock 's testimony was particularly hostile , suggesting that Hopley 's incompetent response to interviews was " tantamount to an admission of guilt " . Other witnesses included the <unk> ' laundress , Roberts , three members of the coastguard who had seen lights on in the house late at night , a local constable , and the town registrar . 
 Ballantine 's conduct during the trial was flawed , and he believed Hopley to be insane . Although he promoted the testimonials of former students and argued that a schoolmaster was unlikely to " so lightly jeopardize his ambitions " , he congratulated Locock on the accuracy of his testimony in open court . Ballantine did not call key witnesses like Edward Philpott , another student of Hopley 's who had been at the house that night . Philpott slept in the bedroom beside Cancellor 's and had reported hearing no unusual noises or screams from Cancellor 's room on the night of his death . Neither did Ballantine call Professor John Eric <unk> of University College Hospital , who had conducted a second autopsy on Cancellor on 11 May and had suggested that " the misleading appearance of the body was attributable to an undiagnosed blood condition akin to haemophilia " . In his memoir Some experiences of a barrister 's life , published in 1883 , Ballantine offered a highly sensationalised account of Cancellor 's death : " the wretched half @-@ witted victim of a lunatic 's system of education was deliberately mangled to death " . 
 Hopley was convicted of manslaughter , not murder , because of his position as a schoolteacher " endowed with parental authority " . Sir Alexander Cockburn , the Chief Justice of the Court of King 's Bench , presented a summary of the decision : 
 By the law of England , a parent or a schoolmaster ( who for this purpose represents the parent and has the parental authority delegated to him ) , may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child , inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment , always , however , with the condition , that it is moderate and reasonable . If it be administered for the gratification of passion or of rage , or if it be immoderate or excessive in its nature or degree , or if it be protracted beyond the child 's powers of endurance , or with an instrument unfitted for the purpose and calculated to produce danger to life and limb : in all such cases the punishment is excessive , the violence unlawful , and if evil consequences to life or limb ensue , then the person inflicting it is answerable to the law , and if death ensues it will be manslaughter . 
 Cockburn further suggested that Hopley should have realised Cancellor 's cognitive deficiencies and taken these into account in his treatment of the boy . 
 Hopley was sentenced to four years of penal servitude at Millbank Prison . After being indicted , he wrote : " while anguish shook the frame , the conscience suffered not one pang . I searched and searched among the deepest secrets of my soul , and could not blame myself ... I could look up <unk> into the face of heaven who knew me to be Not Guilty . " He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher . He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion , claiming that " a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder , and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded , not simply through the United Kingdom , but through the civilised world , as one of the most execrable monsters or of madmen . " He published a pamphlet arguing that Locock had perjured himself and had conspired with Fowler to influence the outcome of the trial . 
 = = Reaction and aftermath = = 
 The trial was sensationalised by contemporary media . The press derided Hopley as " monstrous " , and criticised schoolteachers in general and private schoolteachers in particular . Newspapers published graphic accounts of Cancellor 's injuries and autopsy and further exaggerated the early rumours surrounding his death . Cancellor 's was the first death by corporal punishment to have received broad public interest . To prevent overcrowding , the court issued tickets for admission to the public gallery during the trial ; the courtroom was full an hour before the trial began . After Hopley 's conviction , he issued at least two pamphlets on model education from gaol , which were poorly received by the public . Hopley 's immediate fame was short @-@ lived ; a mere month after his conviction , the press was focused on another case of corporal punishment , that of Caroline Lefevre , whose arms were allegedly burnt by her teacher . 
 Following Hopley 's release from prison , he became immediately embroiled in a sensationalised divorce trial . His wife , Fanny , had petitioned for divorce on the grounds that he was " unloving " and had mistreated her . She claimed that Hopley had married her as an " educational experiment " , presenting Hopley 's educational theories as evidence of his " lunacy " . She had been 18 years old to Hopley 's 36 at the time of their marriage in 1855 . According to her statements during the trial , Hopley frequently criticised her writing and insisted that the couple 's three children should be raised as " second Christs " . She accused him of physically abusing her from the time of her first pregnancy , beating his first child only days after its birth ( the child was later found to be " brain @-@ damaged " ) , and suggesting that during his prison sentence she should be confined to a workhouse . Hopley responded by claiming that he set rules only to ensure the maintenance of his household and the well @-@ being of his family , and produced a set of romantic letters he had received from Fanny during his incarceration as evidence of her unforced affection for him . 
 The jury found Hopley guilty of cruelty , but suggested that Fanny had condoned his treatment of her . The judge therefore ruled that her case was insufficient to grant a divorce . The verdict sparked outrage among the public , who believed that " a great injustice had been done " , and that Fanny should not be forced to remain married to an abusive convicted killer . Fanny left England shortly afterwards , allegedly to avoid having to continue living with Hopley . 
 Hopley largely withdrew from the public eye after the trial , becoming a private tutor in London and publishing pamphlets on spiritualism in the late 1860s . He died at University College Hospital on 24 June 1876 . A retrospective editorial published in The Times in 1960 concluded that Hopley was not " the villain which some persons pictured him to be " ; it noted that at the time of his arrest Hopley had been planning the construction of a " model school " in Brighton and that he had examined architect 's drawings of the school after beating Cancellor . 
 In 1865 , Cancellor 's death was used in a medical journal article discussing adult hydrocephalus . Despite Willis ' statement that Cancellor had no pre @-@ existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death , author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus , but that he was consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result . He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor 's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness . 
 R v Hopley was used as an archetypal case for legal commentaries about corporal punishment until physical discipline was officially banned in British schools well over a century later . According to education professor Marie Parker @-@ Jenkins , R v Hopley is " the most quoted case of the 19th century involving the issue of corporal punishment " . The case is credited with prompting outcry against corporal punishment among the general public , although contemporary education journals rejected the possibility of abolishing corporal punishment . Hopley 's defence , known as " reasonable chastisement " , became a frequently used response to charges of corporal punishment and was incorporated into the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . Cockburn 's requirement for " moderate and reasonable " punishment was established as a legal limit to corporal punishment and is still employed in modern legal scholarship .

 Cyrus is a singer @-@ songwriter and actress who starred as Miley Stewart , a girl with a secret double life as the popstar Hannah Montana , on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana . Through the television series , Cyrus developed fame as a teen idol and released music while being credited to Hannah Montana . Cyrus ' debut studio album , titled Meet Miley Cyrus , was released as the second disc of the Hannah Montana 2 : Meet Miley Cyrus ( 2007 ) double @-@ disc album . Breakout is Cyrus ' second studio album and her first not be affiliated with the Hannah Montana franchise , which was intended to be reflected by the title of the album . She believed it was her " breakout record " , where she was going to " show everyone what Miley Cyrus is all about . " Cyrus further explained the album was also appropriately titled because it portrayed her " stepping away from Hannah but just a little bit different . " She also decided to title the album after the song " Breakout " because it was " one of [ her ] favorite songs " . 
 Cyrus believed that compared to previous albums , Breakout was " grown @-@ up " and " just a little more creative . " Cyrus aimed to incorporate a sound influenced by rock music , saying " the writing is definitely different ... the lyrics mean more than my last couple of records " . According to Cyrus , the album documented , in depth , the events that occurred in her life in a year span . Most of the songs were written as Cyrus traveled on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008 . Recording commenced immediately after the tour came to an end , and seized in March 2008 , for Cyrus was to film Hannah Montana : The Movie ( 2009 ) in Tennessee soon after . She expressed that , through each song , a listener could discover something about her and about themselves . Of connecting with her fans through Breakout , she claimed she wanted " girls to feel to be able to feel empowered and just feel like they can kind of rock out " , going on to say that , " listening to this music , I hope they can feel like a reason to dance and just smile and to have fun . This CD is totally age appropriate , specially for me " .

 " Breakout " was written by Ted Bruner , in collaboration with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go @-@ Go 's . It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry , for her second album One of the Boys ( 2008 ) , though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus , on whose version Perry sings backing vocals . Like most songs on Breakout , Cyrus wrote " 7 Things " while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour , reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex @-@ boyfriend . She claimed her use of the word " hate " demonstrated how furious she was , at the time . Originally , " 7 Things " was more " soft and nice " but Cyrus says she " went nuts " during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound . She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper 's " Girls Just Want to Have Fun " from the album She 's So Unusual ( 1983 ) , after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards . The two singers were conversing about music , when Lauper stated , " Well , don 't be scared of anything . People waste their lives being scared . Lasso the moon . But don 't do it because someone tells you it 's the right idea . " Cyrus believed Lauper 's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout , ergo she covered " Girls Just Want to Have Fun " . However , she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of " Girls Just Want to Have Fun " she heard . She described the process as " almost [ having ] to relearn the song . " About the finished product , Cyrus said , " When you listen to the song , it 's , like , you 're not even sure what it is . It 's something completely new . " " Full Circle " was co @-@ written by Cyrus , Scott Cutler , and Anne Preven about Cyrus ' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers . " It 's about two people . They 're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says , the bad people that try to keep you apart " , Cyrus said of the song 's concept . 
 " Fly on the Wall " was written by Cyrus with the aid of Armato , James , and Devrim Karaoglu . " Fly on the Wall " was intended for the media , regarding " how they think they know everything about [ her ] , when they don 't . They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [ her ] 24 / 7 . " Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid <unk> but they appeared , " not going away like little annoying flies . " Cyrus was inspired to write " Bottom of the Ocean " by her deceased fish , Lyric and Melody , who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age . She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing . " It 's saying if there 's someone you 've loved but for some reason you can 't love them anymore , you have to take your feelings , scoop them out , and put them at the bottom of the ocean . " Cyrus , Armato , James , Aaron Dudley co @-@ wrote " Wake Up America " , a track about environmentalism . The song was directed towards " the people in the back seat " , children of today 's generation ; she said that , in the future , they would be the ones " driving [ the ] Earth to what it 's gonna be . " " It 's the only one you got , so you gotta take care of it . And if you don 't , there 's gonna be , maybe not for you , right then , and your generation but your kids and their kids ... Every generation has a cycle that 'll carry on for the rest of eternity " , she concluded . Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball 's " Four Walls " from the album The Day Has Come ( 2006 ) for Breakout , titled " These Four Walls " . The twelfth and final track is a remixed version of the hit " See You Again " , referred to as the Rock Mafia Remix and the 2008 Remix ; " See You Again " was originally released on the Meet Miley Cyrus disc of Hannah Montana 2 : Meet Miley Cyrus . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Overall , Breakout is dominant on pop rock but explores a variety of other musical genres . The opening track , " Breakout " , is a dance @-@ pop number that begins with a fast beat , composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progresses to " the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer " ; " ecstatic beats " pummel throughout . The song 's lyrics are " a girls @-@ only call to fun " that anecdote on feelings about coming of age and the desire to be school @-@ free . The uptempo refrains of " 7 Things " are pop punk influenced . The song is " a three @-@ tempo patchwork quilt " , transitioning " from sensitive breakup song in the strummy verses to punky @-@ pop kiss @-@ off in the double @-@ time choruses . " " 7 Things " ' lyrics list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex @-@ boyfriend . " The Driveway " is a power ballad whose lyrics regard a breakup , insisting " nothing hurts like losing when you know it 's really gone . " The cover of Cyndi Lauper 's " Girls Just Wanna Have Fun " replaces the subtle reggae undercurrent in the original version with a more rock music driven sound that includes pop punk beats and string stabs . The lyrics of " Girls Just Wanna Have Fun " primarily discuss the " desire to let loose with one 's friends " , touching upon details of the life of an overworked child star . The song " Full Circle " is composed of a several pop rock hooks ; in one of the hooks , Cyrus finishes various words with " Oh , oh , oh ! " . The lyrics describe not quitting a relationship . 
 " Fly on the Wall " is prominently an electropop song that is also composed of a number of hooks , which yell the song 's title , while the instrumentation relies on electric guitars . Unlike other songs on Breakout , " Fly on the Wall " has Cyrus ' voice processed to sound different . The song 's lyrics taunt " the listener for being on the outside of her inner sanctum " . The target of the message has been interpreted differently by contemporary critics – an ex @-@ boyfriend and the media have most commonly been referred to . " Bottom of the Ocean " is a contemporary ballad that contains a sound reflecting influences from minimalist music . The backdrop for the " feel @-@ bad " love song features ocean wave sounds . The track " Wake Up America " has a " cheeky riff @-@ rock backdrop " as its , while its lyrical content concerns environmentalism , where Cyrus mainly pleads for audiences to give the Earth " just a little attention " . In the first verse , she " admits that she doesn 't know exactly what 's up with this global warming but believes there 's something we should all do about it " . " These Four Walls " is a power ballad accented with country pop elements and twangy vocals and lyrics which speak of an interior narrative . " Simple Song " has " bile " sound and is lyrically about moments in coming of age where a person " can 't tell which way is up , which way is down " and they feel the need to alienate themselves . In " Goodbye " , Cyrus ' vocal performance is more " <unk> " with a more " natural @-@ sounding accompaniment " while , in the lyrics , she finds her remembering the " simple things ... until [ she cries ] . " " See You Again " ( Rock Mafia Remix ) is dance @-@ pop number , fusing sultry vocals with techno beats . The track has Cyrus detailing previous scenes and plans to redeem herself .

 " 7 Things " was released on June 17 , 2008 as the lead single from Breakout , through digital distribution . Following the song 's release , allegations sparked that it was about Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers , which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied . It received mixed reviews from contemporary critics , several of which compared Cyrus to Avril Lavigne . " 7 Things " enjoyed worldwide commercial success , becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia , Japan , Norway , and the United States . The single was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) . The song 's accompanying music video was directed by Brett Ratner and features Cyrus performing the song with a back @-@ up band as many teenage girls lipsync along . 
 " See You Again " ( Rock Mafia Remix ) was released August 11 , 2008 as the second single from Breakout ; it was only released in countries where the original version was not . The remix was received well by critics for properly combining vocals and music . The remix expanded the success of " See You Again " , appearing on charts in Austria , Belgium ( Flanders ) , Germany , Ireland , and the United Kingdom . " See You Again " ( Rock Mafia Remix ) was given a promotional music video , taken from a performance at the 2008 Disney Channel Games . 
 " Fly on the Wall " was released on February 16 , 2009 as the third and final single from the album . " Fly on the Wall " received critical praise ; several critics claiming it defied teen pop expectations and was Breakout 's best track . However , the song failed to match success of " 7 Things " , reaching its highest peak at number sixteen on the UK Singles Chart . Its music video was directed by Philip Andelman . Inspired by Michael Jackson 's Thriller , the video depicts Cyrus attempting to escape the paparazzi , as they follow her in a parking garage . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 The promotion plan was centered on massive performances and interviews to television , radio , and magazines . It was formulated to not be aggressive to give Cyrus a period of rest , after doing many consecutive projects . Cyrus explained , 
 " I 'm a kid . That 's why , for the most part , we only did the big publicity and otherwise decided to let the album whatever it was going to do . It was so weird not to do everything in my power to promote my first album under my own name . I am very proud of it and love what we came up with . But I also had to accept the reality of my situation . So much is happening all at once , so many opportunities . I want to make the most of them , but I also need to stay sane . There will be a day , my parents constantly remind me , when I won 't have so much going on . And when that day comes , I don 't want to feel like an empty shell of a person . " 
 Cyrus first performed songs from Breakout , the title track , " Fly on the Wall " , and " See You Again " ( Rock Mafia Remix ) , at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Disney Channel Games on May 4 , 2008 . Her first live performance of " 7 Things " took place on May 17 , 2008 at the 2008 Zootopia , an annual summer concert put on by radio station Z100 . Later that summer , she promoted Breakout at outdoor concerts hosted by Good Morning America and The Today Show , while hosting the 2008 Teen Choice Awards , and at FNMTV . Cyrus began promotion for Breakout in Europe in fall 2008 , performing the track on the United Kingdom channel GMTV , the French television show Le Grand Journal , and the British singing competition The X Factor among other venues . Cyrus performed several songs from album on April 24 , 2009 in a London Apple Store . These performances were recorded and sold exclusively by the United Kingdom iTunes Store as a live extended play ( EP ) titled iTunes Live from London . 
 Well over a year after the Breakout 's release , Cyrus embarked on her second concert tour , the Wonder World Tour , to promote the album and The Time of Our Lives extended play ( EP ) . The tour was Cyrus ' first to not have her costumed as Hannah Montana and was announced in June 2009 , with dates revealed for American venues . Dates for venues in the United Kingdom were later announced . In to order to avoid the extensive scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour , all tickets were sold exclusively through paperless ticket delivery , which would require audiences to bring identification to gain entry into the concert . The tour expanded from September to December 2009 , with a total of fifty @-@ six concerts in North America and Europe . The tour received positive to mixed reviews from critics . Some praised it and deemed it a spectacle , while others believed it lacked profundity and portrayal of Cyrus ' personality . The Wonder World Tour managed to gross over $ 67 @.@ 1 million , $ 15 million which were earned by the singer . The entire European leg sold out within ten minutes , and , at one stop , Cyrus broke the record for the largest attendance at The O2 Arena in London , England with an audience of 16 @,@ 196 . A concert film was released on the limited , deluxe edition of her third studio album Can 't Be Tamed ( 2010 ) .

 Breakout received generally positive reviews , earning a collective score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic . Heather Phares of Allmusic commented that Breakout 's title expresses its " purpose nicely " though the music was not drastically different from Hannah Montana 's , adding , " only a handful of songs truly break out from the Montana mold " . Though not being impressed by " nothing [ being ] left to chance " , she concluded , " Even if these songs are derivative of much more established pop divas [ Avril Lavigne and Britney Spears ] , they provide clues to the kind of company Cyrus aims to keep . And while Breakout isn 't as much of a breakthrough as it could be , it still moves Miley closer to an identity and career outside of Hannah . " Kerri Mason of Billboard wrote , " While it 's still age @-@ appropriate for minors , Breakout is for the big kids too " and complimented Cyrus for being a " natural @-@ born popstar . " Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe felt Cyrus mostly succeeded while " trying to please most of the people most of the time " on Breakout . She summarized , " With Breakout , Cyrus has clearly made a choice to break from the shiny , happy ' Hannah Montana ' character , but she hasn 't scuffed her sound up so much that her fans won 't recognize that she 's just being Miley . " Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded the album a B and noted that the first half of the album was " fun " but the second half became " overly ballad @-@ heavy , " assuming that was the more mature side of Cyrus she had promised . <unk> Wood of the Los Angeles Times stated , " In that respect , Breakout is unlikely fodder for the razzle @-@ dazzle road shows and 3 @-@ D concert films to come . As a portrait of the artist as a young <unk> , though , it 's rarely less than fascinating . " 
 Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said Cyrus ' attempt to leave Hannah Montana was weak , only being driven by " more gray thoughts " . Ratliff continued , " She eases up on songs with total @-@ affirmation chants about being the captain of her ship ... The lyrics are half @-@ terrible — almost too realistic as teenage thoughts — but the best of them transmit the desired message ... It ’ s a lackluster album , floated by two or three strong singles . " Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was " a just @-@ okay <unk> record with audible suggestions of said singer @-@ songwriter aspirations . To be sure , it ’ s a stronger collection of songs than Moms and Dads with upturned noses ... would probably expect . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five , being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a " worthy follow @-@ up " to " See You Again " . Cinquemani finished , " For teen @-@ pop , your kid could do worse . You know , like Avril [ Lavigne ] " . Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice wrote , " If her lyrical prowess hasn 't caught up to her voice yet , that should only hold promise of things to come . She 's a rare talent ; now she only has to survive until adulthood . " Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo ! Music gave Breakout seven stars out of ten and referred to Cyrus , in Breakout , as the ideal of the American Dream : " a combination of hard work , good Christian living and un @-@ smutty pop " .

 = M @-@ 120 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 120 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan in the southwest Lower Peninsula . The highway runs northeast from Muskegon to Hesperia . In between , the road passes through suburban Muskegon , forests and farmland . Some 5 @,@ 900 – 26 @,@ 000 vehicles use the highway each day on average as it runs long a series of roads that follow county lines in the area . 
 The current highway to bear the M @-@ 120 designation is the third in the state . The first was a spur route in the Lansing area in the 1930s . The second was a route that connected to like @-@ numbered state highways in both Ohio and Indiana . The current M @-@ 120 was originally part of M @-@ 20 until that highway was rerouted between New Era and US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The current route starts at Business US 31 ( Bus . US 31 ) where Muskegon Lake and the Muskegon River meet in Muskegon . As it crosses the river , it is known as the Veterans Memorial Causeway , with a section of Veterans Memorial Park between the northbound and southbound sections of the road . This road continues north as Whitehall Road , which connects Muskegon to Whitehall . At Whitehall Road , M @-@ 120 turns east on Holton Road and continues in a northeastern direction through the suburb of North Muskegon . The south side of the roadway abuts residential areas and <unk> @-@ Puffer High School ; the north side is largely undeveloped . M @-@ 120 meets the US 31 freeway in Muskegon Township . Holton Road continues northeasterly past Oak Hill Cemetery and turns northerly at Bard Road . The highway curves to the northeast again through Twin Lake to avoid several lakes in the area . The landscape along the road between Twin Lake and Holton , like much of the overall route of the highway , is woodland . Northeast of Holton , those forests transition to farm land as M @-@ 120 turns to the north . The highway meets B @-@ 31 as it turns north to run along the Muskegon – Newaygo county line . 
 As M @-@ 120 continues north along the county line , it runs in Holton Township in Muskegon County to the west and Sheridan Township in Newaygo County to the east along Maple Island Road . West of Fremont , the highway meets an intersection with M @-@ 82 and B @-@ 86 . B @-@ 86 runs along the Muskegon – Oceana county line , and M @-@ 82 runs along a township line in Newaygo County . North of this intersection , M @-@ 120 follows the Oceana – Newaygo county line that divides Greenwood Township from Dayton Township . Maple Island Road enters the south side of Hesperia on Division Street . M @-@ 120 terminates at an intersection with M @-@ 20 in the middle of the village , 27 @.@ 901 miles ( 44 @.@ 902 km ) from its starting point . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 120 like all other components of the Michigan state trunkline highway system . As part of these responsibilities , the department tracks traffic volumes along the highway . MDOT uses a metric called average annual daily traffic , which is a calculation of the traffic along a roadway segment for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the highest traffic levels were near the southern terminus at 26 @,@ 736 vehicles each day . The lowest levels MDOT calculated were in Holton at 5 @,@ 936 vehicles daily . The section between the south end and US 31 , M @-@ 120 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . The remainder of the highway has not been listed .

 The M @-@ 120 designation was originally used on two different roadways in the state . In 1930 , a road from US 16 for about a mile at the northwest corner of Lansing was numbered M @-@ 120 . In early 1939 , the M @-@ 174 designation replaced the M @-@ 120 moniker on the road . Later that year , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) used the number for a road along the Michigan @-@ Ohio state line . This highway connected to State Route 120 on its east end at the state line and ran west to US 127 at Meridian Road along the Hillsdale – Lenawee county line . By the end of 1940 , M @-@ 120 was extended through Hillsdale County to connect to State Road 120 along the short north – south Michigan – Indiana border . By the middle of 1961 , the M @-@ 120 designation was retired by the MSHD again . The Ohio and Indiana SR 120 highways are still in place today with only the county road in Michigan connecting them . 
 = = = Current routing = = = 
 The MSHD 's successor , the Michigan Department of State Highways , realigned the route of M @-@ 20 through Western Michigan in 1969 . In the aftermath of the reroute , the M @-@ 20 designation was moved from Muskegon to New Era . The former routing of M @-@ 20 south of Hesperia to Muskegon was renumbered M @-@ 120 , including a segment that ran concurrently with M @-@ 82 . That concurrency was removed in 1978 .

 = Barra Head = 
 Barra Head , also known as Berneray ( Scottish Gaelic : Beàrnaraigh ) , is the southernmost of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland . Within the Outer Hebrides , it forms part of the Barra Isles archipelago . Originally , Barra Head only referred to the southernmost headland of Berneray but is now a common name for the entire island . The highest point of the island is Sotan , a Marilyn . 
 There are numerous prehistoric structures on the island and permanent occupation by 20 – 50 individuals occurred throughout the historic period , peaking in the 19th century . The economy of the residents was based on agriculture , fishing and fowling . The cliffs provide nesting sites for seabirds in such profusion that Berneray has been designated as a Special Protection Area . 
 The Barra Head Lighthouse , built by Robert Stevenson , has operated since 1833 . From 1931 to 1980 Barra Head was inhabited only by the lighthouse keepers and their wives but the lighthouse is now automated and the island completely uninhabited . The rough seas that surround the island have been used to test prototype lifeboats . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The derivation of the modern name is straightforward , the Old Norse name meaning " Bjorn 's island " becoming Beàrnaraigh in Gaelic and then " Berneray " as an <unk> . However , as is often the case with Hebridean island names , there are a number of additional complications . There are two fuller Gaelic names - Beàrnaraigh <unk> <unk> and Beàrnaraigh an <unk> meaning " Berneray of Barra Head " and " Berneray of the Bishop " respectively . The former refers to Barra Head the southernmost promontory of the island and the latter name is a reference to the " Bishop 's Isles " an alternative name for the " Barra Isles " , of which archipelago Berneray is a member . " Barra Head " alone is an English language alternative to Berneray for the island name .

Most of the island consists of gneiss , although the lighthouse was constructed of rock from a small granite quarry . 
 The seabed to the west is a continuation of the gneiss platform with a depth of between 120 to 140 metres ( 390 to 460 ft ) . The sea floor is largely devoid of sand and there is some evidence of scouring by icebergs . This rocky platform extends south of Barra Head by at least 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) . Due to glacial action the sea channel to the east is significantly deeper than the open ocean to the west , reaching up to 365 metres ( 1 @,@ 198 ft ) . 
 The rocky north coast has a small landing place at <unk> na <unk> to the west and a small jetty at Achduin further east . From there a track leads westward and upward across the slope of the island to the lighthouse . To the west of Achduin the land is relatively flat and low @-@ lying , the area known as " The Aird " ending at <unk> Point which overlooks the little islands of Rubha <unk> and Sgeir <unk> . 
 The south coast is dominated by high cliffs , which rise to 190 metres ( 620 ft ) at Skate Point ( Rubha <unk> ) in the south west . Barra Head itself is the southern prominence located mid @-@ way along the south coast . The highest point of the island is Sotan , a Marilyn whose summit lies above high cliffs between Barra Head and Skate Point . This eminence is easily reached from the track that leads from Achduin to the lighthouse that passes just to the north of the summit , which is only 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) from the cliff edge . The skerry of Bird Rock guards the coast far below . The lighthouse is located near the prominence of Sròn an Duin , just east of Skate Point and above the narrow chasm of <unk> na <unk> ( ravine of the monster ) . 
 Visiting in 1868 H. J. Elwes wrote : 
 It was the grandest sight I ever experienced , to look out of the lighthouse on a very stormy day , and see oneself hanging , as it were , over the ocean , surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce the appearance of a heavy snowstorm , whilst the cries of these myriads , mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe , made it almost impossible to hear a person speak . 
 = = History = = 
 Berneray has been inhabited since prehistoric times and Historic Scotland have identified eighty @-@ three archaeological sites on the island , the majority being of a pre @-@ medieval date . There are four chambered tombs , five cists and five other sites assumed to be burial cairns , suggesting a significant settlement in the Neolithic and Bronze Age . The fort of Dùn <unk> ( the broken fort ) lies to the north west and a second site nearby dating to the Iron Age was largely destroyed during the construction of the lighthouse . Visiting in the late 17th century the writer Martin Martin described the latter as " having a vacuity round the walls , divided in little apartments " . A century later Edward MacQueen wrote that he believed it had served " as a <unk> or watch tower " . 
 There is also the presumed site of a chapel near MacLean 's Point ( just east of the landing place ) where an incised cross , tentatively dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries was found . Archaeological evidence of the Norse presence in the Hebrides is scant , but boat shaped stone settings found not far from the chapel may be graves from this period of occupation . 
 Referring to his own time , Martin suggested that life on " Bernera " was not unduly difficult . " It excels other islands of the same extent for cultivation and fishing . The natives never go a fishing while <unk> or his steward is in the island , lest seeing their plenty of fish , perhaps they might take occasion to raise their rents . " In the 18th century the population was over fifty , with settlement concentrated around the north east coast . The 1841 census recorded a population of 30 , rising to 56 in 1881 and then declining again to 36 in nine houses by 1891 . During the 19th century the permanently resident population ( see below ) remained stable at about 20 in two or three families . The number fell to 17 by 1901 , with the last native islanders leaving about 1910 . From this point the three families of the lighthouse keepers were the only residents and the island became uninhabited with the 1980 automation of the light . 
 = = = Overview of population trends = = = 
 Notes : 
 Population ( a ) includes permanent residents only and was not recorded in 1901 . 
 Population ( b ) also includes lighthouse keepers and , given that many of the censuses were taken in April , temporarily resident fishermen . 
 = = Traditional economy and culture = = 
 During the 19th century agriculture was based on crops of barley , potatoes , oats , turnips and cabbages and livestock including sheep and cattle . Ponies were kept , although their use may have been to transport materials to the lighthouse , and goats were also recorded in 1863 . Berneray lacks peat , which had to be brought over from Mingulay at considerable effort . The harvest of the seas remained important , with the island a base for exploiting the rich stocks of white fish by fishermen from several local islands . Seabirds were also an important part of the economy , supplying both food and feathers for sale . Such was the abundance that in 1868 a single <unk> caught 600 birds in six to eight hours . 
 Visiting in 1818 , William MacGillivray , professor of Natural History at Aberdeen University wrote : 
 On reaching Berneray we landed and soon after <unk> ourselves to a hut which we found cleared for our reception . We dined on roasted mutton , wild fowls ' eggs , bread , butter and whisky . The <unk> of the house came home with a basketful of eggs from the rocks , and some birds he had caught . 
 The travel writer Isabella Bird arrived in 1863 aboard the Shamrock receiving an " outrageous welcome " from the islanders , despite the fact that amongst the Gaelic @-@ speaking locals only a few had " some very lame sentences in English " . She wrote approvingly that her hosts were " well @-@ dressed , cleanly and healthy looking " and of the " delicious cream , in large clean , wooden bowls . " Duncan Sinclair , the only Protestant on the island purchased a Bible and there was much bartering and bargaining with the islanders paying for their purchases in dried fish . Bird concluded that the island was : 
 Far out into the Atlantic , exposed to its fullest fury , and generally inaccessible , yet has nursed a population before , rather than behind , those of the other Hebrides . Without any advantages or other religious ordinances than are supplied by the annual visit of a priest from Barra , these very interesting people thirst for education , and would make considerable sacrifices to obtain it . 
 In 1851 several of the island 's children were described as " scholars at home " and later some youngsters attended the school on Mingulay . The Barra School Board created a " sub @-@ school " on Berneray but it can never have had even as many as ten children in attendance and it closed in 1887 after a few years of operation . 
 = = Lighthouse = = 
 Barra Head Lighthouse identifies the southern entrance to The Minch , roughly halfway between the Eilean Glas and Rinns of Islay lighthouses . The 58 foot ( 18 m ) stone tower stands on the west side of the island , at the top of a very steep cliff , making the light 693 feet ( 211 m ) above sea level , with a range of 18 miles ( 29 km ) . There is no shallow water west of Berneray to break the blow of the Atlantic storms and small fish are sometimes thrown onto the grass on the cliff top . In 1836 Sir Archibald Geikie recorded the movement of a 42 long tons ( 43 t ) block of gneiss across 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) of ground during a violent storm . 
 Designed by Robert Stevenson and built by James Smith of Inverness the light was first exhibited on 15 October 1833 . The oil @-@ burning light was converted to incandescent in 1906 and the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation on 23 October 1980 , when the last keepers were withdrawn . 
 Due to the dangerous landing conditions , Barra Head lighthouse was re @-@ classified by the RNLI as a " Rock Station " early in the 20th century . Two small boats had been swamped and lost in the enormous swell by the slipway at the landing place . The regulations associated with this change prevented both alongside landings by tenders and the lighthouse men keeping dinghies onshore . The departure of the last of the crofting families meant an end to regular links by sea and the regular mist and fog rendered signalling unreliable . A system of wireless communications with Castlebay on Barra was therefore proposed and installed by 1925 . 
 The pier was built in the late 1930s with the approach of war , when a sophisticated radar system was installed to guard the Western Approaches . This involved the landing of hundreds of steel girders and drums containing steel cables used to create three large radar masts , and a robust " Scots Derrick " was erected to crane them ashore . A small walled cemetery was constructed halfway between the lighthouse and the summit of Sotan for the keepers . This contains the grave of a visiting inspector and those of a number of the keepers ' children . A Blenheim bomber crashed into the cliffs nearby during World War II , but the wreck was not discovered until many years later by a rock climber . 
 = = Lifeboats = = 
 In the early 1970s a research project sponsored by BP into a prototype safety boat for Barra Head also assisted the RNLI in developing the Atlantic 21 class lifeboat . The boat used was a <unk> Atlantic 21 <unk> modified for long @-@ range operations and with full offshore capability . The project involved multi @-@ organisation co @-@ operation and included <unk> themselves , HM Coastguard and the Royal Marines Amphibious Trials and Testing Unit . 
 In 2008 the Barra RNLI Life Boat , Edna Windsor was featured on a series of Royal Mail stamps . The first class stamp shows the 17 metres ( 56 ft ) Severn class lifeboat in action in the Sound of Berneray 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south west of Barra in a 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) swell and a 30 kilometres per hour ( 16 kn ) wind .

 The National Trust for Scotland purchased the island in 2000 from a local crofters ' syndicate called the Barra Head Isles <unk> Company who had owned the island since 1955 . The NTS were able to acquire it through a bequest by Miss J. M. <unk> “ to provide an area of natural beauty in memory of her parents and the courage of her late brother , Bernard . ” In 2009 the NTS removed all the sheep from the island , citing the difficulties of maintaining the flock in such a remote location . 
 Berneray and Mingulay form an important breeding site for around a hundred thousand pairs of seabirds , and are especially important for the razorbill , the two islands having at least 2 @.@ 0 % of the UK 's breeding population in 1985 . Other species present include a variety of gulls , guillemots , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and ( since 1899 ) fulmars . The island is largely covered by maritime grassland , with some machair and heath . Primrose , violets , yellow flag iris and <unk> grow abundantly and grey seals are regularly seen by the landing cove . The island is designated as an SSSI and ( with Mingulay ) is a Special Protection Area .

 The island 's best known former resident is Peter Sinclair , aka <unk> Mòr or the " Barra Giant " . He was measured at 2 @.@ 03 m ( 6 ft 8 in ) tall aged seventeen in 1866 . He joined a travelling show , but disliked the publicity and returned to the islands to run a dairy in Castlebay in the summer and spend the winters at his home on Berneray . 
 = Problem of religious language = 
 The problem of religious language considers whether it is possible to talk about God meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal , infinite , and timeless , are accepted . Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God , religious language has the potential to be meaningless . Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless , or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful . Statements like " God loves me " are discussed largely in Religious Language . 
 Traditionally , religious language has been explained as via negativa , analogy , symbolism , or myth , each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms . The via negativa is a way of referring to God according to what God is not ; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities ; symbolism is used non @-@ literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences ; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories . Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political , performative , or imperative functions . 
 <unk> David Hume 's requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement , particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer . The movement proposed that , for a statement to hold meaning , it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically – with evidence from the senses . Consequently , the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify . Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about ; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism . British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that , in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified , religious statements are rendered meaningless . 
 The analogy of games – most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein – has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language . The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game : just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done , so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful . Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context . Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language . R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of " bliks " – unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established – which are not necessarily meaningless . Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical , even if it seems unverifiable . John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification , the view that if there is an afterlife , then religious statements will be verifiable after death . 
 = = Problem of religious language = = 
 Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God . Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal , infinite , and timeless , ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity . This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult : a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good , yet also hold that God 's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness . This raises the problem of how ( and whether ) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all , which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life . The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God , in which she outlined her dilemma : she was simultaneously certain of God 's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him . 
 The medieval doctrine of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language . This suggests that God has no accidental properties – these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence . If God has no accidental properties , he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived , because properties such as goodness are accidental . If divine simplicity is accepted , then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition . Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers ; for example , the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God , <unk> which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity . 
 The theologian Sallie <unk> believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience , owing to the increased secularisation of society . She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine , which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary . Because of this , she argues , religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God , and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless .

 = = = Via negativa = = = 
 Jewish philosopher Maimonides believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes , a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs : that the existence of God must be accepted , and that it is forbidden to describe God . Maimonides believed that God is simple and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes . He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively , for example , " God lives " should be taken as " God does not lack vitality " . Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment ; rather , he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures . To say that God is powerful , for example , would mean that God 's power is beyond worldly power , and incomparable to any other power . In doing so , Maimonides attempted to illustrate God 's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God . 
 = = = Analogy = = = 
 Thomas Aquinas argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience . An analogous term is partly univocal ( has only one meaning ) and partly equivocal ( has more than one potential meaning ) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject . He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously , with reference to human terms ; for example , when God is described as good , it does not mean that God is good in human terms , but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God 's goodness . 
 Philosopher <unk> Smedes argued that religious language is symbolic . Denying any conflict between science and religion , he proposes that ' to believe ' means to accept a conviction ( that God exists , in the context of Christianity ) , which is different from ' knowing ' , which only occurs once something is proven . Thus , according to Smedes , we believe things that we do not know for sure . Smedes argues that , rather than being part of the world , God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared . He argues that people can still believe in God , even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world , because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world ( he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently ) . Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God . He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis ( for us ) and not in se ( as such ) or sine nobis ( without us ) . The point , he argues , is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality , but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors . 
 In the twentieth century , Ian Ramsey developed the theory of analogy , a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath . He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other : a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God . Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other , defining the limits of other analogies . As a result , no one analogy on its own is sufficient , but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God . The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied . 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 Philosopher Paul Tillich argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs . He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept . Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point : a flag points to something beyond itself , the country it represents , but also participates in the meaning of the country . He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality . Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness , and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious . He believed that symbols cannot be invented , but live and die at the appropriate times . 
 Louis Dupré differentiates between signs and symbols , proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it . A symbol holds its own meaning : rather than merely pointing someone towards another object , it takes the place of and represents that object . He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign . Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself . A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived . Dupré differentiates between religious and aesthetic symbols , suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which " remains forever beyond our reach " . He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies , but conceals it . 
 Langdon Brown Gilkey explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism , identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use . Firstly , religious symbolism has a double focus , referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent ; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being . Secondly , he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life , involving issues important to an individual or community . Finally , he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived . 
 In the Sikh religious text the Guru Granth Sahib , religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically . In the text , Sikh Gurus repeat that the experiences they have while meditating are ineffable , <unk> , incomprehensible , and <unk> – this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised . To overcome this , the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language , assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine ( the <unk> ) and those experiencing it . For example , light is used to refer to the spiritual reality . 
 = = = Myth = = = 
 William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories . He argued that to those who practice a religion , myths are not mere fiction , but provide religious truths . Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force , and dismissed any myths which did not as " folktales " . Using the example of creation myths , he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses , the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth ; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory . 
 Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann proposed that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology ; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology , a task known as ' demythologising ' . Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import , the latter of which commands obedience . He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word , perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God , which seeks to provide humans with self @-@ understanding . Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible , a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God . 
 Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be <unk> to be compatible with naturalism . He offered a <unk> Christology , arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate , but a man with incredible experience of divine reality . To Hick , calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus ' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented . Hick believed that demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God .

 Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst has argued that religious language is often political , especially in the public sphere , and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority , as well as convey information . He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism , which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists . Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically , religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making truth @-@ claims ; instead , it is used to achieve certain goals . He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact , such as expressing feelings or asking questions . Donovan calls many of these uses performative , as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life . For example , the words " I promise " perform the action of promising themselves – Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function . Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language . Wittgenstein argued that " the meaning of the language is in the use " , taking the use of language to be performative . The philosopher J. L. Austin argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts , including vows , blessings , and the naming of children . He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs , but bring them about . Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language . He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks : when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred , those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest . He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker , who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent . 
 = = = Imperative = = = 
 British philosopher R. B. Braithwaite attempted to approach religious language empirically and adopted Wittgenstein 's idea of " meaning as use " . He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non @-@ descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning ; they do not describe the world , but the believer 's attitudes towards it . Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories , metaphors , and parables . 
 Professor Nathan Katz writes of the analogy of a burning building , used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra , which casts religious language as imperative . In the analogy , a father sees his children at the top of a burning building . He persuades them to leave , but only by promising them toys if they leave . Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies ; rather , he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language . Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation , rather than a truth @-@ claim .

 In the conclusion of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding , Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience , and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless . Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it . 
 Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number ? No . Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact of existence ? No . Commit it then to the flames : for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion . 
 Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God , and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about . He was unconvinced by Aquinas ' theory of analogy and argued that God 's attributes must be completely different from human attributes , making comparisons between the two impossible . Hume 's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century . 
 = = = Logical positivism = = = 
 The logical positivism movement originated in the Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer . The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements : analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves , such as definitions , tautologies or mathematical statements , while synthetic statements make claims about reality . To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful , the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning , which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning , its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable . Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified , the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless . 
 In 1936 , Ayer wrote Language , Truth and Logic , in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless . He put forward a strong empirical position , arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true , like mathematical statements . In doing so , he rejected metaphysics , which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science . Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable , Ayer denounced religious language , as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics , as meaningless . Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God – theistic , atheistic and agnostic – arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical , unverifiable being . 
 Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his Tractatus <unk> @-@ <unk> with the proposition that " Whereof one cannot speak , thereof one must be silent . " Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement , Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about . They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the mystical , which cannot be described , as important . Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless , as the logical positivists did , Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same , the perspective from which they are viewed will vary . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning , and those that are meaningless . It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false . In a landmark paper published in 1945 , analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs ; for example , the statement " God loves us " both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us . Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false , then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless . 
 Using John Wisdom 's parable of the invisible gardener , Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable . The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island ; one believes it is tended to by a gardener , the other believes that it formed naturally , without the existence of a gardener . The two watch out for the gardener but never find him ; the non @-@ believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener , whereas the believer rationalises the non @-@ appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected . Flew contended that if the believer 's interpretation is accepted , nothing is left of the original gardener . He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart <unk> in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence ; and these beliefs consequently suffer a " death by a thousand qualifications " as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful . Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God 's love for humans , arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs . He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God , such as the terminal illness of a child , theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence ; for example they may suggest that God 's love is different from human love . Such qualifications , Flew argued , make the original proposition meaningless ; he questioned what God 's love actually promises and what it guarantees against , and proposed that God 's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless . 
 Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning ; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable , and so meaningless . Drawing specifically on the emerging science of molecular genetics ( which had not existed at the time of his original paper ) , Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened ; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion " that there is no creator God " might be falsified ; " the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done . " 
 It is a presupposition for applying the falsification principle to religious language that some assertions of religious belief or non @-@ belief could potentially have been established purely from empirical evidence , even had none actually been so . When the sceptic challenges the believer to apply a falsification test to their assertions of belief , there is an underlying implication that were that test to be passed , the sceptic would be persuaded to assent to those particular assertions of the believer – even if the believer would not have abandoned his beliefs had the test been failed . In which case , the beliefs of the persuaded sceptic would be meaningful . Flew , in his last years , considered himself to be just such a persuaded sceptic , and hence accepted the term Deist as a valid descriptor for his religious standpoint . Flew nevertheless continued to maintain the non @-@ falsifiability of religious assertions purportedly derived from divine revelation as presented by dogmatic believers , all of which he rejected as meaningless . 
 = = Analogies of games = = 
 The analogy of a game was first proposed by Hans @-@ Georg Gadamer in an attempt to demonstrate the epistemic unity of language . He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being . Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language ; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ . 
 Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language , which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way . Later in his life he rejected this theory , and instead proposed an alternative language @-@ game analogy . He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games , arguing that just as there are many different games , each with different rules , so there are many different kinds of language . Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful ; outside of its language @-@ game , a proposition is meaningless . He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context . Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used . He provided some examples of language games : " Asking , thanking , greeting , cursing , praying " . 
 It is as if someone were to say : ' A game consists of moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules ... ' – and we replied : You seem to be thinking of board games , but there are others . 
 Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life , rather than confirming the existence of God . He therefore believed that religious language is confessional – a confession of what someone feels and believes – rather than consisting of claims to truth . Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game . 
 Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein 's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous , they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death . Phillips argued that because of this connection , religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events . He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical . 
 Peter Donovan criticises the language @-@ games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth . He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context , but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs ; if the language games analogy is accepted , such a comparison between beliefs is impossible . Donovan proposes that debates between different religions , and the apologetics of some , demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games .

 = = = R. M. Hare = = = 
 In response to Flew 's falsification principle , British philosopher R. M. Hare told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful . Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him ; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view . Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a " blik " , and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable , yet still meaningful , worldview . He proposed that all people – religious and non @-@ religious – hold bliks , and that they cannot be unseated by empirical evidence . Nevertheless , he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person 's understanding of the world . Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not , though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two . 
 = = = Basil Mitchell = = = 
 Basil Mitchell responded to Flew 's falsification principle with his own parable . He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement . The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him , even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side . The soldier 's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides , but his faith remains strong . Mitchell 's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief , a believer still has reason to hold their views . He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs , the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief . 
 = = = John Hick = = = 
 Responding to the verification principle , John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of eschatological verificationism . His parable is of two travellers , a theist and an atheist , together on a road . The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road ; the atheist believes that there is no such city . Hick 's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife , which he argued can be verified upon death . Hick believed that eschatological verification is " unsymmetrical " because while it could be verified if it is true , it cannot be falsified if not . This is in contrast to ordinary " symmetrical " statements , which can be verified or falsified . 
 In his biography of Hick , David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick 's theory : waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional , preventing total commitment to faith . Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick 's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers , who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless . James Morris notes that Hick 's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism . Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick 's parable to include multiple travellers , all with different beliefs , on the road . He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable , Hick 's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified . 
 = Lyon @-@ class battleship = 
 The Lyon class was a proposed type of battleship which was planned for the French Navy in 1913 , with construction scheduled to begin in 1915 . The class was to have comprised four ships : Lyon , Lille , Duquesne , and Tourville . The first two were named for cities in France , while the rest honored French admirals Abraham Duquesne and Anne Hilarion de Tourville . The design was an improvement on the previous Normandie class , and mounted a fourth quadruple gun turret , for a total of sixteen 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns . Construction was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 before any of the ships could be laid down . 
 = = Design = = 
 Starting in 1910 , the French Navy began a dreadnought battleship construction program , starting with the four ships of the Courbet class that year . The three @-@ ship Bretagne class was authorized the next year , and five Normandie @-@ class battleships followed in 1912 . Design work began in 1912 ; the design staff submitted several proposals for the new battleships . <unk> ranged from 27 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 27 @,@ 000 long tons ; 30 @,@ 000 short tons ) to 29 @,@ 000 t ( 29 @,@ 000 long tons ; 32 @,@ 000 short tons ) ; the various designs featured a main battery of fourteen or sixteen 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns , eight or ten 380 mm ( 15 in ) guns , or twenty 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns , in a mix of quadruple or twin gun turrets . 
 In 1913 , the Navy authorized a fourth class of battleships , Lyon , which was scheduled for 1915 . The design staff determined the 38 cm gun would take too long to design , so the proposals that incorporated these weapons were cancelled . The design staff settled on one of the two 34 cm proposals . The first proposal , which mounted fourteen guns , was a 27 @,@ 500 t ( 27 @,@ 100 long tons ; 30 @,@ 300 short tons ) ship 185 meters ( 607 ft ) long . On 24 November 1913 , the design staff instead chose the slightly larger second design , armed with sixteen guns in four quadruple turrets . The first two ships , Lyon and Lille , were scheduled to be ordered on 1 January 1915 , and Duquesne and Tourville would have followed on 1 April 1915 . World War I broke out in August 1914 , however , and shifting military requirements , particularly for the army , forced the cancellation of the class .

 The ships would have been 190 m ( 620 ft ) long between perpendiculars and 194 @.@ 5 m ( 638 ft ) long overall . They would have had a beam of 29 m ( 95 ft ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 65 to 9 @.@ 2 m ( 28 @.@ 4 to 30 @.@ 2 ft ) . Their full load displacement was estimated at 29 @,@ 000 t ( 29 @,@ 000 long tons ; 32 @,@ 000 short tons ) . The propulsion system had not been settled by the time the class was cancelled ; the design staff proposed either the mixed steam turbine and triple expansion engine system used in the first four ships of the preceding Normandie class or the all @-@ turbine system used in the last ship of the previous class , Béarn . They also considered new geared turbines that had proved satisfactory in the new destroyer Enseigne <unk> . The final design called for a propulsion system rated at 43 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 32 @,@ 000 kW ) with a top speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . An unknown number of boilers were trunked into two funnels amidships . 
 Sixteen 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns mounted in four quadruple turrets comprised the main battery . The turrets , which were equipped with electric @-@ hydraulic training and elevation gear , were all mounted on the centerline , though the arrangement is not clear . According to Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , one turret was placed forward , one amidships , and two in a superfiring pair aft . The contemporary Journal of United States Artillery , however , suggests the turrets would have been mounted in two superfiring pairs , forward and aft . The turrets weighed 1 @,@ 500 t ( 1 @,@ 500 long tons ; 1 @,@ 700 short tons ) , and were electrically trained and hydraulically elevated . The guns were divided into pairs and mounted in twin cradles ; a 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick bulkhead divided the turrets . Each pair of guns had its own ammunition hoist and magazine . They could be fired simultaneously or independently . The guns had a range of 16 @,@ 000 m ( 52 @,@ 000 ft ) and had a rate of fire of two rounds per minute . The shells were 540 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 190 lb ) armor @-@ piercing rounds and were fired with a muzzle velocity of 800 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . 
 The secondary battery was to consist of twenty @-@ four guns , either the 138 @.@ 6 mm / 55 Modèle 1910 or a new automatic model , each singly @-@ mounted in casemates in the hull . The M1910 guns fired a 36 @.@ 5 kg ( 80 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 830 m / s ( 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ) . The ships would also have been equipped with an unknown number of 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) or 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns and six torpedo tubes of unknown size , submerged in the hull . The ships would have been protected with a variation of the armor layout of the previous Normandie class . The primary alterations were slightly thinner casemate armor and upper deck plating to compensate for improved armor below the waterline . 
 = First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus = 
 The Greek Revival First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus is located at the intersection of North Street ( New York State Route 174 ) and East Main Street ( also NY 174 ) in the village of Marcellus , New York , and is the oldest of four churches in the village . Marcellus village was founded in 1794 . Local residents with differing religious denominations met in a tavern , until October 1801 when Reverend Caleb Alexander , a missionary active in the central New York area , helped organize the 18 @-@ member Church of Christ . A wooden meeting house was constructed two years later . 
 By 1819 , the community had built three churches in the environs of Marcellus : the original First Church in Marcellus , its offshoot the Second Church in Skaneateles , New York , and the Third Church on State Road ( now U.S. Route 20 ) . In 1851 , the present church in Greek Revival style was erected and dedicated . The church would undergo substantial alterations over the next century . In 1948 , it was remodelled and dedicated in April 1952 . Commentators have found the structure one of the finest examples of Greek Revival church architecture in Onondaga County ; however , they have expressed some regret in the loss of several original features . The church celebrated its bicentenary in 2001 . 
 = = Original church ( 1803 – 1851 ) = = 
 The village of Marcellus was founded 1794 with Presbyterians , Congregationalists , Baptists and villagers of other denominations meeting in a tavern for worship services . Tavern proprietor Deacon Rice was permitted to read sermons , not write them , and Reverend Seth Williston , a missionary active in the area as early as 1800 may have provided spiritual guidance . On October 13 , 1801 , the village 's first worship society , the 18 @-@ member Church of Christ , was organized through the efforts of Rev Caleb Alexander , another missionary active in central New York . In May the following year , the society was incorporated as the Eastern Religious Society of Marcellus . The church was later described as " Presbyterian in its ecclesiastical relations , and at the same time Congregational in its internal policy and arrangement . " 
 On August 12 , 1802 , the society voted to build a church , and a trustee donated an acre of land at the intersection of Main Street and North Street in the present @-@ day village of Marcellus . In 1803 , construction of the fifty @-@ five by forty @-@ eight feet wooden meeting house was completed with a floor , a board pulpit , and slab seats but without a steeple , a bell , stoves , and ceilings . Congregants warmed themselves with foot stoves , squirrel fur , and the " power of the spirit " . 
 Itinerant missionaries served the meeting house for its first few years . The church gained its first pastor in 1807 , when Rev Levi Parsons was ordained and installed . That same year , the congregation adopted fifteen articles of faith and a covenant , which remained membership prerequisites for one hundred years . In the same year the church affiliated with the Presbyterian Synod of Albany , three years later becoming a charter member of the Presbytery of Cayuga , which , in 1811 , became part of the newly formed Synod of Geneva . Mr Parsons served until 1833 when he accepted posts in Tully , New York and Otisco , New York . He returned to Marcellus in 1835 , where he remained until 1841 when Rev John Tompkins was appointed . 
 In 1814 , a steeple was built , an extension to the church added , and the interior painted at a cost of $ 4 @,@ 500 ( $ 50 @.@ 8 thousand today ) . The same year , The Female Charitable Society of Marcellus donated $ 133 @.@ 34 to the <unk> Missionary Society . By 1819 , the church had grown considerably . The Second Church was erected in what is now Skaneateles , New York , and the Third Presbyterian Church of Marcellus was built on State Road ( now U.S. Route 20 ) , which , after twenty prosperous years , experienced declining membership following deaths and migrations . In 1830 , a shed for horses and vehicles was constructed at the First Church . On April 23 , 1833 , the name of the society was changed to the Marcellus First Religious Society , and in 1846 , a house and lot for a parsonage were secured . In 1849 , church land was graded and new horse sheds built . 
 = = Present church ( 1851 – present ) = = 
 By 1850 , the First Church was in need of repair and sold for $ 500 ( $ 4 @.@ 5 thousand today ) which , in the agreement , was applied to the construction of a new church on the same site at a cost of $ 3 @,@ 800 . The new church , designed in the then popular Greek Revival style , was dedicated October 13 , 1851 , the fiftieth anniversary of the congregation . Two years after the 1851 construction and dedication of the new church , a bell was fitted to the steeple . The church 's first pastor , Reverend Levi Parsons had been succeeded by Rev John Tompkins . In 1866 , Mr Tompkins died on the eve of his 25th anniversary with the church . Reverends W. S. Franklin and Dwight <unk> were appointed as interim ministers , and , during their tenures , a new pulpit and new furniture were acquired . A change in boundaries , by act of the General Assembly in 1869 , brought the Marcellus Church within the Syracuse Presbytery which was merged with the Cayuga Presbytery . In 1877 , the Women 's Missionary Society was formed . In 1880 , Rev George Smith was appointed , but , in 1882 , accepted a position at Canandaigua Academy . Before Smith left , he celebrated the church 's 80th anniversary on October 13 , 1881 by writing the church 's history . 
 On Smith 's departure Rev Alex <unk> . <unk> was appointed and served five years . Under his leadership , the church perfected its organization as a Presbyterian Church and several ruling elders were elected . However , the corporate name , Eastern Religious Society , remained in effect until November 19 , 1951 , when it was officially changed to the First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus . On November 16 . 1887 , Rev <unk> was succeeded by Rev A. H. Cameron , who served ten years with the church . In 1893 and 1894 , the church was remodeled once again with new kitchens , a church parlor , and new stained glass windows . The original stoves were replaced with a new heating system . The church began conducting Sunday school classes for those unable to attend services , at Marcellus Falls ( north of town ) and nearby hamlet Shepard Settlement . 
 Rev Cameron was succeeded in 1897 , by Rev A. K. McNaughton , who served ten years and celebrated the church 's centenary on October 13 , 1901 . McNaughton left in 1907 , and was replaced by Rev F. J. Sauber who served until 1914 when Rev C. C. Frost was appointed . In 1921 , Rev David S. <unk> was appointed , who served until 1928 . During <unk> 's years of service , new horse and carriage sheds were constructed for the church , replacing earlier ones built in 1849 . In 1961 , the sheds ( which had been rented @-@ out as car garages ) were torn down to make way for an extension of the church . A severe windstorm destroyed the spire in 1924 ; it was replaced shortly thereafter at a cost of $ 3 @,@ 500 ( $ 31 thousand today ) . 
 Rev Robert Lloyd Roberts served the Marcellus church during the Great Depression and war years from 1931 to 1944 . His successor Dr. Albert Dutton Stearns , called in 1944 , continued as pastor until 1948 . From 1948 to 1956 , Rev Ralph Miller served the congregation . Under his aegis the body of the building was raised , the sanctuary redone and refurbished , and a basement constructed with the additions of a kitchen , a dining room , a lounge and several classrooms at a cost of $ 65 @,@ 000 ( $ 579 thousand today ) . The church was dedicated after completion of construction in April 1952 . On November 19 , 1951 , the church officially became the First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus . On December 9 , 1956 , Rev Miller was succeeded by Syracuse University graduate Rev Keith Shinaman ; Miss Helen Austin was ordained as the first woman elder one year later . Women make up one @-@ half of the present session of eighteen elders . 
 Reverend Shinaman remained with the church for over fifty years , but was succeeded by Reverend Bill Grossman , who presently serves the congregation w . In 2001 , the church celebrated its 200th anniversary . Reverend Shinaman died October 10 , 2010 at the age of 88 .

 Connie Talbot 's Christmas Album , sometimes referred to as Connie 's Christmas Album or just Christmas Album , is the second album by the English child singer Connie Talbot , released on 24 November 2008 . The album is made up of Christmas @-@ themed songs , and was recorded in the middle of 2008 . Shortly after the release , Pinnacle Entertainment , the United Kingdom distributor , went into administration . Despite this , the album had some success in Asia and the United States , and Talbot 's third album , Connie Talbot 's Holiday Magic , included many of the same tracks .

 Talbot 's voice was recorded near her home . Other parts of the album were recorded elsewhere in the UK , as well as in the US , Bulgaria and Hong Kong . Connie Talbot 's Christmas Album contains " a mix of classics and modern Christmas tunes " , and was produced by Simon Hill and Rob May , who produced her first album , Over the Rainbow . Big band arrangements on the album included music from Laurence Cottle Big Band , while the orchestral sections of the more traditional songs were performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra . The duet on " When a Child Is Born " was performed by Talbot and Ginger Kwan . Describing the recording of the album , Talbot said " I really liked it . I liked all the songs they picked and everything . It was really good and enjoyable . " Five tracks ( " Let it Snow ! " , " Rocking Around the Christmas Tree " , " Jingle Bell Rock " , " Santa Clause Is Coming to Town " and " Frosty the Snowman " ) were recorded in the style of a big band , while the remainder were recorded in a " more traditional " style . 
 Connie Talbot 's Christmas Album was released on 24 November 2008 . The album was difficult to obtain in Britain after the distributor , Pinnacle Entertainment , went into administration . Talbot 's mother , Sharon , was quoted as saying , " We don 't really know what 's going to happen at the moment ... We think they 'll probably wait and promote the album later this year . It 's a shame , but they can still get the album in Asia and the US . " In 2009 , Talbot 's third album , Connie Talbot 's Holiday Magic , was released in the United States , with many of the same songs as Connie Talbot 's Christmas Album , but with rerecorded vocals .

 = Louis XVIII of France = 
 Louis XVIII ( Louis Stanislas Xavier ; 17 November 1755 – 16 September 1824 ) , known as " the Desired " ( le Désiré ) , was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1814 to 1824 except for a period in 1815 known as the Hundred Days . Louis XVIII spent twenty @-@ three years in exile , from 1791 to 1814 , during the French Revolution and the First French Empire , and again in 1815 , during the period of the Hundred Days , upon the return of Napoleon I from Elba . 
 Until his accession to the throne of France , Louis held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI . On 21 September 1792 , the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed King Louis XVI , who was later executed by guillotine . When the young Louis XVII , Louis XVI 's son , died in prison in June 1795 , Louis XVIII succeeded his nephew as titular King . 
 During the French Revolution and Napoleonic era , Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia , the United Kingdom and Russia . When the Sixth Coalition finally defeated Napoleon in 1814 , Louis was placed in what he , and the French royalists , considered his rightful position . Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba , however , and restored his French Empire . Louis XVIII fled and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire , defeated Napoleon , and restored Louis XVIII to the French throne . 
 Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade . The Bourbon Restoration regime was a constitutional monarchy ( unlike the ancien régime , which was absolutist ) . As a constitutional monarch , Louis XVIII 's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814 , France 's new constitution . Louis had no children ; therefore , upon his death , the crown passed to his brother , Charles , Count of Artois . Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while reigning ; as his successor Charles X ( 1824 @-@ 1830 ) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I ( 1830 @-@ 1848 ) and Napoléon III ( 1852 @-@ 1870 ) were deposed . 
 = = Youth = = 
 Louis Stanislas Xavier , styled Count of Provence from birth , was born on 17 November 1755 in the Palace of Versailles , the son of Louis , Dauphin of France , and his wife Maria Josepha of Saxony . He was the grandson of the reigning King Louis XV . As a son of the Dauphin he was a Fils de France . Louis Stanislas was christened Louis Stanislas Xavier six months after his birth in accordance with Bourbon family tradition , being nameless before his baptism . By this act , he became also a Knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit . The name of Louis was bestowed because it was typical of a prince of France ; Stanislas was chosen to honour his great @-@ grandfather King Stanisław I of Poland ; and Xavier was chosen for Saint Francis Xavier , whom his mother 's family held as one of their patron saints . 
 At the time of his birth , Louis Stanislas was fourth in line to the throne of France , behind his father and his two elder brothers : Louis Joseph Xavier , Duke of Burgundy , and Louis Auguste , Duke of Berry . The former died in 1761 , leaving Louis Auguste as heir apparent until the Dauphin 's own premature death in 1765 . The two deaths elevated Louis Stanislas to second in the line of succession , while Louis Auguste acquired the title Dauphin . 
 Louis Stanislas found comfort in his governess , Madame de Marsan , Governess of the Children of France , as he was her favourite among his siblings . Louis Stanislas was taken away from his governess when he turned seven , the age at which the education of boys of royal blood and of the nobility was turned over to men . Antoine de <unk> de <unk> de <unk> , Duke of La <unk> , a friend of his father , was named his governor .
