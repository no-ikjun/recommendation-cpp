 Vassar Brothers Laboratory was the first chemistry building on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York , built in 1880 , around 500 feet ( 150 m ) from the college 's Main Building . The Laboratory , which was the first free @-@ standing chemistry structure at a women 's college , stood until 1938 , 29 years after the construction of its replacement , the Ewing & Chapelle @-@ designed Sanders Hall of Chemistry . 
 In 1981 , the Seeley G. Mudd Fund granted Vassar $ 1 @.@ 3 million for the construction of a new chemistry building . Mudd was a California @-@ based cardiologist , professor , and trustee with the University of Southern California 's School of Medicine as well as with a number of other West Coast schools . Over his lifetime , Mudd donated more than $ 10 million to higher education institutions and upon his death in 1968 , his will established a further $ 44 million for building construction at universities and colleges , with the stipulation that institutions requesting a grant provide at least half the funds for their projects and that his name be prominently displayed on any buildings receiving the funding . While the cost of the building was originally reported to be $ 4 @.@ 5 million , this estimate grew to $ 6 @.@ 5 million by 1984 and would ultimately come to $ 7 @.@ 2 million once the project was completed . The College planned to cover the costs not paid for by the Mudd Fund with a $ 100 million development fundraising program that spanned the entirety of the 1980s . 
 Ground was broken on the new building on October 8 , 1982 , in a ceremony presided over by Vassar president Virginia B. Smith . Smith had previously selected engineer Fred Dubin to aid the school in constructing a more environmentally friendly chemistry building . As design progressed , she identified the need to hire architects to design the building alongside Dubin , so Perry Dean Rogers Architects of Boston were selected . Named the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building after its benefactor , the building was constructed on the site where Vassar Brothers Laboratory once stood . Dubin initially tried to have it placed on the south side of Sanders Physics Building , but that site was deemed unworkable in part because of its proximity to the school 's Shakespeare Gardens . The building was instead placed southwest of Sanders Hall of Chemistry , which would be renamed Sanders Classrooms , and completed a quadrangle consisting of both Sanders buildings and the New England Building . Though built across from Sanders Physics , Mudd was actually 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) out of alignment with it . <unk> Associates served as the project 's structural engineers and W. J. Barney Corporation served as its general contractor . 
 In 2007 , despite being Vassar 's youngest completed academic building , a report by Platt Byard Dovell White Architects report found that many components of Mudd 's structure were in either Fair or Poor condition . The structure was slated for demolition in spring 2016 as part of the college 's Science Center project , which also included the construction of the new Bridge for Laboratory Sciences building and the renovations of the New England Building , Sanders Physics , and Olmsted Hall . The chemistry department began its move to the Bridge for Laboratory Sciences in summer 2015 and Mudd 's demolition followed . Exterior facade elements , windows , and indoor walls were cut away before the building 's frame was dismantled , concluding on April 22 , 2016 . Once cleared , the former site of Mudd will be an open green space .

 The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building was designed in the postmodern style . The structure 's exterior walls were constructed from limestone and brick that surround regular glass blocks , each about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) thick with side lengths ranging from 8 to 12 inches ( 20 to 30 cm ) . The brick and limestone walls faced the west , north , and east , while the southern face was primarily glass , a feature designed for efficient energy use ; when sunlight hit the wall , air rose into the building and was heated , then pumped throughout where it aided in the operation of the structure 's 46 fume hoods . The north wall , meanwhile , <unk> designed to be resistant to cold air . The building was well insulated and its plain outer walls were as uninterrupted in material as possible to keep as much warm air inside the structure as possible in winters . 
 Containing 42 @,@ 000 square feet ( 3 @,@ 900 m2 ) , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood three stories tall . The second and first floors ( the latter of which lies partially below ground ) contained laboratory space while the third floor consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices . Other offices on the first floor were lit via skylights . The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get from one side of the building to the other . In spite of this , Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it . Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust @-@ colored . 
 The 2007 report by Platt Byard Dovell White Architects evaluating the condition and context for many of Vassar 's buildings found Mudd to be " by far Vassar 's most interesting and most important post @-@ Modern building . " A contemporary review in Architecture commented that Mudd " responds on a variety of levels to its context , but it does so without sacrificing its own unique and powerful identity . " Margaret <unk> also praised the building 's placement and contextualization among its fellow structures in a 1986 issue of Architectural Record : " the scale of the structure beneath its outcroppings is sympathetic to the existing buildings in the quad , and its mass , though larger , [ is ] appropriate to its role as a gateway between them and the central campus " . She went on to positively comment on the building 's aesthetics , saying , " the eye can feast on the mingled sparkle and luminosity drawn from minimal outdoor exposures used to maximum effect . In more public areas , where crisp glass @-@ block and lucent glass ignite clear deep @-@ timbered tones and pretty pastels , the feast becomes a banquet . " Crosbie in Architecture noted " some instances of shoddy drywall work and sloppy painting " but otherwise praised the building 's " bare @-@ bones " and " nuts and bolts " interior as functional and environmentally friendly . The Platt Byard Dovell White report found that Mudd 's glass walls " seem to function particularly poorly " as a passive heat control system but otherwise noted that the structure 's expressive postmodernist ambitions marked it as " a strong , compact if busy building [ that ] makes it more than a bit of a tour de force . " Mudd was awarded first place in a 1988 competition run by Pittsburgh Corning for its design . 
 = Korketrekkeren = 
 Korketrekkeren ( direct translation : " The Corkscrew " ) is a tobogganing track and former bobsleigh and luge track in Oslo , Norway . The tobogganing track runs between Frognerseteren and Midtstuen and is operated as a public venue by the municipality . Return transport to the top of the hill is undertaken by riding the Oslo Metro 's Holmenkollen Line . Tobogganing in the area started in the 1880s , with several roads being used during winter evenings . Auto racing took place in the hill in 1921 and the following year it saw its first luge tournament . The first major tournament was the FIL European Luge Championships 1937 . <unk> also took place in the nearby Heftyebakken , but from 1950 Korketrekkeren became the sole tobogganing hill and Heftyebakken was used for cross @-@ country skiing . 
 The bobsleigh track was built for the 1952 Winter Olympics , where it hosted two bobsleigh events . Contrary to popular belief , this was not built at Korketrekkeren but as a separate run nearby also starting at Frognerseteren . It was built as a temporary , artificial track with the curves being constructed in snow and then frozen hard to ice . Trial runs were undertaken in 1951 and the bobsleigh course was not used after 1952 . Both Olympic events were won by Germany , with Andreas Ostler and Lorenz <unk> participating in both winning teams . The tobogganing hill hosted the inaugural FIL World Luge Championships 1955 , with Norway 's Anton Salvesen winning the men 's single — the only time in history Norway has won a World Luge Championships medal . 
 = = History = = 
 Korketrekkeren was originally part of <unk> , a road which ran up to Frognerseteren . It was completed in 1867 to the orders of landlord Thomas Johannessen <unk> , who had been purchasing forest properties in the area . The section between <unk> and Frognerseteren gradually became known as <unk> . <unk> og <unk> was established in 1888 and undertook a series of public infrastructure investments in the area , including the construction of roads , skiing trails , natural <unk> tracks and a chapel . The property was given to Kristiania Municipality ( today Oslo Municipality ) in 1894 . <unk> became a popular sport from the 1880s and <unk> og <unk> rented out sleds which were permitted to be used on roads and designated tracks after 19 : 00 on evenings with moonlight . 
 Norsk <unk> was founded in 1899 to work towards encouraging English tourists to visit Oslo , specifically by building tobogganing tracks . A committee was established in 1904 to look into building a new tobogganing track in the Holmenkollen area . It proposed that two new tracks be built , one from <unk> to <unk> , and one from <unk> to Midtstuen , and that Korketrekkeren be upgraded to allow for safer tobogganing . The investments cost 7 @,@ 000 Norwegian krone ( NOK ) and the annual operating costs estimated at NOK 2 @,@ 000 . The investments were financed with NOK 2 @,@ 000 by Christiania <unk> and NOK 5 @,@ 000 by <unk> . The latter was established in 1905 and was also responsible to operating the track . 
 In 1898 , the Holmenkollen Line was opened to Besserud . One of the line 's main revenue sources was transporting city @-@ dwellers to the recreational area of Nordmarka where they would go skiing . An alternative activity was tobogganing down the hill back to Majorstuen . The operator Holmenkolbanen immediately started plans to extend the line . There were two proposals : a continuation of the line past Holmenkollen and a branch from Midtstuen up Korketrekkeren to Frogneseteren . However , the latter required the use of a rack railway , as it would give a 1 : 8 gradient . The former route was selected and the line was extended to Frogneseteren in 1916 . Holmenkolbanen started renting out sleds at Frogneseteren , which could be returned at most stations . To save the return ticket , many chose to continue the tobogganing ride to Majorstuen . 
 The use of Korketrekkeren for tobogganing created a conflict with the local residents — especially at the guest house in <unk> , which was often blocked on Sundays . There was also a conflict between cross @-@ country skiing and tobogganing , as both groups wanted priority on the road . <unk> proposed holding a tournament in 1921 , but this was rejected by the municipal council . However , an auto race was held on the track that year . Permission for the <unk> race was given the following season , resulting in regular tournaments . Construction of Heftyebakken took place in 1930 . The track was constructed between <unk> to <unk> , including a concrete curve which allowed it to connect to Korketrekkeren . Heftyebakken had a poor profile as it was not steep enough in the lower areas . In 1950 , Heftyebakken was converted to a skiing trail and Korketrekkeren became a pure tobogganing trail . 
 Unusually for winter sports , bobsleigh has never been popular in Norway . The country had not sent an Olympic team until the 1948 Winter Olympics and there were no previous bobsleigh tracks in Norway when Oslo was awarded the 1952 Winter Olympics . Two Swiss civil engineers , Heinz <unk> and Emil <unk> , were the main technical consultants for the development of the venue . The steep terrain made construction excessively expensive , resulting in the organizing committee deciding to build a temporary track , without permanent concrete and stone curves . Instead , a new track was constructed each year using snow : the overhangs were built by hand , the tracks were leveled and the structure sprayed with ice until it was hard . 
 The track route was built under supervision of Sigurd Lund and Carl <unk> in 1949 and 1950 and subsequently corrected by <unk> . The only fixed installation was a water main which ran along the track , using Øvresetertjern as its water source . Engineer Luigi Angelini from Switzerland was hired to supervise the construction of the curves , which cost NOK 615 @,@ 000 . The track was first constructed for training in 1951 and then for the Olympics in 1952 . 
 There have been occasional proposals that Norway should build a permanent bobsleigh track , where Korketrekkeren was the leading location . The debate died out in the 1990s with the selection of Lillehammer as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics and the subsequent construction of Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track . Also the Oslo bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics proposed using the Lillehammer track . In 2007 , there were two serious accidents in the hill and it was subsequently closed by the police . The municipality then renovated the hill , removing poles and <unk> dangerous edges .

 = Ammiraglio di Saint Bon @-@ class battleship = 
 The Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class was a pair of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Italian Navy ( Italian : Regia Marina ) during the 1890s . The class comprised two ships : Ammiraglio di Saint Bon , the lead ship , and Emanuele Filiberto . They were armed with a main battery of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 @-@ millimetre ) guns and were capable of a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Smaller and less powerfully @-@ armed than most contemporary battleships , they marked a brief departure from Italian battleship design , which had previous emphasized large ships equipped with large guns . 
 Both ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers , and participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 . They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes , but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet . They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I , and they spent the war in Venice . The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war , both having been stricken in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The previous Italian capital ships , the Re Umberto and the Ruggiero di Lauria classes of ironclad battleships , marked a period of experimentation on the part of Benedetto Brin , Admiral Simone di <unk> Saint Bon , and the strategists of the Italian navy . Since the planners had not determined what type of battleship would best suit their strategic needs , the government stepped in and mandated a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) design smaller than the earlier classes . Following the death of di Saint Bon , Brin took over the design process and proposed a small battleship armed with 10 in ( 254 mm ) guns , a weaker main battery than those of contemporary foreign designs . 
 The ships , much smaller than their contemporaries , and slower than cruisers , were not particularly useful warships . The mistake of building a battleship of only 10 @,@ 000 tons was not repeated in the subsequent , and much more successful , Regina Margherita class .

Ammiraglio di Saint Bon displaced 10 @,@ 082 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 923 long tons ; 11 @,@ 114 short tons ) at standard loading and 10 @,@ 531 t ( 10 @,@ 365 long tons ; 11 @,@ 608 short tons ) at full combat load , while Emanuele Filiberto displaced 9 @,@ 645 t ( 9 @,@ 493 long tons ; 10 @,@ 632 short tons ) and 9 @,@ 940 t ( 9 @,@ 780 long tons ; 10 @,@ 960 short tons ) , respectively . The ships had a low freeboard of only 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . Ammiraglio di Saint Bon had a crew of 557 officers and enlisted men , while Emanuele Filiberto had a slightly larger complement of 565 . 
 The ships ' propulsion system consisted of two triple expansion engines ; Ammiraglio di Saint Bon 's were rated at 14 @,@ 296 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 661 kW ) , while Emanuele Filiberto 's engines only reached 13 @,@ 552 ihp ( 10 @,@ 106 kW ) .

 Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was built by the Venice Naval Shipyard . She was laid down on 18 July 1893 , launched on 29 April 1897 , and completed on 24 May 1901 , although she had been commissioned on 1 February 1901 . Emanuele Filiberto was named after Prince Emanuele Filiberto , Duke of Aosta . She was built by the Castellammare Naval Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia , Naples . She was laid down on 5 October 1893 , launched on 29 September 1897 , and completed on 16 April 1902 , although she had been commissioned on 6 September 1901 . The ships spend the first several years in the active duty squadron until they were replaced by the new Regina Elena @-@ class battleships , which entered service by 1908 . 
 Both ships took part in the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 – 1912 in the 3rd Division with the two Regina Margherita @-@ class battleships . Emanuele Filiberto took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911 , though Ammiraglio di Saint Bon did not see action in the first months of the war . Both ships participated in the seizure of the island of Rhodes , where Ammiraglio di Saint Bon provided gunfire support to the soldiers ashore . 
 The two ships were slated to be scrapped in 1914 – 15 due to their age , but the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 prevented their disposal . Italy initially remained neutral during the war , but by 1915 , had been convinced by the Triple Entente to enter the war against Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary . Both Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Emanuele Filiberto were used as harbor defense ships in Venice for the duration of the war , and did not see action there . Neither ship remained in service long after the end of the war . Emanuele Filiberto was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was stricken on 18 June . Both ships were subsequently discarded .

 Challinor 's first sending off for Cambridge came after receiving a second yellow card during a 5 – 0 home defeat to Crawley Town in the FA Trophy second round on 14 January 2009 . He made his return from suspension in a 1 – 1 home draw with Oxford United on 29 January 2009 . Challinor came on as a 79th minute substitute for Paul Carden in the 2009 Conference Premier play @-@ off Final at Wembley , in which Torquay United won 2 – 0 . Having struggled to make an impact for Cambridge in the 2008 – 09 season , which he finished with two goals in 39 games , he was transfer @-@ listed . 
 He was sent out on loan for the start of the 2009 – 10 season to divisional rivals Forest Green Rovers for one month on 7 August 2009 . Challinor made his debut the following day in a 2 – 1 home defeat against Kettering Town , going on to make seven appearances at Forest Green . Forest Green had been interested in taking Challinor on another loan , until appointing a new manager . He left Cambridge on loan again after joining Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town on a two @-@ month loan on 20 November 2009 . Challinor made a scoring debut for Mansfield with the equalising goal from close range in a 1 – 1 draw at home to Eastbourne Borough on 21 November 2009 . After making six appearances and scoring one goal in his loan spell , Challinor signed permanently for Mansfield for the rest of the season on 6 January 2010 . He was released by Mansfield at the end of the season , having made 15 appearances and scored two goals after signing permanently .

He made his debut later that day as a half @-@ time substitute for Callum Wilson in Kettering 's 2 – 1 loss away to Grimsby Town . His first goal for Kettering came in stoppage time against Southport in a 3 – 1 home victory on 30 April 2011 , having entered the match in the 89th minute . Challinor finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal for Kettering . He agreed to stay at Kettering ahead of the 2011 – 12 season on non @-@ contract terms , in the belief that a permanent contract would later be agreed , and started the season playing in defensive midfield .

 On 25 August 2011 , Challinor signed for Conference Premier rivals York City on a contract until January 2012 , having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier . He made his debut a day later , coming on as a 56th @-@ minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0 – 0 draw away to Fleetwood Town . Challinor was soon converted into a right @-@ back at York , a position in which he displayed composure and an ability to start attacking moves . His first goal for York came in a 4 – 2 win away at Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom right corner of the goal from the edge of the penalty box . 
 He signed a new contract with York until the end of the season in January 2012 . He featured in the York side that won 2 – 0 in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley against his former club Newport on 12 May 2012 . Eight days later he again played at Wembley to win promotion to League Two through the 2012 Conference Premier play @-@ off Final with a 2 – 1 victory over Luton Town . Thus , Challinor was successful in achieving promotion to the Football League in his fourth appearance in a Conference play @-@ off final . Having made 51 appearances and scored three goals for York in the 2011 – 12 season , he signed a new one @-@ year contract with the club in July 2012 . 
 Ahead of Challinor 's first season as a Football League player he was quoted as saying " It 's been a long time coming so I ’ m going to embrace it and enjoy every minute .

 = HMS Glorious = 
 HMS Glorious was the second of the Courageous @-@ class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during the First World War . Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord , Lord Fisher , they were very lightly armoured and armed with only a few heavy guns . Glorious was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea . She participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later . 
 Glorious was paid off after the end of the war , but was rebuilt as an aircraft carrier during the late 1920s . She could carry 30 % more aircraft than her half @-@ sister Furious which had approximately the same tonnage . After recommissioning she spent most of her career operating in the Mediterranean Sea . After the start of the Second World War , Glorious spent the rest of 1939 unsuccessfully hunting for the German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean before returning to the Mediterranean . She was recalled in April 1940 to support British operations in Norway . While evacuating British aircraft from Norway in June , the ship was sunk by the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau in the North Sea with the loss of over 1 @,@ 200 lives . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 During the First World War , Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding Renown @-@ class battlecruisers by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers . To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles , such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders , he settled on a design with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser . He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast , shallow @-@ draught ships for his Baltic Project , a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast . 
 Glorious had an overall length of 786 feet 9 inches ( 239 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 81 feet ( 24 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 25 feet 10 inches ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . She displaced 19 @,@ 180 long tons ( 19 @,@ 490 t ) at load and 22 @,@ 560 long tons ( 22 @,@ 922 t ) at deep load . Glorious and her sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines . To save time the installation used in the light cruiser Champion , the first cruiser in the Royal Navy with geared turbines , was simply doubled . The Parsons turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow small @-@ tube boilers . They were designed to produce a total of 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 67 @,@ 113 kW ) at a working pressure of 235 psi ( 1 @,@ 620 kPa ; 17 kgf / cm2 ) . During the ship 's abbreviated sea trials she reached 31 @.@ 42 knots ( 58 @.@ 19 km / h ; 36 @.@ 16 mph ) . 
 The ship was designed to normally carry 750 long tons ( 760 t ) of fuel oil , but could carry a maximum of 3 @,@ 160 long tons ( 3 @,@ 210 t ) . At full capacity , she could steam for an estimated 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 110 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . 
 Glorious carried four BL 15 @-@ inch Mark I guns in two twin hydraulically powered Mark I * turrets , one each fore ( ' A ' ) and aft ( ' Y ' ) . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4 @-@ inch Mark IX guns mounted in six manually powered triple T.I. Mark I mounts . These mounts had the three breeches too close together and the 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another . This rather negated the mount 's intended purpose to provide a high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft . A pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Glorious . She mounted two submerged tubes for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Her keel was laid down on 1 May 1915 by Harland and Wolff at their Belfast shipyard . Glorious was launched on 20 April 1916 and completed on 14 October 1916 . During her sea trials in November 1916 , Courageous sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence . Glorious did not suffer any similar damage and did not receive her stiffening until 1918 . Upon commissioning , Courageous served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet . After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland , the squadron was re @-@ formed with Courageous as flagship along with her sister ship Glorious . She cost £ 1 @,@ 967 @,@ 223 to build ( costs to 23 Nov 1916 ) . Glorious received a half a dozen torpedo mounts , each with two tubes in mid @-@ 1917 : one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck . 
 On 16 October 1917 the Admiralty received word of German ship movements , possibly indicating some sort of raid . Admiral Beatty , the commander of the Grand Fleet , ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships . Courageous and Glorious were not initially ordered to sea , but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day . Two German Brummer @-@ class light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy bound for Norway during the morning of 17 October , but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon . The 1st Cruiser Squadron were ordered to intercept , but were unsuccessful as the German cruisers were faster than expected . 
 = = = Second Battle of Heligoland Bight = = = 
 Throughout 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British @-@ laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines . A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their light cruiser escorts . Based on intelligence reports , the Admiralty allocated the 1st Cruiser Squadron on 17 November 1917 , with cover provided by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and distant cover by the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron . 
 The German ships , four light cruisers of II Scouting Force , eight destroyers , three divisions of minesweepers , eight <unk> ( cork @-@ filled trawlers ) and two trawlers to mark the swept route , were spotted at 7 : 30 am , silhouetted by the rising sun . Courageous and the light cruiser Cardiff opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later . The Germans responded by laying a smoke screen and this made spotting targets very difficult . The British continued in pursuit , but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted . One 15 @-@ inch hit was made on a gun shield of SMS Pillau , but it did not affect her speed . At 8 : 33 the left @-@ hand gun in Glorious 's forward turret was wrecked when a shell detonated inside the gun barrel . At 9 : 30 the 1st Cruiser Squadron broke off their pursuit so they would not enter a minefield marked on their maps ; the ships turned south , playing no further role in the battle . 
 Glorious required five days of repairs to right the damage caused from the premature detonation and from her own muzzle blast . She fired 57 15 @-@ inch and 213 4 @-@ inch shells during the engagement . The ship received flying @-@ off platforms on top of her turrets in 1918 . A Sopwith Camel was carried on the rear turret and a Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter on the forward turret . She was present at the surrender of the German fleet on 21 November 1918 . Glorious was reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February 1919 and served as a turret drill ship , being also flagship of the Rear @-@ Admiral Commanding the Devonport Reserve between 1921 and 1922 . 
 = = Conversion = = 
 The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 severely limited the amount of capital ship tonnage and the Royal Navy was forced to scrap many of its older battleships and battlecruisers . However up to 66 @,@ 000 long tons ( 67 @,@ 059 t ) of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers , for which the Courageous @-@ class ships ' combination of a large hull and high speed made them an ideal candidate for conversion . Glorious began her conversion at Rosyth in 1924 , but was towed to Devonport for completion , and she was re @-@ commissioned on 24 February 1930 . During the ship 's post @-@ conversion sea trials she reached 29 @.@ 47 knots ( 54 @.@ 58 km / h ; 33 @.@ 91 mph ) . Her fifteen @-@ inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during World War II for HMS Vanguard , the Royal Navy 's last battleship . 
 Her new design improved on her half @-@ sister HMS Furious which lacked an island and a conventional funnel . All superstructure , guns , torpedo tubes , and fittings down to the main deck were removed . A two @-@ storey hangar , each level 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high and 550 feet ( 167 @.@ 6 m ) long , was built on top of the remaining hull ; the upper hangar level opened on to a short flying @-@ off deck , below and forward of the main flight deck . The flying @-@ off deck improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility until new fighters requiring longer takeoff rolls made the lower deck obsolete in the 1930s . Two 46 @-@ by @-@ 48 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 0 m × 14 @.@ 6 m ) lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck . An island with the bridge , flying control station , and funnel was added on the starboard side as islands had been found not to contribute significantly to turbulence . By 1939 the ship could carry 34 @,@ 500 imperial gallons ( 157 @,@ 000 l ; 41 @,@ 400 US gal ) of petrol for her aircraft . 
 Glorious received a dual @-@ purpose armament of sixteen QF 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mark VIII guns in single High @-@ Angle Mark XII mounts . One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair was on the quarterdeck . The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of the ship . During her 1935 refit , Glorious received three octuple 2 @-@ pounder pom @-@ pom Mark VI mounts , one on each side of the flying @-@ off deck , forward of the 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns , and one behind the island on the flight deck . She also received four water @-@ cooled .50 @-@ calibre Mark III machine guns in a single quadruple mounting . 
 Glorious recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet , but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930 . She relieved Courageous in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939 . In a fog on 1 April 1931 Glorious rammed the French ocean liner Florida amidships while steaming at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . The impact crumpled 60 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) of the flying @-@ off deck and killed 1 seaman aboard Glorious and 24 passengers and crew aboard Florida . Glorious was forced to put into Gibraltar to temporary repairs . She had to sail to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931 . Sometime in the early 1930s , traverse arresting gear was installed . She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two hydraulic accelerators ( catapults ) on her upper flight deck , which was also extended to the rear , her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple pom @-@ pom mounts . Glorious participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI before returning to the Mediterranean . 
 = = = Air group = = = 
 Glorious could carry up to 48 aircraft ; when first recommissioned , she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters , Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers , and Fairey IIIF reconnaissance planes of the Fleet Air Arm . From 1933 until Glorious returned to the United Kingdom in April 1940 , aside from a period when refitting in the mid @-@ 1930s , she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters , until re @-@ equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939 . 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti @-@ ship attack missions . They flew the Blackburn Ripon , the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft . When Glorious recommissioned after her refit in 1935 825 Squadron was embarked , initially with Fairey IIIFs , but the squadron converted to Fairey Swordfish in May 1936 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Glorious served briefly with the Mediterranean Fleet for a time after World War II broke out . In October 1939 , she moved through the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean where she became part of Force J which was organized to hunt for the Admiral Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean . It was not successful and Glorious remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she returned to the Mediterranean . 
 = = = Norwegian Campaign = = = 
 She was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in Norway . Eighteen Gloster Gladiators of No. 263 Squadron RAF were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases . Eleven Blackburn Skuas of 803 Squadron , plus eighteen Sea Gladiators from 802 and 804 Squadrons were also embarked . Glorious and Ark Royal arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their own aircraft attacked targets in and south of Trondheim before Glorious had to return to Scapa Flow late on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft . Glorious 's Sea Gladiators provided air cover for the two carriers . They damaged one Heinkel He 111 bomber on a reconnaissance mission . Before departing she transferred four serviceable Skuas to Ark Royal . She returned on 1 May , but had been unable to load many new aircraft because of poor weather . Only a dozen Swordfish of 823 Squadron , three Skuas and one Blackburn Roc managed to be flown aboard . The task force was under heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe all day and was withdrawn that evening . One Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber was shot down after it dropped its bomb by the Sea Gladiators on patrol . 
 Glorious returned on 18 May with six Supermarine Walrus amphibious flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF . The latter aircraft had been loaded aboard by crane . The Walruses were quickly flown off to Harstad , but the airfield at <unk> was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when Glorious returned to Scapa on 21 May . Glorious came back to the Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were quickly flown off . 
 However , even this success proved to be ephemeral and British forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later . The evacuation ( Operation Alphabet ) began in the north on the night of 3 / 4 June and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support although she only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 and six Swordfish from 823 Squadrons for self @-@ defence as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if at all possible . Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes . These had been flown off from land bases to keep them from being destroyed in the evacuation after the pilots discovered that a 7 @-@ kilogram ( 15 lb ) sandbag carried in the rear of the Hurricane allowed full brakes to be applied immediately on landing . This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier . 
 = = = The sinking = = = 
 The commanding officer of Glorious , Captain Guy D 'Oyly @-@ Hughes , was a former submariner who had been executive officer of Courageous for ten months . He was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June to hold a court @-@ martial of his Commander ( Air ) , J. B. Heath , who had refused an order to carry out an attack on shore targets on the grounds that the targets were at best ill @-@ defined and his aircraft were unsuited to the task , and who had been left behind in Scapa to await trial . On the way through the Norwegian Sea the funnel smoke from Glorious and her two escorting destroyers , Acasta and Ardent , was spotted by the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at about 3 : 46 pm . The German ships were not spotted until shortly after 4 : 00 and Ardent was dispatched to investigate . Glorious did not alter course or increase speed . Five Swordfish were ordered to the flight deck but Action Stations was not ordered until 4 : 20 . No combat air patrol was being flown , no aircraft were ready on the deck for quick take @-@ off and there was no lookout in Glorious 's crow 's nest . Scharnhorst opened fire on Ardent at 4 : 27 at a range of about 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) , causing the destroyer to withdraw , firing torpedoes and making a smoke screen . Ardent scored one hit with her 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) guns on Scharnhorst but was hit several times by the German ships ' secondary armament and sank at about 5 : 25 . 
 Scharnhorst switched her fire to Glorious at 4 : 32 and scored her first hit six minutes later on her third salvo , at an approximate range of 26 @,@ 000 yards ( 24 @,@ 000 m ) , when one 28 @.@ 3 @-@ centimetre ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) hit the forward flight deck and burst in the upper hangar , starting a large fire . This hit destroyed two Swordfish being prepared for flight and the hole in the flight deck prevented any other aircraft from taking off . Splinters penetrated a boiler casing and caused a temporary drop in steam pressure . At 4 : 58 a second shell hit the homing beacon above the bridge and killed or wounded the captain and most of the personnel stationed there . The smokescreen became effective enough to impair the visibility of the Germans from about 4 : 58 to 5 : 20 so they ceased fire on Glorious . 
 Glorious was hit again in the centre engine room at around 5 : 20 and this caused her to lose speed and commence a slow circle to port . She also developed a list to starboard . The German ships closed to within 16 @,@ 000 yards and continued to fire at her until about 5 : 40 . Glorious sank at about 6 : 10 , approximately at 68 ° 38 ′ N 03 ° 50 ′ E , with only 43 survivors . 
 As the German ships approached Glorious , the destroyer Acasta , which had been trying to maintain the smokescreen , broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst . One of these hit the battleship at 5 : 34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her . Acasta also managed one hit from her 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns on Scharnhorst , but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 6 : 20 . 
 According to Winton , survivors ' estimates were that about 900 men abandoned Glorious . The German ships did not try to save survivors . The Royal Navy knew nothing of the sinking until it was announced on German radio . The Norwegian ship <unk> , on passage to the Faroe Islands , arrived late on June 10 and picked up survivors , eventually delivering 37 alive to <unk> of whom two died . Another Norwegian ship , Svalbard II , also making for the Faeroes , picked up five survivors but was sighted by a German aircraft and forced to return to Norway , where the four still alive became prisoners of war for the next five years . It is also believed that one more survivor from Glorious was rescued by a German seaplane . Therefore , the total of survivors was 40 , including one each from Acasta and Ardent . The total killed or missing was 1 @,@ 207 from Glorious , 160 from Acasta and 152 from Ardent , a total of 1 @,@ 519 . 
 The disaster and the failure to mount an effective rescue was clearly an embarrassment for the Royal Navy . All ships encountering the enemy should routinely broadcast a sighting report , and so the lack of a sighting report from Glorious was eventually raised in the House of Commons . It later became known that the heavy cruiser HMS Devonshire had passed within 30 – 50 miles of the battle , flying the flag of Vice Admiral John Cunningham , who was carrying out orders to evacuate the Norwegian Royal Family to the UK and maintain radio silence . Some surviving eyewitnesses from Glorious and HMS Devonshire later testified that the sighting report had been correctly sent , and received by HMS Devonshire , but that it had been suppressed by Cunningham , who departed at high speed in accordance with his orders . It has also been alleged by Howland that there was some confusion over the use of wireless telegraphy frequencies on board Glorious which could have contributed to the failure of any other ship or shore @-@ station to receive a sighting report . Howland also cites the absence of normal airborne patrols over Glorious and its attendant destroyers , in conditions of maximum visibility , as a contributory factor to the sinking of Glorious and her escorts .

 = Morgan dollar = 
 The Morgan dollar was a United States dollar coin minted from 1878 to 1904 , and then again in 1921 . It was the first standard silver dollar minted since production of the previous design , the Seated Liberty dollar , ceased due to the passage of the Coinage Act of 1873 , which also ended the free coining of silver . The coin is named after its designer , United States Mint Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan . The obverse depicts a profile portrait representing Liberty , while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings outstretched . 
 The dollar was authorized by the Bland – Allison Act . Following the passage of the 1873 act , mining interests lobbied to restore free silver , which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it , struck into coin . Instead , the Bland – Allison Act was passed , which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars ' worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month . In 1890 , the Bland – Allison Act was repealed by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , which required the Treasury to purchase 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 troy ounces ( 140 @,@ 000 kg ) of silver each month , but only required further silver dollar production for one year . This act , once again , was repealed in 1893 . 
 In 1898 , Congress approved a bill that required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars . When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904 , the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar . The Pittman Act , passed in 1918 , authorized the melting and <unk> of millions of silver dollars . Pursuant to the act , Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921 . The design was replaced by the Peace dollar later the same year . 
 In the early 1960s , a large quantity of unissued Morgan dollars was found to be available from Treasury vaults , including issues once thought rare . Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value , and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin . Beginning in the 1970s , the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration . In 2006 , Morgan 's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building .

 In 1873 , Congress enacted the Fourth Coinage Act , which effectively ended the bimetallic standard in the United States by <unk> silver bullion . Prior to enactment of the Coinage Act , silver could be brought to the mints and coined into legal tender for a small fee . With such a system in place , bullion producers could have silver coined into dollars when the intrinsic value of a silver dollar was lower than the face value , thus making a profit , flooding the money supply and causing inflation . The act ended production of the standard silver dollar ( then the Seated Liberty dollar , as designed by Christian Gobrecht ) and provided for mintage of a silver trade dollar , which was intended to compete with Mexican dollars for use in the Orient . Under the act , bullion producers were allowed to bring bullion to the mints in order to be cast into bars or coined into the newly authorized trade dollars for a small fee . Trade dollars initially held legal tender status , but it was revoked in 1876 to prevent bullion producers from making a profit by coining silver into trade dollars when the value of the metal was low . The restrictions on free coinage laid out in the Coinage Act initially met little resistance from mining interests until the price of silver declined rapidly due to increased mining in the Western United States . Protests also came from bankers , manufacturers and farmers , who felt an increased money supply would have a positive impact . Groups were formed that demanded the free coinage of silver ( or " free silver " ) in order to inflate the dollar following the Panic of 1873 . 
 Beginning in 1876 , several bills were introduced in the House of Representatives in an effort to resume the free coinage of silver . One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876 . Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate . The House bill allowed Free Silver ; one of Allison 's amendments struck that provision . This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates for the first time in United States history . The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes . The president 's veto was overridden on February 28 , 1878 . What came to be known as the Bland – Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars ' worth of silver per month , to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold / silver value ratio of 16 : 1 , meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver . 
 = = Design history = = 
 In 1876 , Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began efforts to redesign the nation 's silver coins . Linderman contacted C.W. Fremantle , Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London , requesting him to " find a first class die @-@ sinker who would be willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the Mint at Philadelphia . " In response to Linderman 's request , Fremantle wrote " My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan , age 30 , who has made himself a considerable name , but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country . " An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William Barber on a six @-@ month trial basis . 
 Morgan arrived in Philadelphia on October 9 , 1876 . His earliest pattern coins designed during his tenure at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar . In 1876 , Morgan enrolled as a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design . Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design . For the representation of Liberty , Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek – style figures . Morgan 's friend , artist Thomas Eakins , suggested he use Anna <unk> Williams of Philadelphia as a model . In total , Morgan had five sittings with Williams ; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen . 
 On October 18 , 1877 , Linderman requested Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint James Pollock to " instruct Mr. Morgan to prepare without delay , dies for a silver dollar , the designs , inscriptions , and arrangement thereof to be the same as the enclosed impression for the Half Dollar and numbered ' 2' substituting the words ' one dollar ' in place of ' half dollar ' " . Linderman also ordered Pollock to " instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law . He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same . " Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver ; he wrote Pollock on February 21 , 1878 , " I have now to state for your information , that it is my intention , in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress , becoming law , to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury , of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan . " 
 = = Production = = 
 Production of the coins did not commence until March 11 , more than a week after the passage of the Bland – Allison Act . The first acceptable strike , after adjustments to the press , was coined at 3 : 17 p.m. at the Philadelphia Mint . This piece was given to President Hayes ; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman and to Mint Director Henry Linderman . 
 Linderman desired to involve the western mints of San Francisco and Carson City in production in order to help reach the monthly quota necessary under the Bland – Allison Act . Pressure was so great at the Philadelphia Mint that it halted production of all other coins and began operating overtime . Use of the western mints was delayed , however , as all dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint , and it was believed that the Western mints did not have the proper equipment to prepare the dies for use . During the second week of production , Linderman pointed out what he called a " slight imperfection " in the dies for the dollar . The reason for the changes was to reduce the relief of the designs and to change the number of tail feathers on the eagle from eight to seven ; this was done because all prior United States coinage depicted the bald eagle as having an odd number of tail feathers . The high relief had caused the dies to have a shorter life . Dies were eventually sent to the Western mints , arriving in both San Francisco and Carson City on April 16 , 1878 . The New Orleans Mint began striking the new silver dollars in 1879 . 
 The Denver Mint , established in 1906 , struck the coins for only one year , in 1921 . The mint marks appearing on the coins are none , representing Philadelphia , " CC " for Carson City , " S " for San Francisco , " O " for New Orleans and " D " for Denver . In order to conform to the Coinage Act of 1837 , the Morgan dollar contained ninety percent silver and ten percent copper , measured 38 @.@ 1 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 50 in ) in diameter and weighed 412 @.@ 5 grains ( 26 @.@ 73 g ) . 
 = = Sherman Silver Purchase Act , Panic of 1893 = = 
 Mintage of the Morgan dollar remained relatively steady until the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act on July 14 , 1890 . The act , authored by Ohio senator and former Treasury secretary John Sherman , forced the Treasury to increase the amount of silver purchased to 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 troy ounces ( 140 @,@ 000 kg ) each month . Supporters of the act believed that an increase in the amount of silver purchased would result in inflation , helping to relieve the nation 's farmers . The act also received support from mining interests because such large purchases would cause the price of silver to rise and increase their profits . Despite the Act 's requiring large purchases of silver indefinitely , it provided that the Mint must coin 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 silver dollars each month only until 1891 . Since the Treasury already had a surplus of silver dollars , minting of dollars dropped sharply beginning in 1892 . The silver that remained after mintage of the dollars was used to mint dimes , quarters and half dollars . 
 Beginning early in 1893 , a number of industrial firms , including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt . The resulting bank runs and failures became known as the Panic of 1893 . In June of that year , President Grover Cleveland , who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it . The act was repealed on November 1 , 1893 . On June 13 , 1898 , Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars . Silver dollar production rose again , until the bullion was exhausted in 1904 , when it ceased . 
 = = Pittman Act = = 
 The German government began a propaganda campaign during World War I to discredit the United Kingdom 's currency in India . The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British banknotes in that country could not be redeemed for silver . This led to a run on the British supply of silver . In response , United States Democratic senator Key Pittman of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government . The bill , passed on April 22 , 1918 , stated that " sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States , of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use , and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States " . The Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 silver dollars , and this commenced immediately after the Act 's passage . The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270 @,@ 232 @,@ 722 silver dollars . Of that amount , 259 @,@ 121 @,@ 554 were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce . 
 The U.S. only minted the Morgan dollar again during 1921 , the only year in which Morgan dollars were struck at the Denver mint . Since the Treasury had destroyed the obsolete Morgan dollar dies in 1910 , Morgan had to create an entirely new master die . Another provision of the Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to mint a replacement coin for every silver dollar melted . During the same year , the Peace dollar was first issued to commemorate the end of World War I. The Peace dollar was supposedly minted to replace the Morgan dollar under the terms of the Pittman Act but without congressional authorization , despite the fact that the Act did not describe the coin design . The change in design was actually authorized under an 1890 act of Congress , which stated : 
 But no change in the design or die of any coin shall be made oftener than once in twenty @-@ five years from and including the year of the first adoption of the design , model , die , or hub for the same coin : 
 Provided , That no change be made in the diameter of any coin : 
 And provided further , That nothing in this section shall prevent the adoption of new designs or models for devices or emblems already authorized for the standard silver dollar and the five @-@ cent nickel piece as soon as practicable after the passage of this act . 
 = = Carson City Mint Morgan dollars = = 
 Until 1964 , U.S. citizens could redeem paper money known as silver certificates for silver dollars at a U.S. Treasury mint on demand . In 1962 , an individual redeemed a silver certificate and received a rare and valuable Morgan dollar in exchange . The coin was from a bag of silver dollars in the vault of the Philadelphia Mint . This incident triggered huge interest , and between November 1962 and March 1964 , millions of Morgan and Peace dollars were sold to the general public . The demand to exchange silver certificates for silver dollars was so great that lines formed outside of the Treasury Building in Washington , D.C. Some people in line were pushing wheelbarrows . The U.S. Treasury discovered previously unknown mint bags of Carson City dollars in its vaults containing slightly more than 2 @.@ 8 million Carson City silver dollars in the Treasury vaults . Treasury officials decided to hold them back because the total number of coins minted at the Carson City mint were generally lower than others . 
 On May 12 , 1969 , the Joint Commission on Coinage held a meeting in order to determine the best way to sell the Carson City @-@ minted dollars earlier held back by Treasury officials . They recommended a mail bid sale . Legislation was passed on December 31 , 1970 directing the Treasury to transfer the silver dollars to the Administrator of General Services who was given the responsibility for marketing and selling the coins . The legislation also stated that all proceeds from the sale were to be " covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts . " Congress supplied the General Services Administration with $ 10 million to market the dollar coins . Advertising consisted of posters and brochures distributed to post offices , banks and various financial institutions , as well as television documentaries . The coins were sorted and mounted in small plastic display cases . The GSA conducted a total of seven mail bid sales between 1972 and 1980 . In total , the sales generated $ 107 million in revenue .

 On June 15 , 2006 , legislation was approved that provided for the minting of a silver dollar and a five dollar gold coin in " commemoration of the Old Mint at San Francisco , " with surcharges to be given to the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society in an effort to rehabilitate the Old Mint . In total , 100 @,@ 000 gold and 500 @,@ 000 silver commemorative coins were authorized . Authorization came at the behest of several hobby publications , who enlisted readers to contact their local congressmen and persuade them to pass necessary legislation . The designs approved for the silver dollar bear a left @-@ frontal view of the Old Mint building and a copy of Morgan 's eagle design on the obverse and reverse , respectively . Mint artist Joseph Menna made a new model for the reverse , employing a 1904 San Francisco @-@ minted dollar as his model . 
 = Keswick , Cumbria = 
 Keswick ( / <unk> / ) is an English market town and civil parish , historically in Cumberland , and since 1974 in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria . The town , in the Lake District National Park , just north of Derwentwater , and 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from <unk> , had a population of 4 @,@ 821 at the time of the 2011 census . 
 There is considerable evidence of prehistoric occupation of the Keswick area , but the first recorded mention of the town dates from the 13th century , when Edward I of England granted a charter for Keswick 's market , which has maintained a continuous 700 @-@ year existence . In Tudor times the town was an important mining area , and from the 18th century onwards it has increasingly been known as a holiday centre ; tourism has been its principal industry for more than 150 years . Its features include the Moot Hall ; a modern theatre , the Theatre by the Lake ; one of Britain 's oldest surviving cinemas , the Alhambra ; and the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery in the town 's largest open space , Fitz Park . Among the town 's annual events is the Keswick Convention , an Evangelical gathering attracting visitors from many countries . 
 Keswick became widely known for its association with the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey . Together with their fellow Lake Poet William Wordsworth , based at Grasmere , 12 miles ( 19 km ) away , they made the scenic beauty of the area widely known to readers in Britain and beyond . In the late 19th century and into the 20th , Keswick was the focus of several important initiatives by the growing conservation movement , often led by Hardwicke Rawnsley , vicar of the nearby Crosthwaite parish and co @-@ founder of the National Trust , which has built up extensive holdings in the area . 
 = = Name = = 
 The town is first recorded in Edward I 's charter of the 13th century , as " <unk> " . Scholars have generally considered the name to be from the Old English , meaning " farm where cheese is made " , the word deriving from " <unk> " ( cheese ) with a Scandinavian initial " k " and " <unk> " ( special place or dwelling ) , although not all academics agree . George Flom of the University of Illinois ( 1919 ) rejected that derivation on the grounds that a town in the heart of Viking @-@ settled areas , as Keswick was , would not have been given a Saxon name ; he proposed instead that the word is of Danish or Norse origin , and means " Kell 's place at the bend of the river " . Among the later scholars supporting the " cheese farm " toponymy are Eilert Ekwall ( 1960 ) and A D Mills ( 2011 ) ( both Oxford University Press ) , and Diana Whaley ( 2006 ) , for the English Place @-@ Name Society . 
 = = Prehistory = = 
 Evidence of prehistoric occupation in the area includes the Castlerigg stone circle on the eastern fringe of the town , which has been dated to between 3000 and 2500 BC . Neolithic @-@ era stone tools were unearthed inside the circle and in the centre of Keswick during the 19th century . The antiquary W G Collingwood , commenting in 1925 about finds in the area , wrote that they showed " Stone Age man was fairly at home in the Lake District " . There is little evidence of sustained settlement in the area during the Bronze Age , but from excavations of hill forts it is clear that there was some Iron Age occupation , circa 500 BC , although scholars are not agreed about how permanent it was . 
 In Roman Britain Cumbria was the territory of the <unk> . As the site of the western part of Hadrian 's Wall , it was of strategic importance . The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period , but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area , other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present @-@ day town . Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic . Many local place names from the period , including that of the River Derwent , are Celtic , some closely related to Welsh equivalents . 
 Several Christian saints preached the Gospel in the north of England in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD ; in Keswick and the surrounding area the most important figures were St Herbert of Derwentwater and his contemporary St Kentigern . The former , the pupil and friend of St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne , lived as a hermit on an island in Derwentwater , now named after him . Kentigern , who lived and preached in the area before moving to Wales , is traditionally held to have founded Crosthwaite Church , which was the parish church of Keswick until the 19th century . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 Keswick 's recorded history starts in the Middle Ages . The area was conquered by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria in the seventh century , but Northumbria was destroyed by the Vikings in the late ninth . In the early tenth century the British Kingdom of Strathclyde seized the area , and it remained part of Strathclyde until about 1050 , when Siward , Earl of Northumbria , conquered Cumbria . In 1092 William II of England , son of William the Conqueror , marched north and established the great baronies of Allerdale @-@ below @-@ Derwent , Allerdale @-@ above @-@ Derwent , and Greystoke , the borders of which met at Keswick . In 1181 Jocelyn of Furness wrote of a new church at Crosthwaite , Keswick , founded by Alice de Romilly , the Lady of Allerdale , a direct descendant of William II 's original barons . In 1189 , Richard I granted the rectory of Crosthwaite to the Cistercian order of Fountains Abbey . 
 During the 13th century , agricultural land around the town was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys . The latter , already prosperous from the wool trade , wished to expand its sheep farming , and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly . She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey , to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater , land at <unk> , the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale . Keswick was at the hub of the monastic farms in the area , and Fountains based a steward in the town , where tenants paid their rents . Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore . 
 Keswick was granted a charter for a market in 1276 by Edward I. This market has an uninterrupted history lasting for more than 700 years . The pattern of buildings around the market square remained broadly the same from this period until at least the late 18th century , with houses – originally timber @-@ framed – fronting the square , and sturdily enclosed gardens or yards at the back . According to local tradition these stout walls and the narrow entrances to the yards were for defence against marauding Scots . In the event it appears that the town escaped such attacks , Scottish raiders finding richer and more accessible targets at Carlisle and the fertile Eden Valley , well to the north of Keswick . 
 = = = 16th and 17th centuries : agriculture and industry = = = 
 With the Dissolution of the Monasteries , between 1536 and 1541 , Furness and Fountains Abbeys were supplanted by new secular landlords for the farmers of Keswick and its neighbourhood . The buying and selling of sheep and wool were no longer centred on the great Abbeys , being handled locally by the new landowners and tenants . This enhanced Keswick 's importance as a market centre , though at first the town remained only modestly prosperous : in the 1530s John Leland wrote of it as " a <unk> poore market town " . By the second half of the century copper mining had made Keswick richer : in 1586 William Camden wrote of " these copper works not only being sufficient for all England , but great quantities of the copper exported every year " with , at the centre , " <unk> , a small market town , many years famous for the copper works as appears from a charter of king Edward IV , and at present inhabited by miners . " 
 Earlier copper mining had been small in scale , but Elizabeth I , concerned for the defence of her kingdom , required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships . There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land . The experts in copper mining were German , and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel <unk> of Augsburg , to whom she granted a licence to " search , dig , try , roast and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold , silver , copper and quicksilver " in the Keswick area and elsewhere . 
 As well as copper , a new substance was found , extracted and exploited : this was variously called wad , black lead , plumbago or black <unk> , and is now known as graphite . Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral : it reduced friction in machinery , made a heat @-@ resistant glaze for crucibles , and when used to line moulds for cannonballs , resulted in rounder , smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon . Later , from the second half of the 18th century , it was used to make pencils , for which Keswick became famous . 
 The copper mines prospered for about seventy years , but by the early 17th century the industry was in decline . Demand for copper fell and the cost of extracting it was high . Graphite mining continued , and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance . Other small @-@ scale industries grew up , such as tannery and weaving . Although the boom of the mid @-@ 16th century had finished , the town 's economy did not slide into ruin , and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = 18th and 19th centuries : beginnings of tourism = = = 
 The historian George Bott regards John Dalton ( 1709 – 63 ) and John Brown ( 1715 – 66 ) as the pioneers of tourism in the Lake District . Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery , and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area . The poet Thomas Gray published an account of a five @-@ day stay in Keswick in 1769 , in which he described the view of the town as " the vale of Elysium in all its verdure " , and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake . His journal was widely read , and was , in Bott 's phrase , " an effective public relations job for Keswick . " Painters such as Thomas Smith of Derby and William <unk> also contributed to the influx of visitors ; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers , further enhancing the fame of the area . In 1800 the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote , " It is no small advantage that for two @-@ thirds of the year we are in complete retirement – the other third is alive & swarms with Tourists of all shapes & sizes . " Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year , and together with his fellow Lake Poets ( see below ) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District . 
 During the 18th century and into the 19th , turnpike trusts were established and major roads in Cumberland were greatly improved . With the Lake District now accessible by coach the area attracted well @-@ off visitors , particularly at times of war in mainland Europe , which made the aristocratic Grand Tour impossible there . Regular public coach services were established in the 1760s , but they were expensive . The ten @-@ hour journey from Whitehaven to Penrith via Keswick cost 12 shillings ( equivalent to 60 pence ) , at a time when country labourers typically earned £ 24 a year or less , and the annual income of even the most prosperous tenant farmers was rarely more than £ 200 . Nonetheless , by the 19th century the number of tourists visiting Keswick during each season was estimated at between 12 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 . Some of the Keswick inns that catered for affluent visitors remain as hotels , including the Queen 's , where Gray stayed . 
 The construction of the railways in the mid @-@ 19th century made the Lake District , and Keswick in particular , more accessible to visitors of modest means . The original impetus for building the Cockermouth , Keswick and Penrith Railway ( <unk> ) line came from heavy industry : the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham on the east side of the country . The <unk> was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties . The line opened for goods traffic in 1864 , and the following year it began to carry passengers . Fares varied , but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices , such as six shillings for the 170 @-@ mile return journey from Preston to Keswick . 
 In addition to its growing importance as a tourist centre , Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century . It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792 , as a cottage industry , using graphite mined locally . This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose @-@ built by several companies . Pencil making was the town 's most important manufacturing industry by the mid @-@ 19th century , textiles and leather goods having declined . 
 The Moot Hall was rebuilt in 1813 , and the lower floor was used as a market house on Saturdays . Coal gas was supplied by a gas works from 1846 ; the Keswick library opened in 1849 ; a water works began operation in 1856 ; and Keswick police station opened in 1857 . The local weekly newspaper , The Keswick Reminder was founded in 1896 , and in 2014 continues to be published every Friday . In an article in The Observer in 1978 , Christopher Brasher wrote that as long as the Reminder flourishes , " there will be one corner of these islands that is forever England . " 
 In 1883 Hardwicke Rawnsley was appointed vicar of Crosthwaite . In a study of Lake District towns in 1974 , H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning Rawnsley would be the equivalent of writing about Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon without mentioning Shakespeare , so great was Rawnsley 's impact on the town . He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving ; these grew into the Keswick School of Industrial Art , which trained local craftsmen and <unk> from 1894 until it closed in 1986 . He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town , and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School , Blencathra Sanatorium and the County Farm School . As co @-@ founder of the National Trust , Rawnsley contributed to Keswick 's continued growth as a tourist centre , with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around Derwentwater , beginning with <unk> Wood in 1902 . 
 = = = 20th century and beyond = = = 
 Keswick 's history throughout the 20th century was one of increasing reliance on tourism , the pencil industry being the second largest source of employment . The Cumberland Pencil Company , formed at the turn of the century , occupied a large factory near the River Greta on the road leading out of Keswick towards Cockermouth . The conservation movement continued to develop ; Rawnsley led successful campaigns to save the medieval Greta and Portinscale bridges from replacement with ferro @-@ concrete structures ; and the National Trust continued to acquire land locally . In the First World War Keswick lost many of its young men : the war memorial near Fitz Park commemorates 117 names , from a population at the time of less than 4 @,@ 500 . By the 1930s Keswick was firmly established as the main centre of tourism in Cumberland and Westmorland . An article in The Manchester Guardian in 1934 called it " the capital of the Lake District " , and continued : 
 Keswick 's chief industry is to promote the contentment and happiness of its visitors . Its pleasant position provides at the outset a tonic atmosphere ... it is set in the most delightful part of a delightful district , described by Wordsworth as " the loveliest spot that ever man has found . " There are numerous places of interest and fine shops , and good accommodation is offered to visitors at reasonable prices . Keswick is the best centre from which to visit Lakeland . 
 During the Second World War students from St Katharine 's College , Liverpool and Roedean School , Sussex , were evacuated to Keswick when their own buildings were requisitioned for use as a hospital and a navy base respectively . Students were also brought to the safety of Keswick from Central Newcastle High School , <unk> Hall School , Yorkshire , and the Liverpool Orphanage . 
 The creation of the Lake District National Park in 1951 , with strict control over new development , prevented any expansion of the town beyond its pre @-@ war borders . Keswick 's population has remained stable at a little below 5 @,@ 000 residents . The town 's reliance on tourism increased in 2006 when Cumberland Pencils moved production from Keswick to <unk> , Workington , only the Cumberland Pencil Museum remaining at the old site . At the beginning of the 21st century , more than 60 per cent of the population were employed in hotels , restaurants and distribution . A survey of retail premises in 2000 found that more than ten per cent were outdoor clothes shops , a similar proportion were cafés or restaurants , and more than eight per cent were gift shops . The age profile of the Keswick population is significantly higher than the English average . In 2011 children under 10 made up 7 @.@ 6 per cent of the town 's population , compared with 11 @.@ 9 per cent for England as a whole . Between ages 10 and 20 the comparable figures are 10 @.@ 2 and 12 @.@ 1 ; and from ages 20 to 44 , 25 @.@ 9 as against 34 @.@ 3 . The percentage of Keswick 's population aged 45 and upwards is above the national average , the largest difference being within the <unk> to 84 @-@ year @-@ old bracket , which contains 9 @.@ 6 per cent of Keswick 's population compared with a national average of 5 @.@ 5 . Figures from the same census show that Keswick has fewer than average " large employers and higher managerial occupations " and more small employers and self @-@ employed people . Long @-@ term unemployment is considerably below the average for England . 
 = = = Ownership and governance = = = 
 In medieval times the township was within the manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater . The earliest surviving official record of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to the lord of the manor , Thomas de Derwentwater . The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly to Adam de Derwentwater before 1216 , and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage . The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of James Radclyffe , third Earl of Derwentwater , in 1716 for his part in the Jacobite rebellion the previous year . In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the Greenwich Hospital , London . Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital 's forestry and farming estates until the 19th century . In 1925 the then owner , Sir John Randles , gave the National Trust 90 acres of land in this estate , including the foreshore woodland . 
 Keswick became a Local Government District in 1853 and an urban district with three wards in 1894 , reflecting its growth in the latter part of the 19th century . The new urban district 's northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway , taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899 . In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and Allerdale Borough Council . Since 2010 Keswick has been in the Copeland parliamentary constituency , having previously been part of Workington and before that Penrith and The Border . The electoral ward of Keswick stretches beyond the confines of the parish boundary and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 5 @,@ 243 .

 = = Transport = = 
 Keswick is on the <unk> road linking Workington and Penrith , as well as the A591 , linking the town to Windermere , Kendal and Carlisle ( via the A595 ) . 
 There are no rail links to Keswick ; the line built in the 1860s for the Cockermouth , Keswick and Penrith Railway closed in 1972 . Since the 1990s a plan to rebuild it has been under discussion . Some 90 percent of the earthworks of the railway still exist , but according to 2000 estimates , a reopening would cost £ 25 million . In 2014 the only public transport serving the towns and villages on the old railway route is a bus service operating at mostly hourly intervals . The bus journey from the main line station at Penrith to Keswick takes a scheduled 47 minutes . 
 The town is served by other bus routes providing direct connections with Carlisle , Cockermouth , Kendal , Lancaster , Penrith , Windermere , Workington , and other towns and villages in the north west . The flow of traffic from Penrith to Cockermouth and beyond was eased after the <unk> was diverted to a new bypass in 1974 , a development that caused controversy because of a prominent new viaduct carrying the road across the Greta Gorge to the north of the town . 
 The majority of visitors arrive by car and are catered for by three town centre car parks , another large one next to the Theatre by the Lake , and smaller ones elsewhere in the town .

 In August , Keswick features the Derwentwater Regatta . It was inaugurated by the eccentric local landowner Joseph Pocklington in 1792 , and after a lapse of more than two centuries was revived in 2013 . Its organisers describe it as " A weekend of mayhem and madness afloat , with the chance to climb aboard in a variety of races on Derwentwater " . The Keswick Agricultural Show , founded in 1860 , has traditionally been held on August Bank Holiday Monday at the western edge of the town on the Crossing Fields section of the open land known as the <unk> .

Performers in Keswick have included the <unk> Quartet , the Royal Northern Sinfonia , <unk> Little , the City of London Sinfonia , Red Priest and Nicolai <unk> . 
 = = = Lake Poets and other Keswick notables = = = 
 Coleridge and William Wordsworth were close friends and collaborators ; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy took up residence in the Lake District in late 1799 it was , in Bott 's word , inevitable that Coleridge would follow suit . Six months after the Wordsworths moved into Dove Cottage at Grasmere , Coleridge leased Greta Hall in Keswick , 12 miles ( 19 km ) away . In 1803 Robert Southey , Coleridge 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , agreed to share the house with Coleridge and his family . Southey remained at Greta Hall after Coleridge left in 1804 , and it remained Southey 's family home until his death in 1843 . Many famous literary figures stayed at Greta Hall in these years , including the Wordsworths , Charles and Mary Lamb , Thomas de Quincey , William Hazlitt , Percy Bysshe Shelley , and Sir Walter Scott . Lamb , a Londoner devoted to his native city , remained doubtful of the attractions of the Lake District , but most of the visitors to Greta Hall wrote eloquently of the beauty of the scenery , and further enhanced the public regard for , and desire to visit , the area . Southey was well regarded locally , but played little part in the life of the town . He is buried in Crosthwaite churchyard and there is a memorial to him inside the church , with an inscription written by Wordsworth . 
 Among Keswick notables before the Lake Poets was Sir John Bankes , a leading Royalist during the English Civil War . He was Charles I 's Attorney General and Chief Justice . Bankes was born at Castlerigg near Keswick in 1589 . A bust in his memory is in upper Fitz Park close to the museum . In 2014 he was further commemorated by the conversion of the former Keswick courthouse into a bar named in his honour with his full title , " The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas " . 
 Later residents of the area have included the classical scholar , essayist , poet and founder of the Society for Psychical Research , Frederic Myers , who was born in Keswick , and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson , founder of the Vegan Society , who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching . The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham lived and worked in Keswick . Their photographic shop in Lake Road , built in 1887 , was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher ; the shop still contains memorabilia , including photographs , from the Abrahams ' era . 
 Of literary figures after the Lake Poets among those most closely associated with Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole . In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn , a house between Keswick and Grange at the opposite end of Derwentwater . Like the Lake Poets in the previous century , he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District , and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction . He wrote in 1939 , " That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books . That I wasn 't born a Cumbrian isn 't my fault : that Cumbrians , in spite of my ' foreignness ' , have been so kind to me , is my good fortune . "

 Georgekutty ( Mohanlal ) is an orphan who had dropped out of school after his 4th grade . Now he is a businessman running a cable TV service in a rural area . He is married to Rani ( Meena ) and they have two daughters , Anju ( Ansiba Hassan ) and Anu ( Esther Anil ) . His only interest apart from his family is watching films . He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office . 
 During a nature camp , Anju gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone . The culprit , Varun ( Roshan Basheer ) , is the son of police inspector general Geetha Prabhakar ( Asha Sarath ) . Varun is accidentally killed by Rani and her daughter when he comes to blackmail them . They hide his body in a compost pit , which is witnessed by Anu . Rani tells Georgekutty about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law . He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Varun 's car , which is seen by Constable Sahadevan ( Kalabhavan Shajon ) , who has a grudge against Georgekutty . Georgekutty takes them out on a trip to Thodupuzha to pray in a church , watch a movie and eat at a restaurant . Geetha , seeing that her son has gone missing , starts an investigation . 
 After a preliminary investigation , Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning . Georgekutty , who had predicted that this would happen , had already taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder . When questioned individually , they give the same replies . Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant , the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi . Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty 's alibi . However , Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later . 
 Geetha arrests Georgekutty and family and Sahadevan uses brute force to beat the truth out of them . Eventually , Anu gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried . After digging the compost pit , they find the carcass of a calf , indicating that Georgekutty had moved the body . Anu reports to the media and complains against Sahadevan . The constable is suspended and Geetha resigns from her post . 
 Later , Geetha and Prabhakar ( Siddique ) meet Georgekutty to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior . Prabhakar asks Georgekutty if he can tell them about their son . Georgekutty then reveals indirectly that his family has committed a crime . Now in remand , Georgekutty signs a register at the newly constructed local police station . As he leaves , a flashback shows him leaving the incomplete police station with a shovel in hand , indicating that he has hidden Varun 's body in the foundations of the police station itself .

 In July 2013 , it was reported that Jeethu Joseph will be directing a film titled My Family with Mohanlal in the lead . In August 2013 , Jeethu clarified that the film was titled Drishyam . A thread similar to that of Drishyam has been with the director since the early 1990s . He was inspired by a conversation he had overheard about the plight of two families involved in a legal battle . Jeethu had penned the story of Drishyam even before Memories ( 2013 ) . He says , " I started working on the subject some two years back . But I wanted to stick to the planned order and hence postponed the project till I finished Memories " . The script was initially planned to be filmed by another director but since that director could not find a producer , Jeethu took back the script and decided to direct it himself . Drishyam contrasts from the director 's previous films . He says , " Different films require different treatment . I toiled hard while filming Memories as the film was full of twists and turns and the handling of the subject mattered a lot . But Drishyam is a complete script @-@ oriented film that does not require any special effort . We shot the film sticking completely to the script , and the shooting was completed effortlessly . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Jeethu had initially approached Mammootty to play the lead , but he was unable to commit and asked Jeethu to proceed with the film with another actor . According to the director , Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film . The director , in an interview with The New Indian Express , stated that he wrote the screenplay with Mohanlal in mind and that the character was tailor @-@ made for Mohanlal . He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed . 
 Kalabhavan Shajon , who previously worked in the industry as a comedian and the sidekick of the lead actors , was chosen for the main antagonistic role . The director stated , " I had two @-@ three actors in mind , but at last decided to pick Shajon . I was very clear that I did not want anyone who has played negative characters so far to do the role . Shajon was a total revelation . " Roshan Basheer , who debuted through Plus Two ( 2010 ) , was chosen after conducting a screen test . Prithviraj was rumored to play a cameo role , though this was denied by Jeethu . Asha Sarath was later signed for the role of a police officer . Child actors Ansiba Hassan and Esther Anil , along with Siddique , Irshad , <unk> and <unk> <unk> were also cast to play major supporting roles .

 A reviewer from The Hindu noted , " The film takes off as a typical family drama . The first half of the film is intentionally slow @-@ paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty . This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres . The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold from the end of the first half . The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family , despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop , stands its ground even as the law takes its course . " When asked whether this change in narrative style post @-@ interval was intentional , Jeethu replied : " I really don 't understand when people say the first half lacked pace . A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig @-@ zag away , capturing all the ups and downs of our lives . Right from the start if you accelerate the pace , sooner or later , the story @-@ telling will lose its steam . " 
 When asked whether he had kicked off a new genre in Malayalam — family thriller , a genre which combines the elements of a family drama and thriller , Jeethu replied , " I still believe it belongs to the genre ' drama ' , not a thriller . " He also stated in another interview , " We usually brand a film as a thriller , simply because there is some mystery in the narrative or the story unfolds through an investigation . But I don 't subscribe to this . Although there are some twists in the tale and some suspense as well , Drishyam is essentially the story of a family . " 
 The film has also been said to be inspired by The Devotion of Suspect X , a Japanese novel written by Keigo <unk> . Ekta Kapoor , who had purchased the Hindi movie rights of the novel , sent a legal notice to the makers of the film . However , the director clarified , " After Ekta 's legal team sent us the letter , I watched the Japanese film , Suspect X , which is an adaptation of the Japanese novel . There could be similarities between my film and that Japanese film , but my film is neither an adaptation nor a copy . The Japanese film is also about a murder cover @-@ up and hence the allegation . Similarities are quite common in the works of creators and that shouldn 't be made into an issue . " Rashomon ( 1950 ) was also cited as an inspiration for the film . 
 The film was criticised for the use of some " sexist dialogues " in the first half which were playing to a certain " new generation " audience . Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film , " it is such banter , which we often dismiss with a laugh , that helps perpetuate rape culture . " When asked about this , the director replied , " I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives . I don 't want to elaborate , but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences . Yes , frankly , I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes . But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval . " 
 There were also allegations that Drishyam might provoke murder . Additional Director General of Police ( <unk> ) <unk> claimed that two people accused of murdering a woman from Nilambur in February 2014 admitted that their methods for disposing of the victim 's body and mobile phone SIM card were influenced by the film . The murder of a young girl in <unk> by her father and his mistress was also said to be influenced by Drishyam .

The case was dismissed in March 2015 as it was proved that Jeethu had written the script in 2011 .

 Sify 's reviewer rated the film as " Excellent " and stated , " It is not often that you sit in a theatre with bated breath , never wanting to miss a moment of the film on screen .

 Unni R. Nair noted in his review for <unk> , " The care with which the script is done , the finesse with which the direction part is executed and the characterization and performance plus the thoughtful placing of the songs makes Drishyam worth real appreciation . That the film has almost <unk> ' filmy ' humour is also worth noting . It 's the logical manner in which the story unfolds and the very convincing manner in which the characters behave makes it impressive . " The critic rated the film three in a scale of five . IndiaGlitz 's reviewer rated the film 8 / 10 and stated , " Drishyam is undoubtedly <unk> with exceptional story telling combined with bravura performances . An undoubtedly exceptional film as far the content is concerned , the movie is a must watch for all the audiences of family and thriller movies . " In contrast , Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times wrote , " Scripted more or less in a convincing manner and mounted with finesse , writer @-@ director Joseph fleshes out his characters . However , Drishyam often seems like a radio play , long dialogues mar its cinematic qualities , and like many other <unk> , Joseph too does not know where to end his film . Cinema need not be so explanatory ; certainly this is not how contemporary movies are made .

 = = Early life = = 
 Waylon Arnold Jennings was born on June 15 , 1937 , on the J.W. Bittner farm , near Littlefield , Texas . He was the son of Lorene Beatrice ( née Shipley ) and William Albert Jennings . The Jennings family line descended from Irish and Black @-@ Dutch . Meanwhile , the Shipley family moved from Tennessee and settled in Texas . The Shipley line descended from Cherokee and Comanche families . 
 The name on his birth certificate was Wayland , meaning land by the highway . His name was changed after a Baptist preacher visited Jennings 's parents and congratulated his mother for naming him after the Wayland Baptist University in Plainview , Texas . Lorene Jennings , who had been unaware of the college , changed the spelling to Waylon . Jennings later expressed in his autobiography , " I didn 't like Waylon . It sounded corny and hillbilly , but it 's been good to me , and I 'm pretty well at peace with it right now . " 
 After working as a laborer on the Bittner farm , Jennings 's father moved the family to Littlefield and established a retail creamery . When Jennings was eight , his mother taught him to play guitar with the tune " Thirty Pieces of Silver " . Jennings used to practice with his relatives ' guitars , until his mother bought him a used Stella , and later ordered a Harmony Patrician . Early influences were Bob Wills , Floyd Tillman , Ernest Tubb , Hank Williams , Carl Smith , and Elvis Presley . 
 Beginning at family gatherings , Jennings advanced to perform at the Youth Center with Anthony Bonanno , followed by appearances at the local Jaycees and Lions Clubs . He won a talent show at Channel 13 , in Lubbock , singing " Hey Joe " . He later made frequent performances at the Palace Theater in Littlefield , during local talent night .

 = = = Beginnings in music = = = 
 The 12 @-@ year @-@ old Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield , Texas . Owner J.B. McShan , along with Emil Macha , recorded Jennings 's performance . McShan liked his style and hired him for a weekly 30 @-@ minute program . Following this successful introduction , Jennings formed his own band . He asked Macha to play bass for him , and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form The Texas Longhorns . The style of the band , a mixture of Country and Western and Bluegrass music , was often not well received . 
 At age 16 , after several disciplinary infractions , tenth @-@ grader Jennings was convinced to drop out of high school by the superintendent . Upon leaving school , he worked for his father in the produce store , also taking temporary jobs . Jennings felt that music , his favorite activity , would turn into his career . The next year , Jennings and The Texas Longhorns recorded a demo of the songs " Stranger in My Home " and " There 'll Be a New Day " at <unk> radio in Lubbock . Meanwhile , he drove a truck for the Thomas Land Lumber Company , and a concrete truck for the Roberts Lumber Company . Tired of the owner , and after a minor driving accident , Jennings quit . Other local musicians and he often performed at Country radio station KDAV ; during this , he met Buddy Holly at a Lubbock restaurant . Holly and he became friends , often meeting during local shows . Jennings also attended Holly 's performances on KDAV 's Sunday Party . 
 In addition to performing on air for KVOW , Jennings started to work as a DJ in 1956 , and moved to Lubbock . His program ran for six hours , from 4 : 00 in the afternoon to 10 : 00 in the evening . Jennings played two hours of Country classics , two of current Country , and two of mixed recordings . During those final two hours , Jennings played artists such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard . The owner reprimanded him each time he aired the recordings , and when he then played two Richard records in a row , the owner fired him . 
 During his time at KVOW , Jennings was visited by DJ Sky Corbin , who worked at <unk> in Levelland . Corbin was impressed with his voice , and decided to visit Jennings at the station after hearing him sing a jingle to the tune of Hank Snow 's " I 'm Moving On " . Jennings expressed his economic struggle to live on a US $ 50 @-@ a @-@ week salary . Corbin invited Jennings to visit <unk> , where he eventually took Corbin 's then @-@ vacated position . The Corbin family later purchased KLLL , in Lubbock . They changed the format of the station to Country , becoming the main competition of KDAV . The <unk> hired Jennings as the station 's first DJ . 
 Jennings produced commercials and created jingles with the rest of the DJs . As their popularity increased , the DJs made public appearances . Jennings 's events included live performances . During one performance , Buddy 's father , <unk> Holley , approached them with his son 's latest record , and requested them to play it at the station . <unk> mentioned his son 's intention to start producing artists himself , and Corbin recommended Jennings . After returning from his England tour , Buddy Holly visited KLLL . 
 Holly took Jennings as his first artist . He outfitted him with new clothes , and worked with him to improve his image . He arranged a session for Jennings at Norman Petty 's recording studios in Clovis , New Mexico . On September 10 , Jennings recorded the songs " Jole Blon " and " When Sin Stops ( Love Begins ) " with Holly and Tommy Allsup on guitars with saxophonist King Curtis . Holly then hired Jennings to play electric bass for him during his " Winter Dance Party Tour " . 
 = = = Winter Dance Party Tour = = = 
 Before the tour , Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock , and visited Jennings ' radio station in December 1958 . Jennings and Sky Corbin performed the hand claps to Holly 's tune " You 're the One " . Jennings and Holly soon left for New York City , arriving on January 15 , 1959 . Jennings stayed at Holly 's apartment by Washington Square Park , on the days prior to a meeting scheduled on the headquarters of the General Artists Corporation , that organized the tour . They later took a train to Chicago to join the band . 
 The Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , on January 23 , 1959 . The amount of travel created logistical problems , as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance . Adding to the problem , the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather , with dire consequences . Holly 's drummer Carl Bunch suffered frostbite to his toes ( while aboard the bus ) and was hospitalized , so Buddy Holly made the decision to find another means of transportation . Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake , Iowa , Holly chartered a four @-@ seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane at Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City , Iowa , for himself , Jennings , and Allsup , to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead , Minnesota . Following the Clear Lake show ( which ended around midnight ) , Tommy Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens , while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson , who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size . When Holly learned that his band mates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly , a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued , and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow : Holly jokingly told Jennings , " Well , I hope your ol ' bus freezes up ! " Jennings jokingly replied , " Well , I hope your ol ' plane crashes ! " Less than an hour and a half later , shortly after 1 : 00 AM on February 3 , 1959 ( later known as The Day the Music Died ) , Holly 's charter plane crashed at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City , Iowa , instantly killing all on board . 
 Later that morning , Jennings ' family heard on the radio that " Buddy Holly and his band had been killed . " After calling his family , Jennings called Sky Corbin at KLLL from Fargo to say that he was alive . The General Artists Corporation promised to pay a first @-@ class ticket for Jennings and the band to assist Holly 's funeral in Lubbock , in exchange for them playing that night in Moorhead . After the first show , they were initially denied their payment by the venue , but after Jennings 's persistence , they were paid . The flights were never paid , and Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks , featuring Jennings as the lead singer . They were paid less than half of the original agreed salary , and upon returning to New York , Jennings put Holly 's guitar and amplifier in a locker in Grand Central Terminal and mailed the keys to Maria Elena Holly . Then , he returned to Lubbock . 
 For decades afterward , Jennings repeatedly admitted that he felt responsible for the crash that killed Buddy Holly . This sense of guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of Jennings ' career . The day of the flight was later known as the Day the Music Died . Jennings sang The Stage , which is a touching tribute to the Day the Music Died . He recreates the concert performers on February 2 , 1959 , in order at the Surf Ballroom , starting with Eddie Cochran , then Ritchie Valens , the Big Bopper and , finally , Buddy Holly . This was the concert that preceded the infamous plane crash . The Stage can be found on the Surf Ballroom Winter Dance Party CD . 
 " Jole Blon " was released on Brunswick in March 1959 with limited success . Now unemployed , he returned to KLLL . Deeply affected by the death of Buddy Holly , Jennings ' performance at the station worsened . He left the station after he was denied a raise , and later worked briefly for the competition , KDAV .

 Due to Maxine 's father 's illness , Jennings had to shuttle between Arizona and Texas . While his family lived back in Littlefield , Jennings found a job briefly at <unk> in Odessa , Texas . He moved with his family to Coolidge , Arizona , where his wife 's sister lived . He found a job performing at the Galloping Goose bar , where he was heard by Earl Perrin , who offered him a spot on <unk> . Jennings also played during the intermission at drive @-@ in theaters and in bars . After a successful performance at the Cross Keys Club in Phoenix , Arizona , he was approached by contractors who were building a club for Jimmy D. <unk> , called JD 's . <unk> employed Jennings as his main artist and designed the club around his act . 
 He formed his backing band , The Waylors , with bassist Paul Foster , guitarist Jerry Gropp , and drummer Richie Albright . Jennings and his band performed at the newly opened nightspot in Scottsdale , where they soon earned a strong local fanbase . At JD 's , Jennings developed his " rock tempered " style of country music that defined him on his later career . 
 In 1961 , Jennings signed a recording contract with Trend Records , and experienced moderate success with his single , " Another Blue Day " . His friend , Don Bowman , took demos of Jennings to Jerry Moss , who at the time was starting A & M Records with associate Herb Alpert . On July 9 , 1963 , Jennings signed a contract with A & M that granted him 5 % of record sales . At A & M , he recorded " Love Denied " backed with " Rave On " , and " Four Strong Winds " backed with " Just to Satisfy You " . He followed up by recording demos of " The Twelfth of Never " , " Kisses Sweeter than Wine " , and " Don 't Think Twice , It 's All Right " , and also produced the single " Sing the Girls a Song , Bill " , backed with " The Race Is On " . The singles were released between April and October 1964 . 
 His records had little success , because A & M 's main releases were folk music rather than Country . He had a few hits on local radio in Phoenix , with " Four Strong Winds " and " Just To Satisfy You " ( co @-@ written with Bowman ) . Meanwhile , he recorded an album on BAT records , called JD 's . After 500 copies were sold at the club , another 500 copies were pressed by the Sounds label . He also played lead guitar for Patsy Montana on a 1964 album . 
 Singer Bobby Bare heard Jennings 's " Just to Satisfy You " on his car radio while passing through Phoenix , eventually recording it and " Four Strong Winds " . After stopping in Phoenix to attend to a Jennings performance at JD 's , while driving to Las Vegas , Bare stopped and called Chet Atkins in Nashville , suggesting that he needed to sign Jennings . 
 When he was made aware of the new deal , Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD 's . He then went to get the advice of his friend , RCA artist Willie Nelson , who had gone to see one of Waylon 's shows . When Willie and Waylon met , after talking about the possibilities and considering Waylon 's profits at the club , Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville . 
 Nonetheless , Jennings decided to accept the offer , and asked Herb Alpert to release him from his contract with A & M. Alpert agreed , though later A & M would compile all of Jennings 's singles and unreleased material the label had and release it as Don 't Think Twice . Atkins formally signed Jennings to RCA Victor in 1965 . On August 21 , Jennings made his first appearance on the Billboard 's Hot Country Songs chart with " That 's the Chance I 'll Have to Take " . 
 In 1966 , Jennings released his debut album for RCA Folk @-@ Country , followed by Leavin ' Town and Nashville Rebel . Leavin ' Town resulted in significant chart success as the first two singles " Anita , You 're Dreaming " and " Time to Burn Again " both peaked at no . 17 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart . The album 's third single , a cover of Gordon Lightfoot 's " ( That 's What You Get ) For Lovin ' Me " , became Jennings 's first top 10 single , peaking at no . 9 . Nashville Rebel was the soundtrack to an independent film of the same name , starring Jennings . The single " Green River " charted on Billboard country singles at # 11 . In 1967 , Jennings released a hit single , " Just to Satisfy You " . During an interview , Jennings remarked that the song was a " pretty good example " of the influence of his work with Buddy Holly and rockabilly music . Jennings produced <unk> albums that sold well , including Just to Satisfy You , that included the same @-@ named hit single of 1967 . Jennings 's singles enjoyed success . " The <unk> ' Kind " peaked at number eight on Billboard 's Hot Country Singles in 1967 , while " Only Daddy That 'll Walk the Line " hit number two the following year . In 1969 , his collaboration with The <unk> on the single " MacArthur Park " earned a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group . His single " Brown Eyed Handsome Man " reached number three at the Hot Country Singles chart by the end of the year . 
 During this time , Jennings rented an apartment in Nashville with singer Johnny Cash . Jennings and Cash were both managed by " Lucky " Moeller 's booking agency Moeller Talent , Inc . The tours organized by the agency were unproductive , with the artists being booked to venues located far from each other in close dates . After paying for the accommodation and travel expenditures , Jennings 's profits were reduced , with him frequently requesting advances from the agency or RCA Records to play the next venue . While playing 300 days on the road , Jennings 's debt increased along with his consumption of amphetamines , as he believed himself to be trapped on the circuit . 
 In 1972 , Jennings released Ladies Love Outlaws . The single that headlined the album became a hit for Jennings , and was his first approach to Outlaw Country . Jennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band , The Waylors , a practice that was not encouraged by powerful Nashville producers . Over time , however , Jennings felt limited by the Nashville sound 's lack of artistic freedom . The music style publicized as " <unk> " was characterized by orchestral arrangements , and the absence of traditional Country music instruments . The producers did not let Jennings play his own guitar or select material to record . 
 = = = Outlaw Country = = = 
 In an interview , Jennings recalled the restrictions of the Nashville establishment : " They wouldn 't let you do anything . You had to dress a certain way : you had to do everything a certain way .... They kept trying to destroy me .... I just went about my business and did things my way .... You start messing with my music , I get mean . " By 1972 , after the release of Ladies Love Outlaws , his recording contract was nearing an end . Sick with hepatitis , Jennings was hospitalized . Afflicted by disease , and the music industry , he was considering retirement . Albright visited him and convinced him to continue . Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager . Meanwhile , Jennings requested a US $ 25 @,@ 000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery . The same day he met <unk> , RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US $ 5 @,@ 000 as a bonus for signing a new 5 % royalty deal with RCA , the same terms he had accepted in 1965 . After reviewing with Reshen , he rejected the offer and hired Reshen . 
 Reshen started to renegotiate Jennings 's recording and touring contracts . At a meeting in a Nashville airport , Jennings introduced Reshen to Willie Nelson . By the end of the meeting , Reshen had become Nelson 's manager , as well . Jennings 's new deal gained him a $ 75 @,@ 000 advance and artistic control . Reshen advised Jennings to keep the beard that he had grown in the hospital , to match the image of Outlaw Country . 
 By 1973 , Nelson had returned to music , finding success with Atlantic Records . Now based in Austin , Texas , he had made inroads into the rock and roll press by attracting rock audiences . Atlantic Records was now attempting to sign Jennings , but Nelson 's rise to popularity persuaded RCA to renegotiate with Jennings before losing another potential star . 
 In 1973 , Jennings released Lonesome , On 'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes , the first albums recorded and released under his creative control . The release of these albums heralded a major turning point for Jennings , kicking off his most critically and commercially successful years . More hit albums followed with This Time and The Ramblin ' Man , both released in 1974 . The title tracks of both albums topped the Billboard Country singles chart , with the self @-@ penned " This Time " becoming Jennings 's first no . 1 single . Dreaming My Dreams , released in 1975 , included the no . 1 single " Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way " and was his first album to be certified gold by the RIAA ; it was also the first of his next six consecutive , solo studio albums to be certified gold or higher . In 1976 , Jennings released Are You Ready for the Country , Jennings wanted the record to be produced by Los Angeles producer Ken Mansfield . Although RCA denied the request , Jennings and The Waylors went to Los Angeles and recorded with Mansfield at his expense . After a month , Jennings presented the master tape to Chet Atkins , who decided to release it . The album hit number one on Billboard 's country albums three times the same year , topping the charts for 10 weeks . It was named Country album of the year in 1976 by Record World magazine and it was certified gold by the RIAA . 
 In 1976 , Jennings released the album Wanted ! The Outlaws , recorded with Willie Nelson , Tompall Glaser , and Jessi Colter for RCA . The album was the first Country music album certified platinum . The following year , RCA issued Ol ' Waylon , an album that produced a hit duet with Nelson , " Luckenbach , Texas " . The album Waylon and Willie followed in 1978 , producing the hit single " Mammas Don 't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys " . Jennings released I 've Always Been Crazy , also in 1978 . The same year , at the peak of his success , Jennings began to feel limited by the outlaw movement . Jennings referred to the overexploitation of the image in the song " Don 't You Think This Outlaw Bit Has Done Got Out of Hand ? " , claiming that the movement had become a " self @-@ fulfilling prophecy " . In 1979 , he released Greatest Hits , which was certified gold the same year , and quintuple platinum in 2002 . 
 Also in 1979 , Jennings joined the cast of the CBS series The Dukes of Hazzard as the <unk> , the narrator . The only episode to feature him in person was " Welcome , Waylon Jennings " , during the seventh season . Jennings played himself , presented as an old friend of the Duke family . For the show , he also wrote and sang the theme song " Good Ol ' Boys " , which became the biggest hit of his career . Released as a single in promotion with the show , it became Jennings 's 12th single to reach number one on the Billboard Country Singles chart . It was also a crossover hit , peaking at no . 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 .

 In 1985 , Jennings joined with USA for Africa to record " We Are the World " , but he left the studio because of a dispute over the song 's lyrics that were to be sung in Swahili . Ironically , after Jennings left the session , the idea was dropped at the prompting of Stevie Wonder , who pointed out that Ethiopians did not speak Swahili . By this time , his sales had decreased . After the release of Sweet Mother Texas , Jennings signed with Music Corporation of America . The debut release with the label Will the Wolf Survive ( 1985 ) peaked at number one in Billboard 's Country albums in 1986 .

 Jennings 's music was characterized by his " powerful " singing voice , noted by his " rough @-@ edged quality , " as well as his phrasing and texture . He was also recognized for his " spanky @-@ twang " guitar style . To create his sound , he used a pronounced ' phaser ' effect ( see ' Modulation Effects ' : below ) plus a mixture of thumb and fingers during the rhythmic parts , while using picks for the lead runs . He combined hammer @-@ on and pull @-@ off riffs , with eventual upper @-@ fret double stops and modulation effects . Jennings played a 1953 Fender Telecaster , a used guitar that was a gift from The Waylors . Jennings 's bandmates adorned his guitar with a distinctive leather cover that featured a black background with a white floral work . Jennings further customized it by filing down the frets to lower the strings on the neck to obtain the slapping sound .

The same year , it was announced for September the release of Goin ' Down Rockin ' : The Last Recordings , a set of 12 songs recorded by Jennings and bassist Robby Turner before his death in 2002 . Jennings 's family was reluctant to release any new material because they did not feel comfortable at the time . The songs only featured Jennings and Turner on the bass , while further accompaniment would be added later . Ten years after , Turner completed the recordings with the help of former Waylors . The Jennings family approved the release despite the launch of a new business focused on his estate . Shooter Jennings arranged deals for a clothing line , while also launching a renewed website , and started talks with different producers about the making of a biographical film .

They become a superhero duo , calling themselves " Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl " . Later , Lucy Lawless ( dressed as Xena ) addresses fans at a science fiction convention . Comic Book Guy , who has styled himself as a villain called " The Collector " , kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate . Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready . The Collector takes her to his lair , where he puts her in an aluminized PET film bag for " safekeeping " and imprisons her in a room of other similarly @-@ captured celebrities . Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray in an attempt to free Xena , but they are soon captured as well . The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of " Lucite " . After feigning interest in the villain , Lawless starts clobbering him . The Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace ( which was released a few months before the episode ) and ignites the blades , but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging , he panics and ends up falling into the Lucite . Lawless then flies the children home ( Lisa points out that Xena cannot fly , but Lawless reminds her she 's not Xena , she 's Lucy Lawless ) .

Homer , the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant 's Y2K compliance officer , declares that he fixed all the possible Y2K problems at the plant , including the computers . Unfortunately , Homer forgot to fix his own computer , and in the process sends a virus across the world . Chaos ensues , and widespread looting begins . Krusty 's malfunctioning pacemaker apparently kills him in front of the family . Bart tearfully mourns his hero , but he perks up , after finding a note . The letter in Krusty 's pocket states that a rocket ( codenamed Exodus ) is being populated with humanity 's " best and brightest " , and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on Mars . When they reach the shuttle , Homer fails to bluff his way on board by claiming to be the famous pianist from the film Shine but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as the ship 's designated proofreader . Lisa is only able to take one parent with her , and quickly chooses Marge . Homer and Bart find a second , unguarded rocket and board just before it launches . They quickly notice that the <unk> is filled with such notoriously obnoxious and mediocre celebrities as radio psychologist Dr. Laura , film director Spike Lee , skating champion Tonya Harding , grunge rock singer Courtney Love , politician Ross Perot , actor Tom Arnold , MTV VJ Paulie Shore , and actress / talk show host Rosie O 'Donnell . Although the craft is headed directly for the sun , Homer and Bart eject themselves from the spacecraft and die of explosive decompression .

 " Treehouse of Horror X " was directed by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary , Tim Long and Ron Hauge . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween , 1999 . " I Know What You Diddily @-@ Iddily @-@ Did " was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary . In the DVD commentary for the episode , Cary said that he came up with the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer . " I had just seen the movie and I was like , ' Hey , there you go . ' " he said . While Flanders serves as the segment 's antagonist , the role would originally go to Grampa , who would chase Homer inside a roller disco . While Grampa does not appear in the segment , the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders . Despite serving as writer for the segment , Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series , which never came to fruition . In his absence , the writing staff rewrote the last quarter of the segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf . In order to dispose of Ned Flanders ' corpse , Homer throws his body into Flanders ' house . After he is finished , he says " That 's the end of that chapter " , a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life . " That 's just something that comes up a lot in my life is when no matter if it 's a good or a bad thing , just move on " he said . 
 " Desperately Xeeking Xena " was written by staff writer Long . At the beginning of the segment , Milhouse is seen wearing a plastic smock with a picture of Radioactive Man on it . The scene was based on an experience in Long 's childhood ; " I asked my mom for a Batman costume . And I got a smock that had Batman on it and said ' Batman ' . It was very dispiriting " he said in the episode 's DVD commentary . " Stretch Dude & Clobber Girl " ' s theme song was written by Long and composed by Alf Clausen . During the sequence , Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl are seen assaulting Saddam Hussein , the fifth President of Iraq . According to Long , the writing staff had a " passionate " discussion about whether the duo would be attacking Hussein or Iranian religious leader and politician Ruhollah Khomeini during the sequence . Scully quipped that Hussein was chosen because " he was always asking to be on the show . " The segment features New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless as herself . According to Long , Lawless was very happy with the segment 's script . She was especially fond of the speech she gives to The Collector , in which she mentions that she was very tall as an adolescent . Lawless was directed by Scully , who commented that she was " terrific " . In an interview with the Hungarian online newspaper Origo , Lawless said that her part in the episode was the best experience she had guest @-@ starring for a show . " It was really funny when the Comic Book Guy kidnapped me " , she said . 
 " Life 's a Glitch , Then You Die " was written and conceived by Hauge . In DVD commentary for the episode , Hauge stated that , when writing the segment , he knew it would not age well . " I was aware of it at the time , that it wouldn 't last forever " he said , " But I wanted to capture that moment . " According to director Michels , the rocket which transported the " best and brightest " of the population was drawn to resemble a <unk> . The Simpsons ' staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket , and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor Tom Arnold . In the episode , Arnold is depicted as an annoying , " not @-@ so @-@ great " celebrity . Although he was mostly in on the joke , Arnold did " bust [ the staff 's ] chops " a little bit when recording his lines . " He would say a line and then they 'd yell cut and he 'd look over at me and take a shot at me " Hauge said . Still , Hauge found Arnold 's performance " fantastic " and Scully said that he was a " good sport " . The segment also features television personality Dick Clark as himself . A few months after the episode aired , Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio . According to Hauge , Clark said that the episode gave the " biggest response " he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done . " After the career that he had in television for so long , just to give him a highlight was a highlight for me " Hauge said in the episode 's DVD commentary . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The opening segment , which shows Kang and Kodos attempting to entertain an audience of aliens , was " born out of [ The Simpsons ' staff 's ] love " of comedy teams like Martin and Lewis and the Smothers Brothers . The plot of " I Know What You Diddily @-@ Iddily @-@ Did " is based on the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer . At the beginning of the segment , the Simpsons are seen escaping from a group of vampires . Holding a package of Super Sugar Crisp cereal , Homer starts singing a jingle about the cereal . Super Sugar Crisp is a reference to the breakfast cereal Golden Crisp , while the jingle Homer sings references " Can 't get enough of that Golden Crisp " , a jingle sung by Golden Crisp 's mascot Sugar Bear during advertisements for the cereal . According to Scully , the series ' staff had a lot of trouble clearing the song for the episode . " Apparently , they didn 't want the tune [ ... ] used in this context " he said in the episode 's DVD commentary . 
 Although there is a fictional Marvel Comics character called Collector , Long did not base The Collector on him . While carrying Lawless with an electromagnet , The Collector says " Care for a Rolo , sweet Xena ? " The reference was included because the writing staff were given free <unk> at the time . In The Collector 's lair , several celebrities are seen stored in aluminized PET film bags . Some of these include The Simpsons ' creator Matt Groening and Tom Baker , who portrayed the fourth incarnation of the doctor in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who . " There are several Doctor Who actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with " Hauge explained in the episode 's DVD commentary . Other captives include actress Yasmine Bleeth , Gilligan from the series Gilligan 's Island and Spock and Seven of Nine from Star Trek . The segment also features the series ' first reference to Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace , when The Collector uses a mint @-@ condition of Darth Maul 's double @-@ bladed lightsaber . Because the episode was written before the film 's release , the writers did not know " how bad it was gonna be " , in their view , and therefore did not include any " obligatory shot " at the film . As he dies , The Collector poses as Lorne Greene 's character Commander Adama in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica . Coincidentally , Lawless would go on have a recurring role on the re @-@ imagined Battlestar Galactica . 
 Hauge based " Life 's a Glitch , Then You Die " on the hysteria involving Y2K , a digital problem that occurred the night into January 1 , 2000 . Humans escaping an <unk> Earth in rockets is a reference to the 1951 film When Worlds Collide . In a scene in the segment , several celebrities , including actor Mel Gibson and former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire , can be seen waiting in line for the first rocket . They both guest starred as themselves in two earlier episodes from the season . Others in the line include businessman Bill Gates , director Ron Howard , former President Jimmy Carter , scientist Stephen Hawking , rock musician Paul McCartney , basketball player Michael Jordan and ice skater Michelle Kwan . Those on the doomed ship include actors Pauly Shore and Tom Arnold , politicians Ross Perot and Dan Quayle , singer Courtney Love , TV presenters Rosie O 'Donnell and Laura <unk> , film director Spike Lee , reverend Al Sharpton and figure skater Tonya Harding .

 Following its broadcast , " Treehouse of Horror X " received positive reviews from critics . In his review of The Simpsons : The Complete Eleventh Season , Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote " Even in the series ’ <unk> seasons , the staff always seems to come up with a good Halloween episode " , and that " Treehouse of Horror X " " continues that trend " . Of the three segments , Jacobson found " Life 's a Glitch , Then You Die " to be the weakest . He wrote " [ ... ] other than a good ending , it simply doesn ’ t have a lot going for it " and added that it is the most dated of the three . He continued , " ' Diddily ' offers a fun horror spoof , and ' Xena ' is a terrific superhero bit with plenty of cleverness . " DVD Talk 's Ian Jane gave the episode a positive review as well . Considering it to be one of the season 's best episodes , Jane wrote " This one , like so many that have come before and since , is a great blend of horror movie parody and Halloween themed fun in Springfield . " In 2007 , Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal included " Desperately Xeeking Xena " in a list called " The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes " . Although he disliked Bart and Lisa 's part in the segment , Patrick wrote that it " earns its stripes by being perhaps Comic Book Guy 's finest hour " . He also praised the segment 's references , as well as Lawless ' line " A wizard did it " , a phrase used to explain continuity errors . In 2009 , The Collector 's marriage proposal to Lawless was included in " Line @-@ O @-@ Rama : Comic Book Guy " , a compilation of what IGN considers to be The Comic Book Guy 's best lines . 
 = Medal of Honor = 
 The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest military honor , awarded for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty . The medal is awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress to U.S. military personnel only . There are three versions of the medal , one for the Army , one for the Navy , and one for the Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version . 
 The Medal of Honor was created as a Navy version in 1861 named the " Medal of Valor " , and an Army version of the medal named the " Medal of Honor " was established in 1862 to give recognition to men who distinguished themselves " conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity " in combat with an enemy of the United States . Because the medal is presented " in the name of Congress " , it is often referred to as the " Congressional Medal of Honor " . However , the official name is the " Medal of Honor " , which began with the U.S. Army 's version . Within United States Code the medal is referred to as the " Medal of Honor " , and less frequently as " Congressional Medal of Honor " . 
 The Medal of Honor is usually presented by the President in a formal ceremony at the White House , intended to represent the gratitude of the American people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3 @,@ 515 Medals of Honor awarded to the nation 's soldiers , sailors , airmen , Marines , and Coast Guardsmen since the decoration 's creation , with just less than half of them awarded for actions during the four years of the American Civil War . 
 In 1990 , Congress designated March 25 annually as " National Medal of Honor Day " . Due to its prestige and status , the Medal of Honor is afforded special protection under U.S. law against any unauthorized adornment , sale , or manufacture , which includes any associated ribbon or badge .

 1780 : The Fidelity Medallion was a small medal worn on a chain around the neck , similar to a religious medal , that was awarded only to three militiamen from New York state , for the capture of John André , a British officer and spy connected directly to General Benedict Arnold ( American and British general @-@ 1780 ) during the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) . The capture saved the fort of West Point from the British Army . 
 1782 : Badge of Military Merit : The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by George Washington when he issued a field order on August 7 , 1782 , for a Badge of Military Merit to recognize those members of the Continental Army who performed " any singular meritorious action " . This decoration is America 's first combat decoration and was preceded only by the Fidelity Medallion , the Congressional medal for Henry Lee awarded in September 1779 in recognition of his attack on the British at Paulus Hook , the Congressional medal for General Horatio Gates awarded in November 1777 in recognition of his victory over the British at Saratoga , and the Congressional medal for George Washington awarded in March 1776 . Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the American Revolutionary War , the concept of a military award for individual gallantry by members of the U.S. Armed Forces had been established . 
 1847 : Certificate of Merit : After the outbreak of the Mexican @-@ American War ( 1846 – 1848 ) a Certificate of Merit ( Meritorious Service Citation Certificate ) was established by Act of Congress on March 3 , 1847 " to any private soldier who had distinguished himself by gallantry performed in the presence of the enemy " . 539 Certificates were approved for this period . The certificate was discontinued and reintroduced in 1876 effective from June 22 , 1874 to February 10 , 1892 when it was awarded for extraordinary gallantry by private soldiers in the presence of the enemy . From February 11 , 1892 through July 9 , 1918 ( Certificate of Merit disestablished ) it could be awarded to members of the Army for distinguished service in combat or noncombat ; from January 11 , 1905 through July 9 , 1918 the certificate was granted medal status as the Certificate of Merit Medal ( first awarded to a soldier who was awarded the Certificate of Merit for combat action on August 13 , 1898 ) . This medal was later replaced by the Army Distinguished Service Medal which was established on January 2 , 1918 ( the Navy Distinguished Service Medal was established in 1919 ) . Those Army members who held the Distinguished Service Medal in place of the Certificate of Merit could apply for the Army Distinguished Service Cross ( established 1918 ) effective March 5 , 1934 .

 There were no military awards or medals at the beginning of the Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) except for the Certificate of Merit which was awarded for the Mexican @-@ American War . In the fall of 1861 , a proposal for a battlefield decoration for valor was submitted to Winfield Scott , the general @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , by Lt. Colonel Edward D. Townsend , an assistant adjutant at the War Department and Scott 's chief of staff . Scott however , was strictly against medals being awarded which was the European tradition . After Scott retired in October 1861 , the Secretary of the Navy , Gideon Welles , adopted the idea of a decoration to recognize and honor distinguished naval service . On December 9 , U.S. Senator ( Iowa ) James W. Grimes , Chairman on the Committee on Naval Affairs , proposed Public Resolution Number 82 ( Bill 82 : 37th Congress , Second Session , 12 Stat . 329 ) " to promote the efficiency of the Navy " which included a provision for a Navy Medal of Valor which was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on December 21 , 1861 ( Medal of Honor had been established for the Navy ) , " to be bestowed upon such petty officers , seamen , <unk> , and marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other seamen @-@ like qualities during the present war . " Secretary Wells directed the Philadelphia Mint to design the new military decoration . On May 15 , 1862 , the United States Navy Department ordered 175 medals ( $ 1 @.@ 85 each ) with the words " Personal Valor " on the back from the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . 
 = = = Medal of Honor = = = 
 Senator Henry Wilson , the chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs , introduced a resolution on February 15 , 1862 for an Army Medal of Honor . The resolution ( 37th Congress , Second Session , 12 Stat . 623 ) was approved by Congress and signed into law on July 12 , 1862 ( " Medals of Honor " were established for enlisted men of the Army ) . This measure provided for awarding a medal of honor " to such non @-@ commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other soldier @-@ like qualities during the present insurrection . " During the war , Townsend would have some medals delivered to some recipients with a letter requesting acknowledgement of the " Medal of Honor " . The letter written and signed by Townsend on behalf of the Secretary of War , stated that the resolution was " to provide for the presentation of medals of honor to the enlisted men of the army and volunteer forces who have distinguished or may distinguish themselves in battle during the present rebellion . " By mid @-@ November the War Department contracted with Philadelphia silversmith William Wilson and Son , who had been responsible for the Navy design , to prepare 2 @,@ 000 Army medals ( $ 2 @.@ 00 each ) to be cast at the mint . The Army version had " The Congress to " written on the back of the medal . Both versions were made of copper and coated with bronze , which " gave them a reddish tint " . 
 1863 : Congress made the Medal of Honor a permanent decoration . On March 3 , Medals of Honor were authorized for officers of the Army ( 37th Congress , Third Session , 12 Stat . 751 ) . The Secretary of War first presented the Medal of Honor to six Union Army volunteers on March 25 , 1863 in his office . 
 1890 : On April 23 , the Medal of Honor Legion is established in Washington , D.C. 
 1896 : The ribbon of the Army version Medal of Honor was redesigned with all stripes being vertical . 
 1904 : The planchet of the Army version of the Medal of Honor was redesigned by General George Lewis Gillespie . The purpose of the redesign was to help distinguish the Medal of Honor from other medals , including a medal issued by the Grand Army of the Republic . 
 1915 : On March 3 , Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard officers became eligible for the Medal of Honor . 
 1963 : A separate Coast Guard medal was authorized in 1963 , but not yet designed or awarded . 
 1965 : A separate design for a version of the medal for the U.S. Air Force was created in 1956 , authorized in 1960 , and officially adopted on April 14 , 1965 . Previously , members of the U.S. Army Air Corps , U.S. Army Air Forces , and the U.S. Air Force received the Army version of the medal . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 There are three versions of the Medal of Honor , one for each of the military departments of the Department of Defense : Army , Navy , and Air Force . Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version . Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red brass alloys with some gold plating , enamel , and bronze pieces . The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which would require the Medal of Honor to be made with 90 % gold , the same composition as the lesser @-@ known Congressional Gold Medal , but the measure was dropped .

 Since 1944 , the Medal of Honor has been attached to a light blue colored moiré silk Neck ribbon that is 1 3 ⁄ 16 in ( 30 mm ) in width and 21 3 ⁄ 4 in ( 550 mm ) in length . The center of the ribbon displays thirteen white stars in the form of three chevron . Both the top and middle chevrons are made up of 5 stars , with the bottom chevron made of 3 stars . The Medal of Honor is one of only two United States military awards suspended from a neck ribbon . The other , the Commander 's Degree of the Legion of Merit , and is usually awarded to individuals serving foreign governments . 
 On May 2 , 1896 , Congress authorized a " ribbon to be worn with the medal and [ a ] rosette or knot to be worn in lieu of the medal . " The service ribbon is light blue with five white stars in the form of an " M " . It is placed first in the top position in the order of precedence and is worn for situations other than full @-@ dress military uniform . The lapel button is a 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) , six @-@ sided light blue <unk> rosette with thirteen white stars and may be worn on appropriate civilian clothing on the left lapel . 
 In 2011 , Department of Defense instructions were amended to read " for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify award of the Medal of Honor , the individual receiving the subsequent award is authorized to wear an additional Medal of Honor ribbon and / or a ' V ' device on the Medal of Honor suspension ribbon " ( the " V " device is a 1 ⁄ 4 @-@ inch ( 6 @.@ 4 mm ) high bronze miniature letter " V " with serifs that denotes valor ) . The Medal of Honor was the only decoration authorized the use of the " V " device to designate subsequent awards in such fashion . Nineteen individuals , all now deceased , were double Medal of Honor recipients . This was discontinued in July 2014 , and changed to read " A separate MOH is presented to an individual for each succeeding act that justified award . " As of 2014 , no devices are authorized for the Medal of Honor . 
 = = = Historical versions = = = 
 The Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance over time . The upside @-@ down star design of the Navy version 's pendant adopted in early 1862 has not changed since its inception . The Army 1862 version followed and was identical to the Navy version except an eagle perched atop cannons was used instead of an anchor to connect the pendant to the suspension ribbon . In 1896 , the Army version changed the ribbon 's design and colors due to misuse and imitation by nonmilitary organizations . In 1904 , the Army " Gillespie " version introduced a smaller redesigned star and the ribbon was changed to the light blue pattern with white stars seen today . In 1913 , the Navy version adopted the same ribbon pattern . 
 After World War I , the Navy decided to separate the Medal of Honor into two versions , one for combat and one for non @-@ combat . The original upside @-@ down star was designated as the non @-@ combat version and a new pattern of the medal pendant , in cross form , was designed by the Tiffany Company in 1919 . It was to be presented to a sailor or Marine who " in action involving actual conflict with the enemy , distinguish [ es ] himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " Despite the " actual conflict " guidelines — the Tiffany Cross was awarded to Navy CDR ( later <unk> ) Richard E. Byrd and Floyd Bennett for arctic exploration . The Tiffany Cross itself was not popular . In 1942 , the Navy returned to using only the original 1862 inverted 5 @-@ point star design , and ceased issuing the award for non @-@ combat action . 
 In 1944 , the suspension ribbons for both the Army and Navy version were replaced with the now familiar neck ribbon . When the Air Force version was designed in 1956 , it incorporated similar elements and design from the Army version . It used a larger star with the Statue of Liberty image in place of Minerva on the medal and changed the connecting device from an eagle to an heraldic thunderbolt flanked with wings as found on the service seal .

 On October 23 , 2002 , Pub.L. 107 – 248 was enacted , modifying 36 U.S.C. § 903 , authorizing a Medal of Honor flag to be presented to recipients of the decoration . 
 The flag was based on a concept by retired Army Special Forces First Sergeant Bill Kendall of Jefferson , Iowa , who designed a flag to honor Medal of Honor recipient Captain Darrell Lindsey , a B @-@ 26 pilot from Jefferson who was killed in World War II . Kendall 's design of a light blue field emblazoned with 13 white five @-@ pointed stars was nearly identical to that of Sarah LeClerc 's of the Institute of Heraldry . LeClerc 's design , ultimately accepted as the official flag , does not include the words " Medal of Honor " and is fringed in gold . The color of the field and the 13 white stars , arranged in the form of a three bar chevron , consisting of two chevrons of five stars and one chevron of three stars , emulate the suspension ribbon of the Medal of Honor . The flag has no set proportions . 
 The first Medal of Honor recipient to receive the official Medal of Honor flag was Sergeant First Class Paul R. Smith . The Medal of Honor with the flag was presented by President George W. Bush to his family during a ceremony at the White House on April 4 , 2005 . 
 A special Medal of Honor Flag presentation ceremony was held for over 60 living Medal of Honor recipients on board the USS Constitution on September 30 , 2006 .

 There are two distinct protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor . The first and most common is nomination and approval through the chain of command of the service member . The second method is nomination by a member of the U.S. Congress , generally at the request of a constituent . In both cases , if the proposal is outside the time limits for the recommendation , approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress . The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of , and in the name of , the Congress . Since 1980 , nearly all Medal of Honor recipients or in the case of posthumous awards , the next of kin have been personally decorated by the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . Since 1941 , more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously . 
 = = = Evolution of criteria = = = 
 1800s : Several months after President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law on December 21 , 1861 for a Navy medal of honor , a similar resolution was passed in July 1862 for an Army version of the medal . Six Union Army soldiers who hijacked a Confederate locomotive named The General in 1862 , were the first Medal of Honor recipients ; James J. Andrews , a civilian , led the raid . He was caught and hanged as a Union spy , but was a civilian and not eligible to receive the medal . Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with " saving the flag " ( and country ) , not just for patriotic reasons , but because the U.S. flag was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time . Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War , some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict . 
 1900s : Early in the twentieth century , the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery . For instance , in 1901 , John Henry Helms aboard the USS Chicago ( CA @-@ 14 ) was awarded the medal for saving the ship 's cook from drowning . Seven sailors aboard the USS Iowa ( BB @-@ 4 ) were awarded the medal after the ship 's boiler exploded on January 25 , 1904 . Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett were awarded the medal — combat ( " Tiffany " ) version despite the existence then of a non @-@ combat form of the Navy medal — for the 1926 flight they claim reached the North Pole . And Admiral Thomas J. Ryan was awarded the medal for saving a woman from the burning Grand Hotel in Yokohama , Japan , following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake . Between 1919 and 1942 , the Navy issued two separate versions of the Medal of Honor , one for acts related to combat and one for non @-@ combat bravery . The criteria for the award tightened during World War I for the Army version of the Medal of Honor , while the Navy version retained a non @-@ combat provision until 1963 . In an Act of Congress of July 9 , 1918 , the War Department version of the medal required that the recipient " distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " , and also required that the act of valor be performed " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " . This was in reaction to the results of the Army Medal of Honor Review Board , which struck 911 medals from the Medal of Honor Roll in February 1917 for lack of basic prerequisites . These included the members of the 27th Maine erroneously awarded the medal for reenlisting to guard the capital during the Civil War , 29 members of Abraham Lincoln 's funeral detail , and six civilians , including Buffalo Bill Cody and Mary Edwards Walker ( though the latter 's was restored posthumously in 1977 ) . 
 World War II : Starting in 1942 , the Medal would only be awarded for action in combat , although the Navy version of the Medal of Honor technically allowed non @-@ combat awards until 1963 . Official accounts vary , but generally , the Medal of Honor for combat was known as the " Tiffany Cross " , after the company that designed the medal . The Tiffany Cross was first awarded in 1919 , but was unpopular partly because of its design . The Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor was awarded at least three times for non @-@ combat . By a special authorized Act of Congress , the medal was presented to Byrd and Bennett ( see above ) . In 1942 , the United States Navy reverted to a single Medal of Honor , although the statute still contained a loophole allowing the award for both " action involving actual conflict with the enemy " or " in the line of his profession " . Arising from these criteria , approximately 60 percent of the medals earned during and after World War II have been awarded posthumously . 
 Public Law 88 @-@ 77 , July 25 , 1963 : The requirements for the Medal of Honor were standardized among all the services , requiring that a recipient had " distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty . " Thus , the act removed the loophole allowing non @-@ combat awards to Navy personnel . The act also clarified that the act of valor must occur during one of three circumstances : 
 While engaged in action against an enemy of the United States 
 While engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force . 
 While serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party . 
 Congress drew the three permutations of combat from President Kennedy 's executive order of April 25 , 1962 , which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart . On August 24 , Kennedy added similar criteria for the Bronze Star Medal . The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor Statute that required valor " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " , since the United States has not formally declared war since World War II as a result of the provisions of the United Nations Charter . According to congressional testimony by the Army 's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel , the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1 , 1958 , in areas such as Berlin , Lebanon , Quemoy and Matsu Islands , Taiwan Straits , Congo , Laos , Vietnam , and Cuba .

 The Medal of Honor confers special privileges on its recipients . By law , recipients have several benefits : 
 Each Medal of Honor recipient may have his or her name entered on the Medal of Honor Roll ( 38 U.S.C. § 1560 ) . 
 Each person whose name is placed on the Medal of Honor Roll is certified to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as being entitled to receive a monthly pension above and beyond any military pensions or other benefits for which they may be eligible . The pension is subject to cost @-@ of @-@ living increases ; as of December 1 , 2012 , it is $ 1 @,@ 259 a month . 
 Enlisted recipients of the Medal of Honor are entitled to a supplemental uniform allowance . 
 Recipients receive special entitlements to air transportation under the provisions of DOD Regulation 4515 @.@ 13 @-@ R. This benefit allows the recipient to travel as he or she deems fit across geographical locations , and allows the recipient 's dependents to travel either Overseas @-@ Overseas , Overseas @-@ Continental US , or Continental US @-@ Overseas when accompanied by the recipient . 
 Special identification cards and commissary and exchange privileges are provided for Medal of Honor recipients and their eligible dependents . 
 Recipients are granted eligibility for interment at Arlington National Cemetery , if not otherwise eligible . 
 Fully qualified children of recipients are eligible for admission to the United States military academies without regard to the nomination and quota requirements . 
 Recipients receive a 10 percent increase in retired pay . 
 Those awarded the medal after October 23 , 2002 , receive a Medal of Honor Flag . The law specified that all 103 living prior recipients as of that date would receive a flag . 
 Recipients receive an invitation to all future presidential inaugurations and inaugural balls . 
 As with all medals , retired personnel may wear the Medal of Honor on " appropriate " civilian clothing . Regulations specify that recipients of the Medal of Honor are allowed to wear the uniform " at their pleasure " with standard restrictions on political , commercial , or extremist purposes ( other former members of the armed forces may do so only at certain ceremonial occasions ) . 
 Most states ( 40 ) offer a special license plate for certain types of vehicles to recipients at little or no cost to the recipient . The states that do not offer Medal of Honor specific license plate offer special license plates for veterans for which recipients may be eligible .

 Although not required by law or military regulation , members of the uniformed services are encouraged to render salutes to recipients of the Medal of Honor as a matter of respect and courtesy regardless of rank or status , whether or not they are in uniform .

 1904 : The Army redesigned its Medal of Honor . To prevent the making of copies of the medal , Brigadier General George Gillespie , Jr . , a Medal of Honor recipient from the Civil War , applied for and obtained a patent for the new design . General Gillespie received the patent on November 22 , 1904 , and he transferred it the following month to the Secretary of War at the time , William Howard Taft . 
 1923 : Congress enacted a statute ( the year before the 20 @-@ year term of the patent would expire ) — which would later be codified at 18 U.S.C. § 704 — prohibiting the unauthorized wearing , manufacturing , or sale of military medals or decorations . In 1994 , Congress amended the statute to permit an enhanced penalty if the offense involved the Medal of Honor . 
 2005 : Congress enacted the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 . ( Section 1 of the Act provided that the law could be cited as the " Stolen Valor Act of 2005 " , but the bill received final passage and was signed into law in 2006 . ) The law amended 18 U.S.C. § 704 to make it a federal criminal offense for a person to deliberately state falsely that he or she had been awarded a military decoration , service medal , or badge . The law also permitted an enhanced penalty for someone who falsely claimed to have been awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 June 28 , 2012 : In the case of United States v. Alvarez , the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 's criminalization of the making of false claims of having been awarded a military medal , decoration , or badge was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment 's guarantee of free speech . The case involved an elected official in California , Xavier Alvarez , who had falsely stated at a public meeting that he had been awarded the Medal of Honor , even though he had never served in any branch of the armed forces . 
 The Supreme Court 's decision did not specifically address the constitutionality of the older portion of the statute which prohibits the unauthorized wearing , manufacturing , or sale of military medals or decorations . Under the law , the unauthorized wearing , manufacturing , or sale of the Medal of Honor is punishable by a fine of up to $ 100 @,@ 000 and imprisonment of up to one year . 
 June 3 , 2013 : President Barack Obama signs into law a revised version of the Stolen Valor Act , making it a federal offense for someone to pass themselves off as awardees of medals for valor in order to receive benefits or other privileges ( such as grants , educational benefits , housing , etc . ) that are set aside for veterans and other service members .

 The Medal of Honor has been awarded to 3 @,@ 496 different persons . Of the 19 men have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice , 14 received two separate medals for two separate actions , while five received both the Navy and Army Medals of Honor for the same action . As of June 2011 , since the beginning of World War II , 851 Medals of Honor have been awarded , 523 ( 61 @.@ 45 % ) posthumously . One has been awarded to a woman : Mary Edwards Walker . 
 The first Medals of Honor ( Army ) were awarded by and presented to six " Andrews Raiders " on March 25 , 1863 , by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , in his office in the War Department . Private Jacob Parrott , a Union Army volunteer from Ohio , became the first recipient of the medal , awarded for his volunteering for and participation in a raid on a Confederate train in Big Shanty , Georgia on April 12 , 1862 during the American Civil War . The six decorated raiders met privately afterward with President Lincoln in his office , in the White House . 
 The first Medal of Honor ( Navy ) was awarded by Secretary of War Stanton to 41 sailors on April 4 , 1863 ( 17 for action during the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip ) . 
 The first Marine awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy ) was John F. Mackie on July 10 , 1863 , for his rifle action aboard the USS Galena on May 15 , 1862 . 
 The only Coast Guardsman to be awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy , posthumous ) was Signalman First Class Douglas Munro on May 27 , 1943 , for evacuating 500 Marines under fire on September 27 , 1942 during the Battle of Guadalcanal . Munro was a Canadian @-@ born , naturalized U.S. citizen . 
 The only woman awarded the Medal of Honor ( Army ) is Mary Edwards Walker , who was a civilian Union Army surgeon during the American Civil War . She received the award in 1865 for the First Battle of Bull Run ( July 21 , 1861 ) and a series of battles to the Battle of Atlanta in Sept . 1864 ... " for usual medal of honor meritorious services . " 
 The 1917 Medal of Honor Board deleted 911 awards , but only 910 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll , including awards to Dr. Mary Edwards Walker , William F. " Buffalo Bill " Cody and the first of two awards issued February 10 , 1887 , to George W. <unk> , who retained his award issued October 25 , 1893 . None of the 910 " deleted " recipients were ordered to return their medals , although on the question of whether the recipients could continue to wear their medals , the Judge Advocate General advised the Medal of Honor Board the Army was not obligated to police the matter . Walker continued to wear her medal until her death . President Jimmy Carter formally restored her medal posthumously in 1977 . 
 61 Canadians who served in the United States Armed Forces , mostly during the American Civil War . Since 1900 , four Canadians have received the medal . The only Canadian @-@ born , naturalized U.S. citizen to receive the medal for heroism during the Vietnam War was Peter C. Lemon . 
 While the governing statute for the Army Medal of Honor ( 10 U.S.C. § <unk> ) , beginning in 1918 , explicitly stated that a recipient must be " an officer or enlisted man of the Army " , " distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " , and perform an act of valor " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " , exceptions have been made : 
 Charles Lindbergh , 1927 , civilian pilot , and U.S. Army Air Corps reserve officer . Lindbergh 's medal was authorized by a special act of Congress that directly contradicted the July 1918 act of Congress that required that all Army recipients be " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " . The award was based on the previous acts authorizing the Navy medal to Byrd and Bennett ( see above ) . Some congressmen objected to Lindbergh 's award because it contradicted the 1918 statute , but Representative Snell reportedly quelled this dissent by explaining that " it was and it wasn 't the Congressional Medal of Honor which Lindbergh would receive under his bill ; that the Lindbergh medal would be entirely distinct from the valor award for war service . " 
 Major General ( Retired ) Adolphus Greely was awarded the medal in 1935 , on his 91st birthday , " for his life of splendid public service " . The result of a special act of Congress similar to Lindbergh 's , Greely 's medal citation did not reference any acts of valor . 
 Foreign unknown recipients include the British Unknown Warrior , the French Unknown Soldier , the Romanian Unknown Soldier , the Italian Unknown Soldier , and the Belgian Unknown Soldier . 
 U.S. unknown recipients include the Unknowns of World War I , World War II , Korea , and Vietnam . The Vietnam Unknown was later identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie through the use of DNA identification . Blassie 's family asked for his Medal of Honor , but the Department of Defense denied the request in 1998 . According to Undersecretary of Defense Rudy de Leon , the medal was awarded symbolically to all Vietnam unknowns , not to Blassie specifically . 
 = = = Double recipients = = = 
 Nineteen men have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice . The first two @-@ time Medal of Honor recipient was Thomas Custer ( brother of George Armstrong Custer ) for two separate actions that took place several days apart during the American Civil War . 
 Five " double recipients " were awarded both the Army and Navy Medal of Honor for the same action ; all five of these occurrences took place during World War I. Since February 1919 , no single individual can be awarded more than one Medal of Honor for the same action , although a member of one branch of the armed forces can receive the Medal of Honor from another branch if the actions for which it was awarded occurred under the authority of the second branch . 
 To date , the maximum number of Medals of Honor earned by any service member has been two . The last individual to be awarded two Medals of Honor was John J. Kelly in 1918 ; the last individual to receive two Medals of Honor for two different actions was Smedley Butler , in 1914 and 1915 .

 Since 1979 , 85 belated Medal of Honor decorations were presented to recognize actions from the Civil War to the Vietnam War . In addition , five recipients who names were not included on the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 had their awards restored . 
 A 1993 study commissioned by the U.S. Army investigated " racial disparity " in the awarding of medals . At the time , no Medals of Honor had been awarded to American soldiers of African descent who served in World War II . After an exhaustive review , the study recommended that ten Distinguished Service Cross recipients be awarded the Medal of Honor . On January 13 , 1997 , President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to seven of these World War II veterans , six of them posthumously and one to former Second Lieutenant Vernon Baker . 
 In 1998 , a similar study of Asian Americans resulted in President Bill Clinton presenting 22 Medals of Honor in 2000 . Twenty of these medals went to American soldiers of Japanese descent of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team ( 442nd RCT ) that served in the European Theater of Operations during World War II . One of these Medal of Honor recipients was Senator Daniel Inouye , a former U.S. Army officer in the 442nd RCT . 
 In 2005 , President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor to Tibor Rubin , a Hungarian @-@ born American Jew who was a Holocaust survivor of World War II and enlisted U.S. infantryman and prisoner of war in the Korean War , whom many believed to have been overlooked because of his religion . 
 On April 11 , 2013 , President Obama presented the Medal of Honor posthumously to Army chaplain Captain Emil <unk> for his actions as a prisoner of war during the Korean war . This follows other awards to Army Sergeant Leslie H. Sabo , Jr. for conspicuous gallantry in action on May 10 , 1970 , near Se San , Cambodia , during the Vietnam War and to Army Private First Class Henry <unk> and Army Private First Class Anthony T. <unk> for their heroic actions during the Korean War . 
 As a result of a Congressionally mandated review to ensure brave acts were not overlooked due to prejudice or discrimination , on March 18 , 2014 President Obama upgraded Distinguished Service Crosses to Medals of Honor for 24 Hispanic , Jewish , and African American individuals — the " Valor 24 " — for their actions in World War II , the Korean War and the Vietnam War . Three were still living at the time of the ceremony . 
 = = 27th Maine and other revoked <unk> = = 
 During the Civil War , Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton promised a Medal of Honor to every man in the 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who extended his enlistment beyond the agreed @-@ upon date . The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent , and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved . The remaining men returned to Maine , but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed . The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with the men who had earlier returned . Since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers , the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment . The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that , if he returned the remainder to the War Department , the War Department would try to reissue the medals . 
 In 1916 , a board of five Army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded . The board was to report on any Medals of Honor awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished service . The commission , led by Nelson A. Miles , identified 911 awards for causes other than distinguished service . This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine regiment ; 29 servicemen who served as Abraham Lincoln 's funeral guard ; six civilians , including Mary Edwards Walker and Buffalo Bill Cody ; and 12 others . Walker 's medal was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 . Cody and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service in action , and who were therefore considered by the board to have fully earned their medals , had theirs restored in 1989 . The report was endorsed by the Judge Advocate General , who also advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board . In the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal , the War Department was advised to take no action to enforce the statute .

 = Bacteria = 
 Bacteria ( / <unk> / ; singular : bacterium ) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms . Typically a few micrometres in length , bacteria have a number of shapes , ranging from spheres to rods and spirals . Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth , and are present in most of its habitats . Bacteria inhabit soil , water , acidic hot springs , radioactive waste , and the deep portions of Earth 's crust . Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals . 
 There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water . There are approximately 5 × 1030 bacteria on Earth , forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals . Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients , with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms , such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction . In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps , bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds , such as hydrogen sulphide and methane , to energy . On 17 March 2013 , researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench , which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest part of the Earth 's oceans . Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2 @.@ 6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States . According to one of the researchers , " You can find microbes everywhere — they 're extremely adaptable to conditions , and survive wherever they are . " 
 Most bacteria have not been characterized , and only about half of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory . The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology , a branch of microbiology . 
 There are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells in the human flora as there are human cells in the body , with the largest number of the human flora being in the gut flora , and a large number on the skin . The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system , and some are beneficial . However , several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases , including cholera , syphilis , anthrax , leprosy , and bubonic plague . The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections , with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year , mostly in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . In developed countries , antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming , making antibiotic resistance a growing problem . In industry , bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills , the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation , and the recovery of gold , palladium , copper and other metals in the mining sector , as well as in biotechnology , and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals . 
 Once regarded as plants constituting the class <unk> , bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes . Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes , bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane @-@ bound organelles . Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes , the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor . These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word bacteria is the plural of the New Latin bacterium , which is the latinisation of the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , the diminutive of <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " staff , cane " , because the first ones to be discovered were rod @-@ shaped . 
 = = Origin and early evolution = = 
 The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on Earth , about 4 billion years ago . For about 3 billion years , most organisms were microscopic , and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life . In 2008 , fossils of <unk> were discovered and named as the Francevillian biota . Although bacterial fossils exist , such as stromatolites , their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution , or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species . However , gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny , and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal / eukaryotic lineage . Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence , that of the archaea and eukaryotes . Here , eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells , which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea . This involved the engulfment by proto @-@ eukaryotic cells of <unk> symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes , which are still found in all known Eukarya ( sometimes in highly reduced form , e.g. in ancient " <unk> " protozoa ) . Later on , some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial @-@ like organisms . This led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants . There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events . Here , eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a " second @-@ generation " plastid . This is known as secondary endosymbiosis . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes , called morphologies . Bacterial cells are about one @-@ tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 0 micrometres in length . However , a few species are visible to the unaided eye — for example , Thiomargarita <unk> is up to half a millimetre long and <unk> <unk> reaches 0 @.@ 7 mm . Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus Mycoplasma , which measure only 0 @.@ 3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses . Some bacteria may be even smaller , but these <unk> are not well @-@ studied . 
 Most bacterial species are either spherical , called cocci ( sing. coccus , from Greek <unk> , grain , seed ) , or rod @-@ shaped , called bacilli ( sing. bacillus , from Latin <unk> , stick ) . <unk> is associated with swimming . Some bacteria , called <unk> , are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma @-@ shaped ; others can be spiral @-@ shaped , called <unk> , or tightly coiled , called <unk> . A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes . More recently , some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth 's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star @-@ shaped cross @-@ section . The large surface area to volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient @-@ poor environments . This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton , and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients , attach to surfaces , swim through liquids and escape predators . 
 Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells , others associate in characteristic patterns : Neisseria form diploids ( pairs ) , Streptococcus form chains , and Staphylococcus group together in " bunch of grapes " clusters . Bacteria can also be elongated to form filaments , for example the Actinobacteria . <unk> bacteria are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells . Certain types , such as species of the genus Nocardia , even form complex , branched filaments , similar in appearance to fungal mycelia . 
 Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called biofilms or bacterial mats . These films can range from a few micrometers in thickness to up to half a meter in depth , and may contain multiple species of bacteria , protists and archaea . Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components , forming secondary structures , such as <unk> , through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients . In natural environments , such as soil or the surfaces of plants , the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms . <unk> are also important in medicine , as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices , and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria . 
 Even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible . For example , when starved of amino acids , <unk> detect surrounding cells in a process known as quorum sensing , migrate toward each other , and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500 micrometres long and containing approximately 100 @,@ 000 bacterial cells . In these fruiting bodies , the bacteria perform separate tasks ; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation . For example , about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruiting bodies and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called myxospores , which are more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells . 
 = = Cellular structure = = 
 = = = Intracellular structures = = = 
 The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a lipid , cytoplasmic or plasma membrane ) . This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . As they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane @-@ bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . They lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . These subcellular levels of organization have been called " bacterial <unk> " . 
 Bacterial microcompartments , such as <unk> , provide a further level of organization ; they are compartments within bacteria that are surrounded by polyhedral protein shells , rather than by lipid membranes . These " polyhedral organelles " localize and compartmentalize bacterial metabolism , a function performed by the membrane @-@ bound organelles in eukaryotes . 
 Many important biochemical reactions , such as energy generation , use concentration gradients across membranes . The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space . However , in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light @-@ gathering membrane . These light @-@ gathering complexes may even form lipid @-@ enclosed structures called <unk> in green sulfur bacteria . Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane , or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm . 
 Bacteria do not have a membrane @-@ bound nucleus , and their genetic material is typically a single circular DNA chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid . The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA . The phylum <unk> and candidate phylum <unk> may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria , because they appear to have a double membrane around their <unk> and contain other membrane @-@ bound cellular structures . Like all living organisms , bacteria contain ribosomes , often grouped in chains called <unk> , for the production of proteins , but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea . Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S ( measured in Svedberg units ) : their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S . Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis . Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host . 
 Some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules for later use , such as glycogen , polyphosphate , sulfur or <unk> . Certain bacterial species , such as the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria , produce internal gas vesicles , which they use to regulate their buoyancy – allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels . Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria . Used primarily for photosynthesis , they contain <unk> pigments and carotenoids . An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed <unk> , but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy . <unk> are considered to be nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes . The most common inclusions are glycogen , lipid droplets , crystals , and pigments . <unk> granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate . These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect ; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or <unk> blue . Gas vacuoles , which are freely permeable to gas , are membrane @-@ bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria . They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy . <unk> are widespread , membrane @-@ bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes . <unk> are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation . <unk> are bacterial microcompartments , present in <unk> bacteria , that contain magnetic crystals . 
 = = = Extracellular structures = = = 
 In most bacteria , a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane . The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope . A common bacterial cell wall material is peptidoglycan ( called " <unk> " in older sources ) , which is made from polysaccharide chains cross @-@ linked by peptides containing D @-@ amino acids . Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi , which are made of cellulose and chitin , respectively . The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea , which do not contain peptidoglycan . The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria , and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan . 
 There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria , a thick one in the gram @-@ positives and a thinner one in the gram @-@ negatives . The names originate from the reaction of cells to the Gram stain , a test long @-@ employed for the classification of bacterial species . 
 Gram @-@ positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and <unk> acids . In contrast , gram @-@ negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins . <unk> , also called <unk> , are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram @-@ negative bacteria . Most bacteria have the gram @-@ negative cell wall , and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram @-@ positive arrangement . These two groups were previously known as the low G + C and high G + C gram @-@ positive bacteria , respectively . These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility ; for instance , vancomycin can kill only gram @-@ positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram @-@ negative pathogens , such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa . If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed , it is called a <unk> , whereas if it is partially removed , it is called a <unk> β @-@ <unk> antibiotics , such as penicillin , inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross @-@ links in the bacterial cell wall . The enzyme lysozyme , found in human tears , also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body 's main defense against eye infections . 
 Acid @-@ fast bacteria , such as Mycobacteria , are resistant to <unk> by acids during staining procedures . The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria , is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention . The most common staining technique used to identify acid @-@ fast bacteria is the Ziehl @-@ Neelsen stain or acid @-@ fast stain , in which the acid @-@ fast bacilli are stained bright @-@ red and stand out clearly against a blue background . L @-@ form bacteria are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls . The main pathogenic bacteria in this class is Mycoplasma ( not to be confused with Mycobacteria ) . 
 In many bacteria , an S @-@ layer of rigidly arrayed protein molecules covers the outside of the cell . This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier . S @-@ layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions , but are known to act as virulence factors in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus <unk> . 
 Flagella are rigid protein structures , about 20 nanometres in diameter and up to 20 micrometres in length , that are used for motility . Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane . 
 <unk> ( sometimes called " attachment pili " ) are fine filaments of protein , usually 2 – 10 nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometers in length . They are distributed over the surface of the cell , and resemble fine hairs when seen under the electron microscope . <unk> are believed to be involved in attachment to solid surfaces or to other cells , and are essential for the virulence of some bacterial pathogens . <unk> ( sing. pilus ) are cellular appendages , slightly larger than <unk> , that can transfer genetic material between bacterial cells in a process called conjugation where they are called conjugation pili or " sex pili " ( see bacterial genetics , below ) . They can also generate movement where they are called type IV pili ( see movement , below ) . 
 <unk> are produced by many bacteria to surround their cells , and vary in structural complexity : ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extra @-@ cellular polymer to a highly structured capsule . These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages ( part of the human immune system ) . They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition , as well as aiding attachment to surfaces and the formation of biofilms . 
 The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on bacterial secretion systems . These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell . Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens , so are intensively studied . 
 = = = Endospores = = = 
 Certain genera of gram @-@ positive bacteria , such as Bacillus , Clostridium , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , can form highly resistant , dormant structures called endospores . In almost all cases , one <unk> is formed and this is not a reproductive process , although <unk> can make up to seven endospores in a single cell . Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat . <unk> acid is a chemical compound that composes 5 % to 15 % of the dry weight of bacterial spores . It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the <unk> . 
 Endospores show no detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses , such as high levels of UV light , gamma radiation , detergents , disinfectants , heat , freezing , pressure , and desiccation . In this dormant state , these organisms may remain viable for millions of years , and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space . According to scientist Dr. <unk> Sigurdsson , " There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth — and we know they 're very hardened to radiation . " <unk> @-@ forming bacteria can also cause disease : for example , anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus <unk> endospores , and contamination of deep puncture wounds with Clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus . 
 = = Metabolism = = 
 Bacteria exhibit an extremely wide variety of metabolic types . The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy , but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications . Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria : the kind of energy used for growth , the source of carbon , and the electron donors used for growth . An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration . 
 Carbon metabolism in bacteria is either heterotrophic , where organic carbon compounds are used as carbon sources , or autotrophic , meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide . <unk> bacteria include parasitic types . Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria , green sulfur @-@ bacteria and some purple bacteria , but also many <unk> species , such as nitrifying or sulfur @-@ oxidising bacteria . Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on <unk> , the use of light through photosynthesis , or based on <unk> , the use of chemical substances for energy , which are mostly oxidised at the expense of oxygen or alternative electron acceptors ( aerobic / anaerobic respiration ) . 
 Bacteria are further divided into lithotrophs that use inorganic electron donors and <unk> that use organic compounds as electron donors . <unk> organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation ( by aerobic / anaerobic respiration or fermentation ) and biosynthetic reactions ( e.g. , carbon dioxide fixation ) , whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes . Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds as a source of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction . This reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise ATP and drive metabolism . In aerobic organisms , oxygen is used as the electron acceptor . In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds , such as nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors . This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification , sulfate reduction , and acetogenesis , respectively . 
 Another way of life of <unk> in the absence of possible electron acceptors is fermentation , wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products ( e.g. , lactate , ethanol , hydrogen , butyric acid ) . Fermentation is possible , because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products , which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism . 
 These processes are also important in biological responses to pollution ; for example , sulfate @-@ reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury ( <unk> and <unk> ) in the environment . Non @-@ respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power , secreting metabolic by @-@ products ( such as ethanol in brewing ) as waste . Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves . 
 <unk> bacteria can use inorganic compounds as a source of energy . Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen , carbon monoxide , ammonia ( leading to nitrification ) , ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions , and several reduced sulfur compounds . In unusual circumstances , the gas methane can be used by <unk> bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism . In both aerobic <unk> and <unk> , oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor , whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead . Most <unk> organisms are autotrophic , whereas <unk> organisms are heterotrophic . 
 In addition to fixing carbon dioxide in photosynthesis , some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas ( nitrogen fixation ) using the enzyme nitrogenase . This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of nearly all the metabolic types listed above , but is not universal . 
 Regardless of the type of metabolic process they employ , the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules , which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes . The <unk> are the exception ( as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material ) . It has recently been shown that <unk> <unk> is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles endocytosis , the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items . 
 = = Growth and reproduction = = 
 Unlike in multicellular organisms , increases in cell size ( cell growth ) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms . Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission , a form of asexual reproduction . Under optimal conditions , bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly , and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9 @.@ 8 minutes . In cell division , two identical clone daughter cells are produced . Some bacteria , while still reproducing asexually , form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells . Examples include fruiting body formation by <unk> and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces , or budding . Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell . 
 In the laboratory , bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media . Solid growth media , such as agar plates , are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain . However , liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required . Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension , making the cultures easy to divide and transfer , although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult . The use of selective media ( media with specific nutrients added or deficient , or with antibiotics added ) can help identify specific organisms . 
 Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly . However , in natural environments , nutrients are limited , meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely . This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies ( see r / K selection theory ) . Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available , such as the formation of algal ( and cyanobacterial ) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer . Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments , such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms . In nature , many organisms live in communities ( e.g. , biofilms ) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses . These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ( <unk> ) . 
 Bacterial growth follows four phases . When a population of bacteria first enter a high @-@ nutrient environment that allows growth , the cells need to adapt to their new environment . The first phase of growth is the lag phase , a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high @-@ nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth . The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates , as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced . The second phase of growth is the log phase , also known as the logarithmic or exponential phase . The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth . The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate ( k ) , and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time ( g ) . During log phase , nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth . The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients . The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non @-@ essential cellular proteins . The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair , antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport . The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 Most bacteria have a single circular chromosome that can range in size from only 160 @,@ 000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria <unk> <unk> <unk> , to 12 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 base pairs in the soil @-@ dwelling bacteria <unk> <unk> . <unk> of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement , with bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi , the cause of Lyme disease , containing a single linear chromosome . The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria , these are much rarer than in eukaryotes . 
 Bacteria may also contain plasmids , which are small extra @-@ chromosomal DNAs that may contain genes for antibiotic resistance or virulence factors . Plasmids replicate independently of chromosomes , so it is possible that plasmids could be lost in bacterial cell division . Against this possibility is the fact that a single bacterium can contain hundreds of copies of a single plasmid . 
 Bacteria , as asexual organisms , inherit identical copies of their parent 's genes ( i.e. , they are clonal ) . However , all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material DNA caused by genetic recombination or mutations . Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to mutagens . Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria . Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or " stress @-@ directed mutation " , where genes involved in a particular growth @-@ limiting process have an increased mutation rate . 
 = = = DNA transfer = = = 
 Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells . This can occur in three main ways . First , bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment , in a process called transformation . Genes can also be transferred by the process of transduction , when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome . The third method of gene transfer is conjugation , whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact . 
 <unk> of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles , rather than a bacterial adaptation . Conjugation , in the much @-@ studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes , and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another . It is seldom that a <unk> plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome , and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium . Plasmid @-@ mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation . 
 Transformation , unlike transduction or conjugation , depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process , and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer . In order for a bacterium to bind , take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome , it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence ( see Natural competence ) . In Bacillus subtilis , about 40 genes are required for the development of competence . The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome . Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species , and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation . The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions , and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells . 
 In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance . In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions . Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens . 
 = = = Bacteriophages = = = 
 Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria . Many types of bacteriophage exist , some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria , while others insert into the bacterial chromosome . A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host 's phenotype : for example , in the evolution of Escherichia coli O157 : H7 and Clostridium botulinum , the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen . Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA , and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past , which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference . This CRISPR system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Bacteria frequently secrete chemicals into their environment in order to modify it favorably . The secretions are often proteins and may act as enzymes that digest some form of food in the environment . 
 = = = Bioluminescence = = = 
 A few bacteria have chemical systems that generate light . This bioluminescence often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish , and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals . 
 = = = Multicellularity = = = 
 Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as biofilms , exchanging a variety of molecular signals for inter @-@ cell communication , and engaging in coordinated multicellular behavior . 
 The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labor , accessing resources that cannot effectively be utilized by single cells , collectively defending against antagonists , and optimizing population survival by differentiating into distinct cell types . For example , bacteria in biofilms can have more than 500 times increased resistance to antibacterial agents than individual " planktonic " bacteria of the same species . 
 One type of inter @-@ cellular communication by a molecular signal is called quorum sensing , which serves the purpose of determining whether there is a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly , as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light . 
 Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate gene expression , and enables them to produce , release and detect <unk> or pheromones which accumulate with the growth in cell population . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 Many bacteria can move using a variety of mechanisms : flagella are used for swimming through fluids ; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces ; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion . 
 Swimming bacteria frequently move near 10 body lengths per second and a few as fast as 100 . This makes them at least as fast as fish , on a relative scale . 
 In bacterial gliding and twitching motility , bacteria use their type IV pili as a grappling hook , repeatedly extending it , anchoring it and then retracting it with remarkable force ( > 80 <unk> ) . 
 " Our observations redefine twitching motility as a rapid , highly organized mechanism of bacterial translocation by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa can disperse itself over large areas to colonize new territories . It is also now clear , both morphologically and genetically , that twitching motility and social gliding motility , such as occurs in Myxococcus xanthus , are essentially the same process . " 
 Flagella are semi @-@ rigid cylindrical structures that are rotated and function much like the propeller on a ship . Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat , paddle @-@ like , forms appropriate at human @-@ size scale . 
 Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface ; some have a single flagellum ( <unk> ) , a flagellum at each end ( <unk> ) , clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell ( <unk> ) , while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell ( peritrichous ) . The bacterial flagella is the best @-@ understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins , with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly . The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power . This motor drives the motion of the filament , which acts as a propeller . 
 Many bacteria ( such as E. coli ) have two distinct modes of movement : forward movement ( swimming ) and tumbling . The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three @-@ dimensional random walk . ( See external links below for link to videos . ) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria , the <unk> , are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space . They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves . 
 <unk> bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviors called taxes : these include chemotaxis , phototaxis , energy taxis , and <unk> . In one peculiar group , the myxobacteria , individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores . The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces , unlike E. coli , which is motile in liquid or solid media . 
 Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton , which is normally used to move organelles inside the cell . By promoting actin polymerization at one pole of their cells , they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell 's cytoplasm . 
 = = Classification and identification = = 
 Classification seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities . Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure , cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components , such as DNA , fatty acids , pigments , antigens and quinones . While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains , it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species . This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria , as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species . Due to lateral gene transfer , some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms . To overcome this uncertainty , modern bacterial classification emphasizes molecular systematics , using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination , genome @-@ genome hybridization , as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer , such as the rRNA gene . Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology , and Bergey 's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology . The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology ( <unk> ) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria . 
 The term " bacteria " was traditionally applied to all microscopic , single @-@ cell prokaryotes . However , molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains , originally called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria , but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor . The archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria . These two domains , along with Eukarya , are the basis of the three @-@ domain system , which is currently the most widely used classification system in <unk> . However , due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and a rapid increase in the number of genome sequences that are available , bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field . For example , a few biologists argue that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from gram @-@ positive bacteria . 
 The identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine , where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection . Consequently , the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria . 
 The Gram stain , developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram , characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls . The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the " gram @-@ positive " cell wall stain purple , while the thin " gram @-@ negative " cell wall appears pink . By combining morphology and Gram @-@ staining , most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups ( gram @-@ positive cocci , gram @-@ positive bacilli , gram @-@ negative cocci and gram @-@ negative bacilli ) . Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain , particularly mycobacteria or Nocardia , which show acid @-@ fastness on Ziehl – Neelsen or similar stains . Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media , or by other techniques , such as serology . 
 Culture techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria , while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample . Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens ; for example , a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia , while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea , while preventing growth of non @-@ pathogenic bacteria . Specimens that are normally sterile , such as blood , urine or spinal fluid , are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms . Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated , it can be further characterised by its morphology , growth patterns ( such as aerobic or anaerobic growth ) , patterns of hemolysis , and staining . 
 As with bacterial classification , identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods . Diagnostics using DNA @-@ based tools , such as polymerase chain reaction , are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed , compared to culture @-@ based methods . These methods also allow the detection and identification of " viable but <unk> " cells that are metabolically active but non @-@ dividing . However , even using these improved methods , the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty . Following present classification , there are a little less than 9 @,@ 300 known species of prokaryotes , which includes bacteria and archaea ; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species – and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude . 
 = = Interactions with other organisms = = 
 Despite their apparent simplicity , bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms . These symbiotic associations can be divided into parasitism , mutualism and commensalism . Due to their small size , commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface . However , their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat , and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odor . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms , these species are called predatory bacteria . These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus , which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter . Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients , such as <unk> <unk> , or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol , such as <unk> . These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from <unk> that consumed dead microorganisms , through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival . One such mutualistic association , called interspecies hydrogen transfer , occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids , such as butyric acid or propionic acid , and produce hydrogen , and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen . The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings . Only the intimate association with the hydrogen @-@ consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow . 
 In soil , microorganisms that reside in the rhizosphere ( a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking ) carry out nitrogen fixation , converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds . This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants , which cannot fix nitrogen themselves . Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms . For example , the presence of over 1 @,@ 000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity , synthesise vitamins , such as folic acid , vitamin K and biotin , convert sugars to lactic acid ( see Lactobacillus ) , as well as fermenting complex <unk> carbohydrates . The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria ( usually through competitive exclusion ) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements . 
 = = = Pathogens = = = 
 If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms , they are classed as pathogens . Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus , typhoid fever , diphtheria , syphilis , cholera , foodborne illness , leprosy and tuberculosis . A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after , as was the case with Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease . Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture , with bacteria causing leaf spot , fire blight and <unk> in plants , as well as Johne 's disease , mastitis , salmonella and anthrax in farm animals . 
 Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts . Some organisms , such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus , can cause skin infections , pneumonia , meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis , a systemic inflammatory response producing shock , massive vasodilation and death . Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all . Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans , such as the Rickettsia , which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms . One species of Rickettsia causes typhus , while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever . Chlamydia , another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites , contains species that can cause pneumonia , or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease . Finally , some species , such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Burkholderia <unk> , and Mycobacterium avium , are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis . 
 Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics , which are classified as <unk> if they kill bacteria , or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth . There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host . An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and <unk> , which inhibit the bacterial ribosome , but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome . Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth , where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations . Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe , and by proper care of indwelling catheters . Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria . <unk> such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection . 
 = = Significance in technology and industry = = 
 Bacteria , often lactic acid bacteria , such as Lactobacillus and <unk> , in combination with yeasts and molds , have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of fermented foods , such as cheese , pickles , soy sauce , sauerkraut , vinegar , wine and yogurt . 
 The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and bioremediation . Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills . Fertilizer was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil . Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes . In the chemical industry , bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals . 
 Bacteria can also be used in the place of pesticides in the biological pest control . This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis ( also called BT ) , a gram @-@ positive , soil dwelling bacterium . Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran @-@ specific insecticides under trade names such as <unk> and <unk> . Because of their specificity , these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly , with little or no effect on humans , wildlife , pollinators and most other beneficial insects . 
 Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated , bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology , genetics and biochemistry . By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes , scientists can determine the function of genes , enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria , then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms . This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms . This is achievable in some well @-@ studied bacteria , with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested . This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to <unk> bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins , such as insulin , growth factors , or antibodies . 
 Because of their importance for research in general , samples of bacterial strains are isolated and preserved in Biological Resource Centers . This ensures the availability of the strain to scientists worldwide . 
 = = History of bacteriology = = 
 Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 , using a single @-@ lens microscope of his own design . He then published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London . Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek 's most remarkable microscopic discovery . They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and , in one of the most striking hiatuses in the history of science , no one else would see them again for over a century . Only then were his by @-@ then @-@ largely @-@ forgotten observations of bacteria — as opposed to his famous " <unk> " ( spermatozoa ) — taken seriously . 
 Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg introduced the word " bacterium " in 1828 . In fact , his Bacterium was a genus that contained non @-@ spore @-@ forming rod @-@ shaped bacteria , as opposed to Bacillus , a genus of spore @-@ forming rod @-@ shaped bacteria defined by Ehrenberg in 1835 . 
 Louis Pasteur demonstrated in 1859 that the growth of microorganisms causes the fermentation process , and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation . ( Yeasts and molds , commonly associated with fermentation , are not bacteria , but rather fungi . ) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch , Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease . 
 Robert Koch , a pioneer in medical microbiology , worked on cholera , anthrax and tuberculosis . In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory , for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905 . In Koch 's postulates , he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a disease , and these postulates are still used today . 
 Though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases , no effective antibacterial treatments were available . In 1910 , Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic , by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum — the spirochaete that causes syphilis — into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen . Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology , and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria , with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl – Neelsen stain . 
 A major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognized that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria . This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA , and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains , as part of the three @-@ domain system . 
 = Janet Jackson ( album ) = 
 Janet Jackson is the self @-@ titled debut album by American recording artist Janet Jackson . It was released on September 21 , 1982 , by A & M Records . Jackson 's career as a recording artist was established by her father and manager Joseph Jackson , who arranged her recording contract with her recording company . Prior to her rise to fame , the singer had no interest in pursuing a musical career . Despite this , she was motivated to pursue a career in entertainment , and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio . After acting in the variety show The Jacksons , she began starring in several TV series and commenced recording her debut album . Its artwork depicts Jackson submerged in a swimming pool . 
 Janet Jackson is described as a post @-@ disco and R & B record . Songwriters Angela Winbush and René Moore contributed to much of the album 's lyrics . Moore and Winbush share production credits with Foster Sylvers , Jerry Weaver , and Bobby Watson . Janet Jackson received mixed reviews from music critics who found its content bland , although highlighted some tracks . It also managed to chart on the Billboard 200 and in New Zealand . Three singles from the album had little impact on Billboard charts , among them " Young Love " , " Come Give Your Love to Me " and " Say You Do " . In order to promote Janet Jackson , she performed the song on American TV shows American Bandstand and Soul Train in 1982 .

 Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer , with plans to support herself through acting . Despite this , she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment , and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio . At age seven , Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976 . The year after , she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times . She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff 'rent Strokes , portraying Charlene Duprey for two years . Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame , but expressed indifference towards the series . When Jackson was sixteen , she was arranged a contract with A & M Records and began recording her debut album with the assistance of her father , working with a number of songwriters and producers such as René Moore , Angela Winbush and Bobby Watson . 
 The album 's artwork was photographed by Harry Langdon in the swimming pool of the Jackson family 's home . Jackson described Langdon as " the sweetest man imaginable " . She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged in a swimming pool which was taken early in her career . In the photograph , nothing could be seen apart from Taylor 's face above the water ; her body was hidden beneath the surface . Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing , and not to have to reveal anything except for her face . With the photographer , his assistant and other people around the pool , she was still reluctant to take off her robe , and stand there in her bathing suit . She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool . After they took the photos , she waited until everybody was gone to get out of the pool .

 Five singles were released from the album . " Young Love " was the first . It received little notoriety on the principal singles chart , the Billboard Hot 100 ; it was able to reach a peak of number 64 . However , on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs , the single managed to reach number six . In New Zealand , " Young Love " reached a peak of number 16 . The second single from Janet Jackson was " Come Give Your Love to Me " and peaked at number 58 on the Hot 100 . It became her last single to appear on that chart until 1986 , when she released Control . The follow @-@ up single , " Say You Do " , only managed to appear on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs and the Hot Dance Club Songs charts , peaking at numbers 15 and 11 , respectively . The last singles from the album , " Love and My Best Friend " and " Don 't Mess Up A Good Thing " did not appear on any chart worldwide .

 Janet Jackson received mixed reviews from music critics . The Baltimore Afro @-@ American gave it a favorable review , commenting that " the eight songs simply feature the poised voice of a dynamic individual . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it two out of five stars , providing a mixed review saying " On her eponymous debut album , Janet Jackson demonstrates no distinctive musical personality of her own . If her producers had concocted a sharper set of songs and more interesting beats , Janet Jackson might have been a pleasant set of sunny dance @-@ pop " , highlighting " Young Love " as the only song which " stands out among the undistinguished , sub @-@ disco thumpers and drippy ballads " . Bil Carpenter from the same website called Janet Jackson a " debut album of youth @-@ oriented pop " . 
 Similarly , Wilson & Alroy 's Record Reviews commented that " Listening to Jackson 's childlike , personality @-@ challenged voice on this disc , you 'd never dream what a commercial juggernaut she would become " . On its first side , they deemed " You 'll Never Find ( A Love Like Mine ) " and " Young Love " as the standouts , but criticized the ballad " Love And My Best Friend " , saying it is nearly unendurable . He considered the second side 's sound " up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute " , but said " Unfortunately , [ the producer 's ] taste in tunes is abysmal " .
