 = The Girl ( 2012 TV film ) = 
 The Girl is a 2012 British television film directed by Julian Jarrold , written by Gwyneth Hughes and produced by the BBC and HBO Films . The film stars Sienna Miller as Tippi Hedren and Toby Jones as Alfred Hitchcock . It is based on Donald Spoto 's 2009 book , Spellbound by Beauty : Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies , which discusses British @-@ born film director Hitchcock and the women who played leading roles in his films . The Girl 's title was inspired by Hitchcock 's alleged nickname for Hedren . 
 The film depicts Hitchcock 's alleged obsession with Hedren , the American model and actress he brought from relative obscurity to star in his 1963 film The Birds . Hitchcock becomes infatuated with his leading lady ; when she rebuffs his advances , he subjects her to a series of traumatic experiences during the filming of The Birds . Hitchcock 's obsession with Hedren continues when she stars in his next production , Marnie . Hedren grows increasingly uncomfortable with his attentions , and decides that she needs to escape the situation . However , she cannot work elsewhere because of her exclusive contract with Hitchcock ; this effectively ends her Hollywood career . 
 The Girl made its television debut in the United States on 20 October 2012 on HBO and aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 26 December . Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film , which received mixed reviews from critics . The Daily Mirror 's Jane Simon praised Miller 's portrayal of Hedren . Although she endorsed the film , Hedren said its length kept it from showing some of the positive aspects of her relationship with Hitchcock . Others who knew ( and worked with ) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal of him as a sexual predator . Kim Novak ( who starred in one of Hitchcock 's films ) and Nora Brown ( widow of one of Hitchcock 's close friends ) disputed the film 's version of events . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The film is a partially fictionalised account of the relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren . In 1961 , Hitchcock notices Hedren in a television commercial for a diet drink . He wants to turn her into the next Grace Kelly , with whom he had worked extensively during the 1950s . Hedren passes her screen test and is groomed for the starring role in Hitchcock 's latest film , The Birds ; the director instructs her about her dress and appearance . 
 Captivated by Hedren 's Nordic looks , Hitchcock becomes infatuated with her . While filming The Birds , he makes advances to her in the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him . In retaliation for her rejection , Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds . A mechanical bird breaks the apparently <unk> glass of a telephone booth during filming , showering Hedren with glass . After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren 's character ( Melanie Daniels ) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds , she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones . He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren 's reaction looks authentic . This takes several days , leaving Hedren traumatised . 
 With The Birds a box @-@ office success , Hitchcock and Hedren begin work on Marnie . However , Hedren finds the film 's content ( including a marital @-@ rape scene ) and Hitchcock 's obsession with her mentally and emotionally exhausting . The director is frustrated by what he sees as Hedren 's coldness towards him . During a conversation with writer Evan Hunter , Hitchcock admits that he has erectile dysfunction and his only sexual partner is his wife ( screenwriter Alma Reville ) . He later declares his love for Hedren ; she walks away , leaving him to imagine her reciprocating his feelings . 
 Hitchcock refuses Hedren 's request for time off to attend the Photoplay Awards in New York City ( where she is nominated for the Most Promising Actress award ) , and tells her he will include in her contract a clause requiring her to make herself sexually available to him on demand . Hedren quits working for Hitchcock after completing Marnie , but he refuses to release her from her contract ; this prevents her from working for another production company , effectively ending her Hollywood career . Two notes before the titles inform the viewer that Hitchcock and Hedren never worked together again , and The Birds and Marnie are considered his last classic films .

 = = = Background and development = = = 
 The Girl is based on Donald Spoto 's 2009 book , Spellbound by Beauty : Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies , which examines the relationships between Alfred Hitchcock and the female stars of his films . Spoto wrote that Hitchcock attempted to turn Tippi Hedren ( star of The Birds and Marnie ) into his perfect woman , choosing the clothes and lipstick he thought she should wear . Hedren told Spoto that Hitchcock fantasised about running off with her . 
 Details of a film examining Hitchcock 's obsession with Hedren were reported in December 2011 . The Girl , written by Gwyneth Hughes , would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren . In a post @-@ production BBC press release about the film in November 2012 , Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday : " [ I ] got a phone call from producer Amanda Jenks . She only managed to get out the words ' Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren ' before I was already shouting ' yes yes yes ! ' to this seductive , sinister , deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty . " Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock 's crew before preparing a script . She described her discussions with Hedren : " Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen . I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled , as I am , with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her . " The film 's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him . 
 Diana Cilliers designed the costumes , recreating what Hedren wore ( including Melanie Daniels ' green suit ) in Hitchcock 's films : " [ T ] here were certain items that we just copied – such as the Birds suit and the yellow Marnie bag , but otherwise we looked at clean lines , colours . Nothing too fussy . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began on 8 December 2011 . As part of her research Miller ( who was in the early stages of pregnancy ) spoke to Hedren several times during filming , and the two became friends . Live birds were used to recreate the filming of the attic scene in The Birds . Miller told the Radio Times , " I did go through a bird attack for two hours . It pales in comparison to what [ Hedren ] was subjected to , but it was pretty horrible . There were men off @-@ camera with boxes of birds , throwing seagulls and pigeons in my face " . 
 Jones 's role as Hitchcock required him to spend four hours each day being made up with prosthetic makeup and a fatsuit , and he did daily twenty @-@ minute vocal exercises to imitate Hitchcock 's distinctive speech . In a December 2012 interview with The Scotsman , Jones said " [ Hitchcock 's ] voice was so beautiful . There 's something in the rhythm and roll of it that is connected to the way Hitchcock thinks and moves . Then there is everything he ingested – the cigar smoking and drinking that 's imprinted on his voice . And everywhere he lived ; you can hear cockney London , California , and a plummy received pronunciation in that voice " . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 As part of its marketing campaign for The Girl , HBO released a 30 @-@ second trailer in August 2012 . During a Television Critics Association press tour promoting the film , Hedren said " I have to say that when I first heard Toby 's [ Jones ] voice as Alfred Hitchcock , my body just froze " . Hedren 's daughter , Melanie Griffith , attended a screening ; when the film ended , the audience was silent until Griffith said " Well , now I have to go back into therapy again ! " Hedren attended a London screening in October . The Girl made its US television debut on HBO and HBO Canada on 20 October 2012 . It had its UK premiere on 26 December , as part of BBC Two 's Christmas programming . The film was released on DVD in the UK on 7 January 2013 . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 Hedren gave Spoto an account of the director as a sexual predator for his 1983 book , The Dark Side of a Genius ( 1983 ) . Spoto wrote that Hitchcock made " an overt sexual proposition that she could neither ignore nor answer casually . " Hedren alleged in Spoto 's 2009 book , Spellbound by Beauty : Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies , that Hitchcock actually asked her to " make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted . " Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to . She said : " It was embarrassing and insulting — there were a lot of reasons why I didn ’ t want to tell the story . I didn ’ t want it to be taken advantage of , twisted , turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was . It wasn ’ t until years later that I told Donald the story . ( ... ) He is absolutely true and honest in this book . " She previously said , in 1973 , while Hitchcock was still alive , that a major life @-@ style difference caused a split in their relationship . " He was too possessive and too demanding . I cannot be possessed by anyone . But , then , that 's my own <unk> . " 
 Hedren 's account contrasted with the many interviews she gave about her time with Hitchcock , her warm tribute she paid to him when he was honoured with the AFI Life Achievement Award by the American Film Institute in 1979 , and her presence at his funeral . When asked about it , Hedren answered , " He ruined my career , but he didn ’ t ruin my life . That time of my life was over . I still admire the man for who he was . " 
 Shortly before the film was due to air on British television in December 2012 , Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock : " He made it very clear what was expected of me , but I was equally clear that I wasn 't interested ... Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant <unk> and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me . " Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies ' characters and appearances in his films , but they said that no harassment was involved . Eva Marie Saint , who starred in 1959 's North by Northwest , told The Daily Telegraph " Hitchcock was a gentleman , he was funny , he was so attentive to me , with the character , and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore . He had an eye for the specifics of the character . " 
 Kim Novak , who worked on Hitchcock 's 1957 Vertigo , disputed Hedren 's ( and the film 's ) view of the director . Novak told The Daily Telegraph , " I feel bad about all the stuff people are saying about him now , that he was a weird character . I did not find him to be weird at all . I never saw him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody . " Louise Latham , who played Hedren 's mother in Marnie , dismissed claims of Hitchcock 's predatory nature in Broadcast : " I find some of the allegations hard to believe ... I wasn 't aware of her being hassled on the set . " 
 Nora Brown ( widow of James H. Brown , first assistant director on The Birds and Marnie , who knew Hitchcock for several years ) said that her husband would not have endorsed The Girl 's interpretation of events and the film 's portrayal of Hitchcock would have saddened him . Gwyneth Hughes interviewed James Brown as part of her background research for the film , but he died before the film was completed . In October 2012 , Nora Brown told The Daily Telegraph that she had written to Hughes expressing her anger . Hughes has said that James H. Brown backed up Hedren 's claims of sexual harassment . Tony Lee Moral , author of two books about the making of the Hitchcock films in which Hedren starred , echoed Brown 's comments . Writing for Broadcast in December 2012 , Moral ( who interviewed Jim Brown at length for his 2013 book , The Making of Hitchcock 's The Birds ) recalled a remark Brown made about Hitchcock . " Some of the things that are expressed about [ Hitchcock ] are highly over exaggerated . I think Hitch became upset because he thought Tippi wasn 't fulfilling the star quality that he thought she had or was looking for . " 
 In an interview with FT Magazine 's Rosie Millard , Hedren discussed Hitchcock 's attitude towards her after she decided not to work for him again : " He did ruin my career . He kept me under contract , paid me to do nothing for close on two years . " Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios , which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows . However , her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions . Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock , he turned down several film roles on her behalf , and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451 . Truffaut 's daughter Laura disputed this , telling Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren 's possible involvement in the project . Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story . " It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting . "

 = = = Criticism and reaction = = = 
 The film 's portrayal of Hitchcock as a sexual predator was criticised . Some audience members at a British Film Institute private screening expressed their concerns that writer Gwyneth Hughes and director Julian Jarrold unfairly represented Hitchcock . On the day of its UK television premiere , David Millward of The Daily Telegraph quoted Eva Marie Saint , Doris Day and Kim Novak ( who worked with Hitchcock ) ; all refuted Hedren 's account of him . Writing for <unk> ( a website established in response to the media 's portrayal of Hitchcock ) , John Russell Taylor – author of the 1978 biography Hitch – said the film is " totally absurd " . 
 In an interview with London 's Evening Standard in January 2013 , Anthony Hopkins ( who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock ) questioned The Girl 's portrayal of the director and the need for a film about that period of Hitchcock 's career : " I talked to Tippi Hedren one day ... and she never mentioned that ... Whatever his obsession was , she didn 't want to dwell on it ... I don 't think it 's necessary to put all that into a movie . " Speaking to The Independent later that month , Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said , " [ The Girl ] seems a rare one @-@ note portrayal of a man who was a little more complex than that . A lot of people , who were there , do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster " . Danny Huston , who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock , told <unk> that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren 's account of him : " Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don 't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true . " 
 Tony Lee Moral questioned the accuracy of events depicted in the film , particularly their chronology ( which does not tally with his research into the production archives of The Birds and Marnie ) : " Why for example would Hitchcock offer Tippi the coveted part of Marnie on June 7 , 1962 , during filming of the sand dune scene in The Birds , only to deliberately attempt to physically harm her ... by smashing the glass telephone booth , which was filmed on June 12 only a few days later ? " 
 In October 2012 Hedren said although she believed the film accurately portrays Hitchcock 's negative behaviour towards her , the time constraints of a 90 @-@ minute film prevented telling the entire story of her career with him . She told television critic Rob Salem , " It wasn 't a constant barrage of harassment . If it had been constantly the way we have had to do it in this film , I would have been long gone " . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Before the film 's US television debut , Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times was critical of the film 's objectives : " [ T ] he trouble with The Girl is that it tries to <unk> Hitchcock but fails by trying to know the man too much . It 's a movie about Hitchcock that ignores his best advice : ' Suspense is like a woman . The more left to the imagination , the more the excitement ' " . Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review , writing that instead of a drama the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which " points to what everyone ought already to have been talking about in the first place : not least , that it 's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain , fear , control , and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life " . On the day of its UK premiere , James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was " no mere black @-@ and @-@ white hatchet job on Hitch . It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster ; rather , it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life " . The Guardian 's Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film : " [ T ] here was only one thing wrong with The Girl . There was no Hitchcock in the director 's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been . " 
 The Telegraph 's Nigel Farndale praised the film 's balanced view of the director : " [ E ] ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative , vindictive martinet , the portrait was not unsympathetic . " The Daily Mirror 's Jane Simon echoed this view , praising Jones 's Hitchcock and writing that the actor " managed to give [ Hitchcock ] touches of humanity , too . There are moments when you feel a real pang of sympathy for Hitchcock , although admittedly they don 't last long " . " [ G ] <unk> gracefully through it all ( and with an impeccable American accent ) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour , but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her . " In The Telegraph , Clive James said " [ a ] better choice [ to play Hedren ] could not have been made than Sienna Miller , who is even lovelier than Hedren was ... Toby Jones , quite believably looked stunned " . John Doyle of Canada 's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors ' performances . Of Miller ( whom he described as " good but not great " ) he wrote , " She doesn 't have the <unk> that Hedren had in her youth and she struggles to convey Hedren 's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way " . Doyle was equally critical of Jones , describing him as someone who " seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role " . 
 Historian Alex von Tunzelmann gave the film a mixed review in The Guardian : " The Girl is perhaps a more effective piece of film @-@ making than Hitchcock , though it is also more questionable in its portrayal of the director [ ... ] [ t ] he film depicts [ the attic scene ] accurately , though Jones 's Hitchcock appears to be more gratified by the spectacle than the real Hitch was " . Simon quotes Donald Spoto 's book The Dark Side of Genius ( 1983 ) , in which Hedren told Spoto " [ Hitchcock ] was terribly upset by all this " ; screenwriter Evan Hunter said , " [ h ] e wanted to shoot it , but something in him didn 't want to shoot it , and everybody could hear how nervous he was " . Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths , but instead as " an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style " , calling The Girl " an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock 's talent and vision " .

 = Starflight = 
 Starflight is a space exploration role @-@ playing adventure video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986 . Originally developed for IBM compatible and Tandy systems , it was later released for the Amiga , Atari ST , Macintosh and Commodore 64 . A fully revamped version of the game was developed for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis in 1991 . 
 Set in the year 4620 , the game puts players in the role of a starship captain sent to explore the galaxy . There is no set path , allowing players to switch freely between mining , ship @-@ to @-@ ship combat , and alien diplomacy . The broader plot of the game emerges slowly , as the player discovers that an ancient race of beings is causing stars to flare and destroy all living creatures . 
 The game has been widely praised by both contemporary and modern critics , and is one of the earliest instances of a sandbox game . It led to the development of a sequel , Starflight 2 : Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula , and influenced the design of numerous other games for decades after its release . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player begins inside a space station called <unk> orbiting the planet Arth . Here they buy and sell minerals , Endurium ( fuel ) , and artifacts , recruit and train crew members , and upgrade parts of the ship . The player hires a crew from five species to man the ship 's six posts : navigator , science officer , engineer , communications officer , doctor , and captain . A crewman 's proficiency is determined by the relevant skill : a science officer with a high science skill can determine more of a planet 's properties and detect aliens at a greater range , for example . Skills are increased through training , which must be purchased . One crewman can man multiple posts , but different species have different maximum skill levels . The ship is initially equipped only with engines and a limited supply of Endurium , a type of crystal used as fuel . The ship can be modified and upgraded through the purchase of weapons , armor , and shields . 
 The goals of the game include exploration , collection of lifeforms and minerals , and finding habitable colony worlds . Eventually , a larger goal of finding out why stars in the region are flaring dangerously and stopping the process , if possible , comes to the forefront . The main sources of income are selling minerals , artifacts , and lifeforms and recommending planets for colonization . The ship is equipped with a Terrain Vehicle that the crew can use to look for minerals and life @-@ forms . The most lucrative source of income is finding planets suitable for human life . If the science officer 's analysis shows a planet to be within acceptable parameters , the player can have the captain log a planet for colonization . 
 Starflight has 270 star systems , each containing from zero to eight planets for a total of 800 . All star systems can be entered and all planets landed on , though this destroys the ship if the gravity is greater than 8 @.@ 0 g . The science officer can scan and analyze the planet for information about it , including its temperature , gravity , and chemical composition . When a landing is ordered , a Mercator projection map shows the topography of each planet , as well as a cursor to select a landing point . Once the ship lands , a Terrain Vehicle can be deployed to drive across the terrain , which is periodically scanned for new information , in search of minerals , lifeforms , and alien ruins . As is the case in outer space , a heads @-@ up display monitors the Terrain Vehicle 's status . 
 Space is also crisscrossed with continuum fluxes , coordinate pairs that allow instantaneous travel between them without consuming fuel . Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly on fuel costs and travel time , though it causes all but the most accomplished navigators to lose their bearings . 
 Aliens may be cautious , friendly , or hostile , and all have distinctive speech patterns ; the player can influence alien reactions by arming weapons and shields or hailing the aliens with varying communication styles . Alien ships can be also scanned for information . Combat involves maneuvering the ship and firing weapons , either instantly damaging short range lasers or avoidable , but more powerful long range missiles . The weapon used depends on how far away enemy ships are and what the player 's ship is armed with . The player 's ship has ablative armor and regenerative shields , and can take damage to its hull and individual components .

 The galaxy is composed of eight space @-@ faring races , five of which can be hired as part of the player 's crew . Humans only exist on Arth and are not found among the stars . Other species include <unk> , large insects who demand bribes from ships which violate their space ; <unk> , androids left over from the days of the Old Empire ; <unk> , a pacifistic race of sentient plants ; <unk> , reptile creatures who are primarily interested in money ; <unk> , gelatinous blobs who are known for their cowardice ; <unk> , octopus @-@ like religious zealots who regard all " air @-@ breathers " as infidels ; and <unk> , a destructive fleet of ships with a hive mind . Humor also plays a role within Starflight . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The story begins on the planet Arth , a haven for the survivors of the Old Empire . Due to heavy radiation , the inhabitants have been forced to live beneath the planet 's crust for centuries . In recent times , the radiation has finally dissipated from the surface , allowing the population to unearth long @-@ lost technology belonging to Arth 's original settlers . The inhabitants of Arth have recently discovered two things : first , that they were once a colony world of Earth ; and second , Endurium , a crystalline mineral that fuels interstellar flight . 
 An independent company called Interstel is dispatching ships to mine for resources , particularly Endurium . In addition , Interstel employees are instructed to seek information about Arth 's history , alien artifacts , and planets with optimum environments for colonization . Early in the game , Arth scientists discover that stars throughout the local region of the galaxy are flaring , and the home planet of Arth is in danger . 
 By following clues given in Interstel announcements and through contact with alien races in space , the crew discovers an Old Empire starship adrift in space . An endlessly repeating distress call has been transmitting from the ship for over a thousand years . Before the fall of the Old Empire , a scientific expedition known as the Noah 9 left Earth in search of Heaven , a paradise world to which humans could immigrate . The expedition never arrived , leaving a fleet of <unk> ships forever waiting for their arrival . Once their coded questions are answered correctly , the <unk> assume that the crew is , in fact , the long @-@ awaited Noah 9 . Further investigation leads the crew to Earth , the home world of the Old Empire . The planet lies in ruins and is devoid of all life , but contains information about the history of Old Empire and its fate . 
 Additional clues are found in the Four Seedlings , a <unk> symmetrical system made up of four suns . Centuries ago , the leaders of the Old Empire realized something was causing hostile aliens to flee from the center of the galaxy . The greatest minds from each of the races gathered at this location , where they discovered that the Crystal Planet was slowly eradicating all life . In a last act , they sent a human named Commander McConnell to end it , but he failed . At the start of the game , the Crystal Planet is slowly moving through the galaxy . The planet causes nearby stars to flare up and destroy all life in the system . 
 The player must explore solar systems , gather clues , and find special artifacts that grant access to the Crystal Planet , ultimately destroying it before the player 's home system flares . Commander McConnell 's last journal entry can be found on the surface of the Crystal Planet ; in it , he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living , sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel . Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup , they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus . The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet 's surface and retreats back into space , causing the planet to explode , though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed . 
 = = Development = = 
 Starflight was developed by Binary Systems , a five @-@ man team consisting of Rod McConnell , Greg Johnson ( lead designer ) , Alec <unk> ( programming ) , Tim C. Lee ( graphics and programming ) , and Bob Gonsalves ( sound ) . Then @-@ vice president of Electronic Arts Joe Ybarra was also closely involved , and produced the work . The original idea for making a video game was conceived by McConnell and Ybarra in 1983 . McConnell hired colleague Dave Boulton , who had an idea for using fractals to generate an endless virtual universe , along with <unk> , Gonsalves , Lee , and Johnson , all of whom were first time game designers . Boulton quit the project early on in development , saying it was too ambitious , with Lee replacing him . 
 The team coded the game mostly in Forth with a few key routines written in assembler for speed . Forth was chosen since it was easier to use than assembler and more compact . This was important because the game had to fit into 128K of RAM . Many tools , techniques , and concepts used in the game were learned from other individuals in the Forth community . Some of the reference material included the " The Journal of Forth Application and Research " , <unk> conference proceedings , and " Forth Dimensions " magazine . 
 It took " fifteen man @-@ years " and three actual years to develop the game . In a 2006 interview , lead designer Johnson said , " I had never really designed a game before ... It 's funny looking back on it now — just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded . " Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once , and came out about a year behind schedule . Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development . Reiche advised him to draft a " story network " that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in @-@ game objects necessary to advance from one to the next . The designers rewrote the script multiple times . The group designed what they called a " fractal generator " , which took six man @-@ years to develop and allowed them to increase the number of planets in the game from 50 to 800 . They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man @-@ years of work . The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked , and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion . 
 Starflight was released for PC on August 15 , 1986 . Originally available only on IBM , Tandy , and compatible DOS systems , it was released for the Amiga and Commodore 64 systems in 1989 and the Atari ST and Macintosh systems in 1990 , and was ported to the Sega Genesis in 1991 . The Sega version features a few changes to the overall game , such as new graphics , modifications to the ship , and upgrades for the Terrain Vehicle , including equipment to allow amphibious mining . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Critical response to Starflight upon its release was extremely positive . Hartley and Patricia Lesser complimented the game in their " The Role of Computers " column in the December 1986 issue of Dragon , calling it " stunning in its presentation and play " . In 1986 and 1987 , Computer Gaming World declared it " the best space exploration game in years " and " the best science fiction game available on computer " . The magazine named Starflight its Adventure Game of the Year for 1987 , and in August 1988 , it joined the magazine 's Hall of Fame for games highly rated over time by readers , with the third @-@ highest rating for action / adventure games on the list , and the fourth @-@ highest overall . 
 Science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle named Starflight his game of the month for January 1987 , stating that it was " as much a career as a game " and " fascinating " . Fellow writer Orson Scott Card wrote , " Starflight is the first science fiction computer game that actually gives you something of the experience of roaming through the galaxy . ... I have found this game obsessively fascinating — and the graphics and player interface are superb " . He called it the " Star Wars of science fiction games . <unk> designed and programmed ... the standard against which all other space @-@ exploration games must be measured " . Compute ! listed it in May 1988 as one of " Our Favorite Games " , stating that " Starflight captures the feel of a certain type of science fiction ... the game can take hundreds of hours to play fully , yet those hours are anything but boring " . 
 By December 1987 , the game had sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies , and it eventually went on to sell over a million copies . Ybarra said at the time that the game had created a " beachhead in the arena of sci @-@ fi " for Electronic Arts . Lee said in 2010 , " I knew it was a classic while we were building it " . Starflight was one of the earliest games to use procedurally generated content for its planets and everything on them . The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet , with the contents randomly distributed . The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design . 
 Starflight had a sequel , Starflight 2 : Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula . Ybarra went on to create <unk> , another space exploration adventure . Reiche was inspired by the game to create Star Control , with Johnson coding three of the alien species in the game ; Computer Gaming World called Star Control II a spiritual successor to Starflight . Mass Effect director Casey Hudson tweeted in 2011 that " Starflight was a key inspiration for the ME series . " Starflight is often cited along with Elite , which appeared two years earlier with similar gameplay , as early open world space exploration games . Dwarf Fortress 's forgotten beasts were inspired by the procedurally generated lifeforms within Starflight . 
 Starflight has also received favorable reviews from critics and commentators decades after its release . Erin Hoffman of The Escapist in 2010 called it " one of the great breakthroughs in gaming " . In 2012 , Lee Hutchinson of Ars Technica called the game " a thing of awe and reverence " and said it " defined the genre of space exploration games " . 
 = Winsor McCay = 
 Zenas Winsor McCay ( c . 1867 – 71 or September 26 , 1869 – July 26 , 1934 ) was an American cartoonist and animator . He is best known for the comic strip Little Nemo ( 1905 – 14 ; 1924 – 26 ) and the animated film Gertie the Dinosaur ( 1914 ) . For contractual reasons , he worked under the pen name Silas on the comic strip Dream of the Rarebit Fiend . 
 From a young age , McCay was a quick , prolific , and technically dextrous artist . He started his professional career making posters and performing for dime museums , and began illustrating newspapers and magazines in 1898 . He joined the New York Herald in 1903 , where he created popular comic strips such as Little Sammy Sneeze and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend . In 1905 , his signature strip Little Nemo in Slumberland debuted , a fantasy strip in an Art Nouveau style , about a young boy and his adventurous dreams . The strip demonstrated McCay 's strong graphic sense and mastery of color and linear perspective . McCay experimented with the formal elements of the comic strip page , arranging and sizing panels to increase impact and enhance the narrative . McCay also produced numerous detailed editorial cartoons and was a popular performer of chalk talks on the vaudeville circuit . 
 McCay was an early animation pioneer ; between 1911 and 1921 he self @-@ financed and animated ten films , some of which survive only as fragments . The first three served in his vaudeville act ; Gertie the Dinosaur was an interactive routine in which McCay appeared to give orders to a trained dinosaur . McCay and his assistants worked for twenty @-@ two months on his most ambitious film , The Sinking of the Lusitania ( 1918 ) , a patriotic recreation of the German torpedoing in 1915 of the RMS Lusitania . Lusitania did not enjoy as much commercial success as the earlier films , and McCay 's later movies attracted little attention . His animation , vaudeville , and comic strip work was gradually curtailed as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst , his employer since 1911 , expected McCay to devote his energies to editorial illustrations . 
 In his drawing , McCay made bold , prodigious use of linear perspective , particularly in detailed architecture and cityscapes . He textured his editorial cartoons with copious fine hatching , and made color a central element in Little Nemo . His comic strip work has influenced generations of cartoonists and illustrators . The technical level of McCay 's animation — its naturalism , smoothness , and scale — was unmatched until Walt Disney 's feature films arrived in the 1930s . He pioneered inbetweening , the use of registration marks , cycling , and other animation techniques that were to become standard . 
 = = Personal history = = 
 = = = Family history = = = 
 McCay 's paternal grandparents , farmers Donald and Christiana McKay , immigrated from Scotland to Upper Canada in the mid @-@ 1830s . McCay 's father , Robert McKay ( 1840 – March 21 , 1915 ) was born in Woodstock , Upper Canada , the third of six children . McCay 's maternal grandparents , Peter and Mary Murray , were also Scottish immigrants , and settled as farmers in East Zorra in Upper Canada . Their daughter Janet was the third of nine children . 
 Robert was a member of King Solomon 's No. 43 Masonic Lodge in Woodstock . In 1862 , Robert first traveled to the U.S. Robert and the twenty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old Janet married on January 8 , 1866 , at Woodstock 's Methodist Episcopal Church . The couple moved across the American border later in the year and settled in Spring Lake , Michigan , on the eastern coast of Lake Michigan . Robert was employed by American entrepreneur Zenas G. Winsor ( 1814 – 90 ) , with whom he had made contact in Canada . 
 Records of McCay 's birth are not extant . He stated in an interview in 1910 that he was born in 1869 , and this is the year listed on his grave marker . Late in life , he told friends he was born September 26 , 1871 , in Spring Lake , and they published this information in a magazine . Michigan census records from 1870 and 1880 list a Zenas W. McKay , who was born in Canada in 1867 . No Canadian birth record has been found , and a fire in Spring Lake in May 1893 could have destroyed any American birth record he may have had . His obituary in the New York Herald Tribune stated , " not even Mr. McCay knew his exact age " . 
 The McCays had two more children : Arthur in 1868 , and Mae in 1876 . Both were born in Michigan . Robert worked as a teamster under Winsor , and by May 1870 had saved enough money to buy a parcel of land . From 1879 to 1881 he worked as a retail grocer . In 1885 he moved the family to Stanton , Michigan , and expanded his land holdings ; he was successful in real estate with his brother Hugh , who moved from Canada in 1887 . 
 By 1905 , Robert was also a notary public . He had settled in Edmore , Michigan , and by this point had changed the spelling of his surname from " McKay " to " McCay " . His son related this story about the change : 
 " Three Scotsmen of the clan McKay were looking for a fourth member to fight four members of the Irish clan Magee ... ' I 'm not one of you , ' my father pointed out . ' You see , I 'm one of the clan M @-@ c @-@ C @-@ A @-@ Y. ' And that is how I got both my name and my sense of humor . " 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 McCay came to be known by his middle name , Winsor . His drawing skills emerged early . According to a story told within the family , McCay made his first drawing in the aftermath of one of the many fires that hit Spring Lake : he picked up a nail and etched the scene of the fire in the frost of a <unk> . Drawing became obsessive for him ; he drew anything he saw , and the level of detail and accuracy in his drawing was noted at a young age . He was able to draw accurately from memory even things he had never before drawn — what McCay called " memory sketching " . His father thought little of his son 's artistic talents , though , and had him sent to Cleary Business College in Ypsilanti , Michigan . McCay rarely attended classes . He bragged about how he would catch the train to Detroit to show off his drawing skills at the Wonderland and Eden Musee dime museum . He drew portraits there for 25 ¢ apiece , of which he kept half . 
 McCay thrived on the attention he received , and his talents soon drew wider attention . John Goodison , a geography and drawing professor at Michigan state Normal School , offered to teach art to McCay privately , and McCay eagerly accepted . The lessons were practical and focused on using observation to learn to draw in geometrical perspective . Goodison , a former glass <unk> , influenced McCay 's use of color . McCay learned how to draw quickly using drills on a blackboard , and gained an appreciation for master artists of the past . 
 = = = Early career ( 1889 – 1903 ) = = = 
 McCay spent two years in Chicago after making his way there sometime in 1889 with his friend Mort <unk> . He traded art techniques there with painter Jules Guérin , whom he met at a boarding house in which he lodged , and did artwork for posters and pamphlets at the National Printing and Engraving Company . 
 In 1891 , McCay moved to Cincinnati , where he did more dime museum work while living in a boarding house near his workplace . He spent nine years making posters and other advertisements for the Kohl & Middleton Dime Museum , and later Heck and Avery 's Family Theater ( 1896 ) , Avery 's New Dime Museum ( 1898 ) , and Will S. Heck 's Wonder World and Theater ( 1899 ) on Vine Street . At the museum in 1896 , a demonstration of Thomas Edison 's Vitascope was given , which was likely McCay 's first exposure to the young medium of film . He also did work during this time for Ph. Morton 's printing and lithography company . McCay 's ability to draw quickly with great accuracy drew crowds when he painted advertisements in public . 
 His first year at Kohl & Middleton , McCay was smitten when Maude Leonore Dufour walked into the dime museum with her sister while he was painting . He rushed to his studio to change into a custom @-@ tailored suit , returned , and introduced himself to the fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Maude . Soon they eloped in Covington , Kentucky . 
 McCay began working on the side for the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune , where he learned to draw with a dip pen under the tutelage of Commercial Tribune art room manager Joseph Alexander . In 1898 , he accepted a full @-@ time position there . His many illustrations for the paper displayed his bold use of perspective and mastery of <unk> . Soon after , he began freelancing for the humor magazine Life as well . 
 In 1900 , McCay accepted a position with a higher salary at The Cincinnati Enquirer . There , he produced a prolific number of drawings , did some reporting , and became head of the art department . In his drawings , he began using line thickness to indicate depth , and used thick lines to surround his characters in an Art Nouveau @-@ inspired style that became a trademark of his work . 
 = = = Comic strips ( 1903 – 1911 ) = = = 
 From January until November 1903 , McCay drew an ongoing proto @-@ comic strip for the Enquirer based on poems written by George Randolph Chester called A Tale of the Jungle Imps by Felix Fiddle . Before the last two instalments appeared in print , McCay had moved to New York City to work for James Gordon Bennett , Jr . ' s New York Herald , at first doing illustrations and editorial cartoons . He worked alongside comic strip pioneer Richard F. Outcault , who was doing the Buster Brown strip at the Herald . A rivalry built up between the two cartoonists which resulted in Outcault leaving the Herald to return to his previous employer , William Randolph Hearst at The New York Journal . 
 McCay 's first continuing comic strip , Mr. Goodenough , debuted in the Evening Telegram on January 21 , 1904 . The formula for the strip was that a sedentary millionaire would seek ways to become more active , with embarrassing results . Sister 's Little Sister 's Beau , McCay 's first strip with a child protagonist , lasted one instalment that April , and his first color strip , <unk> <unk> of <unk> Philipe 's <unk> <unk> , appeared in the Herald 's Sunday supplement that May . 
 McCay 's first popular comic strip was Little Sammy Sneeze . The strip starred a young boy whose sneeze would build panel by panel until it was released , with explosively disastrous results , for which he was usually punished or chased away by those affected . The strip debuted in July 1904 and ran until December 1906 . 
 McCay 's longest @-@ running strip , Dream of the Rarebit Fiend , first appeared in the Evening Telegram in September 1904 . The strip was aimed at an adult audience , and had no recurring characters . The characters that appeared in the strip would have fantastic , sometimes terrifying dreams , only to wake up in the last panel , cursing the Welsh rarebit they had eaten the night before , which they blamed for bringing on the dream . Rarebit Fiend was so popular that a book collection appeared in 1905 from publisher Frederick A. Stokes . It was adapted to film by Edwin S. Porter , and plans were made for a " comic opera or musical extravaganza " for stage that failed to materialize . McCay signed the Rarebit Fiend strips with the pen name " Silas " , as his contract required that he not use his real name for his Evening Telegram work . 
 The McCays had been living in Manhattan , close to the Herald offices ; before 1905 they moved to Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn , New York , a seaside resort on Long Island . It was an hour commute from the Herald offices , but they believed it to be a better place to raise children . They lived at a number of addresses before settling into a three @-@ story house at 1901 Voorhies Avenue , where McCay resided for the rest of his life . As his reputation grew , his employers allowed him to work from his home studio more often . 
 While still turning out illustrations and editorial cartoons daily , McCay began three more continuing strips in 1905 . In January , he began The Story of Hungry Henrietta , in which the child protagonist visibly ages week by week , and eats compulsively in lieu of the love she craves from her parents . A Pilgrim 's Progress by Mister Bunion was another " Silas " strip for the Evening Telegram , which ran from June 1905 until December 1910 . Mr. Bunion spent each strip unsuccessfully scheming to rid himself of his suitcase , labeled " Dull Care " . 
 McCay got " an idea from the Rarebit Fiend to please the little folk " , and in October 1905 the full @-@ page Sunday strip Little Nemo in Slumberland debuted in the Herald . Considered McCay 's masterpiece , its child protagonist had fabulous dreams , interrupted each week with his awakening in the final panel . Nemo 's appearance was based on McCay 's son Robert . McCay experimented with formal aspects of the comics page : he made inventive use of timing and pacing , the size and shape of panels , perspective , and architectural and other details . The Herald was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time ; its printing staff used the Ben Day process for color , and McCay annotated the Nemo pages with precise color schemes for the printers . 
 Impresario F. F. Proctor approached McCay in April 1906 to perform chalk talks for the vaudeville circuit . For $ 500 per week he was to draw twenty @-@ five sketches in fifteen minutes before live audiences , as a pit band played a piece called " Dream of the Rarebit Fiend " . In his The Seven Ages of Man routine , he drew two faces and progressively aged them . His first performance was on June 11 , 1906 , in a show that also featured entertainer W. C. Fields . It was a success , and McCay toured with the show throughout 1907 , while managing to complete his comic strip and illustration work on time , often working in hotel rooms or backstage . 
 As early as 1905 , several abortive attempts were made to produce a stage version of Little Nemo . In mid @-@ 1907 , Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant Little Nemo show for an unprecedented $ 100 @,@ 000 , with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith . It starred midget Gabriel Weigel as Nemo , Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill , and Billy B. Van as Flip . Reviews were positive ; it played to sold @-@ out houses in New York and toured for two seasons . McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where Little Nemo played . When the Keith circuit refused McCay to perform in Boston without a new act , McCay switched to the William Morris circuit , with a $ 100 @-@ a @-@ week raise . In several cities , McCay brought his son , who as publicity sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo . 
 As part of an improvised story , Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a " <unk> " . The word caught on with the public , and became the name of a hit song and a singing group . Despite the show 's success , it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses and came to an end in December 1910 . 
 McCay displayed his social awareness in the last strip he created for the Herald , Poor Jake . Its title character was a silent laborer who worked <unk> for a Colonel and Mrs. Stall , who exploit him . The strip ran from 1909 until spring 1911 . 
 McCay was approached in early 1910 to bring his vaudeville show to Europe . McCay requested the Herald 's permission , but the plans never materialized . His show stayed within the eastern U.S. until he ceased performing in 1917 . Biographer John Canemaker assumed McCay 's request to tour Europe was turned down , and that the refusal added to McCay 's growing frustration with the Herald . A distrust of big business became pronounced in McCay 's work around this time , including a story arc in Little Nemo in which the characters visit a Mars oppressed by a greedy business magnate . 
 = = = Animation ( 1911 – 1921 ) = = = 
 McCay said he was most proud of his animation work . He completed ten animated films between 1911 and 1921 , and three more were planned . 
 Inspired by the flip books his son brought home , McCay " came to see the possibility of making moving pictures " of his cartoons . He claimed to be " the first man in the world to make animated cartoons " , though he was preceded by others such as James Stuart Blackton and Émile Cohl . McCay made four thousand drawings on rice paper for his first animated short , which starred his Little Nemo characters . They were shot at Vitagraph Studios under Blackton 's supervision . Live @-@ action sequences were added to the beginning and end of the film , in which McCay bets his newspaper colleagues that in one month he can make four thousand drawings that move . Among those featured in these sequences were cartoonist George McManus and actor John Bunny . Little Nemo debuted in movie theatres on April 8 , 1911 , and four days later McCay began using it as part of his vaudeville act . Its good reception motivated him to hand @-@ color each of the frames of the originally black @-@ and @-@ white animation . 
 McCay had become frustrated with the Herald , partly over money issues and partly because he perceived a lack of freedom . He accepted a higher @-@ paying offer in spring 1911 from Hearst at the New York American and took Little Nemo 's characters with him . The Herald held the strip 's copyright , but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters , which he did under the title In the Land of Wonderful Dreams . The Herald was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip . 
 McCay began work that May on his next animated film , How a Mosquito Operates , based on a Rarebit Fiend episode from June 5 , 1909 , in which a man in bed tries in vain to defend himself from a giant mosquito , which drinks itself so full that it explodes . The animation is naturalistic — rather than expanding like a balloon , with each sip of blood the mosquito 's abdomen swells according to its body structure . The film was completed in January 1912 , and McCay toured with it that spring and summer . 
 Gertie the Dinosaur debuted in February 1914 as part of McCay 's vaudeville act . McCay introduced Gertie as " the only dinosaur in captivity " , and commanded the animated beast with a whip . Gertie seemed to obey McCay , bowing to the audience , and eating a tree and a boulder , though she had a will of her own and sometimes rebelled . When McCay admonished her , she cried . McCay consoled her by throwing her an apple — in reality pocketing the cardboard prop apple as a cartoon one simultaneously appeared on screen . In the finale , McCay walked offstage , reappeared in animated form in the film , and had Gertie carry him away . Producer William Fox 's Box Office Attractions obtained distribution rights to a modified version of Gertie that could be played in regular movie theaters . This version was prefaced with a live @-@ action sequence and replaced the interactive portions with intertitles . 
 Gertie was McCay 's first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds . McCay drew the foreground characters , while art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons traced the backgrounds . McCay pioneered the " McCay Split System " of inbetweening , in which major poses or positions were drawn first , and the intervening frames drawn after . This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film 's actions . McCay refused to patent his system , and was sued in 1914 by animator John Randolph Bray , who took advantage of McCay 's lapse by patenting many of McCay 's techniques , including the use of registration marks , tracing paper , the Mutoscope action viewer , and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action . The lawsuit was unsuccessful , and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued — he thereafter received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques . 
 Hearst was disappointed with the quality of McCay 's newspaper work . Infuriated that he couldn 't reach McCay during a vaudeville performance , Hearst pulled from his papers advertising for the theatre where McCay performed . Editor Arthur Brisbane told him that he was " a serious artist , not a comic cartoonist " , and that he was to give up his comic strip work to focus on editorial illustrations . Hearst pressured McCay 's agents to reduce the number of his vaudeville appearances , and he was induced to sign a contract with Hearst that limited his vaudeville appearances to greater New York , with occasional exceptions . In February 1917 , Hearst had McCay give up entirely on vaudeville and all other paid work outside the Hearst empire , though he was occasionally granted permission for particular shows . Hearst increased McCay 's salary to cover the loss of income . 
 McCay was expected to report daily to the American building , where he shared a ninth @-@ floor office with humorist Arthur " Bugs " Baer and sports cartoonist Joe McGurk . There , he illustrated editorials by Arthur Brisbane , who often sent back McCay 's drawings with instructions for changes . The quality of his drawings varied depending on his interest in the subject of the assignment , whether or not he agreed with the sentiments portrayed , and on events in his personal life . For example , in March 1914 he was subjected to a blackmail plot by a Mrs. Lambkin , who was seeking a divorce from her husband . Lambkin alleged that McCay 's wife Maude was seeing her husband . With McCay 's level of fame , such a story would likely be in the papers , and Mrs. Lambkin and her husband told McCay that she would keep it secret for $ 1 @,@ 000 . McCay did not believe the allegations , and gave testimony at the <unk> ' divorce trial . The blackmail failed , and the divorce was not granted . 
 Hearst animation studio International Film Service began in December 1915 , and brought Hearst cartoonists to the screen . McCay was initially listed as one of them , but the studio never produced anything either by his hands or featuring his creations . McCay derived satisfaction from doing the work himself . Begun in 1916 , The Sinking of the Lusitania was his follow @-@ up to Gertie . The film was not a fantasy but a detailed , realistic recreation of the 1915 German torpedoing of the RMS Lusitania . The event counted 128 Americans among its 1 @,@ 198 dead , and was a factor leading to the American entry into World War I. 
 McCay 's daughter Marion married military man Raymond T. Moniz , eighteen years her senior , on October 13 , 1917 . She gave birth to McCay 's first grandchild , Ray Winsor Moniz , on July 16 , 1918 . Moniz and McCay 's son Robert were called up for service when the U.S. entered World War I. 
 McCay 's self @-@ financed Lusitania took nearly two years to complete . With the assistance of John Fitzsimmons and Cincinnati cartoonist William Apthorp " Ap " Adams , McCay spent his off hours drawing the film on sheets of cellulose acetate ( or " cels " ) with white and black India ink at McCay 's home . It was the first film McCay made using cels , a technology animator Earl Hurd had patented in 1914 ; it saved work by allowing dynamic drawings to be made on one or more layers , which could be laid over a static background layer , relieving animators of the tedium of retracing static images onto drawing after drawing . McCay had the cels photographed at the Vitagraph studios . The film was naturalistically animated , and made use of dramatic camera angles that would have been impossible in a live @-@ action film . 
 Jewel Productions released the film on July 20 , 1918 . Advertising touted it as " the picture that will never have a competitor " ; the film itself called McCay " the originator and inventor of Animated Cartoons " and drew attention to the fact that it took 25 @,@ 000 drawings to complete . The Sinking of the Lusitania did not greatly return on McCay 's investment — after a few years ' run in theaters , it netted $ 80 @,@ 000 . 
 McCay continued to produce animated films using cels . By 1921 , he had completed six , though three were likely never shown commercially to audiences and have survived only in fragments : The Centaurs , Flip 's Circus , and Gertie on Tour . In 1921 , he released three films based on Dream of the Rarebit Fiend : Bug Vaudeville , in which insects and other creepy @-@ crawlies perform on stage ; The Pet , in which a creature with a bottomless appetite grows enormously and terrorizes the city in a way reminiscent of King Kong ; and The Flying House , in which a man attaches wings to his house to flee from debt . McCay 's son Robert is credited with the animation on this last film , but Canemaker notes it is highly unlikely that a first @-@ time animator could have produced such an accomplished piece of animation .

 After 1921 , McCay was made to give up on animation when Hearst learned he devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations . Unexecuted ideas McCay had for animation projects included a collaboration with Jungle Imps author George Randolph Chester , a musical film called The Barnyard Band , and a film about the Americans ' role in World War I. 
 McCay 's son Robert married Theresa " <unk> " Munchausen on April 9 , 1921 . McCay bought them a nearby house as a wedding gift . The couple gave McCay two more grandchildren : Janet ( named after McCay 's mother ) in 1922 , and Robert in 1928 . Robert suffered shell shock during World War I , and following the war had difficulty drawing . McCay tried to boost his son 's confidence by finding him cartooning work , and some of the elder McCay 's editorial cartoons were signed " Robert Winsor McCay , Jr . " 
 In 1922 , McCay resumed doing vaudeville shows for the Keith circuit . He had a cameo in a newspaper office scene in the boxing film The Great White Way in early 1924 . 
 McCay left Hearst upon the expiration of his contract in May 1924 , bitter over not having received a promised $ 5 @,@ 000 bonus . He returned to the Herald Tribune , and brought back Little Nemo beginning that August . The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old , but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid . Nemo took a more passive role in the stories , and there was no continuity . The strip came to an end in December 1926 , as it was not popular with readers . Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the American , and succeeded in 1927 . While McCay was gone , his place had been filled by Mel <unk> , who was let go after McCay 's return . Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo 's success , the Herald Tribune signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar . 
 In 1927 , McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York . After a considerable amount of drinking , McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer . McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice , but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention , he berated his audience , saying , " Animation is an art . That is how I conceived it . But as I see , what you fellows have done with it , is making it into a trade . Not an art , but a trade . Bad Luck ! " That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC , and on November 2 he was interviewed by Frank Craven for The Evening Journal 's Woman 's Hour . During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation . 
 An executive of the American Tobacco Company approached McCay in 1929 to do an advertising campaign for a financial " sum in excess of his annual salary " . Brisbane refused , noting that McCay 's contract didn 't allow outside work . When the executive stormed into Brisbane 's office threatening to pull American Tobacco 's advertising dollars from the American , Brisbane provided a written release for the work . 
 In 1932 , McCay found himself in what he recalled as " the wildest ride " in his life when Hearst 's son " Young Bill " drove him at 85 miles per hour ( 137 km / h ) to the scene of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby . They arrived there two hours after the crime was first reported to police , and were able to interview the gathered police before the grounds were closed off to the public . McCay sketched the scene , the staff , and the ladders the kidnappers used , which he was allowed to see up close . 
 McCay enjoyed robust health most of his life . On July 26 , 1934 , he complained to his wife of a severe headache . To his horror , he found his right arm — his drawing arm — was paralyzed . He lost consciousness and was pronounced dead later that afternoon , with his wife , children , and son @-@ in @-@ law by his side . He had died of a cerebral embolism , and was buried at the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn in a family plot . He had a Masonic funeral in his home , attended by his newspaper colleagues , Hearst and his son , and the Society of Illustrators , among others . 
 Brisbane hired back Mel <unk> to replace McCay . Due to his lavish lifestyle , McCay left a smaller fortune than those around him had expected . By the early 1940s , Maude had used up her inheritance and sold the house on Voorhies Avenue . When she died of a heart attack on March 2 , 1949 , she was living with her daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law . Son Robert was also careless with his inheritance , and less successful in art than his father . He worked for a short time at the Hearst papers , and tried unsuccessfully to get a job at the Disney studios , before finding a career as illustrator for Training Aids / Special Services at Fort Ord. 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Self @-@ conscious and introverted in private , McCay was nevertheless a charismatic showman and self @-@ promoter , and maintained several lifelong friendships . McCay was a light but frequent drinker ; he drank for camaraderie rather than for a love of drinking . To his wife 's chagrin , McCay was a smoker of cigars and cigarettes . He was self @-@ taught at the piano , and was an avid reader of poetry , plays and novels ; he admired W. B. Yeats , knew the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats , and could quote the Bible and Shakespeare . 
 McCay stood barely five feet ( 150 cm ) tall , and felt dominated by his wife , who was nearly as tall as he was . McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour , the youngest of three daughters of French @-@ Canadian carriage painter John Dufour . About a decade separated the couple 's ages : Winsor was 24 and Maude only 14 when they married . Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCay 's birthdate , even by McCay himself , as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenage girl . Maude was also notably age @-@ conscious , as she preferred her grandchildren to call her " Nan " instead of " Grandma " and also dyed her hair as she got older . The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time , in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker . Neither spouse got along well with the other 's mother . 
 The couple had two children : Robert Winsor , born June 21 , 1896 ; and Marion Elizabeth , born August 22 , 1897 . McCay was said to be easygoing with the children , and left discipline to their stern mother . Marion felt domineered by her mother and perceived that her brother was her mother 's favorite ; she was closer to her father and often appeared in public with him . Robert looked up to his father and became an artist himself . He was proud to have served as the model for Little Nemo . 
 The McCays lived lavishly . McCay disliked driving , so kept a chauffeur who also served as bodyguard , as the editorial cartoons McCay drew for Hearst sometimes attracted threatening letters . Maude made daily trips by limousine to shop in upscale downtown Brooklyn with other well @-@ to @-@ do wives . Maude often complained to her husband , but he refused to discuss matters with her . 
 McCay 's politics are unclear , and it is disputed whether he sympathized with the viewpoints displayed in his editorial cartoons . He was agnostic and believed in reincarnation . He was a lifelong member of the Freemasons , which he may have joined as early as when he was living in Chicago . His father had also been a Freemason , and was buried in 1915 with full Masonic rites , with funerals arranged by his Masonic lodges in both Woodstock , Ontario , and Edmore , Michigan . His mother often visited him in Brooklyn , and attended Little Nemo 's Philadelphia premiere . She died in Edmore , Michigan , in 1927 . 
 McCay 's brother Arthur was placed in a mental hospital in Traverse City , Michigan on March 7 , 1898 , where he stayed until his death from bronchopneumonia and arteriosclerosis on June 15 , 1946 . He never received family visits . McCay never let his children know about his brother , nor did they know about the existence of his sister Mae , who died in 1910 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In 1937 , McCay 's son Robert attempted to carry on his father 's legacy by reviving Little Nemo . Comic book packager Harry " A " Chesler 's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily Nemo strip , credited to " Winsor McCay , Jr . " Robert also drew a comic book version for Chesler called Nemo in Adventureland starring grown @-@ up versions of Nemo and the Princess . Neither project lasted long . In 1947 , Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate , Inc. to revive the original Nemo strip from McCay 's original art , modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages . This revival also did not last . 
 McCay 's original artwork has been poorly preserved . McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him , and a large collection that survived him was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s . His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces , so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection to his own house . The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash . Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn , then later to daughter Marion . By the early twenty @-@ first century , most of McCay 's surviving artwork remained in family hands . 
 McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space . Of what film he kept , much has not survived , as it was photographed on original 35mm nitrate film , which deteriorates and becomes inflammable in storage . Mendelsohn 's son and a friend , both young animators , discovered the film in Mendelsohn 's possession in 1947 and rescued what they could . In some cases , such as The Centaurs , only fragments could be saved . A negative and incomplete positive was discovered of Performing Animals , a film of animals playing instruments that may have been intended for McCay 's vaudeville act ; it was deemed unsalvageable and destroyed . 
 In 1966 , cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many Little Nemo strips at a cartoon studio where McCay 's son Robert had worked . Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor . In 1973 , Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips in Italy . His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University . 
 McCay 's work , grounded solidly in his understanding of realistic perspective , presaged the techniques featured in Walt Disney 's feature films . Disney paid tribute to McCay in 1955 on an episode of Disneyland . The episode , " The Story of Animated Drawing " , gave a history of animation , and dramatized McCay 's vaudeville act with Gertie . Robert was invited to the Disney studios as a consultant on the episode , where Disney told him , " Bob , all this should be your father 's " . 
 Animator and McCay biographer John Canemaker produced a film in 1974 called Remembering Winsor McCay , narrated by McCay 's animation assistant John Fitzsimmons . Canemaker helped coordinate the first retrospective of McCay 's films at the third International Animation Film Festival in 1975 in New York , which led to a film show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in winter 1975 – 76 . Canemaker also wrote a biography in 1987 called Winsor McCay : His Life and Art . In 2005 , a revised and expanded version of the biography was released , which comics scholar Jeet Heer called " far and away the most scholarly and intelligent biography ever written about an American cartoonist " . Animation scholar Paul Wells stated , " McCay 's influence on the history of animation cannot be understated " . Film critic Richard Eder lamented that as an animation pioneer McCay was not able to reach the potential suggested by his work . Eder compared McCay to the Italian primitives of the early Renaissance , highly skilled " in the limited techniques they could command " . Heer wrote that McCay 's strength was in his visuals , but that his writing and characters were weak . 
 Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini read Little Nemo in the children 's magazine Il <unk> dei <unk> , and the strip was a " powerful influence " on the filmmaker , according to Fellini biographer Peter <unk> . Comics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay " the first original genius of the comic strip medium " and in animation . Harvey said that McCay 's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations , so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon . 
 McCay 's work has inspired cartoonists from Carl Barks to Art Spiegelman . Robert Crumb called McCay a " genius " and one of his favorite cartoonists . Art Spiegelman 's 1974 " Real Dream " strip was partially inspired by Rarebit Fiend , and his In the Shadow of No Towers in 2004 appropriated some of McCay 's imagery , and included a page of Little Nemo in its appendix . Maurice Sendak 's children 's book In the Night Kitchen ( 1970 ) was an homage to McCay 's work , as was Rick Veitch ' comic book series <unk> ' Rick 's Rarebit Fiends ( 1994 – 96 ) . Kim Deitch and Simon Deitch 's graphic novel The Boulevard of Broken Dreams revolved around a character named Winsor Newton , based on an aged McCay . Cartoonist Berke Breathed lamented that the conditions of newspaper cartooning had devolved to such a degree since McCay 's time that , had he worked later in the century , he would not have been allotted space sufficient for his expansive full @-@ page fantasies . 
 As Sigmund Freud 's The Interpretation of Dreams first appeared in print in 1899 , McCay 's major dream strips work have invited speculation of a Freudian influence . A comic strip that appeared in Freud 's book , " A French Nurse 's Dream " , strongly resembles the work of McCay in its theme , pacing Art Nouveau style , and closing panel of the dreamer awakening in bed . However , the English translation of Freud 's book was not published until 1913 . 
 The Winsor McCay Award was established in 1972 to recognize individuals for lifetime or career contributions in animation , and is presented as part of the Annie Awards . The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles devoted a room to McCay 's work as part of the Masters of American Comics exhibit in 2005 . In 2014 , Taschen published a complete edition covering all spreads of Little Nemo , entitled The Complete Little Nemo .

 Virtually from the beginning , McCay innovated with the forms of his chosen media . He varied the size and shape of comic strip panels for dramatic effect , as in the second instalment of Little Nemo ( October 22 , 1905 ) , where the panels grow to adapt to a growing forest of mushrooms . Few of McCay 's contemporaries were so bold with their page layouts . Near @-@ contemporary George Herriman with Krazy Kat was the most notable example , but it was not until a generation later that cartoonists such as Frank King with Gasoline Alley , Hal Foster with Prince Valiant , and Roy Crane with Captain Easy attempted such daring designs on their Sunday pages . 
 McCay 's detailed hatching mastery of perspective enhanced the illusions in his drawings , particularly in Little Nemo . Fantastic grotesqueries such as what McCay witnessed during his time at the Wonderland and Eden Musee appeared often in McCay 's work . McCay was noted for the speed and accuracy with which he could draw ; crowds of people would gather around to watch him paint billboards . 
 McCay had a taste for the ornate . The architecture he drew was inspired by that of carnivals and the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . The detailed illustrations in British illustrated newspapers The Illustrated London News and The Graphic . The Maison Quantin of Paris published a series of illustrated books called Images <unk> , whose pages bear a striking resemblance to McCay 's early Little Nemo strips , both in their graphic sense and their imaginative layouts . 
 To Canemaker , McCay had an " absolute precision of line " akin to those of Northern Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer and 19th @-@ century French illustrator Gustave Doré . McCay drew with Higgins black drawing ink , Gillott # 290 pens , art gum , a T @-@ square and angle , and an assortment of Venus lead pencils . In his early magazine cartoons McCay often painted in gouache . 
 McCay used metafictional techniques such as self @-@ referentiality in his work . This was most frequent in Dream of the Rarebit Fiend , where McCay sometimes put himself in the strip , or had characters address the reader . Sometimes characters become aware of the strip itself — a jealous lover tears the very strip apart in which he appears ; another character fastens panel borders to his strip when he realizes the artist has forgotten them ; and in a Sammy Sneeze episode Sammy 's sneeze destroys the panel borders . 
 In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork , the dialogue in McCay 's speech balloons is crude , sometimes approaching illegibility , and " <unk> [ ing ] his otherwise flawless work " , according to critic R. C. Harvey . This is further highlighted by the level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering . McCay seemed to show little regard for the dialogue balloons , their content , and their placement in the visual composition . They tended to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers , and showed that McCay 's gift was in the visual and not the verbal . 
 In his comics and animation McCay used stock ethnic stereotypes common in his era . A conscious attempt to offend is not apparent . He depicted blacks as savages , or wishing they could be white . Most prominent were a pair of characters in Little Nemo : the ill @-@ tempered Irishman Flip and the rarely speaking grass @-@ skirted African Little Imp . In the animated Little Nemo , the Anglo @-@ Saxon Nemo is shown drawn in a dignified Art Nouveau style , and controls by magic the more grotesquely caricatured Flip and Imp . Women were few in McCay 's work , and were depicted as superficial , jealous , and argumentative ; the Princess in Little Nemo never partook in the camaraderie the males shared .

 = Stay Together for the Kids = 
 " Stay Together for the Kids " is a song recorded by American rock band Blink @-@ 182 for their fourth studio album , Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( 2001 ) . It was released as the third and final single from the album on February 19 , 2002 . The track was composed primarily by guitarist Tom DeLonge , who based its lyrics on his parents ' divorce and its effect on him . 
 The song 's original music video , directed by Samuel Bayer , depicts the band performing in a home being destroyed by a wrecking ball in a metaphor for divorce . The clip was re @-@ shot following the 9 / 11 attacks , with both the band and label deeming its imagery too similar to the collapse of the World Trade Center . 
 The song received positive reviews from contemporary music critics , who complimented its serious tone . It was a hit on rock radio in the United States , where it peaked at number seven on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2001 .

 " Stay Together for the Kids " is written about divorce from the point of view of a helpless child . Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group 's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album , Take Off Your Pants and Jacket , such as Fugazi and Refused . Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge , the song is biographical in nature . He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced . For Hoppus , he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father . " The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don ’ t know what the hell they ’ re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent . You ’ ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes , " he said . DeLonge remembered learning of his parents ' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home . " Right then , I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single @-@ handedly , " he recalled . He spoke on the song 's inspiration in 2001 : 
 Due to its tone and subject matter , it is considered one of the band 's darker songs , alongside " Adam 's Song " , their 2000 single revolving around suicide . Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album 's release that " There 's always a song or two where we really try to really push ourselves [ ... ] On this new record I think we 've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn 't ever expect from us . [ ... ] On the new one , it 's ' Stay Together for the Kids . ' " DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song 's message . " With " Stay Together " , we get emails — just kid after kid after kid — saying , ' I know exactly what you 're talking about ! That song is about my life ! ' " In 2002 , divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior , with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce . " You look at statistics that 50 percent of parents get divorced , and you ’ re going to get a pretty large group of kids who are pissed off and who don ’ t agree with what their parents have done , " said DeLonge . " Stay Together " was the final song completed during the recording sessions ; it was created one day before the album was handed off to the mixing engineer . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Stay Together for the Kids " is set in the time signature of common time , with a tempo of 72 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of D major with vocals spanning the tonal nodes of A3 to B5 . Hoppus and DeLonge split vocals on the song , with the former handling verses and the latter singing the choruses . In the verses , the lyrics detail a marriage gone awry : " Rather than fix the problems / They never solve them / It makes no sense at all . " The song fades out with DeLonge singing " It ’ s not right . "

 " Stay Together for the Kids " was released as a single and EP with live tracks and video extras . It debuted on Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks chart in the issue dated September 22 , 2001 at number 36 , before gradually rising to a peak of position seven in the issue dated November 24 , 2001 . The single spent 26 weeks on the chart as a whole , before appearing for the last time in the issue dated March 16 , 2002 . It also peaked at number 16 and spent five weeks on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart , which documents top singles that have yet to chart on the main chart , the Billboard Hot 100 . By June 2002 , the song had accumulated over 80 @,@ 000 spins on radio in the United States , and it received a BDS Certified Spin Award . Outside of the US , the song charted in Germany , where it reached a peak of 73 .

 " Stay Together for the Kids " received positive reviews from contemporary music critics . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone deemed the song " bleak , " describing it as a " broken @-@ family snapshot . " Eric <unk> of Billboard wrote that the song " remains compelling throughout , " suggesting it could be a " MacArthur Park " or " Hey Jude " within the band ’ s catalogue . Slant Magazine 's Aaron Scott called it " the best track on the album , " writing , " The surprising content about a marriage that is resisting divorce will certainly appeal to a generation of youth subjected to a massive divorce epidemic . Blink hints at something here , but resists saying anything concrete . " 
 William Shaw of Blender compared the song to then @-@ popular songs by rock bands about divorce , such as Papa Roach ( " Broken Home " ) , Staind ( " For You " ) and Nickelback ( " Too Bad " ) , commenting , " The ’ 90s had Generation X — have we ended up with Generation <unk> ? " He interviewed DeLonge , who remarked in response to divorce 's effect on children , " Is this a damaged generation ? Yeah , I ’ d say so . " 
 In popular culture , the song is played on acoustic guitar by a soldier in the War in Afghanistan near the end of the film Restrepo ( 2010 ) .

 The music video for " Stay Together for the Kids " was directed by Samuel Bayer , best known for his work with Metallica and Nirvana . In the clip , Blink @-@ 182 perform in a suburban home that is destroyed with a wrecking ball in a metaphor for a " crumbling marriage . " The video opens with a statistic , claiming that " 50 percent of American households are destroyed by divorce . " 
 The band filmed the music video on September 9 – 10 , 2001 in Los Angeles , in days preceding the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks . Following those events , the band and its label MCA felt the clip ’ s images were " too evocative " of the footage of the collapse of the World Trade Center . The band ended up re @-@ recording the entire video with the same production crew , with the setting changed to an empty mansion populated by shouting teens . 
 The original , uncut video was first released on The <unk> Chronicles II : Harder Faster Faster Harder , a 2002 home video on the band . The video has since widely become available online on sites like YouTube .

 Paes first won titles at the Junior US Open and the Junior Wimbledon and he turned professional in 1991 . He rose to the number 1 in the world junior rankings . In 1992 , he reached the quarter finals of the doubles event in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics with Ramesh Krishnan . 
 He went one better at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics , where he beat Fernando <unk> to win the bronze medal , thus becoming the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics more than four decades earlier . Paes cited the match as one of his greatest performances on the court , in part because his wrist was severely injured . He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India , the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996 . His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993 , when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal . After having a moderate season in 1994 , he reached the quarter @-@ finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett . From 1996 , he partnered with fellow @-@ Indian Mahesh Bhupathi , which would prove to be a winning combination . Their first year was not a very successful one , especially in the Grand Slams , with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best . 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi , with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result . Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no . 89 at the beginning of the year to no . 14 at the end of the year . That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam , getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open , beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric <unk> .

 The doubles team of Paes and Bhupathi grew stronger in 1998 , reaching the semifinals of three Grand Slams , the Australian Open , the French Open , and the US Open . In the same year , Paes had two of his biggest singles results in the ATP tour . The first one came by winning his only ATP singles title at Newport , and the second was beating Pete Sampras , 6 – 3 , 6 – 4 , at the New Haven ATP tournament in their only meeting throughout the career . In 1999 , the duo reached the finals of all four Grand Slams , winning Wimbledon and the French Open , thus becoming the first Indian pair to win a doubles event at a Grand Slam . Paes also teamed up with Lisa Raymond to win the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon . The year also marked his ascent to the no . 1 ranking in doubles . The following year , Paes partnered with Sébastien Lareau for the Australian Open and Jan Siemerink for the French Open , losing in the first round on both occasions . Paes teamed up again with Bhupathi for the US Open , but lost in the first round again . The duo had a disappointing second round exit to Australian duo of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde at the Sydney Olympics , despite high hopes . Paes was given the honour of carrying the Indian Flag at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics . In spite of a winning the French Open in 2001 , the team of Bhupathi and Paes had first @-@ round exits in the other three Grand Slams .

 = Majura Parkway = 
 The Majura Parkway is an 11 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 7 @.@ 1 mi ) north – south parkway under construction in the Majura district of the Australian Capital Territory ( ACT ) . It links at its northern end to the Federal Highway and Horse Park Drive at the edge of the Gungahlin district , and at its southern end to the Monaro Highway in <unk> . 
 The parkway has been in planning since the 1970s and is considered as being an important access road to and from the Gungahlin district . It largely replaces Majura Road , which lacks the capacity to cope with future increases in traffic . Majura Road will be largely retained to provide access to various facilities in the area . The parkway will provide a more efficient transport link in the area and convey large numbers of freight vehicles . The project has been jointly funded by both the ACT and Australian Governments , at a total cost of A $ 288 million . Major construction works commenced in February 2013 and are expected to be completed by June 2016 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Majura Parkway will traverse the length of the largely rural Majura Valley within the ACT , providing a parkway standard link between the northern terminus of the Monaro Highway in territory 's east and the Federal Highway at the north close to the New South Wales border . The parkway largely replaces Majura Road , which is now the main route through the valley and carries approximately 18 @,@ 000 vehicles each day . This road is single carriageway , and rural in design and quality ; the need for the replacement with a more efficient , higher capacity roadway has been highlighted in several studies . Majura Road will remain largely intact to serve local traffic to various facilities located in the Majura Valley , multiple rural properties and Canberra Airport 's business precinct . Other benefits of the Majura Parkway include more efficient freight transportation , relieving traffic congestion , supporting future growth of Canberra Airport , and easier movement between Canberra 's northern and southern suburbs . 
 The roadway will start as a continuation from the northern end of the Monaro Highway . It will then cross the Molonglo River , and Morshead Drive as part of a singular bridge structure , just to the west of the current Morshead Drive / <unk> Avenue intersection . The next section of the parkway entirely replaces the northern arm of Morshead Drive with a raised section of roadway , before crossing over Fairbairn Road at the location of the current Morshead Drive / Fairbairn Road intersection . 
 From this point the roadway enters farmland , and grasslands ; the parkway itself aligned just to the west of Woolshed Creek . Towards the northern end of the valley , the parkway bisects the Majura Pine Plantation . North of the plantation the parkway way will gain a service road along its western side , allowing southbound access via an overpass to businesses in that area . This service road continues a short distance to the north until it meets the access road to the Mount Majura air navigation facility , which is located atop the nearby Mount Majura . 
 The remainder of the roadway from the plantation to the north follows the existing Majura Road alignment , with the addition of a second carriageway constructed to the east . It curves towards the west and joins onto the existing interchange with the Federal Highway . The roadway itself then continues on through the interchange into the Gungahlin district as Horse Park Drive . 
 The parkway will be dual carriageway for the entirety of its length . Each traffic lane will be 3 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 11 ft ) wide , with a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) wide outside shoulder , and a 1 @-@ metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) wide median shoulder . The speed limit is to be 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . By 2030 , the Majura Parkway is expected to carry approximately 40 @,@ 000 vehicles each day , with 6 @,@ 000 of those being freight vehicles . The stated cost is A $ 288 million , and is jointly funded by the ACT Government and the Australian Government , both committing $ 144 million to the project . 
 = = History = = 
 The planning of Majura Parkway began with the Tomorrow 's Canberra ( 1970 ) National Capital Development Commission ( NCDC ) report which identified the Majura Valley corridor as a component of Canberra 's peripheral road system . Further NCDC and National Capital Authority ( NCA ) studies including Metropolitan Canberra ( 1984 ) and the Canberra Spatial Plan ( 2004 ) identified the need for a primary road link in the area . This was also backed up by the Gungahlin External Travel Study Information Report ( 1989 ) identifying four main access roads needed for residents of the Gungahlin district . 
 From the <unk> Concept Evaluation Report ( 2006 ) , Roads ACT identified two preferred alignments , which were known as the western and the eastern alignments . The eastern alignment was later scrapped because of environmental , heritage , and social issues along that corridor , leaving the western alignment as the only preferred alignment . The scrapped eastern alignment would have also included a link to a future urban area in the <unk> District . Resumption of land for the parkway mostly involved farmland , although part of the Majura Pine Plantation was acquired for the new road alignment . The Royal Military College , Duntroon has also lost some parts of its playing fields , though the historic Oval No.1 is preserved . 
 Some concerns were raised about the parkway occupying land now used for offroad recreational cycling in the Majura Pine Plantation ; however by the later stages of the planning process , two large culverts had been planned in this area which would ease access between both sides of the plantation for recreational cyclists and other users . Concerns were also raised by the Geological Society of Australia in regards to the construction works affecting a fossil site on Woolshed Creek in the vicinity of the Fairbairn Avenue southbound offramp . The Geological Society of Australia later accepted assurances from the ACT Government that the site would be protected . 
 Preparatory roadworks on nearby roads began in 2008 , with the main project beginning in September 2012 when Fulton Hogan was awarded the contract to build . Major construction then began in January 2013 . 
 The parkway is expected to be completed by approximately mid @-@ 2016 . Construction of the parkway will create around 350 jobs .

 The completed Majura Parkway will have multiple intersections and interchanges along its length providing access to facilities in the Majura Valley , and several arterial roads .

 " We Belong Together " is a song by American singer Mariah Carey from her tenth studio album , The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . The song was released on March 29 , 2005 , through Island Records , as the second single from the album . " We Belong Together " was written by Carey , Jermaine Dupri , Manuel Seal , and Johntá Austin , and produced by the former three . As the song samples lyrics from Bobby Womack 's " If You Think You 're Lonely Now " ( 1981 ) and the Deele 's " Two Occasions " ( 1987 ) , several other songwriters are credited . " We Belong Together " is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat . The lyrics chronicle a woman 's desperation for her former lover to return . 
 Following her decline in popularity between 2001 and 2005 , critics dubbed the song her musical comeback , as many had considered her career over . " We Belong Together " earned her several music industry awards and nominations throughout 2005 – 06 . The song broke chart records in the United States and became Carey 's sixteenth topper on the US Billboard Hot 100 . After staying at number one for fourteen non @-@ consecutive weeks , it was placed as the second longest running number one song in US chart history , behind Carey 's own " One Sweet Day , " collaboration with Boyz II Men ( 1995 ) . Billboard listed it as the " song of the decade " and the ninth most popular song of all time . Additionally , it broke several airplay records , gathering both the largest one @-@ day and one @-@ week audiences in history . " We Belong Together " also topped the charts in Australia and reached the top two in Canada , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom . 
 The song 's music video was filmed as a two @-@ part story with " It 's Like That " , which featured Carey at her bachelorette party . The video for " We Belong Together " is a continuation focusing on Carey 's wedding to an older and powerful man and ends with the singer eloping with her ex @-@ lover . Rumors arose of the video 's connection to her 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola . Carey performed the song on several award shows and television appearances around the world , namely 2005 MTV Movie Awards , MTV Video Music Awards , Macy 's Fourth of July Parade , The Oprah Winfrey Show and the 48th Grammy Awards . In Europe the song was performed at the Live 8 charity concert , the Fashion Rocks in Monaco , and the German Bambi Awards . Carey performed the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours . 
 = = Background = = 
 Carey had produced back @-@ to @-@ back commercially and critically unsuccessful albums , Glitter ( 2001 ) and Charmbracelet ( 2002 ) . Though fueled by strong media attention regarding Carey 's return to music , as well as her new deal with Island Records , the albums failed to deliver the type of success she had been accustomed to throughout the 1990s , and only managed sales of five million copies globally . After the album 's release , and its succeeding tour , Carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project , eventually titled The Emancipation of Mimi , her tenth studio effort . " We Belong Together " became a song that critics considered Carey 's " return to form " and " the return of The Voice " , after several questioned her vocal abilities following the release of Charmbracelet . 
 By November 2004 , Carey had already recorded several songs for The Emancipation of Mimi . Island Records chairman L.A. Reid suggested Carey that she compose a few more strong singles to ensure the project 's commercial success . Noting that she had written some of her best work with Jermaine Dupri , Reid recommended her to meet with Dupri for a brief studio session . Carey headed to Atlanta to collaborate with Dupri where the duo wrote and produced " Shake It Off " and " Get Your Number " , which were eventually released as the album 's third and fourth singles . ( Following this recording session , " Shake It Off " was briefly selected as the album 's lead single , replacing the originally planned " Say Somethin ' " . ) Carey returned to Atlanta for a second meeting with Dupri ; during this trip , Carey and Dupri penned the last two songs to be included on the album , " We Belong Together " and " It 's Like That " . In an interview with Billboard , Carey described her sentiments regarding the song during the production stage : 
 I had the chills . I had a great feeling about it when we finished writing the song , and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning ... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home , and even from the demo version , I really felt something very special . 
 Carey and her management then decided to release " It 's Like That " , which Carey called " the right fire @-@ starter " , as the album 's lead single . She later reminisced about her experience with Dupri : " I am so grateful I went to Atlanta , " she said . " And I have to say , we wrote some of my favorite songs on the album . I 'm so proud of Jermaine – he 's so focused , and he knew what had to be done . " 
 = = Music and structure = = 
 " We Belong Together " is a R & B ballad . Rolling Stone called it " soulful . " The song is propelled by a programmed Roland TR @-@ 808 @-@ styled kick and hi @-@ hat , which is prominently utilized in hip hop music . Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey 's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power , which would not have been achieved if she had belted . The song also incorporates 1980s retro @-@ soul music by " cleverly " referencing Bobby Womack 's " If You Think You 're Lonely Now " ( 1981 ) and the Deele 's " Two Occasions " ( 1987 ) , with Babyface . In the second verse of " We Belong Together " , Carey sings : " Bobby Womack 's on the radio / Singing to me , ' If you think you 're lonely now ' . " She then flips across a radio dial : " So I turn the dial , tryin ’ to catch a break / And then I hear Babyface / ' I only think of you ... ' . " The line " If you think you 're lonely now " is from the song of the same name and " I only think of you " is from the chorus of " Two Occasions . " In the remix she also says " I only think of you / On two occasions / That 's day and night ... " Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs , the songwriters were given co @-@ writing credits on the song . " We Belong Together " follows the common verse @-@ chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections , with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions . The first section chronicles the break @-@ up of the couple , and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes . In the second section , the narrative switches to the present , and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels " all out of her element " when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio , but fails . " We Belong Together " does not have a bridge ; instead , Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave , which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist . Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song 's production , lyrics and vocals in detail : 
 It ’ s straightforward , heartfelt and classy . Mariah pleads with her departed lover – ' When you left I lost a part of me / It ’ s still so hard to believe ' – and the song ’ s gentle R & B roll is perfectly understated , built from a few piano chords and a slowed @-@ down So So Def rhythm . It has a homebody quality , almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split @-@ up couple singing it quietly , separately , as the world goes on around them . She ’ s on a porch with tea ; he ’ s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio . It even cleverly references that feel , with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear . There ’ s no tired ' I tried to 2 @-@ way you ' retorts , no trash @-@ technology love affair ' I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you , and I cried . ' No , there ’ s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of ' We Belong Together ' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop / R & B songwriting . In other words , it ’ s the jam . And there ’ s probably a happy ending , too : Mariah ’ s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song ’ s title an emphatic . 
 " We Belong Together " is a simple , understated musical arrangement set in F <unk> and composed in 4 / 4 time . Similarly , within the song , Carey 's voice spans from G3 to the high note of A5 . Carey 's vocal range is demonstrated with a greater emphasis in the ending chorus , where the chorus is raised an octave higher , lying from G4 to A5 . As such , Carey ends with an anticipated coda , completing both the chorus and the song with a potent , belted note of C5 for approximately four <unk> ( around 17 seconds ) . It follows the common verse @-@ chorus form and is structured into three sections that portray the protagonist in a range of emotions ; from doleful and resigned in the first section , to desperate and agitated in the second . In the last section the song climaxes with an octave raise , which not only emphasizes the protagonist 's heightened desperation , but her determination to be with her lover . The song is written in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute . Carey 's vocals span from G3 to A5 , and the song follows a chord progression of Am – G – Em – F. 
 = = Critical response = = 
 " We Belong Together " became a " career re @-@ defining " song for Carey , at a point when many critics had considered her career over . Unlike most of Carey 's recent singles at that time , " We Belong Together " received generally positive reviews from critics , most of whom hailed the song as her " return to form " , following reviews for Charmbracelet ( 2002 ) , that suggested Carey had lost her signature vocal range and power . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote " the ... diva [ keeps ] cool with breathy , rapid @-@ fire verses until the final full strong @-@ voiced climax that ... proves that ' The Voice ' has indeed returned . " Additionally , he said that " The song is as ' innovative ' as Mariah has been in years . " Other critics commended Carey on her novel singing style which , according to Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times , gave the song its propulsion , writing " This style is part of the reason why she has been able to turn a ballad into a summer smash . ' We Belong Together ' doesn 't have a guest rapper , or a hard @-@ hitting beat , but Ms. Carey 's tricky vocal lines give the song more propulsion than you 'd expect , with tightly coiled counter @-@ rhythms that tug against the beat . " Johnny Loftus from Metro Times called it a " summer hit " and wrote " We all know it ’ s the intangibles that make a summer single anyway , those untraceable currents that grab the heart and feet , and despite not being an anthem , ' We Belong Together ' is that rousing . " 
 Writing for Vibe , Michael Ehrlich claimed the song would " cut across generations " , while Cinquemani felt it would revive " faith in Mariah the balladeer " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic chose " We Belong Together " as a " top Pick " from the album , while Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as " beautifully cadenced " . Echoing Cinquemani 's comments about the song and Carey 's past as a balladeer , Jozen Cummings from PopMatters wrote " Carey makes the song her own , reminding fans of her ' Hero ' days with full , throaty vocals and a crashing climax at the end . The dichotomy between ' The Emancipation of Mimi 's ' first two tracks is the album ’ s bread and butter . " Since first hearing the song on the radio , Sherri Winston from South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel claimed she " knew it would be a smash " , complimenting its understated beat and Carey 's vocals . Billboard 's Michael Paoletta described " We Belong Together " as one of the album 's strongest cuts , claiming that it highlighted the strongest focal point on the song : Carey 's voice . Slant Magazine ranked it 2nd on their best songs of 2005 list .

 Between 2001 and 2004 , Carey 's popularity had substantially declined and many had considered her career over .

 The wedding dress was a Vera Wang original dress from a while ago that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when we came up with the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it , I said , ‘ well , I do have my old wedding dress , ’ . ' It ’ s still worth [ sic ] for me ’ cause I can ’ t believe I was ever married but whatever , end of story . And I knew that we wouldn ’ t be able to get a fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27 @-@ foot train and it was just all hand @-@ beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.'

 = History of York City F.C. ( 1980 – present ) = 
 York City Football Club is a professional association football club based in York , North Yorkshire , England . Its history from the 1980 – 81 to the current season saw fluctuating fortunes in the 1980s and 1990s , and relegation from and return to the Football League . 
 York made their seventh re @-@ election bid after 1980 – 81 , before the club won its first and only league title after finishing first in the Fourth Division in 1983 – 84 with 101 points . They were the first team to score this many points in a Football League season . After four seasons in the Third Division in 1987 – 88 , York were relegated . They beat Crewe Alexandra on penalties at Wembley Stadium in the play @-@ off final in 1992 – 93 , winning promotion back into the third tier of English football , now renamed as the Second Division . The following season , York competed in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final , when they were beaten by Stockport County . Later in the 1990s , they knocked Premier League clubs Manchester United and Everton out of the League Cup in successive seasons . After six seasons , York were relegated into the Third Division in 1998 – 99 . 
 In the following years , the club experienced financial troubles ; chairman Douglas Craig offered the club and its ground for sale in December 2001 . The club was bought by John Batchelor in March 2002 , but the following December they went into administration . In March 2003 , York were taken over by the club 's Supporters ' Trust , and were relegated into the Conference National in 2003 – 04 , ending seventy @-@ five years of Football League membership . The team were unsuccessful in the play @-@ offs in the 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 seasons , and were beaten in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium . In 2011 – 12 , York defeated Newport County in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley , and shortly after returned to the Football League with a 2 – 1 win over Luton Town in the play @-@ off final . In their second season in League Two , the club reached the play @-@ offs but were knocked out in the semi @-@ final by Fleetwood Town .

 The 1980 – 81 season started comfortably for York City , and the team were fourteenth in the table by mid @-@ January 1981 . However , three wins from the last eighteen matches saw them finish in bottom place . York 's seventh application for re @-@ election was successful with forty @-@ six votes . Poor form at home contributed to York occupying the bottom half of the table for most of 1981 – 82 , and a club record of twelve successive matches without a home win . Barry Lyons was sacked as manager in December 1981 , and under caretaker manager Kevin Randall the club dropped into the bottom four . Former York player and club director Barry Swallow took over as caretaker manager in March 1982 , and several convincing home wins toward the end of the season helped the team to seventeenth place . Denis Smith , who had played on loan from Stoke City the previous season , was appointed player @-@ manager in May 1982 , with Viv Busby as his assistant player @-@ coach . York finished 1982 – 83 in seventh place ; their inconsistent away form in the last half of the season led to them missing out on promotion . The club occupied one of the top two places in 1983 – 84 from the second week of the season onwards , and won the Fourth Division championship with 101 points . They became the first team to achieve a three @-@ figure points total in a Football League season . The Yorkshire Evening Press billed them the " Team of the Century " . York set new club records for most wins ( thirty @-@ one ) , most away wins ( thirteen ) and most goals ( ninety @-@ one ) . For the first time since 1954 – 55 , York had two players score over twenty league goals in a season ; these were John Byrne and Keith Walwyn . A profit of almost £ 15 @,@ 000 was posted and the club aspired to further progress and promotion . 
 Winning six of their first eight matches in 1984 – 85 , York were top of the Third Division by early @-@ October 1984 . After a run of two wins from eleven matches they slipped to eleventh place in mid @-@ December 1984 , though they continued to occupy a top half position before finishing the season in eighth place .

After being unbeaten in the last nine matches , they finished seventh in the table , marking the fifth consecutive season in which York 's end @-@ of @-@ season league placing improved . They reached the FA Cup fifth round for the second consecutive season , again drawing 1 – 1 at home to Liverpool , before losing 3 – 1 after extra time at Anfield . York made a strong start to 1986 – 87 , and in late @-@ September 1986 they were in second place . They won only seven of their remaining thirty @-@ eight matches and needed a point from their last match to avoid the danger of relegation , which they achieved with a 1 – 1 draw against Notts County . York finished 1986 – 87 in twentieth place . 
 Smith left to take over at Sunderland in May 1987 , and former Blackburn Rovers manager Bobby Saxton was appointed in June . Only two players were under contract at the time of Saxton 's arrival ; his hastily arranged squad struggled from the start of 1987 – 88 , and only won their first match in late @-@ October 1987 . York were bottom of the table for most of the season , and were relegated after finishing in twenty @-@ third place . The season was statistically the club 's worst in the Football League , with the fewest wins ( eight ) , most defeats ( twenty @-@ nine ) and the fewest points since the three points for a win system was introduced ( thirty @-@ three ) . York made a poor start to 1988 – 89 , and Saxton resigned with the club bottom of the Fourth Division in mid @-@ September 1988 . Swallow took over on a caretaker basis before the former Hartlepool United manager John Bird was appointed in October 1988 . York 's away form improved in the second half of the season , and in the last week they had a slim chance of reaching the play @-@ offs . They missed out on a play @-@ off place and finished the season in eleventh place . A record loss of £ 190 @,@ 000 was posted for the season , but the club carried no overdraft because of interest @-@ free loans from directors and a £ 100 @,@ 000 share issue . York started 1989 – 90 strongly and were in third place by mid @-@ December 1989 . Successive home defeats in late @-@ December 1989 marked the start of a decline that saw them finish the season thirteenth in the table . 
 In September 1990 , York player David Longhurst collapsed and died after suffering heart failure during a home match against Lincoln City . A few months later , a newly built , covered stand at the Shipton Street End of Bootham Crescent was named after him . York were the Fourth Division 's second lowest scorers in 1990 – 91 , as they finished twenty @-@ first in the table . Douglas Craig , who had been on the board since 1978 , succeeded Michael Sinclair as chairman in June 1991 . York had won two of eleven matches by mid @-@ October 1991 ; Bird was sacked and was replaced in November by Aston Villa assistant manager John Ward . York continued to be placed in lower mid @-@ table , and finished fourth from bottom for the second year running in 1991 – 92 . They started 1992 – 93 with a club @-@ record start of four wins , and led the table until late @-@ December 1992 . Ward left for Bristol Rovers in March 1993 , shortly after a mid @-@ season slump in which York won only one of thirteen matches . Ward 's assistant Alan Little took over and York finished the season in fourth place . They played Bury in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final , drawing the first leg 0 – 0 at Gigg Lane before winning the second leg 1 – 0 at home with a goal from Gary Swann . In the final at Wembley Stadium , York beat Crewe Alexandra 5 – 3 on penalties , after the score had finished 1 – 1 after extra time . Wayne Hall scored the decisive penalty as York won promotion into the third tier , now named the Second Division after the formation of the Premier League in 1992 . 
 York made a good start to 1993 – 94 , before a series of poor results saw them slip to seventeenth place in late @-@ November 1993 . They only lost five of their last thirty fixtures to finish the season fifth in the Second Division table — their highest league placing since 1976 . They lost to Stockport County in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final , being beaten 1 – 0 in the second leg at Edgeley Park after drawing 0 – 0 at home in the first leg . York were in lower mid @-@ table for the first half of 1994 – 95 , but improving form saw them move up the table , before finishing in ninth place . They struggled through most of 1995 – 96 , and only avoided relegation by winning their last match away to Brighton & Hove Albion ; they finished in twentieth place . This season saw York record a 4 – 3 aggregate victory over Manchester United in the League Cup second round . York defeated a strong United side including some younger players 3 – 0 at Old Trafford in the first leg ; in the second leg United fielded some more experienced players , but York defeated them 3 – 1 to progress on aggregate . United went on to win the Premier League and FA Cup double . York finished twentieth in 1996 – 97 , only securing safety in the penultimate match with an away win over Rotherham United . For the second consecutive season , they eliminated Premier League opponents from the League Cup in the second round , with a 4 – 3 aggregate win over Everton . After drawing the first leg 1 – 1 at Goodison Park , York progressed after winning the second leg 3 – 2 at home . In mid @-@ December 1997 , York were fourth in the table , but declining form after New Year saw them finish 1997 – 98 in sixteenth place .

 By mid @-@ October 1998 , York were placed eighth in the Second Division . They slipped to the bottom third of the table after winning one point from a possible twenty @-@ one . Despite improved results over Christmas , York played eleven consecutive matches without a win . In mid @-@ March 1999 , the club was just above the bottom four places , when Little was sacked and player @-@ coach Neil Thompson appointed caretaker manager . A flurry of transfers , including the departure of leading scorer Richard Cresswell to Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday for a club @-@ record fee of £ 950 @,@ 000 , followed . After losing away to Manchester City on the last day of 1998 – 99 , York dropped into the bottom four for the first time that season , and were relegated in twenty @-@ first place . The club 's trading loss for the season was £ 483 @,@ 096 , despite a record profit of £ 1 @,@ 274 @,@ 202 from lucrative transfers . Club historian David Batters said , " the stark reality was that the club had to sell to survive " . In July 1999 , the club and its real property assets , including the ground , were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings ( BCH ) for £ 165 @,@ 000 . Thompson was sacked in February 2000 after a run of one win from twelve matches during the middle of 1999 – 2000 . Former Hull City manager Terry Dolan took over , and York finished the season in twentieth place after conceding only five goals in the last twelve matches . Losses for the season were £ 667 @,@ 255 , and the wage bill of £ 1 @,@ 635 @,@ 736 was twice that of 1995 . 
 By mid @-@ February 2001 , York were bottom of the Third Division table , but after losing only two of their last sixteen matches they finished 2000 – 01 in seventeenth . They reached the FA Cup third round for the second time since 1986 , but were beaten 3 – 0 by Premier League side Leicester City at Filbert Street . Record losses of £ 1 @,@ 261 @,@ 038 were reported in November 2001 , before Craig announced in December that the club and the ground had been put up for sale for £ 4 @.@ 5 million . Craig later said Bootham Crescent would close by June 2002 , and the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found . The club was taken over by motor racing driver John Batchelor in March 2002 . He pledged to give the Supporters ' Trust ( ST ) two seats on the board and announced a sponsorship deal with Persimmon that would see an undisclosed amount split between the club and his racing team . By late @-@ March 2002 , York were second from bottom , before a run of five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish 2001 – 02 in fourteenth place . They reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time since 1986 , losing 2 – 0 at home to Premier League team Fulham . 
 In May 2002 , the club was rebranded York City Soccer Club as part of Batchelor 's plan to market it in the United States . Persimmon , which had bought ten percent of the shares in BCH , submitted planning applications for ninety @-@ three homes on the site of Bootham Crescent , and Batchelor spoke of building York a new stadium at Clifton Moor . The club entered a creditors ' voluntary agreement in November 2002 , and the York Evening Press said York had been " plunged into the darkest , coldest days of its history " . The club went into administration in December 2002 , and was given five weeks to find a buyer or face bankruptcy . The ST donated £ 92 @,@ 000 to give the club a temporary reprieve . The ST took control over the club in March 2003 after the Inland Revenue accepted an offer of £ 100 @,@ 000 as payment for £ 160 @,@ 000 owed in tax . Steve Beck became the new chairman . Batchelor had diverted almost all of the £ 400 @,@ 000 Persimmon sponsorship money away from York to his racing team , and his promise of having ST members on the board never materialised . He left the club with a profit of £ 120 @,@ 000 and admitted to asset stripping during his time as owner . Despite the off @-@ field problems , York pushed for promotion in 2002 – 03 and were in an automatic promotion place by late @-@ March 2003 . They won none of their last six games and finished the season in tenth place . 
 Dolan was sacked in May 2003 , the new board citing financial reasons for his departure . At twenty @-@ seven years , York player Chris Brass was appointed player @-@ manager in June 2003 , which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946 . The club 's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004 , and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move , but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered . The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent , and they bought the site in February 2004 after six months of negotiations . The deal came after York were lent £ 2 million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund ( FSIF ) , with which they bought 75 @.@ 89 % of BCH shares and all of the 20 @,@ 000 shares owned by Persimmon . Once plans for a new stadium were settled , the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move . York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003 – 04 , and by mid @-@ January 2004 were tenth in the table . They won none of their final twenty fixtures , garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division . York were relegated into the Conference National after seventy @-@ five years of Football League membership . Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a fan @-@ owned club . The board was restructured and Jason McGill became the managing director . 
 In November 2004 , Brass was sacked after a home defeat to Forest Green Rovers , which left York fourth from the bottom of the table . His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former Derby County coach Billy McEwan was appointed in February 2005 . Under McEwan , York avoided relegation into the Conference North , with a seventeenth @-@ place finish in 2004 – 05 . One @-@ third into 2005 – 06 , York were in second place but poor mid @-@ season results saw them slide down the table . They pushed for the play @-@ offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the run @-@ in . With twenty @-@ two goals , Andy Bishop was the Conference National top scorer in 2005 – 06 . Financial problems arose again ; a loss of £ 150 @,@ 000 was reported for the season , and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £ 100 @,@ 000 to the FSIF . McGill 's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders , and would lend the club £ 650 @,@ 000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan repayments for the next five years . ST members approved the proposal in June 2006 , and JM Packaging became seventy @-@ five percent shareholders , reducing the ST 's previous eighty @-@ five percent ownership to twenty @-@ five percent . York made a good start to 2006 – 07 , and were never out of the top five from early @-@ November 2006 . They finished the season in fourth place and played Morecambe in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final ; after drawing 0 – 0 at home in the first leg they were beaten 2 – 1 at Christie Park in the second leg . 
 York started 2007 – 08 by losing seven of their first ten matches . Despite improving form , their home results remained poor , leading to McEwan 's sacking in November 2007 . He was succeeded by his assistant Colin Walker , after the team won five of his six matches as caretaker manager . York finished the season in fourteenth place , and reached the semi @-@ final of the FA Trophy , losing 2 – 1 on aggregate to Torquay United . In May 2008 , City of York Council announced its commitment to build a community stadium , to be used by York and the city 's rugby league club , York City Knights . An agreement with the FSIF was reached in September 2008 ; the club would stop making loan repayments and would repay the outstanding amount once Bootham Crescent was sold . At the start of 2008 – 09 , York won only five of their nineteen league matches , resulting in Walker 's sacking in November 2008 . Under his replacement , former Port Vale manager Martin Foyle , the team avoided relegation in the penultimate game of the season against Weymouth , and they finished seventeenth in the table . York participated in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at the new Wembley Stadium , where they were beaten 2 – 0 by Stevenage Borough . After starting 2009 – 10 with only one win from five matches , York won eight successive matches in a bid for promotion . They finished in fifth place and faced Luton Town in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final , winning each leg 1 – 0 , but were beaten 3 – 1 by Oxford United in the final at Wembley . They reached the FA Cup third round that season , and were beaten 3 – 1 by Premier League Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium . Richard Brodie was the Conference Premier joint top scorer in 2009 – 10 , with twenty @-@ six goals .

 After winning only three of their first ten matches of 2010 – 11 , Foyle resigned as manager in September 2010 , and was replaced with Tamworth manager Gary Mills the following month . Improving form saw York challenge for the play @-@ offs , and by mid @-@ March 2011 they were sixth in the table — one place away from a play @-@ off spot . They won only three of ten matches in the run @-@ in and missed out on the play @-@ offs to finish the season in eighth place . York reached the FA Cup third round for the second consecutive year , and lost 2 – 0 to Premier League club Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium . York won three of the opening seven matches in 2011 – 12 and were only once below a play @-@ off place from early @-@ October 2011 , finishing the season in fourth place . Playing a passing style of football but producing results when needed , they earned eighty @-@ three points that season — the second highest in the club 's history . York drew 1 – 1 at home to Mansfield Town in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final first leg and won the second leg 1 – 0 after extra time at Field Mill . They then beat Newport County 2 – 0 at Wembley in the 2012 FA Trophy Final , which was the first time the club had won a national knockout competition . A week later they returned to Wembley for the play @-@ off final , where they beat Luton Town 2 – 1 , with goals from Ashley Chambers and Matty Blair . The club was promoted into League Two , returning to the Football League after an eight @-@ year absence . In between the two matches at Wembley , City of York Council granted planning permission for a new community stadium to be built at Monks Cross . 
 York started 2012 – 13 by winning five of fourteen matches , and by late @-@ October 2012 were ninth in the table . They dropped down the table in the following months , but were still in contention for a play @-@ off place after beating Burton Albion 3 – 0 in the New Year . After this match , York failed to win eleven consecutive matches , and Mills was sacked in March 2013 after a 2 – 0 home defeat to Bradford City . Under his replacement , former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington , York avoided relegation by winning four of their last five matches . They finished their first League Two season in seventeenth place . York won four of their first twenty @-@ three matches of 2013 – 14 , and by late @-@ December 2013 were third from the bottom of the table . A number of influential signings in January 2014 helped York improve their form , and from early @-@ February they were unbeaten in seventeen consecutive matches , conceding no goals from open play . York finished in seventh place and played Fleetwood Town in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final . After losing the first leg 1 – 0 at home , they drew 0 – 0 at Highbury Stadium in the second leg . Worthington resigned as manager in October 2014 after York won only one of their opening fourteen matches of 2014 – 15 . He was succeeded by former Scunthorpe United manager Russ Wilcox . York remained in the lower reaches of the table . They avoided relegation with a late @-@ season run of four wins from five matches , and they finished the season in eighteenth place . 
 With York twenty @-@ first in the table after a nine @-@ match run without a league win , Wilcox was sacked in October 2015 . He was succeeded in November 2015 by the former Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara . 
 = June 2009 Washington Metro train collision = 
 During the afternoon rush hour of June 22 , 2009 , a subway train @-@ on @-@ train collision occurred between two southbound Red Line Washington Metro trains in Northeast , Washington , D.C. , United States . A moving train collided with a train stopped ahead of it ; the train operator and eight passengers were killed , making it the deadliest crash in the history of the Washington Metro . Several survivors were trapped for hours , and approximately 80 were injured . 
 The NTSB investigation found that after a June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became the site of the June 22 collision , the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train . The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead . Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit , it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control ( ATC ) system . The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55 mph . The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision , which occurred at approximately 44 mph . 
 = = Collision = = 
 At approximately 4 : 57 pm EDT ( 20 : 57 UTC ) on Monday , June 22 , 2009 , Washington Metro Train 112 , bound from Glenmont for Shady Grove , left the Takoma station . Minutes later at 5 : 02 pm , Train 112 rear @-@ ended Train 214 , which was stopped between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations while waiting for another train to leave the Fort Totten station . Nine people were killed , including the operator in the lead car of the moving train , <unk> McMillan , 42 , of Springfield , Virginia ; at least 80 people were injured . The death toll makes the crash the deadliest in Metro history . 
 The NTSB found that Train 214 had come to a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2 @-@ 304 , making it effectively invisible to the automatic train control system . Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum to make it to the next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system . Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator , and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2 @-@ 304 and was therefore invisible . Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track . The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision . 
 A series of almost @-@ collisions in 2005 in similar circumstances in the tunnel between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation . However , by 2009 , Metro engineers were unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition . 
 = = = Rolling stock involved = = = 
 Train 112 ( the moving train ) was made up of cars 1079 , 1078 , 1071 , 1070 , 1130 and 1131 — all from the 1000 @-@ Series . Train 214 ( the stationary train ) was made up of cars 3036 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and 5066 , from the Breda 3000 @-@ Series and the CAF 5000 @-@ Series . The cars are equipped with on @-@ board systems called Automatic Train Operation and Automatic Train Control , which allow autonomous operation with little human intervention . 
 = = Response = = 
 At 5 : 20 pm , rescuers first entered car 1079 , the lead car of train 112 . This car had telescoped over the rear car of the stationary train , trapping many passengers who required rescue by emergency workers using ladders for access . Survivors described the crash as " like ... hit [ ting ] a concrete wall , " with air clouded by smoke and debris , and panic among passengers when car doors did not immediately open . 
 Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith , two United States Army soldiers who were in the lead train and were uninjured in the collision , helped passengers , most of whom appeared to have minor injuries , evacuate from their train . Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured . One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound . The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived , and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down . 
 Immediately following the collision , firefighters and paramedics from District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services were dispatched to the Takoma Metro station , and arrived at the location of the collision soon after . D.C. Fire Chief Dennis Rubin stated that the initial 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 emergency calls made the incident seem small , but after firefighters arrived on scene , they dispatched mass casualty incident teams . Within two hours , more than 200 firefighters were on @-@ scene in response to the three @-@ alarm incident . Rescuers worked through the night of June 22 , using cranes and heavy rescue equipment to free trapped passengers and search for bodies . 
 Chief Rubin initially confirmed four fatalities ( including the train operator ) and 74 injuries , 14 of which were considered moderate and 6 critical . Five of the dead were discovered in the wreckage and removed from the site of the collision on the morning of June 23 , as cranes dismantling the wrecked trains revealed the bodies . Nine fatalities were eventually confirmed . Major General ( ret . ) David F. <unk> , Jr. of the District of Columbia Air National Guard – known for deploying fighter jets to defend Washington , D.C. during the September 11 attacks – was killed in the collision along with his wife , Ann ; the other passengers killed in the crash were <unk> King , Veronica DuBose , Cameron Williams , Dennis Hawkins , Mary Doolittle , and Ana Fernandez . 
 According to Daniel <unk> , a former George W. Bush administration homeland security official now with the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University , the overall emergency response was " calm and ordered " , indicating that U.S. emergency response " during extraordinary incidents [ has ] significantly improved " since the September 11 attacks . 
 = = = Service disruption = = = 
 Immediately following the incident , Red Line services were suspended between the Fort Totten and Takoma stations , and New Hampshire Avenue was closed . Service between the Silver Spring and Rhode Island Ave – Brentwood stations was suspended pending the completion of the initial investigation and the clearing of debris . This section was expected to remain shut down at least through June 23 . Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said that transportation " all along the East Coast will be significantly impacted " , as Amtrak and MARC Trains run on tracks adjacent to the crash site . Bus services were effected to route Metrorail passengers around the closed track , but area commuting was severely affected . The federal government urged its employees in the capital area to <unk> on June 23 if possible . The Red Line was projected to be very crowded after resumption of service and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ( WMATA ) advised people to take alternate bus routes . The replacement bus shuttle between the affected stations was expected to be subjected to long delays . 
 Services were restored in both directions on Saturday , June 27 , but with a reduced maximum speed of 35 mph on the entire Red Line , and slower speeds in the area of the collision . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Initial inquiry = = = 
 Shortly after the incident , WMATA General Manager John Catoe stated that the cause was not known but that " the system is safe . " The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) began an investigation . WMATA and NTSB investigators considered several possible causes , which might include operator error , brake failure , fault in the computerized signal and operation system , or a combination of the three . During rush hour operation , train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system , and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision . These systems had failed at least once in the past , and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications , from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design . The train has a manual emergency brake , which can be applied by the driver in the event of an imminent collision , if the driver can see and identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop . Officials indicated that the manual brake was indeed engaged . It is possible that the brake system failed to perform as designed , or that the operator applied the brake too late . The lead car of the moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance . In a press conference the evening of June 22 , Catoe stated that the last car on the stopped train was a CAF 5000 @-@ Series car ( car 5066 ) , which entered service in 2001 , and that the lead car on the moving train was a Rohr Industries 1000 @-@ Series car . WMATA later confirmed that all of the cars on the moving train were 1000 @-@ Series . 
 The 1000 @-@ Series entered service in 1976 when the Metro system opened , and were refurbished and had their motors converted from DC to AC propulsion by Breda Costruzioni <unk> in the mid @-@ 1990s . In 2006 , the NTSB cited the 1000 @-@ Series cars as " vulnerable to catastrophic telescoping damage and complete loss of occupant survival space in a longitudinal end @-@ structure collision " . It recommended refurbishment of the entire series after a 2004 collision at the Woodley Park station in which a 1000 @-@ Series Rohr car telescoped into another train . In this case , NTSB 's Hersman confirmed that , " the first car [ of the striking train ] overrode the rear car [ of the struck train ] , and much of the survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised " . The NTSB called for the accelerated retirement of the 1000 @-@ Series cars , or urged that they be " retrofitted with <unk> collision protection that is comparable to 6000 @-@ Series car railcars . " Additionally , the 1000 @-@ Series cars lack data recorders that could be used in determining the cause of a crash . During the press conference , Catoe stated that he had " no basis to suspend the use of 1000 @-@ Series cars at this time " . However , WMATA later announced a decision to no longer use the 1000 @-@ Series cars as the lead or trailing units of any trains . 
 On June 24 , WMATA issued a press release stating that the agency is " not likely to know the cause for several weeks or months as the investigation unfolds . " Twenty @-@ four hours after the incident , the NTSB confirmed that evidence indicated that the emergency brake had been engaged by the operator . Additionally , the striking train was in automatic mode and so the on @-@ board software should have stopped the train . 
 On June 25 , NTSB tests of the 740 @-@ foot ( 230 m ) long track circuit below the stopped train showed that it did not work correctly , failing to detect the presence of a test train that investigators had placed on it . Hersman said , " These circuits are vital . It 's a signal system . It 's providing information , authorization and speed commands to the following train , " but stopped short of blaming them in this case . WMATA had replaced all 20 @,@ 000 track circuit relays system @-@ wide in 1999 , after a component designed to last 70 years began failing after only 25 years in service , but the agency claims that none of the newer relays had failed prior to this event . WMATA ordered the inspection of all track circuits on its 106 miles ( 171 km ) of track after the NTSB test . On July 23 , the NTSB announced that the track circuit at the accident site had been malfunctioning since 2007 , 18 months prior to the collision , and WMATA has since found six other circuits within the system that have been behaving unusually . WMATA disabled each circuit that could not be immediately fixed and created an online circuit tracking system , similar to its elevator outage tracker . 
 = = = NTSB report = = = 
 The NTSB report on the accident was released on July 27 , 2010 , and blamed a faulty track circuit , part of the automatic train control system , for causing the crash . WMATA made a press release detailing changes on July 26 in anticipation of the release of the report . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 On June 22 , 2015 , the sixth anniversary of the accident , the Legacy Memorial Park in honor of the victims was opened ; ground was broken exactly one year previously by Mayor Vincent C. Gray . The park features a memorial wall and nine inscribed sculptures , one in honor of each person killed in the crash . The sculptures were created by sculptor Barbara Liotta , and the memorial was designed by the firm of Hunt <unk> ; the design is titled A Sacred Grove . Representatives of victims ' families and city government officials attended the dedication , but Metro officials did not . The park is located at the entrance to Blair Memorial Gardens , which is close to the site of the collision . 
 The same week as the memorial dedication , the National Transportation Safety Board held hearings related to another fatal incident in the Metro system , one which happened earlier in 2015 ; the juxtaposition of the two events was noted by some commentators . 
 On the third anniversary of the crash , a plaque on the Charles <unk> Bridge was unveiled . The bridge crosses the rail tracks at the site of the accident , and a makeshift memorial had been maintained there by victims ' families . NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman attended the unveiling along with Mayor Gray . Another memorial plaque was also installed , by Metro officials , at Fort Totten station ; it was subject to complaints from relatives of the dead , who claimed that it was insensitive .

 Bart is visited by <unk> Millwood , whose company makes films out of web cartoon series . Millwood offers Bart a chance to make a film adaptation of the web cartoon Angry Dad . Bart accepts , and Millwood takes him to film studio animators . Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad , as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid . The film is test screened to a horrible reception . Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like , thus making the Angry Dad a short film . The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short . 
 At the Golden Globe ceremony , Angry Dad wins , and Homer takes credit in his acceptance speech for creating the film , to the dismay of Bart. Homer takes credit at many other awards ceremonies . Angry Dad soon receives an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film . Out of frustration against Homer for taking the credit , Bart attempts to distract Homer from going by making him and Marge go on an attraction tour in Los Angeles while he and Lisa attend the awards . However , Homer gets recognized by others who take him to the ceremony . Homer arrives in time to see Angry Dad win the Oscar . Bart goes up to accept the Oscar and thanks Lisa for having the idea to make the film into a short film , the animation studio , and Homer . Touched by this , Homer gets up on stage with Bart and apologizes to him for taking all the credit , and the two agree to cut up the Oscar and give a piece to everyone on the animation team .

 Angry Dad first appeared in the season 13 episode " I Am Furious ( Yellow ) " . In the show , it is a comic book and web series that Bart created based on Homer 's constant fits of rage . In this episode , Bart and Homer make a short film about the character , which wins a number of awards . Executive producer Al Jean said it is " a bit of a satire of the different Oscar acceptances where two people clearly race to the stage to get there first , and Homer and Bart are fighting to be the one that accepts . " Academy Award winner Halle Berry guest starred as herself . She was designed to be wearing a similar dress to the one she wore at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002 . Ricky Gervais appeared as himself , his second guest appearance on the show after season 17 's " Homer Simpson , This Is Your Wife " . The episode aired a month after Gervais hosted the 68th Golden Globe Awards , which was criticized by some as being mean @-@ spirited . 
 Comedian Russell Brand guest starred as himself . He told The Sun that , " I was having an amazing birthday party and found out I was going into space .

 This episode of The Simpsons featured multiple references to animation and Hollywood . Pixar is referenced in the episode as " <unk> " . In the 1999 era of the studio you can hear the song " Bye Bye Bye " by NSYNC . The short film Condiments serves as a parody of the Pixar film Toy Story , and the song " You 've Got an Enemy " ( sung by Castellaneta impersonating Randy Newman ) references " You 've Got a Friend in Me " . Willis and Crumble parodies Wallace and Gromit , and uses the same style of stop @-@ motion animation . Nick Park , the creator of Wallace and Gromit , has a voice cameo as himself . Multiple other short film fragments further lampooned other movies including The Triplets of Belleville and Persepolis . The episode also references Ricky Gervais 's controversial hosting stunt at the 68th Golden Globe Awards , with a sign featuring a picture of him alongside a caption reading " Do Not Allow This Man To Host " . The montage of Angry Dad winning awards uses the theme from Jurassic Park . The opening Itchy & Scratchy skit is a parody of The Bride being trained in Kill Bill : Volume 2 and a composition similar to Ennio Morricone 's " L <unk> " ( used in the film ) can be heard . Homer thanks " the cute one from The Bangles " during his acceptance speech .

 The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth ( Bradypus pygmaeus ) , also known as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth , is a sloth endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas , a small island off the coast of Panama . The species was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr . , of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001 . The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth is significantly smaller than the other three members of its genus , but otherwise resembles the brown @-@ throated three @-@ toed sloth .

A 2012 census of pygmy three @-@ toed sloths estimated the total population at 79 . The IUCN lists the pygmy three @-@ toed sloth as critically endangered . 
 = = Discovery and taxonomy = = 
 The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr . , of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001 . The researchers noted that the three @-@ toed sloths endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas , a small island off the coast of Panama , are significantly smaller than those that occur on the nearby outer islands of Bocas del Toro Province . Moreover , they differ from other populations in terms of pelage and cranial characteristics . Hence , they considered the three @-@ toed sloths in Isla Escudo de Veraguas to be an independent species and formally described it from the skin and skull of an adult female . The researchers further pointed out that Isla Escudos de Veraguas is the oldest island and located farthest from the mainland , that began breaking up into small islands due to rises in sea levels 10 @,@ 000 years ago . They proposed that this species evolved from an isolated population that had originated from the mainland population of brown @-@ throated three @-@ toed sloths ; it gradually differentiated enough to become an independent species through insular dwarfism . In another study the following year , the researchers observed that the mean body size of three @-@ toed sloths on an island decreases linearly as the age of the island increases ; the area of the island and the distance from the mainland , however , do not appear to significantly affect dwarfing . 
 The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth is one of the four members of the genus Bradypus , and is classified under the family <unk> . A 2004 phylogenetic analysis suggested that Bradypus is sister to all other <unk> . The generic name Bradypus is the combination of two Greek words : <unk> ( " slow " ) and pous ( " foot " ) . The specific name pygmaeus comes from the Greek <unk> ( " as small as a fist " ) . ' Monk sloth ' and ' dwarf sloth ' are two other names for this sloth .

 The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth is significantly smaller than the other members of its genus , but otherwise resembles the brown @-@ throated sloth . According to Anderson and Handley Jr . , the head @-@ and @-@ body length is between 48 and 53 centimetres ( 19 and 21 in ) , and the body mass ranges from 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 5 kg ( 5 @.@ 5 to 7 @.@ 7 lb ) . The brown @-@ throated sloth is nearly 40 % heavier and 15 % smaller in head @-@ and @-@ body length than the pygmy three @-@ toed sloth . Moreover , the brown @-@ throated sloth is lighter on the crown . The face is buff to tan ; a dark band runs across the brow , surrounded by an orange patch . The throat is gray to brown , lighter than the underbelly ; the dark brown back is spotted and has a dark stripe along the midline . Facial hair is short , while the long , rough hair on the crown and shoulders forms a hood . The grayish limbs have three claws each . The tail is 4 @.@ 5 to 6 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) long . 
 They have a relatively small and slender skull , with a large external auditory meatus , narrow squamosal and mandibular processes , a minuscule stylomastoid foramen , and usually lack foramina for the external carotid artery and anterodorsal ( meaning in front and toward the back ) nasopharynx . The dental formula of three @-@ toed sloths is : 54 – 5 Two of the teeth in each jaw are incisor @-@ like , although those in the upper jaw are small or may be absent . Many of the features found in pygmy sloths are thought to be indicative of a relatively rapid evolution of a new species in an isolated , island habitat . 
 = = Distribution and status = = 
 The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth is unique in that it is found exclusively in the red mangroves of Isla Escudos de Veraguas ; it is confined to a small area of approximately 4 @.@ 3 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 sq mi ) . A 2012 census of pygmy three @-@ toed sloths estimated the total population at 79 – of which 70 occurred on mangroves and 9 in the surroundings . The population density was calculated as 5 @.@ 8 per hectare . The total area occupied by mangroves on the island was estimated to be around 10 @.@ 67 hectares ( 0 @.@ <unk> sq mi ) . While their population has presumably always been low due to their restricted range , the 2012 census found far lower numbers than had been estimated ( less than 500 ) by the IUCN in 2010 . 
 The IUCN lists the pygmy three @-@ toed sloth as critically endangered ; it is also listed in CITES Appendix II . According to the IUCN , conservation efforts are being hampered by conflict between locals and the government . Threats to the sloth 's survival include timber harvesting and human settlement , that might lead to habitat degradation . Studies in 2010 and 2013 suggested a recent population bottleneck and decline in genetic variability . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth , like others in its genus , is an arboreal ( tree @-@ living ) animal . This sloth can spend as many as 15 to 20 hours on trees . It moves at an extremely slow speed of 0 @.@ 24 kilometres per hour ( 0 @.@ 15 mph ) , making it one of the slowest animals . The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth is symbiotically related to green algae ; a 2010 study investigated this in detail . Different sloths harbour different types of algae – only <unk> species were found on the brown @-@ throated and pygmy three @-@ toed sloths . These algae discolor the fur of the sloth , giving it a greenish hue – this serves as an efficient camouflage . Some of these algae might be transferred to offspring through the mother , others may be picked up from the surroundings over time . The smaller size of pygmy sloths reduces their energy requirements for survival and reproduction , making them an apparent example of insular dwarfism . A BBC documentary , in which English naturalist Chris Packham recognizes the pygmy three @-@ toed sloth as the first in his list of the top ten discoveries in the 2000s , shows a rare clip of a swimming pygmy three @-@ toed sloth . 
 Like other sloths , the pygmy three @-@ toed sloth feeds on leaves . It feeds on red mangrove leaves , which are relatively poor in nutrients and coarser than the tender leaves of Cecropia species eaten by brown @-@ throated sloths on the mainland . Details of mating behavior and reproduction have not been documented . 
 = Alaska Airlines = 
 Alaska Airlines is an American airline based in the Seattle metropolitan area , Washington . Before this they were McGee Airways in 1932 , offering flights from Anchorage , Alaska . Today , Alaska has flights to more than one hundred destinations in the contiguous United States , Alaska , Hawaii , Canada , Costa Rica and Mexico . The airline is a major air carrier and , along with its sister airline Horizon Air , is part of the Alaska Air Group . The airline has been ranked by J. D. Power and Associates as having the highest customer satisfaction of the traditional airlines for nine consecutive years . 
 The airline operates its largest hub at Seattle – Tacoma International Airport ( known as Sea @-@ Tac ) . Although most of its revenue and traffic comes from locations outside of Alaska , the airline plays a major role in air transportation in the state . It operates many flights linking small towns to major transportation hubs and carries more passengers between Alaska and the contiguous United States than any other airline . 
 Alaska Airlines is not a member of any of the three major airline alliances . However , it has codeshare agreements with some members of oneworld , such as American Airlines , British Airways , and LATAM Chile , and with some SkyTeam members , including Air France , Korean Air and Delta Air Lines . Delta , despite cooperating through codeshares , is a major competitor to Alaska Air in its Sea @-@ Tac market . The Alaska Air Group has been a part of the Dow Jones Transportation Average since 2011 , when it replaced the then @-@ parent company of American Airlines , AMR Corporation , in the index . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years ( 1932 – 1945 ) = = = 
 The airline traces its roots to McGee Airways , which was started by <unk> " Mac " McGee in 1932 . The airline flew its inaugural service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay with a Stinson single @-@ engined , three @-@ passenger aircraft . At the time , there were no scheduled flights ; a flight took place when there were passengers or a load of cargo or mail . 
 It was the middle of the Great Depression and the airline was struggling financially . There were too many airlines in Anchorage at the time , and not enough demand to support them . In the next few years the airline performed many mergers and acquisitions that produced changes in the name and saw business expand throughout Alaska . The first of these mergers was in 1934 , when McGee sold his namesake airline for US $ 50 @,@ 000 to Star Air Service , an airline also located in Anchorage . This allowed McGee to enter the mining industry . With a fleet of fifteen aircraft , Star Air Service was a dominant airline in Alaska . But Star continued to struggle financially because of high maintenance costs for its wooden planes . 
 In 1937 , McGee came back to the airline and opened a liquor store , and the airline began flying liquor to remote Alaskan communities . That year , Star Air Service purchased Alaska Interior Airlines and was incorporated as Star Air Lines . Star was again sold later that year to a group of miners . 
 In 1938 , federal regulation began when Congress created the Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) . The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska , but the coveted route between Seattle and Anchorage was awarded to Pan American Airways . 
 In 1941 , Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall , a businessman from New York . In 1942 , the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska , Lavery Air Service , <unk> Air Service , and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the Anchorage airport . That year , the airline 's name was changed to Alaska Star Airlines . The name Alaska Airlines was adopted on May 2 , 1944 having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name . In the 1940s Alaska 's headquarters were in Anchorage . 
 When the United States entered World War II in December 1941 , Alaska Airlines faced a shortage of pilots . During the war , the airline lacked funds and equipment , and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets . The company , which was frequently subjected to lawsuits , also went through many different presidents during this time . In 1943 , Alaska Airlines purchased the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar , its first multi @-@ engine aircraft . That same year the company 's stock was traded for the very first time on the American Stock Exchange . 
 = = = Expansion after World War II ( 1945 – 1949 ) = = = 
 In 1945 , Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses . In 1947 , James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly . Under his leadership , the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II . The airline purchased Douglas DC @-@ 3s , Douglas DC @-@ 4s and Curtiss @-@ Wright C @-@ 46 Commandos . Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC @-@ 3s on skis . 
 Alaska Airlines ' large charter business made it profitable , and the airline moved its base of operations to Paine Field , an airport north of Seattle . It kept a branch office in Anchorage , however . Despite its success , Alaska Airlines ' worldwide charter business was short @-@ lived . In 1949 , the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations . The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights , and president James Wooten left the company . Also in 1949 , Alaska Air began operating five Bell 47B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the North Slope thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary @-@ wing aircraft . 
 In 1949 , the airlines lifted many Jews out of Yemen to Israel in what became known as Operation Magic Carpet . C @-@ 46 or DC @-@ 4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3000 miles flight , From Eritrea to Aden then along the Gulf of Aqaba to Tel @-@ Aviv . The planes then flew to Cyprus in fear of the bombings . More than 40 @,@ 000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers . 
 = = = New leadership ( 1950s ) = = = 
 Alaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska . In 1950 , it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines , Collins Air Service and Al Jones Airways . 
 Though the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall , the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles . Also , Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long @-@ term stability of the company . In 1951 , the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States ; this award would become permanent in 1957 . 
 In 1952 , the CAB appointed Nelson David as president , and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline . By 1957 , with the carrier in a better financial situation , David left and Charles Willis , Jr. became the company 's new president and CEO . A pilot during WWII , Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day . Under his leadership , Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies . The company began service of the Douglas DC @-@ 6 , the airline 's first pressurized plane , enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances . On these DC @-@ 6 's , the airline introduced " Golden Nugget " service , which included an on @-@ board saloon and piano . 
 = = = The jet age ( 1960s ) = = = 
 In 1961 , competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew . To counter this competition , Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer Convair to purchase a Convair 880 jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States . The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year . In 1966 the company received its first Boeing 727 @-@ 100 jets and also removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners . Several of Alaska 's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters , in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger / freight combi aircraft . In the spring of 1967 , greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a Convair 990 jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier <unk> as PP @-@ <unk> which then became Alaska Airlines <unk> . This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727 @-@ 100 's which were then joined by stretched Boeing 727 @-@ 200s which in turn became Alaska Airlines ' signature aircraft for the next 25 years . It also became the first carrier to fly the Lockheed L @-@ 100 Hercules ( <unk> model ) , the civil version of the military C @-@ 130 cargo turboprop , which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska 's North Slope and later to Ecuador . Alaska also owned Lockheed Constellation <unk> including two Lockheed L @-@ <unk> <unk> from 1962 to 1968 , and three L @-@ 1049 's which were used for Military Air Transport Service operations . Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated , including the Convair 240 , de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 Twin Otter and Super Catalina amphibian aircraft as well as two versions of the Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft , one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the " Turbo @-@ Goose " . 
 During this time , Alaska Air faced some tough competition with other airlines such as Northwest Airlines , Pan Am and Pacific Northern Airlines , the latter being an Alaska @-@ based air carrier operating Boeing 720 jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into Western Airlines in 1967 . Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated Boeing 747 wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle @-@ Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle @-@ Fairbanks nonstop with the 747 . To set itself apart from the competition , Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes , staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route . 
 In December 1962 Air Guinée signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise , in addition to two Douglas DC @-@ 6s . The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven @-@ year period but the contract ended after only six months , leading to the United States Agency for International Development paying a US $ 700 @,@ 000 debt owed by the Guinean airline to Alaska Airlines . 
 In 1965 , Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities , as well as some smaller aircraft , to Wien Air Alaska . This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft . 
 Throughout the 1960s , Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the continental United States . In an attempt to increase the state 's appeal , Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963 . In 1967 , as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial , Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional " Gay Nineties " theme with stewardesses dressed in Edwardian outfits . That year , Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to Sitka . This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines , Alaska Coastal Airlines and Cordova Airlines , in 1968 . 
 = = = Economic hardship ( 1970s ) = = = 
 In the beginning of the 1970s , Alaska Airlines began charter service to Siberia in the Soviet Union . This was the result of three years of secret negotiations between Alaska Airlines and Soviet authorities , in which the US Department of State reluctantly chose not to block the plan for fear of a potentially negative response from the Soviets . The airline gained permission to fly more than two @-@ dozen flights in 1970 , 1971 and 1972 . Alaska Airlines was also operating Boeing 707 , Boeing 720 and Boeing 720B jetliners during the early and mid 1970s . 
 However , the airline was not in good financial shape at that time . Like much of the airline industry , Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy . Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the Trans @-@ Alaska Pipeline System was delayed . The airline 's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline , but now sat idle . The airline took another blow on September 4 , 1971 , when a Boeing 727 @-@ 100 jetliner crashed on landing in Juneau , killing 111 people and resulting in the worst single @-@ plane crash at the time . Because the airline was struggling financially , the airline 's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis . Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him . The airline was US $ 22 million in debt when Cosgrave took over , so Cosgrave began to make major cuts . The airline 's cargo business was dropped completely , as well as many flights and employees . Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline 's tarnished image of " Elastic Airlines . " The logo was changed to an image of a smiling Eskimo , which remains today . As a result of these efforts , the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter . 
 = = = Post @-@ deregulation expansion ( 1978 – 1990 ) = = = 
 Alaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act , knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation . After deregulation , the company 's real @-@ estate division was spun off into its own company , with Cosgrave becoming its chairman . Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy , a close associate of Cosgrave . Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor Wien Air Alaska , but this ultimately failed and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition . 
 At the time of deregulation , Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US — the city of Seattle — , and it had only ten planes in its fleet . Immediately after deregulation , the airline began to expand , adding the cities of Portland and San Francisco to its network . Soon later , the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities Nome and Kotzebue , and it also introduced service to Palm Springs , California . Burbank and Ontario were added in 1981 . In 1979 , Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with Hughes Air West , however this never came to fruition . Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline 's route map by 1985 were Oakland and San Jose in California , Spokane in Washington , Boise in Idaho , and Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona . 
 Deregulation also brought challenges to the airline , however . The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs , profits and salaries . By 1979 , competitors Northwest Airlines and Western Airlines were both flying wide body McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 jets on the core Anchorage @-@ Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by Wien Air Alaska which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle . Northwest was operating nonstop DC @-@ 10 service on the Fairbanks @-@ Seattle route at this time as well . There were also tensions with unions , particularly mechanics and flight attendants . In 1985 , the company had a three @-@ month @-@ long strike with its machinists . By June the same year , it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions . In November 1985 , the airline introduced a daily air @-@ freight service called Gold Streak with service to and from Alaska . 
 In the 1980s , Alaska Airlines began acquiring McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 80s to replace their aging 727s . Alaska was the launch customer for the MD @-@ 83 , taking delivery of their first MD @-@ 80s in 1985 . 
 Also in 1985 , the Alaska Air Group was formed as a holding company for Alaska Airlines . In 1986 Alaska Air Group acquired regional airline Horizon Air , which remained a separate brand from Alaska Airlines ; since then , both airlines have been subsidiaries of Alaska Air Group . In 1987 , Alaska Airlines purchased Jet America Airlines . Alaska initially operated Jet America as a separate airline , but this proved economically unviable and Jet America 's operations were merged into Alaska 's . Alaska also discontinued all flights to the Midwest and the East coast formerly operated by Jet America . Additional MD @-@ 80s entered the fleet via the acquisition of Jet America Airlines in 1987 . 
 There was also a big seasonal imbalance in travel to Alaska , which mainly took place in the summer . In an effort to compensate for this , the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts , where most travel takes place in the winter . In 1988 , the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta . By the end of the 1980s , 70 percent of Alaska Airlines ' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska . The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger , more profitable markets . 
 = = = New competition , new technologies ( 1990s ) = = = 
 The airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 Boeing 737 – 400s from International Lease Finance Corporation ( ILFC ) , all of which remain in Alaska 's fleet to this day . The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992 . 
 In 1991 , Alaska Airlines added several routes . In the Russian Far East , it added the cities of Magadan and Khabarovsk , as well as service to Toronto , its first Canadian city and the first city east of the Rocky Mountains . However , Toronto was later dropped , in 1992 . 
 As the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service , Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. <unk> . 
 Alaska Airlines also faced increased competition from low @-@ cost carriers . One carrier that competed with Alaska was <unk> . Since it began operating in 1984 , competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines . However , after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991 , it intensified competition with Alaska . The airline offered low @-@ cost service on the Anchorage @-@ Seattle route and other routes in Alaska , where Alaska Airlines earned almost one @-@ third of its revenues . This hurt Alaska Airlines ; for the first time in 20 years , it posted a loss of US $ 121 million . To save money , the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth US $ 2 billion . It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes , though . The airline also cut labor costs , but this ended up making relations with unions tense . 
 The cost reductions produced quick results . In 1993 , their losses decreased to US $ 45 million and they made a US $ 40 million profit the next year . Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record @-@ setting cargo operations . 
 Alaska had more competition in 1993 when low @-@ cost airline Southwest Airlines entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing Morris Air . Nevertheless , Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down , but it maintained its high level of customer service . The airline also promoted itself as " the last great airline " and with the motto " For the same price , you just get more " , yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts . At the same time , the company had many strikes by the flight attendants ' union . 
 Alaska continued to take delivery of new MD @-@ <unk> during the 1990s , both to meet the demands of a growing route system , and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet . Their last 727 was retired in March 1994 . The airline 's MD @-@ 80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996 . 
 <unk> was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly , former Horizon Air CEO . The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an " open skies " agreement between the US and Canada . 
 Alaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s . It added a heads @-@ up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions , becoming the first airline to use this technology . In 1995 , the airline became the first to sell tickets on the Internet . By 2000 , all the airline 's planes carried automated external <unk> , for use in in @-@ flight emergencies . The airline also installed self @-@ service kiosks called " Instant Travel Machines " that printed boarding passes , allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter . An X @-@ ray device , an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage . This concept , known as " Airport of the Future " by the airline , was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub , and it drew attention from other airlines as well . The airline would also become the first airline in the world to integrate GPS and Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System ( <unk> ) technology , adding a real @-@ time , three @-@ dimensional display of terrain . The system was operational in all the carrier 's Boeing 737 @-@ 400s by April 1999 . 
 The late 1990s also saw the carrier recording much profitability . The airline added new training and maintenance facilities . Also , the airline began buying new 737s , ordering three Boeing 737 – 700s and ten Boeing 737 – 900s . Alaska Airlines became the launch customer for the 737 – 900 when it placed an order for it in November 1997 . 
 = = = Introducing flights across the U.S. ( 2000s ) = = = 
 With the delivery of Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft starting in 1999 , Alaska began launching more medium @-@ haul flights . In 2000 , Alaska started service between Anchorage and Chicago . On May 15 , 2001 , the airline took delivery of its first 737 – 900 . In 2001 , the airline was granted slot exemptions by the Department of Transportation to operate a nonstop flight from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Seattle , but it was halted after only a week due to the September 11 , 2001 attacks . The airline resumed service to Reagan Airport on December 4 , 2001 to meet the demand . 
 In January 2002 , William Ayer was named CEO of Alaska Airlines , who was replaced by Brad Tilden in 2012 . Ayer had been serving as president under Kelly since 1997 , having come to Alaska from Horizon two years earlier after spending 13 years with the smaller airline . Ayer took over as chairman and CEO of the Alaska in 2003 upon Kelly 's retirement . He led the company through a transformation called Alaska 2010 that was intended to insulate the airline from the traditional boom @-@ bust cycle of the airline industry . 
 In 2002 , flights to Newark , New Jersey were launched and in 2003 , services to Orlando began . In 2003 , service to Boston began . 
 In 2003 , Alaska Airlines won the Technology Leadership Award from the magazine Air Transport World for its pioneering of new technologies both in the airport and within the airplane itself . 
 In 2005 , due to the greater efficiency of the Boeing 737 Next Generation and rising costs for maintenance , fuel , and crew training , Alaska Airlines decided to phase out its remaining 26 MD @-@ 80s and trained its pilots to fly the newer Boeing 737 – 800s that were being ordered to replace them . According to the airline , the MD @-@ 80 burned 1 @,@ 100 US gallons ( 4 @,@ 200 l ) of fuel per hour , while the 737 – 800 burns just 850 US gallons ( 3 @,@ 200 l ) per hour . The last MD @-@ 80 flights flew on August 25 , 2008 , with one flight from San Jose , California to Seattle , Washington and another from Sacramento , California to Seattle , Washington . To mark its transition to an all @-@ Boeing fleet , Alaska Airlines unveiled a 737 – 800 with Boeing 's house colors painted on the fuselage and the airline 's Eskimo logo painted on the tail fin . The aircraft , called Spirit of Seattle , shows Alaska 's commitment to Boeing and the fact that the airline now has an all @-@ Boeing fleet . 
 Also in 2005 , Alaska Airlines contracted out many of its jobs , including ground crew positions , to Menzies Aviation . In some cases this resulted in an almost 40 % decline in wages . This agreement was found to be a violation of union agreements in 2008 and the new ground crews caused enough damage to aircraft in the first year to make the savings negligible . In addition , Menzies contractors gained a reputation of stealing from checked bags after a few incidents in 2007 . 
 In February 2007 , Alaska Airlines introduced its first two Boeing 737 – 400 Combis to their fleet in order to replace their aging Boeing 737 – 200 Combi aircraft . The − 400 Combis have 20 % more passenger and cargo capacity than the aircraft they replaced , and can carry a combination of four cargo pallets and 72 passengers . The aircraft were originally introduced as passenger aircraft in 1992 , but have now been converted by Pemco Air Services . Pemco Air Services also converted the airline 's Boeing 737 @-@ 400F . 
 On September 9 , 2007 , Alaska Airlines introduced daily nonstop service between Portland , Oregon to Boston , Massachusetts . On October 12 , 2007 , the airline began service to Hawaii with a flight to Honolulu from Seattle . Seattle – Kauai service began on October 28 , 2007 and Anchorage – Honolulu service began on December 6 , 2007 . 
 On October 26 , 2008 , Alaska launched service from Seattle to Minneapolis @-@ Saint Paul . On August 3 , 2009 , service from Seattle to Austin , Texas began . Service from Seattle to Houston began on September 23 , 2009 and from Seattle to Atlanta on October 23 , 2009 .

 On September 27 , 2010 Alaska Airlines began service between Seattle and Lambert @-@ St. Louis International Airport . 
 On August 23 , 2010 , Alaska Air Group , the parent company , unveiled a capacity purchase agreement in which all decisions regarding route choices and marketing services for Horizon Air were to be made by Alaska Airlines by early 2011 . Therefore , all ticket revenue from Horizon would go directly to Alaska , while Horizon 's operating costs would be covered . Subsequently , Alaska retired the Horizon brand . All Horizon aircraft were repainted in the Alaska livery , with Horizon 's pre @-@ existing services remaining intact . 
 In January 2011 , Alaska Airlines placed an order for thirteen 737 @-@ 900ERs . The aircraft will be delivered between 2012 and 2014 Alaska also ordered two 737 @-@ 800s as part of this order . 
 The airline also recorded record profits for 2010 , as well as record profits for the fourth quarter of 2010 . The profit for the entire year was $ 251 @.@ 1 million , an increase from $ 121 @.@ 6 million a year earlier . Alaska ’ s 2010 fourth @-@ quarter profit of $ 64 @.@ 8 million was up from $ 24 @.@ 1 million from the fourth quarter of the previous year . Also in 2010 , Alaska ranked as the most efficient airline operating in The United States . 
 Alaska Airlines continues pioneering new technologies today . In 2011 Alaska Airlines partnered with Boeing and Fujitsu to be the first to use a new technology called Component Management Optimization , which will streamline maintenance checks . It will do this by allowing mechanics to point a handheld device at little RFID tags attached to certain parts of the aircraft , which will display information about when parts were last replaced . This will allow mechanics to perform inspections quicker than conventional methods . The program is scheduled to launch in 2012 . Also in mid @-@ 2011 , the airline issued iPads to its pilots to replace 25 pounds of paper flight manuals that pilots are currently required to carry on flights . Alaska Airlines is the first major airline to use iPads on flights ; all pilots had iPads by the middle of June 2011 . This was the first part of the airline 's initiative to do away with the flight bag ; the airline is also considering using iPads for displaying aeronautical charts . 
 In November 2011 Alaska Airlines flew 75 commercial passenger flights in the U.S. powered by biofuel using a 20 percent blend of sustainable biofuel made from used cooking oil that meets rigorous international safety and sustainability standards . 
 On February 16 , 2012 , Alaska Airlines ' CEO , Bill Ayer , retired .

 Alaska Airlines announced a plan in June 2013 to begin replacing Boeing 737s on flights between Fairbanks and Anchorage , Alaska with Bombardier Q400s operated by Horizon Air and based out of Anchorage beginning in March 2014 . The plan was intended to reduce operating expenses and eventually lower fares , but was met with a great deal of skepticism by Fairbanks residents who expressed their frustration about safety of the aircraft and outside boarding in the cold winter climate through social media . Alaska Airlines responded to the comments on Facebook attempting to reassure passengers of the safety of the Bombardier Q400s as well as promising to address the unusual aspects of flying in Alaska . The airline ended up modifying one of the jetways at Fairbanks International Airport so that passengers would not have to go outside to board . 
 Alaska Airlines has announced 3 new nonstop destinations from Seattle . These services to Charleston , Nashville and Raleigh @-@ Durham will begin in late 2015 using their 737 aircraft . Alaska is additionally starting service between Los Angeles and Baltimore @-@ Washington , starting September 9 , 2015 .

 With the exception of Bombardier Q400s operated by Horizon Air and Bombardier <unk> and Embraer <unk> operated by SkyWest Airlines , Alaska Airlines has an all @-@ Boeing 737 fleet . As of July 2016 , the fleet consists of the following aircraft : 
 Since the retirement of its McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 80s in 2008 , Alaska Airlines has been operating a fleet consisting of only Boeing 737s . Alaska Airlines became the launch customer of the Boeing 737 – 900 in 1997 and currently operates twelve of the aircraft . 
 In January 2011 , Alaska Airlines placed an order for 15 737s , worth US $ 1 @.@ 3 billion at list prices . The order consists of two 737 @-@ 800s and thirteen 737 @-@ 900ERs . The 737 @-@ 900ERs are a new addition to Alaska Airlines ' fleet and will be used on the airline 's long @-@ haul routes . Thanks to its increased range , the 737 @-@ 900ER will be able to fly transcontinental routes with more passengers , such as the Seattle @-@ Orlando route . " Depending on the ultimate configuration , the larger 737 @-@ 900ER will have between 21 and 27 seats more than our existing <unk> @-@ 800 [ sic ] aircraft and will be a perfect fit for our longer @-@ haul and high @-@ traffic West Coast markets , " Alaska Airlines President Brad Tilden said in his company ’ s release . The airline put its first 737 @-@ 900ER into service on November 8 , 2012 on a flight from Seattle to San Diego . The airline expects to take delivery of the planes between 2012 and 2017 .

 Since the 1960s , Alaska has consistently operated Boeing jet aircraft in its fleet although the first jetliner type operated by the airline was the Convair 880 . Alaska also operated the Convair 990 jetliner . Besides the current Boeing 737 models flown by Alaska , the airline previously operated the Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 as well as the Boeing 727 @-@ 100 , 727 @-@ 200 and 737 @-@ 200 . The last 727 was retired in May 1994 . 
 In the 1980s , Alaska began acquiring McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 80s . Alaska acquired additional MD @-@ 80s via the acquisition of Jet America Airlines in 1987 . Alaska was the launch customer for the MD @-@ 83 , and took delivery of the first airplanes in 1985 . Alaska continued to take delivery of new MD @-@ <unk> during the 1990s , both to meet the demands of a growing route system , and to retire its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet . In 2005 , due to the greater efficiency of the Boeing 737 Next Generation and rising costs for maintenance , fuel and crew training , Alaska Airlines decided to phase out the remaining 26 MD @-@ 80s and trained the pilots to fly the newer 737 @-@ 800s that were being ordered to replace them . The last MD @-@ 80 flights took place on August 25 , 2008 . 
 Alaska also used eight Boeing 737 – 200 Combi / QCs to suit the unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska . These aircraft were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured ( hence the moniker QC or " Quick Change " ) to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight . In the all @-@ freight configuration , the 737 @-@ 200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers , known as " igloos . " The <unk> floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats . The 737 @-@ 200s were also gravel @-@ kitted , which allowed them to be used at airports such as Red Dog , which formerly featured a gravel runway . Alaska replaced the 737 @-@ 200s with six reconfigured 737 @-@ 400s between 2006 and 2007 . Five feature a mixed cargo / passenger " Combi " arrangement , and one is a " freighter " carrying only cargo . Unlike the 737 @-@ 200 Combi , the 737 @-@ 400 Combis feature a fixed seating capacity of 72 seats . The last 737 @-@ 200 Combi ( short for combination ) was retired in 2007 and is now displayed at the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum . 
 = = = Livery = = = 
 The airline 's livery consists of the word Alaska on the fuselage , with painting of a native Alaskan on the vertical stabilizer . The " Eskimo face , " as it is often called , was introduced in the early 1970s .

 Today most of its aircraft are white with a black and green stripe running the length of the left and right sides of the fuselage , with " Alaska " in the company 's present @-@ day wordmark displayed prominently on the sides , and the native Alaskan portrait on the vertical stabilizer . The carrier also has several special liveries :

Of the 28 occupants , there were eight fatalities , plus the driver of the car . The crash was attributed to pilot error . 
 January 20 , 1949 
 Flight 8 , a Douglas C @-@ 47A ( <unk> ) , was on routing Homer , Alaska @-@ Kenai , Alaska when the plane struck the side of Ptarmigan Head 9 miles ( 14 km ) east of the center of the airway to Kenai .

All five occupants perished . The cause of the crash was the pilot 's decision to enter an area of low overcast in mountainous terrain , as well as a navigation error . 
 July 21 , 1961 
 Flight 779 , a Douglas DC @-@ 6A ( <unk> ) operating Seattle @-@ Shemya crashed short of the runway , killing the six crew . The cause of the crash was due to the fact that the air traffic controller in the tower had forgotten to turn on the runway and approach lighting systems during a landing at night . 
 April 17 , 1967 
 An Alaska Airlines Lockheed L @-@ <unk> Super Constellation ( <unk> ) with 28 passengers and four crew members aboard landed with landing gear retracted during heavy snowfall at Kotzebue Airport . Everyone on board survived but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair .

 April 5 , 1976 
 Flight 60 , a Boeing 727 – 81 ( <unk> ) operating Juneau @-@ Ketchikan , overran the runway while landing in Ketchikan after the captain decided to attempt a go around at the last moment .

 June 9 , 1987 
 An Alaska Airlines Boeing 727 @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) at Anchorage International Airport with two people on board struck a jetway while taxiing and caught fire , destroying the aircraft . The avionics technician inadvertently deactivated the brake pressurization system .

 Flight 261 , an McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 83 , plunged into the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu , California while preparing to attempt an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport en route from Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , to San Francisco and Seattle , killing all 88 people on board . In its final report , the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads which were part of the <unk> assembly for the horizontal stabilizer 's trim system . The failure of the acme nut threads happened because of insufficient lubrication of the <unk> assembly which was the result of Alaska 's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the Federal Aviation Administration 's ( FAA ) approval of those intervals . NTSB also found that the lack of a fail @-@ safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD @-@ 80 design contributed to the accident . This incident , along with an earlier ValuJet Flight 592 crash , led to closer FAA oversight of airline maintenance operations . The accident was also the subject of episode 6 , season 1 , of the documentary series , Mayday . 
 = Departures ( 2008 film ) = 
 Departures ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Okuribito , " one who sends off " ) is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yōjirō Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki , Ryōko Hirosue , and Tsutomu Yamazaki . Loosely based on Coffinman , a memoir by Shinmon Aoki , the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nōkanshi — a traditional Japanese ritual mortician . He is subjected to prejudice from those around him , including from his wife , because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death . Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work . 
 The idea for Departures arose after Motoki , affected by having seen a funeral ceremony along the Ganges when travelling in India , read widely on the subject of death and came across Coffinman . He felt that the story would adapt well to film , and Departures was finished a decade later . Because of Japanese prejudices against those who handle the dead , distributors were reluctant to release it — until a surprise grand prize win at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 2008 . The following month the film opened in Japan , where it went on to win the Academy Prize for Picture of the Year and become the year 's highest @-@ grossing domestic film . This success was topped in 2009 , when it became the first Japanese production to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film . 
 Departures received mixed to positive reviews , with aggregator Rotten Tomatoes indicating an 81 % approval rating from 103 reviews . Critics praised the film 's humour , the beauty of the encoffining ceremony , and the quality of the acting , but took issue with its predictability and overt sentimentality . Reviewers highlighted a variety of themes , but focused mainly on the humanity which death brings to the surface and how it strengthens family bonds . The success of Departures led to the establishment of tourist attractions at sites connected to the film and increased interest in encoffining ceremonies , as well as adaptation of the story for various media , including manga and a stage play .

 Daigo Kobayashi ( Masahiro Motoki ) loses his job as a cellist when his orchestra is disbanded . He and his wife Mika ( Ryōko Hirosue ) move from Tokyo to his hometown in Yamagata , where they live in his childhood home that was left to him when his mother died two years earlier . It is fronted by a coffee shop that Daigo 's father had operated before he ran off with a waitress when Daigo was six ; since then the two have had no contact . Daigo feels hatred towards his father and guilt for not taking better care of his mother . He still keeps a " letter @-@ stone " — a stone which is said to convey meaning through its texture — which his father had given him many years before . 
 Daigo finds an advertisement for a job " assisting departures " . Assuming it to be a job in a travel agency , he goes to the interview at the NK Agent office and learns from the secretary , Yuriko Kamimura ( Kimiko Yo ) , that he will be preparing bodies for cremation in a ceremony known as encoffinment . Though reluctant , Daigo is hired on the spot and receives a cash advance from his new boss , Sasaki ( Tsutomu Yamazaki ) . Daigo is furtive about his duties and hides the true nature of the job from Mika . 
 His first assignment is to assist with the encoffinment of a woman who died at home and remained undiscovered for two weeks . He is beset with nausea and later humiliated when strangers on a bus detect an unsavoury scent on him . To clean himself , he visits a public bath which he had frequented as a child . It is owned by <unk> Yamashita ( Kazuko Yoshiyuki ) , the mother of one of Daigo 's former classmates . 
 Over time , Daigo becomes comfortable with his profession as he completes a number of assignments and experiences the gratitude of the families of the deceased . Though he faces social ostracism , Daigo refuses to quit , even after Mika discovers a training DVD in which he plays a corpse and leaves him to return to her parents ' home in Tokyo .

 Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally — though not always — conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites . In preparation for the funeral , the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze . The encoffining ritual ( called nōkan ) , as depicted in Departures , is rarely performed , and even then only in rural areas . This ceremony is not standardized , but generally involves professional morticians ( <unk> , nōkanshi ) ritually preparing the body , dressing the dead in white , and sometimes applying make @-@ up . The body is then put on dry ice in a casket , along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife . 
 Despite the importance of death rituals , in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of <unk> ( defilement ) . After coming into contact with the dead , individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals . People who work closely with the dead , such as morticians , are thus considered unclean , and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin ( untouchables ) , forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society . Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868 , the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society , and discrimination against the untouchables has continued . 
 Until 1972 , most deaths were dealt with by families , funeral homes , or nōkanshi . As of 2014 , about 80 % of deaths occur in hospitals , and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff ; in such cases , the family often does not see the body until the funeral . A 1998 survey found that 29 @.@ 5 % of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife , and a further 40 % wanted to believe ; belief was highest among the young . Belief in the existence of a soul ( 54 % ) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead ( 64 @.@ 9 % ) was likewise common .
