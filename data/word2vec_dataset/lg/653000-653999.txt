 = Azimzhan Askarov = 
 Azimzhan Askarov ( Uzbek : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; born 1951 ) is an ethnically Uzbek Kyrgyzstani political activist who founded the group <unk> in 2002 to investigate police brutality . During the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes , which primarily targeted people of the Uzbek nationality , Askarov worked to document the violence . 
 He was subsequently arrested and prosecuted on charges of creating mass disturbances , incitement of ethnic hatred , and complicity in murder . Following a trial protested by several international human rights groups for irregularities — including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police — Askarov was given a life sentence , which he is currently serving . In November 2010 , Askarov 's health was reported to be rapidly deteriorating as a result of his confinement . Numerous groups have advocated on his behalf , including Human Rights Watch , Reporters Without Borders , People In Need , the Committee to Protect Journalists , and Amnesty International , the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience . 
 In 2015 , the U.S. conferred the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award on Askarov . The Kyrgyz government protested this decision and formally terminated a 1993 agreement on cooperation between the U.S. and Kyrgyzstan . On 12 July 2016 , the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan revoked the life sentence against Askarov and sent his case to the <unk> Oblast Court for review . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Azimzhan Askarov was born in 1951 in the village Bazar @-@ Korgon , Kyrgyzstan . He attended an arts college in Tashkent . After getting his degree Askarov worked as a painter and decorator for 15 years . In the early 1990s , he began writing about human rights issues in a local newspaper . He is married to <unk> <unk> and they have three children . 
 = = Human rights work = = 
 Askarov has worked as a human rights activist since the mid @-@ 1990s . In 2002 , he founded the group <unk> ( Air ) to monitor the conditions of Kyrgyz prisons . Working primarily in the area of Bazar @-@ Korgon , Askarov directed this group until the time of his arrest and was able to initiate new investigations of several cases of police brutality and torture . Several police officers were dismissed from their posts as a result of Askarov 's investigations . Askarov has stated that in 2006 , a prosecutor 's investigator sued Askarov following an article he wrote publicizing torture allegations ; the six @-@ month court case ended with a verdict in Askarov 's favor . As a result , Askarov claims , " Enemies in the law enforcement community were constantly looking for an opportunity to shut me down . " 
 = = Arrest and trial = = 
 In July 2010 , Kyrgyzstan saw an outbreak of ethnic violence in which as many as 2 @,@ 000 people , primarily Uzbeks , were killed , and hundreds of thousands displaced . Following the violence , dozens of Uzbek community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence , among them Azimzhan Askarov , who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots . Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings . 
 He was arrested on 15 June 2010 in Bazar @-@ Korgon . Kyrgyzstan 's human rights ombudsman , <unk> <unk> , protested the arrest shortly after . 
 Askarov was tried along with other human rights activists before a court in the <unk> District of the Jalal @-@ Abad Province . An observer from Human Rights Watch stated that both the defendants and the witnesses evidenced fresh bruises and appeared to have been tortured . The observer also stated that members of the trial 's audience openly threatened and assaulted Askarov , other defendants , and their lawyers inside the courtroom , and that local law enforcement refused to intervene . Askarov 's lawyer , <unk> <unk> , stated that he was also approached by the relatives of a police officer and threatened with violence if he continued to defend Askarov , leading Amnesty International to issue an appeal for the safety of both <unk> and Askarov . 
 Askarov testified himself that he had been beaten and tortured while in police custody , and his lawyer reported that Askarov had further bruises on his back . On 4 November 2010 , however , the prosecutor 's office held a press conference to deny any beatings had taken place . 
 = = Imprisonment and health = = 
 On 10 November 2010 , Askarov 's sentence was upheld by an appellate court . Two days later , Amnesty International reported that Askarov 's health was failing rapidly ; he was soon moved from his prison hospital to a hospital in Bishkek . Members of his family expressed concern that he was receiving inadequate care from prison authorities . 
 On 8 February 2011 , the Kyrgyzstani Supreme Court agreed to hear new evidence in Askarov 's case ; however , his hearing was suspended . On 11 April 2011 , his appeal hearing was postponed for the second time . On 20 December 2011 , the Kyrgyzstani Supreme Court upheld Askarov 's sentence . 
 Askarov 's lawyer then said he would protest the Supreme Court 's decision in the UN Human Rights Council , however Askarov himself was against this , feared of not being able to survive until the day of decision . Askarov insists on the review of his case in the Kyrgyz legislature . 
 = = International attention = = 
 Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , the Committee to Protect Journalists , Front Line , International Partnership for Human Rights ( <unk> ) , and the International Federation for Human Rights have all denounced the charges against Askarov . The Committee to Protect Journalists called for him and fellow detainee <unk> <unk> to be released , and for the officers who arrested them to be investigated for " abuse of office " . His cause has also been championed by American actor Martin Sheen . The US Embassy in Bishkek also put pressure on the Kyrgyz government to hold " impartial hearings " on Askarov 's appeal . Reporters Without Borders has called for his immediate release . 
 On 8 March 2011 , People In Need awarded him the Homo Homini Award " in recognition of a dedication to the promotion of human rights , democracy and non @-@ violent solutions to political conflicts . " In an acceptance speech written from prison , Askarov responded , " I cried like a baby . There are no words to express my heartfelt joy . After much suffering , torture and humiliation , I realized once again the high social value of fighting for human rights and justice ! " 
 In May 2011 , an exhibition of Askarov 's paintings opened in Bishkek , organized by his wife and various Kyrgyz human rights organizations . The paintings focus on " the inhabitants of the Fergana valley and scenes from their everyday lives . " 
 In 2012 , Askarov won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists . The award recognizes journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks , threats , or imprisonment . 
 = Bell X1 ( band ) = 
 Bell X1 are a music group from Dublin , Ireland , known for their wide range of styles , powerful live performances , intelligent and witty lyrics and a dedication to touring . NPR says they deliver " a brilliant co @-@ mingling of electronic music and anthemic pop rock " . 
 Bell X1 are festival and arena headliners in their native Ireland and play to ever growing numbers on their regular North American and European tours . Aside from U2 , they are the Irish band with the most airplay in their native country and , according to Billboard , also the second biggest live performers . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Juniper = = = 
 Most of the band were originally members of Juniper . Paul Noonan was Juniper 's drummer and Damien Rice was the lead vocalist ; guitarists Dominic Philips and Brian Crosby and multi @-@ instrumentalist David Geraghty completed the original line @-@ up . Juniper built up a strong live following in Ireland and enjoyed chart success with EP Manna and singles Weatherman and World is Dead ( the latter two through Universal Records ) but never released a full album . The band became a quartet with the departure of Rice over creative differences . Rice admitted in a 2002 interview with the Sunday Tribune that he had become upset after writing a song which the record company had disliked . 
 After a short break they reformed themselves as Bell X1 and Noonan became the new band 's frontman . The live line @-@ up , alongside original members Crosby and Philips , came to be completed by drummer Tim O 'Donovan , and <unk> <unk> Harpur , who also fronts electropop group <unk> . 
 Juniper 's original contract with Polygram Ireland was moved to Island Records UK . Bell X1 released three albums while with Universal / Island ; Neither Am I , Music in Mouth and Flock . Subsequent releases have come out on the band 's own <unk> Records and its distribution partners at Warner Music , <unk> & The Orchard . Those titles are : Tour De Flock , Blue Lights on the Runway , Bloodless Coup , Field Recordings & Chop Chop . 
 = = = Neither Am I = = = 
 Neither Am I was released on 13 October 2000 . It was produced by Crowded House bass player Nick Seymour with whom members of the band have collaborated extensively since . It features a number of songs ( Volcano and Face ) that were previously played by Juniper and co @-@ written with Damien <unk> and achieved gold status sales . Pinball Machine and Man on Mir were released as singles . In late 2010 Bell X1 revisited and reprised the record on their sold @-@ out Irish acoustic tour . 
 = = = Music in Mouth = = = 
 Bell X1 's second album Music in Mouth fared better , garnering greater fan acceptance and critical acclaim . Reviewer Harry Guerin described the album as being one from a band " pushing themselves in different directions and coming up with a joy and sadness that prove as contagious as each other [ ... ] a band thinking outside the a , b , c of guitar rock " . 
 Music in Mouth achieved double @-@ platinum sales in Ireland and four singles released from the album achieved top forty positions in the Irish Singles Chart . The Irish Independent 's John Meagher named it his fourth best Irish album of the 2000s . In early 2004 they led a tour of that year 's accession states of Eastern Europe as part of Ireland 's EU Presidency . In December 2004 , they performed their first major headlining show at the Olympia Theatre , Dublin . 
 The wider appeal of the band internationally was assisted by the use of the song " Eve , the Apple of My Eye " from Music in Mouth during an episode of US teen dramedy The O.C. ; it featured during a scene in which two of the show 's female characters shared a lesbian kiss . The show 's music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas chose to feature " Eve " and " In Every Sunflower " after listening to Music in Mouth , with " Eve " also being included on the series soundtrack . That opportunity led to Bell X1 's arrival in the United States . The Sunday Tribune 's Neil Dunphy and Una Mullally named it number 46 in their 2008 " ultimate playlist representing the top @-@ 50 Irish songs of all time " . In the same publication at the end of the decade Dunphy cited it as an example of how Irish bands had used television to their advantage . The band went on to record a live session for Nic Harcourt 's radio show on KCRW in Los Angeles . 
 = = = Flock = = = 
 Capitalising on the momentum generated by the success of Music in Mouth , Bell X1 took over a remote farmhouse in Co . Wexford to write Flock , this time working with producer Roger <unk> . It went straight to number one in Ireland on its release on 14 October 2005 and to date has sold five @-@ times platinum in that country . RTÉ reviewer Katie Moten described the album as " an accomplished collection from a clever and inventive band , whose talent deserves <unk> of praise " . Bell X1 returned to feature in a dedicated <unk> special presented by Myles Dungan on 18 October 2005 . Flock was subsequently released around Europe , prompting Noonan to describe 2005 as Bell X1 's " annus fabulous " . On 31 January 2006 , they performed a sold out show in the RDS Main Hall , and appeared on the Main Stage at Oxegen 2006 that July . They would go on to perform even bigger live shows at Dublin 's Point Theatre and Malahide Castle over the next 18 months 
 " Bigger Than Me " , the first single to be released from this album , reached number sixteen in the Irish Singles Chart . They performed follow @-@ up single " Flame " on Tubridy Tonight on 14 January 2006 . " Flame " was later included in a collection of works giving a " sense of the noughties " put together by Vincent Murphy and broadcast on Morning Ireland on 31 December 2009 . A third single , " Rocky Took a Lover " , would be performed on the Late Show with David Letterman on 17 March 2008 . Bell X1 performed songs from Flock when they were one of the acts to appear on Other Voices in 2007 . 
 In February 2007 , it was reported that Bell X1 had parted company with their UK record label Island Records . Noonan later spoke of the artistic freedom which had resulted from this move — " We have found owning our music and finding partners all over the world to put our music out really empowering " . 
 = = = Tour De Flock = = = 
 A live CD and DVD set called Tour De Flock was released on the band 's own record label , <unk> Records , on 15 June 2007 . The set was the band 's first post @-@ Island release . It was a recording of their sell @-@ out performance at the Point Theatre in Dublin on 1 December 2006 . 
 On 30 June , two weeks after the release of Tour De Flock , Bell X1 played an outdoor show at Malahide Castle in Dublin , becoming the first Irish band to headline that venue . In July 2007 , they played a sell @-@ out show at Live at the Marquee in Cork , with Noonan two years later describing that show as , " Without doubt [ ... ] one of the best gigs of our entire Flock tour . We had played venues like The Lobby , The Savoy and the Opera House , but being asked to play the Marquee was a crowning moment for us " . 
 On 15 March 2008 , the band 's tour bus burst into flames outside their hotel in Medford , Massachusetts . Noonan and Geraghty were on board the vehicle alongside their manager and a friend . Brian Crosby , Dominic Phillips , and Tim O 'Donovan were inside the hotel . Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3 : 30 am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze , which started in the bus ventilation / air @-@ conditioning unit and caused an estimated $ 50 @,@ 000 ( € 32 @,@ 000 ) worth of damage . Talking to local newspaper the Boston Herald , the band 's manager , Foye Johnson said : " The guys were basically around the bus , which was a good thing because we were able to get all the equipment and instruments out . " After a few hours of sleep , off they went in a replacement vehicle to New York City where the band played a sell @-@ out show in the Bowery Ballroom and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman , Other North American television appearances during the early part of 2008 included MTV Canada , The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Late Night with Conan O 'Brien . They would return to perform on the Late Show with David Letterman one year later . 
 They were the support act for Stars in the United States in September 2008 , their fourth time there that year . There were also several shows at events in Europe , and a homecoming appearance at Oxegen 2008 . 
 On 2 October 2008 , Brian Crosby announced his decision to leave Bell X1 following their 19 October Flock tour finale at the Panorama Festival in the Lebanon . They parted ways on good terms and the recruitment of at least one new member for live performances was planned . Their first show without Crosby was the opening night of an acoustic tour at the Pavilion in Cork two days after Panorama . By this time they were already performing material which was to feature on their fourth studio album , Blue Lights on the Runway . 
 = = = Blue Lights on the Runway = = = 
 Bell X1 released their fourth studio album Blue Lights on the Runway in Ireland on 20 February 2009 . It went to number one in the Irish Albums Chart . RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin described the album as " a flight that you can actually enjoy from start to finish " . The Sunday Tribune 's Neil Dunphy selected it as his CD of the week , calling it " a wonderful exploration of a sound often derided for being in thrall to its influences " and commenting : " I don 't know why but Bell X1 used to make me cringe . These days their music feels like an old friend ; something solid and inspiring amid all the negativity " . 
 Blue Lights on the Runway was preceded by its lead single , titled " The Great Defector " . which became the band 's most successful single yet , peaking at number three in the Irish Singles Chart and going top 10 in America on the AAA Radio charts . The band were invited back to Tubridy Tonight to perform it and presenter Ryan Tubridy said it was his favourite song that year . Irish Independent journalist Eamon Sweeney described it as " happens to the best thing on the airwaves at the moment " . Marc <unk> on keys and Rory Doyle on drums featured during live performances , the former replacing Crosby in the band . 
 Blue Lights on the Runway was released in the United States through the band 's American label on 3 March 2009 . It appeared in the top twenty of that country 's Billboard Top Heatseekers Chart . When asked to describe touring for the first time without Crosby , Noonan said : " It 's good — it 's all part of the journey " . The band received attention from prominent bloggers in the country and made appearances on public radio , said to be a " crucial showcase " for bands like them in the United States . The band recorded a <unk> Session with the newspaper Le Soir to support the release of their album in Belgium . In Spain they played the Festival Internacional de Benicàssim that year . Back home Blue Lights on the Runway was given an " honourable mention " by The Sunday Business Post 's Andrew Lynch in his end @-@ of @-@ year 2009 review of music . 
 " The Ribs of a Broken Umbrella " , a second single from Blue Lights on the Runway , was later released . Bell X1 was a support act for U2 during that band 's sold @-@ out Croke Park show on 27 July 2009 , part of the international U2 360 ° Tour . Other major Irish shows that summer included an appearance at Live at the Marquee in Cork and a headlining performance at Electric Picnic 2009 , with the band later returning to the United States for a tour which included a slot at the Austin City Limits Festival before coming home to perform two more sell @-@ out shows at the Olympia Theatre that November . They then reappeared on Other Voices , performing a live session in Dingle which was broadcast in early 2010 . Their only summer performance in Ireland that year was at Oxegen 2010 .

 The band released their fifth album Bloodless Coup on 1 April 2011 . The album was recorded by frequent Flood collaborator & PJ Harvey engineer Rob Kirwan at Grouse Lodge Residential Studios in County Westmeath , Ireland . 
 To celebrate the album release , Bell X1 performed a rooftop gig at Facebook 's European Headquarters with its founder Mark Zuckerberg . 
 The band also performed a special concert recorded for America 's National Public Radio at the Guinness Storehouse 
 A 4 Star review of the album by The Independent praised Bell X1 for being one of the few bands to lyrically tackle the " turbulent , uncertain times . " 
 The Sunday Times named Bloodless Coup its CD of The Week in a 5 star review saying the album is " a 10 track mish @-@ mash about growing old , living in a hopeless political landscape and nourishing lasting friendships . It turns out to be Bell X1 's most satisfying album to date . A beguiling achievement . " 
 The Boston Herald graded the album an " A " saying " the Songwriting and playing are superb . " 
 In support of the album the band headlined shows at Marlay Park , The Galway Arts Festival , Sea Sessions & The Cork Marquee in addition to touring Europe and North America extensively .

Brother Kevin Crowley of The Capuchin Day Centre was quoted in Hot Press " Our numbers get bigger and bigger , we have 200 people in the morning and nearly 500 in the evening for dinner . So the whole charity concert was a tremendous success , a huge boost . When Bell X1 came to present the cheque I was so impressed by their kindness and sensitivity .

 = Potbelly sculpture = 
 Potbelly sculptures , ( Spanish <unk> pl. or <unk> sing . ) , are in @-@ the @-@ round sculptures of obese human figures carved from boulders . They are a distinctive element of the sculptural tradition in the southern Maya area of Mesoamerica . The precise purpose of potbelly sculptures is unknown , although they appear to have been the focus of public veneration and ritual directed by the ruling elite . Although this sculptural tradition is found within the southern Maya area , it has been recognized that the sculptures themselves are non @-@ Maya . 
 = = Description = = 
 Potbelly monuments are generally crude in @-@ the @-@ round sculptures of extremely fat human figures ; they are usually seated cross @-@ legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure 's arms and legs . The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips . The monuments are generally of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from porphyritic basalt , a kind of rock with a combination of large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America . There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials , such as from ceramic or from other types of rock . 
 There are variations on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures , headless <unk> , some of which may be deliberately headless , and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style even though they have no potbelly body . Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked . There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all . Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals . There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm . 
 Potbelly sculptures vary enormously in size and weight , from the smallest examples that can weigh as little as a few grams and measure 4 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) to monuments that weigh 12 tons and measure 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . 
 = = Dating = = 
 The dating of potbelly sculptures has been problematic with few of the earlier known sculptures being found in their original context . Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre @-@ Olmec . Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating . Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 using a combination of radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence . 
 The dating of the monuments to the Late Preclassic indicate that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier Olmec colossal heads , although it does not answer the question of the ethnicity of the sculptors . Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region , such as at Sin Cabezas , Copán and Teopán . Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style appears to have been from south to north , while the Olmec heartland lies to the north , on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico , which would indicate an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 Potbelly sculptures have been interpreted in a variety of manners . Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors . Alternatively , they have been associated with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology . Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic hearth . A further interpretation , based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador , interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term , possibly in the very act of giving birth . 
 One theory is that the sculptures represent deceased individuals with bloated bodies , closed eyes , distended bellies and puffed out faces . The position of the limbs on some monuments , although following the natural contours of the boulder , give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles . It is possible that <unk> Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture . Although it has been suggested that the monuments themselves are burial markers , only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains . One of these is a ceramic potbelly from <unk> in Belize , the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu . However , since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers . 
 An alternative interpretation of potbelly monuments is that they were representations of rulership . This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures , the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them , the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites . The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership ; the figures are seated cross @-@ legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object . Twenty @-@ five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery , again suggestive of rulership . Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas , Antigua Guatemala , Kaminaljuyu , Santa Cruz del Quiché , Takalik Abaj , Tikal , <unk> , El Balsamo , Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala , Chalchuapa in El Salvador , and Copán in Honduras . This represents 42 % of sites with potbelly sculptures . If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant , which was found associated with a four @-@ legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it . 
 The diversity of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural tradition and the individuality of the monuments support the argument that the monuments represent individual rulers . The monuments may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of the region as a depiction of both rulership and their ancestors . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Potbelly sculptures are distributed along the Pacific slope of southern Mesoamerica from Chiapas in Mexico , through Guatemala to El Salvador , as well as in the Guatemalan highlands . A few examples have been found further afield in the Maya lowlands of Guatemala and Honduras . A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as <unk> in northern Belize and has been dated to <unk> – 600 BC , in the Middle Preclassic . 
 The core of the distribution area falls within a humid piedmont zone with the land consisting of volcanic soil and rubble carried down from the mountains , with naturally occurring basalt boulders of varying sizes that provided a practical raw material for sculpture . Potbelly sculptures are found in prominent ceremonial centres .

 Examples have been found at many sites on the Pacific coast of Guatemala including Takalik Abaj , Monte Alto , Bilbao and El Baúl . The earliest examples of <unk> monuments have been dated to the Middle Preclassic , with the majority dating to the Late Preclassic . 
 Well @-@ preserved examples of Late Preclassic potbelly sculptures have been found at Bilbao , on the coastal plain , and at Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan highlands . A small potbelly monument has been found at the major Maya city of Tikal in the lowlands of Petén in Guatemala . 
 There is some variation in the exact features , those at Kaminaljuyu have fat bodies with short , thick necks and large heads , sometimes wearing a wide collar . The faces are depicted with incised lines and are heavy and coarse . The legs curve around the body parallel to the ground and the arms are clasped against the torso with the elbows bent . Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site , with several of them found concentrated in the <unk> monument plaza . 
 Large potbelly monuments have been found at Giralda , a site 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from the Pacific coastline . 
 Potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas are stylistically related to Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples , being found in fill dating to the Late Classic period . The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident , suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re @-@ erected by later occupants of the site . 
 At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all date to the Late Preclassic . Stylistically , the monuments are very similar to those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto . Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures ( Monuments 2 , 3 , 19 , 40 , 69 , 94 and 117 ) , six of these represent complete figures . Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures ( Monuments 100 , 107 and 109 ) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style ( Monument 99 ) . 
 One potbelly sculpture was found in Chocolá , Guatemala .

 At Copán in Honduras , another important Maya site , archaeologists found a potbelly sculpture on top of the Northwest Platform , to the west of the Great Plaza . Another was found in a cache under Stela 4 . Further potbelly monuments have been found in caches under Late Classic stelae in the Great Plaza itself and throughout the Copán valley .

 A small example excavated from underneath the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3 @-@ 1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic . Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador , a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms . These monuments were large and especially obese . Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture . The El Salvador <unk> conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture . 
 In Chalchuapa , potbelly monuments were grouped in the El <unk> ceremonial centre . 
 Santa Leticia Monument 1 is a nearly spherical potbelly sculpture and the smallest of the three potbelly monuments at the site , measuring 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) high . Monument 2 is a massive 2 @-@ metre ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high potbelly that has been split in half down the middle . Monument 3 is a finely carved potbelly figure with stylistic affinities to some of the sculptures found at Monte Alto in Guatemala , it measures 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) high . All three sculptures measured 1 @.@ 5 to 2 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 to 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in height and diameter . The monuments were arranged in a north @-@ south line on a 70 @-@ metre ( 230 ft ) wide terrace projecting from a hill , Cerrito de <unk> . 
 The Teopán potbelly clearly represents a female figure and has been interpreted as the sculpture of a Late Preclassic earth goddess . Teopán itself is a small site located on an island in Lake Coatepeque in western El Salvador . The site has been identified as that of Late Preclassic Maya settlement . Although the Teopán sculpture has typical Monte Alto @-@ style traits such as closed puffy eyes , no neck , wrap @-@ around arms , a clearly marked naval and grooves forming portions of the nose and mouth , it also includes some unusual features such as clearly indicated breasts , wide hips , buttocks and a 10 @-@ centimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) concavity below the legs . The closed eyelids were later re @-@ carved with the addition of two irregular oval concavities in order to represent open eyes , probably in the Postclassic Period . The Teopán potbelly is likely to be the idol mentioned by Spanish Colonial official Diego García de Palacio in a letter written in 1576 , in which he mentions that the Pipil natives on the island worshipped " a large stone idol in the form of a woman " . 
 = Japanese battleship Kongō = 
 Kongō ( 金剛 , " Indestructible " , named for Mount Kongō ) was a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II . She was the first battlecruiser of the Kongō class , among the most heavily armed ships in any navy when built . Her designer was the British naval engineer George Thurston , and she was laid down in 1911 at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness in Britain by Vickers Shipbuilding Company . Kongō was the last Japanese capital ship constructed outside Japan . She was formally commissioned in 1913 , and patrolled off the Chinese coast during World War I. 
 Kongō underwent two major reconstructions . Beginning in 1929 , the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt her as a battleship , strengthening her armor and improving her speed and power capabilities . In 1935 , her superstructure was completely rebuilt , her speed was increased , and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes . Now fast enough to accompany Japan 's growing carrier fleet , Kongō was reclassified as a fast battleship . During the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , Kongō operated off the coast of mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941 . In 1942 , she sailed as part of the Southern Force in preparation for the Battle of Singapore . 
 Kongō fought in a large number of major naval actions of the Pacific War during World War II . She covered the Japanese Army 's amphibious landings in British Malaya ( part of present @-@ day Malaysia ) and the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) in 1942 , before engaging American forces at the Battle of Midway and during the Guadalcanal Campaign . Throughout 1943 , Kongō primarily remained at Truk Lagoon in the Caroline Islands , Kure Naval Base ( near Hiroshima ) , Sasebo Naval Base ( near Nagasaki ) , and Lingga Roads , and deployed several times in response to American aircraft carrier air raids on Japanese island bases scattered across the Pacific . Kongō participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944 ( 22 – 23 October ) , engaging and sinking American vessels in the latter . Kongō was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine USS Sealion while transiting the Formosa Strait on 21 November 1944 . She was the only Japanese battleship sunk by submarine in the Second World War , and the last battleship sunk by submarine in history . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Kongō was the first of the Imperial Japanese Navy 's Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers , which were almost as large , costly and well @-@ armed as battleships , but which traded off armored protection for higher speeds . These were designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston and were ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of HMS Invincible in 1908 . These four battlecruisers of the Kongō class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the battlecruisers of the other major naval powers at the time , and they have been called the battlecruiser versions of the British ( formerly Turkish ) battleship HMS Erin . Their heavy armament of 14 @-@ inch naval guns and their armor protection ( which took up about 23 @.@ 3 % of their approximately 30 @,@ 000 @-@ ton displacements in 1913 ) were greatly superior to those of any other Japanese capital ship afloat at the time . 
 The keel of Kongō was laid down at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering on 17 January 1911 . Under Japan 's contract with Vickers , the first vessel of the class was constructed in the United Kingdom , with the remainder built in Japan . Kongō was launched on 18 May 1912 , and then transferred to the dockyards of Portsmouth , England , where her fitting @-@ out began in mid @-@ 1912 . All parts used in her construction were manufactured in the U.K. Kongo was completed on 16 April 1913 . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Kongō 's main battery consisted of eight 14 @-@ inch ( 36 cm ) heavy @-@ caliber main naval guns in four twin turrets ( two forward and two aft ) . The turrets were noted by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence to be " similar to the British 15 @-@ inch turrets " , with improvements made in flash @-@ tightness . Each of her main guns could fire high explosive or armor @-@ piercing shells 38 @,@ 770 yards ( 19 @.@ 14 nmi ; 35 @.@ 45 km ) at a firing rate of about two shells per minute . In keeping with the Japanese doctrine of deploying more powerful vessels before their opponents , Kongō and her sister ships were the first vessels in the world equipped with 14 @-@ inch ( 36 cm ) guns . Her main guns carried ammunition for 90 shots , and they had an approximate barrel lifetime of 250 to 280 shots . In 1941 , separate dyes were introduced for the armor @-@ piercing shells of the four Kongō @-@ class battleships to assist with targeting , with Kongō 's armor @-@ piercing shells using red dye . 
 The secondary battery of Kongō originally consisted of sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 15 cm ) 50 caliber guns in single casemates located amidships ( " 50 calibre " means that the lengths of the guns were 50 times their bore , or 300 inches ) , eight 3 @-@ inch ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) guns , and eight submerged 21 @-@ inch ( 53 cm ) torpedo tubes . Her six @-@ inch naval guns could fire five to six rounds per minute , with a barrel lifetime of about 500 rounds . The 6 @-@ inch / 50 calibre gun was capable of firing both antiaircraft and antiship shells , though the positioning of these guns on Kongō made antiaircraft firing mostly impractical . During her second reconstruction , the older three @-@ inch guns were removed and then replaced with eight 5 @-@ inch ( 13 cm ) 5 @-@ inch / 40 calibre dual @-@ purpose guns . These guns could fire from eight to 14 rounds per minute , with a barrel lifetime of about 800 to 1 @,@ 500 rounds . Of Kongō 's guns , the 5 @-@ inch guns had the widest variety of shell types : antiaircraft , antiship , and illumination shells . Kongō was also armed with a large number of 1 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) antiaircraft machine guns . By October 1944 , Kongō 's secondary armament was reconfigured to eight 6 @-@ inch ( 15 cm ) guns , eight 5 @-@ inch ( 13 cm ) guns , and 122 Type 96 antiaircraft rapid @-@ fire cannons .

 On 16 August 1913 , Kongō was completed and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy ( I.J.N. ) . Twelve days later , she departed from Portsmouth headed for Japan . She was docked at Singapore from 20 October to 27 October , before arriving at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 5 November , where she was placed in First Reserve . In January 1914 , she docked at Kure Naval Base for armament checks . On 3 August 1914 , the German Empire declared war on France and then invaded via Belgium , sparking the beginning of World War I in the West . Twelve days later , Japan issued a warning to Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire , ordering him to withdraw the German troops from their base at Tsingtao , China . When the German Empire did not respond , Japan declared war on Germany on 23 August , occupying the former German possessions in the Caroline Islands , Palau Islands , Marshall Islands , and Marianas Islands . Kongō was quickly deployed towards the Central Pacific to patrol the sea lines of communication of the German Empire . Kongō returned to the port of Yokosuka , Japan , on 12 September , and one month later , she was assigned to the First Battleship Division . In October , Kongō and her new sister ship Hiei sortied off the Chinese coast in support of Japanese army units during the Siege of Tsingtao . Then Kongō returned to Sasebo Naval Base for upgrades to her searchlights . On 3 October 1915 , Kongō and Hiei participated in the sinking of the old Imperator Nikolai I as a practice target . She was a Russian pre @-@ dreadnought that had been captured in 1905 during the Russo @-@ Japanese War that had next served as an I.J.N. warship . With the defeat of the German East Asia Squadron by the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 , there was little or no need for I.J.N. operations in the Pacific Ocean . Kongō spent the rest of World War I either based at Sasebo , or on patrol off the coast of China . In December 1918 , following the end of the hostilities of World War I , Kongō was placed in " Second Reserve " . In April 1919 , she was fitted with a new seawater flooding system for her ammunition magazines . 
 With the conclusion of World War I , and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty on 6 February 1922 , the size of the I.J.N. was significantly limited , with a ratio of 5 : 5 : 3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom , the United States , and the Japanese Empire , since the latter was only responsible for one ocean , rather than the two of the other country , and fewer warships for France and Italy . This Treaty also banned the signatories from building any new capital ships until 1931 , with no capital ship permitted to exceed 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) in displacement . Provided that new additions did not exceed 3 @,@ 000 tons of displacement , the existing capital ships were allowed to be upgraded with improved anti @-@ torpedo bulges and armored main decks . By the time that the Washington Naval Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan , only three classes of World War I type capital ships remained active : the Ise @-@ class battleships , the Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers , and the Fusō @-@ class battleships . 
 In April 1923 , Kongō gave transportation to Emperor Hirohito during his official visit to the Japanese possession of Taiwan . In November 1924 , Kongo docked at Yokosuka , where modifications were made to her main armament , increasing the elevation of her main guns and improving her fire @-@ control systems . In 1927 , Kongō underwent major modifications to her superstructure , rebuilding it into the pagoda mast style to accommodate the growing number of fire @-@ control systems for her main guns . In May 1928 , her steering equipment was upgraded , before she was placed in reserve in preparation for major modifications and reconstruction in 1929 – 31 . 
 = = = 1929 – 1935 : Reconstruction into battleship = = = 
 Prohibited by the Washington Treaty from constructing new capital ships until 1931 , Japan resorted to upgrading their World War I era battleships and battlecruisers . Beginning in September 1929 , Kongō underwent extensive modernization and modification in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal . Over the next two years , Kongō 's horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened , and the machinery spaces within the hull were given increased torpedo protection . Anti @-@ torpedo bulges were added along the waterline , as permitted by the Washington Treaty . She was refitted to accommodate three Type 90 Model 0 floatplanes , though no aircraft catapults were fitted . To increase her speed and power , all 36 of her Yarrow boilers were removed , and then replaced with 16 newer boilers , and Brown @-@ Curtis direct @-@ drive turbines were installed . Kongō 's forward funnel was removed , and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened . The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6 @,@ 502 to 10 @,@ 313 long tons , directly violating the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . In March 1931 , Kongō — now capable of a speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ) — was reclassified as a battleship . 
 On 22 April 1930 , Japan signed the London Naval Treaty , placing further restrictions on the signatories ' naval forces . Several of her older battleships were scrapped , and no new capital ships were built as replacements . After minor fitting @-@ out work , Kongō 's reconstruction begun in September 1929 and was declared complete on 31 March 1931 . On 1 December 1931 , two months after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria , Kongō was assigned to the First Battleship Division and also designated the flagship of the Combined Fleet . Additional rangefinders and searchlights were fitted to her superstructure in January 1932 , and Captain Nobutake Kondō assumed command of the vessel in December . In 1933 , aircraft catapults were fitted between the two rear turrets . 
 On 25 February 1933 , following a report by the Lytton Commission , the League of Nations agreed that Japan 's invasion of China had violated Chinese sovereignty . Refusing to accept the judgement of this organization , Japan withdrew from the League of Nations on the same day . Japan also immediately withdrew from the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty , thus removing all restrictions on the numbers and sizes of her capital warships . In November 1934 , Kongō was placed in Second Reserve in preparation for further modifications . On 10 January 1935 , Kongō was toured by the Nazi German naval attaché to Japan , Captain Paul Wenneker , as part of a gunnery demonstration .

 On 1 June 1935 , Kongō was dry @-@ docked at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in preparation for upgrades that would enable her to escort Japan 's growing fleet of aircraft carriers . Her stern was lengthened by 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) to improve her fineness ratio and her 16 older boilers were removed and then replaced with 11 oil @-@ fired Kampon Boilers and newer geared turbines . In addition , her bridge was completely reconstructed according to Japan 's pagoda mast style of forward superstructure , and catapults were added to support three Nakajima E8N or Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance and spotter floatplanes . 
 Kongō 's armor was also extensively upgraded . Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of eight inches ( up from varying thicknesses of six to eight inches ) , and also diagonal bulkheads of depths ranging from 5 to 8 inches ( 127 to 203 mm ) were added to reinforce the main armored belt . The turret armor was strengthened to 10 inches ( 254 mm ) , while 4 inches ( 102 mm ) were added to portions of the deck armor . Kongō 's ammunition magazine protection was also strengthened to 4 @.@ 0 inches ( 10 cm ) . This reconstruction was finished on 8 January 1937 . Capable of greater than 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) , despite the significant increase in her hull displacement , Kongō was now reclassified as a fast battleship . 
 In February 1937 , Kongō was assigned to the Sasebo Naval District , and in December she was placed under the command of Takeo Kurita in the Third Battleship Division . In April 1938 , two float planes from Kongō bombed the Chinese town of Foochow during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . Throughout 1938 and 1939 , Kongō steamed off the Chinese coast in support of Japanese Army operations during the war . In November 1939 , Captain Raizo Tanaka assumed command of Kongō . From November 1940 to April 1941 , additional armor was added to Kongō 's armament barbettes and ammunition tubes , while ventilation and firefighting equipment was also improved . In August 1941 , she was assigned to the Third Battleship Division under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa alongside her fully modified sister warships Hiei , Kirishima and the Haruna . 
 = = = 1942 : Early war service = = = 
 Kongō and Haruna departed from the Hashirajima fleet anchorage on 29 November 1941 to begin the War in the Pacific as part of the Southern ( Malay ) Force 's Main Body , under the overall command of Vice @-@ Admiral Nobutake Kondō . On 4 December 1941 , the Main Body arrived off the coast of southern Thailand and northern Malaya in preparation for the invasion of Thailand and the Malayan Peninsula four days later . When Britain 's " Force Z " — consisting of the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse — was quickly defeated by Japan 's land @-@ based aircraft from southern Vietnam , Kongō 's battlegroup withdrew from Malayan waters . This battlegroup subsequently sortied from Indochina for three days in mid @-@ December to protect a reinforcement convoy traveling to Malaya , and again on 18 December to cover the Japanese Army 's landing at Lingayen Gulf , Luzon , in the Philippines . The Main Body departed Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 23 December bound for Taiwan , arriving two days later . In January 1942 , Kongō and the heavy cruisers Takao and Atago provided distant cover for air attacks on Ambon Island . 
 On 21 February , Kongō was joined by Haruna , four fast aircraft carriers , five heavy cruisers and numerous support ships in preparation for " Operation J " , Japan 's invasion of the Dutch East Indies . On 25 February , the Third Battleship Division provided cover for air attacks on the Island of Java . Kongō bombarded Christmas Island off the western coast of Australia on 7 March 1942 , and then she returned to Staring @-@ baai for 15 days of standby alert . In April 1942 , Kongō joined five fleet carriers in attacks on Colombo and Trincomalee on Ceylon . Following the destruction of the British heavy cruisers HMS Dorsetshire and HMS Cornwall on 5 April 1942 , this naval task force moved southwest to locate the remainder of the British Eastern Fleet , then under the command of Admiral James Somerville . On 9 April , one of Haruna 's reconnaissance seaplanes spotted the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes south of Trincomalee . On the same day , Japanese air attacks sank the carrier , and Kongō was attacked but missed by nine British medium bombers . Having crippled the offensive capability of Britain 's Eastern Fleet , the Third Battleship Division returned to Japan . Kongō reached Sasebo on 22 April . From 23 April to 2 May , Kongō was drydocked for reconfiguration of her antiaircraft armament . 
 On 27 May 1942 , Kongō sortied with Hiei and the heavy cruisers Atago , Chōkai , Myōkō , and Haguro as part of Admiral Nobutake Kondō 's invasion force during the Battle of Midway . Following the disastrous loss of four of the Combined Fleet 's fast carriers on 4 June 1942 , Kondō 's force withdrew to Japan . On 14 July she was assigned as the flagship of the restructured Third Battleship Division . In August , Kongō was drydocked at Kure to receive surface @-@ detection radar and additional range finders . In September , Kongō embarked with Hiei , Haruna , Kirishima , three carriers , and numerous smaller warships in response to the U.S. Marine Corps 's amphibious landing on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands . On 20 September , this task force was ordered to return to the Truk Naval Base in the Central Pacific north of the equator . 
 In the aftermath of the Battle of Cape Esperance , the Japanese Army opted to reinforce its troops on Guadalcanal . To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sent Haruna and Kongō , escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers , to bombard the American air base as Henderson Field . Because of their high speeds , these two battleships could bombard the airfield and then withdraw before being subjected to air attack from either land @-@ based warplanes or American aircraft carriers . On the night of 13 – 14 October , these two battleships shelled the area of Henderson Field from a distance of about 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) , firing 973 14 @-@ inch high @-@ explosive shells . In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war , the bombardment heavily damaged both runways , destroyed almost all of the U.S. Marines ' aviation fuel , destroyed or damaged 48 of the Marines ' 90 warplanes , and killed 41 Marines . A large Japanese troop and supply convoy reached Guadalcanal on the next day . 
 During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942 , Kongō was attacked by four Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers , but she received no hits . In mid @-@ November , this battleship and other warships provided distant cover for the unsuccessful mission by the I.J.N. to bombard Henderson Field again and to deliver more Army reinforcements to Guadalcanal . On 15 November 1942 , following the Japanese defeat and the sinking of Hiei and Kirishima during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , the Third Battleship Division returned to Truk , where it remained for the rest of 1942 . 
 = = = 1943 : Movement between bases = = = 
 Throughout 1943 , Kongō engaged no enemy targets . In late January 1943 , she participated in " Operation Ke " as part of a diversionary and distant covering force to support I.J.N. destroyers that were evacuating Army troops from Guadalcanal . From 15 February through 20 February 1943 , the Third Battleship Division was transferred from Truk to the Kure Naval Base . On 27 February , Kongō was drydocked to receive upgrades to her antiaircraft armament , with the additions of two triple 25 mm gun mounts and the removal of two of her 6 @-@ inch turrets , while additional concrete protection was added near her steering gear . On 17 May 1943 , in response to the U.S. Army 's invasion of Attu Island , Kongō sortied alongside Musashi , the Third Battleship Division , two fleet carriers , two cruisers , and nine destroyers . Three days later , the American submarine USS Sawfish spotted this naval task force , but she was unable to attack it . On 22 May 1943 , the task force arrived in Yokosuka , where it was joined by an additional three fleet carriers and two light cruisers . This force was disbanded when Attu fell to the U.S. Army before the necessary preparations for a counterattack had been finished . 
 On 17 October 1943 , Kongō again left Truk as part of a larger task force consisting of five battleships , three fleet carriers , eight heavy cruisers , three light cruisers , and numerous destroyers . These sortied in response to U.S. Navy air raids on Wake Island . No contact between the two forces was made , and the Japanese task force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943 . She soon left Truk for home waters , and on 16 December 1943 , Kongō arrived at Sasebo for refits and training in the Inland Sea . 
 = = = 1944 : Combat and loss = = = 
 In January 1944 , Kongō was dry @-@ docked for a reconfiguration of her anti @-@ aircraft suite . Four 6 @-@ inch guns and a pair of twin 25 mm mounts were removed and replaced with four 5 @-@ inch guns and four triple 25 mm mounts . The Third Battleship Division departed Kure on 8 March 1944 . Arriving at Lingga on 14 March 1944 , the division remained for training until 11 May 1944 . On 11 May 1944 , Kongō and Admiral Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet departed Lingga for Tawitawi , where they were joined by Vice @-@ Admiral Takeo Kurita 's " Force C " . On 13 June , Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet departed Tawitawi for the Mariana Islands . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea , Kongō escorted Japanese fast carriers , and remained undamaged in counterattacks from US carrier aircraft on 20 June . When she returned to Japan , 13 triple and 40 single 25 @-@ mm mounts were added to her anti @-@ aircraft armament , for a total of over 100 mounts . In August , two more 6 @-@ inch guns were removed and another eighteen single mounts installed . 
 In October 1944 , Kongō departed Lingga in preparation for " Operation Sho @-@ 1 " , Japan 's counterattack during the Battle of Leyte Gulf , the largest naval engagement in history . On 24 October , Kongō was undamaged by several near misses from American carrier aircraft in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea . On 25 October , during the Battle off Samar , Kongō — as part of Admiral Kurita 's Centre Force — engaged the US 7th Fleet 's " Taffy 3 " , a battlegroup of escort carriers and destroyers . She succeeded in scoring numerous hits on the escort carrier Gambier Bay as well as the destroyers Hoel and Heermann . At 09 : 12 , she sank the destroyer escort Samuel B. Roberts . After a fierce defensive action by the American ships , which sank three Japanese heavy cruisers , Admiral Kurita elected to withdraw , ending the battle . While retreating , Kongō suffered damage from five near misses from attacking aircraft . The fleet arrived at Brunei on 28 October . 
 On 16 November , following a US air raid on Brunei , Kongō along with Yamato , Nagato and the rest of the First Fleet , departed Brunei for Kure in preparation for a major reorganization of the fleet and battle repairs . On 20 November , they entered the Formosa Strait . Shortly after midnight on 21 November , the submarine USS Sealion made radar contact with the fleet at 44 @,@ 000 yards ( 40 @,@ 000 m ) . Maneuvering into position at 02 : 45 , Sealion fired six bow torpedoes at Kongō followed by three stern torpedoes at Nagato fifteen minutes later . One minute after the first salvo was launched , two of the torpedoes were seen to hit Kongō on the port side , while a third sank the destroyer Urakaze with all hands . The torpedoes flooded two of Kongō 's boiler rooms , but she was still able to make 16 kn ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . By 05 : 00 , she had slowed to 11 kn ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) and was given permission to break off from the fleet and head to the port of Keelung in Formosa along with the destroyers Hamakaze and Isokaze as escort . 
 Within fifteen minutes of detaching from the main force , Kongō was listing 45 degrees and flooding uncontrollably . At 5 : 18 the ship lost all power and the order was given to abandon ship . At 5 : 24 , while the evacuation was underway , the forward 14 @-@ inch magazine exploded and the broken ship sank quickly with the loss of over 1 @,@ 200 of her crew including the commander of the Third Battleship Division and her captain . The escort destroyers Hamakaze and Isokaze rescued 237 survivors . 
 Kongō is believed to have sunk in 350 feet ( 110 m ) of water approximately 55 nautical miles ( 102 km ; 63 mi ) northwest of Keelung . She was one of only three British @-@ built battleships sunk by submarine attack during World War II . The other two were the British Revenge @-@ class battleship HMS Royal Oak and the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleship HMS Barham . 
 = Tropical Storm Dean ( 1995 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Dean was a short @-@ lived storm that formed in late July 1995 and lasted into early August . It was the fourth named storm of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season . It spent most of its life as a tropical depression , and briefly gained tropical storm status before its landfall on the Texas coast on July 30 . After landfall , it dissipated over central Texas on August 2 . The impacts from Dean were minimal , mainly due to heavy rain in Oklahoma and Texas that caused localized coastal and inland flooding . Two F0 Tornadoes touched down in Texas as a result of Dean 's landfall . Also , Twenty families had to be evacuated in Chambers County , due to flooding in the area . One fatality was recorded as a result of flooding in Oklahoma . Several highways were flooded out in Oklahoma , which impeded travel in the state . In addition approximately $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 1995 U.S. dollars ) worth of damage was recorded in the aftermath of Dean . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The precursor system that would form Dean was a stationary front situated in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in the last week of July . On July 27 , it developed a weak upper @-@ level circulation indicated by reports from buoys in the Gulf , its structure was disorganized but was in the process of organizing . The system continued to organize early on July 28 , and that afternoon it developed a surface circulation . The tropical depression that spawned Dean was thought to have formed at around 1800 UTC , July 28 . It was later declared Tropical Depression Four that same day with the center located about 345 miles ( 555 km ) southeast of New Orleans . 
 At first , the depression slowly tracked westward because it was blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north . The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance , and the depression remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July . The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures . Late on July 29 , the system began to execute a turn to the northwest with an increase in forward speed . It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana . 
 On July 30 , the system 's circulation began to organize and the first reports of tropical storm @-@ force squalls were reported as it moved closer to the Texas coast . Based on this the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) issued tropical storm warnings for much of the Texas and Louisiana coast , from Intracoastal City , Louisiana to Corpus Christi , Texas . Later that afternoon it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean while located just 70 mi ( 110 km ) off the coast . The Hurricane Hunters confirmed that Dean strengthened in the final hours before its landfall on the Texas coast to a 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) storm , and made landfall near Freeport , Texas at 8 : 30 pm CDT ( 0130 UTC ) July 31 . Shortly after its landfall , Dean weakened back to tropical depression strength as it tracked further northwest into Texas . The depression stalled in central Texas on August 1 and remained there for 36 hours until the next day , dropping heavy rain over parts of the state . Late on August 2 , it merged with a non @-@ tropical front and dissipated . 
 The remnants of Dean eventually moved up into Oklahoma , where it caused heavy rainfall , forcing roads to close and rescues to be made . Dean also dropped heavy rain across the Midwest states as well . Some areas in Kansas received more than seven inches of rain . Illinois , Missouri , and Indiana each had areas that received more than 5 inches ( 127 mm ) of rain from Dean . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Because of Dean 's proximity to land upon formation , there was little warning in advance of the storm . Tropical storm warnings were issued at 0300 UTC on July 30 from Intracoastal City , Louisiana to Corpus Christi , Texas . The warnings were up for 23 hours before landfall , and were allowed to expire at 0300 UTC July 31 .

 Most of the damage from Dean was concentrated in the states of Texas and Oklahoma . The damage , if any , was mainly due to the heavy rain across both states . The total cost of the damage totaled to $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 1995 USD ; $ 707 @,@ 000 2008 USD ) . 
 = = = Texas = = = 
 In Texas , most of the damage was due to inland flooding . Heavy rainfall of 6 to 18 inches ( 150 to 450 mm ) was reported across a large swath of Texas . The heaviest measured amount was 17 @.@ 4 inches ( 426 mm ) near Monroe City , Texas . Rainfall amounts of two to six inches were common throughout the eastern part of the state . In total , 38 houses were flooded in southeast Texas . The freshwater flooding resulted in the evacuation of 20 families in Chambers County . 250 people had to evacuate from their homes near Abilene , Texas due to floodwater . The storm surge impacts were fairly minor , ranging from 3 to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) above mean sea level . A portion of State Highway 87 was flooded from the storm surge , although no significant property damage was reported as a result of it . Minor beach erosion and street flooding was also reported on Galveston Island . The highest wind gust on land was 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) at Scholes Field . There were two tornadoes confirmed as a result of Dean . One touched down on High Island in Galveston County , and the other touched down near Anahuac . Both tornadoes were rated as F0 on the Fujita scale , with minor damage .

 Oklahoma also saw heavy rain as well from the remnants of Dean . Over 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of rain fell in the town of Stillwater , and the highest amount , 12 @.@ 07 inches ( 307 mm ) , was recorded at Great Salt Plains Dam , Oklahoma . Over 40 homes were flooded in the area by the heavy rain , and about 24 cars were found stranded in high water . Thunderstorms , associated with Dean 's remnants , dumped heavy rain across the state , resulting in flash flooding in many areas . The flooding , in many areas , made travel near impossible . U.S Highway 62 in Jackson County and Highway 5 in Harmon County were both closed due to flash flooding covering their roadways . State Highway 51 was under 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) of water at times . Several other roads remained flooded and closed for several days after the arrival of Dean 's remnants . One death , a small child , was reported in Hardeman County after the child had been swept away by flood waters .

 Vogel State Park is a 233 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 94 km2 ) or 94 hectares state park located at the base of Blood Mountain in the Chattahoochee National Forest . It became one of the first two parks in Georgia when it founded a state park system in 1931 . Much of the park was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s . 
 The park features streams , a waterfall , and Lake Trahlyta . At 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) elevation it is one of Georgia 's highest altitude state parks . The mountainous habitats surrounding the lake support a wide assortment of plants and animals . 
 Within the park are a series of hiking trails . These include the Bear Hair Gap Trail and the more strenuous Coosa Backcountry Trail , which leads up toward Blood Mountain and the Appalachian Trail near Neal 's Gap . Vogel Park features camping sites , cabins , swimming , boating and other recreational activities .

 Vogel State Park is located 11 miles ( 18 km ) south of <unk> on US Highway 19 in the north Georgia mountains . At nearly 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) altitude , Vogel State Park is usually cool during the summer months , and is one of Georgia 's most popular state parks . Vogel features hiking trails , cabins and a 20 @-@ acre ( 81 @,@ 000 m2 ) pond known as Lake Trahlyta , which was created when the Civilian Conservation Corps dammed Wolf Creek . The lake is named for Trahlyta , a Cherokee maiden who is buried a few miles from the park at <unk> Gap . The Corps workers , located at the CCC Camp at Goose Creek just north of the park , also built the first cabins , picnic areas and camping grounds at Vogel . 
 Vogel is Georgia 's second oldest state park . The land comprising the park was donated to the state in 1927 by August H. Vogel and Fred Vogel , Jr. of Milwaukee , Wisconsin . The two were heirs to the Pfister & Vogel Leather Company , a Wisconsin tannery founded by Frederick Vogel . The Vogel family harvested bark from oak and hemlock trees located on thousands of acres they owned in North Georgia . The bark was shipped to Wisconsin and used by the company for tanning leather . During World War I , a synthetic method to tan leather was developed so there was no further need for the north Georgia resources . The Vogels gave their land to Georgia to create the state park . 
 Vogel State Park Lake Dam , also known as Lake Trahlyta Dam , is a 52 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) high earthen embankment . The 600 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) long dam has a maximum discharge of 2 @,@ 447 cubic feet ( 69 @.@ 3 m3 ) per second . Its capacity is 522 acre feet ( 644 @,@ 000 m3 ) , although its normal storage is 210 acre feet ( 260 @,@ 000 m3 ) . It drains an area of 1 @,@ 638 acres ( 663 ha ) .

The park also features a 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) Trahlyta Lake Loop Trail and the Byron Herbert Reese Nature Trail ( .8 miles ) . 
 Also in the park is the Coosa Backcountry Trail , a strenuous 12 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) loop which climbs Coosa Bald and Slaughter Mountain . The trail is marked with green blazes and is generally easy to follow . It fords streams on its lower segments before ascending Duncan 's Ridge near the summit of Coosa Bald at over 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) elevation , where it joins the Duncan Ridge Trail . The joined trail then makes a descent , then climbs slightly to the summit of Wildcat Knob , then descends to <unk> Gap where it crosses State Route 180 . Across <unk> Gap , the trail makes a steep ascent up Slaughter Mountain , then descends to Slaughter Gap where the Coosa Backcountry and Duncan Ridge Trail split . From this point , the Duncan Ridge Trail leads directly to Blood Mountain where it meets the Appalachian Trail . The Coosa Backcountry Trail makes a steep 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) descent down the mountain and joins with the Bear Hair Gap Trail , leading back to the point of origin . The Appalachian Trail can also be accessed from nearby Neel 's Gap , just a little higher up Blood Mountain on Highway 19 / 129 ; hikers can reach this area from the Byron Herbert Reece Trail .

 Like the rest of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains , Vogel State Park and the surrounding area consists of many valleys , ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions , starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1 @.@ 5 billion years ago . The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal . 
 The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains contains low @-@ to @-@ high @-@ grade metamorphic rocks . Many of the rocks of the Blue Ridge appear to be the metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks . Others are metamorphosed igneous rocks , including Corbin <unk> , Fort Mountain gneiss , varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks , and the metavolcanic rocks of the Gold Belt . 
 Much of the area resembles Pennsylvania in climate , vegetation and wildlife . The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern white pine . Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography , with second @-@ growth oak and hickory more common in lower @-@ lying areas . The surrounding forests contain rich , high @-@ altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns , such as Persistent Trillium , which grows near Rhododendron . Nearby <unk> by Blood Mountain include Dutchman 's breeches , squirrel corn , waterleaf and other herbaceous plants . 
 The area is populated with white @-@ tailed deer , grouse and raccoon . The deer population , which was extirpated by 1895 , has rebounded since re @-@ introduction by park ranger Arthur Woody during the 1930s . Over 100 species of birds inhabit or migrate through the area , including native songbirds such as the Canada warbler , Blackburnian , black @-@ throated blue , black @-@ throated green and chestnut @-@ sided warblers .

 = Flotilla ( video game ) = 
 Flotilla is a 2010 turn @-@ based strategy space combat video game developed by Brendon Chung 's studio , Blendo Games . The game was released in March 2010 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360 . Flotilla was designed with Microsoft 's XNA tools , and its development was influenced by animals as well as board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror . The game takes the player in an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy . 
 Chung began developing Flotilla immediately after the closure of Pandemic Studios , where he had worked as a designer . The new game used assets imported from Chung 's early space combat prototype , Space Piñata . Flotilla incorporates several pieces of classical music in its score , such as Chopin 's " Raindrop " prelude . It received mixed reviews from video game media outlets , scoring 72 out of 100 on review aggregate website Metacritic , and was included in Mike Rose 's book 250 Indie Games You Must Play . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Flotilla is a three @-@ dimensional simultaneous turn @-@ based strategy space combat video game set in a randomly generated galaxy . The player and computer @-@ controlled opponents issue orders to their ships , which are carried in a simultaneous and real @-@ time fashion over a period of 30 seconds . The game then freezes , and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships , which are again performed for 30 seconds . This process repeats until one party is defeated . Orders are separated into three groups : attack move , flank move and focus fire . An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously ; a flank move increases the ship 's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving ; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship 's speed . 
 At the beginning of the game , the player is usually given two ships to control , but more become available as the game continues . Ships may be rotated arbitrarily in any direction . The single @-@ player mode is an " adventure " that can be played an indefinite number of times . These adventures have a duration of around 30 minutes . The character dies at the end of each adventure and the player is given the option to play again . A hardcore mode , which removes the solo mode 's standard 30 @-@ minute time limit , was later added to the game . Each time the player starts a new adventure , a new galaxy is randomly generated and filled with planets and enemy ships . The player may take a short tutorial before beginning the adventure . 
 Each planet offers a possible quest or challenge to the player . Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies . However , ships can only be harmed from behind or below ; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships ' shields . Upon succeeding , a new chapter is added to the player 's character 's story , and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades . These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements , such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor . The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary , so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures . Flotilla has cooperative and split @-@ screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller . 
 = = Development = = 
 Flotilla was developed by Brendon Chung 's video game studio , Blendo Games . Chung , who worked as a level designer for Pandemic Studios , previously contributed to the development of Full Spectrum Warrior ( 2004 ) and Lord of the Rings : Conquest ( 2009 ) . Chung started coding Flotilla in 2009 after Electronic Arts closed Pandemic Studios . He was excited at the time of the studio 's closure , and stated that " there was adrenaline pumping through my veins " . The game was developed using Microsoft XNA , a set of game development tools created by Microsoft . 
 The concept of Flotilla came from a combination of " sci @-@ fi like Star Wars and submarine movies " . Chung explained that he " figured there was enough games about little fighter jets " , and that what he had in mind was " a jumbo battleship floating in space " . Animals , instead of aliens , are featured as characters in the game . Chung explained that he did so because " any fantastical creature design I came up with would pale in comparison to already @-@ existing designs made by other people . " Therefore , instead of trying to solve the problem of creating compelling alien characters , he switched to animals : " [ they ] have certain built @-@ in characteristics , they were fairly unique in how they weren 't typically associated with space adventures . " In an interview with <unk> , Chung revealed that board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror had an influential role in the game 's development process . 
 Before Flotilla , Chung worked on a prototype , a two @-@ dimensional turn @-@ based space action game called Space Piñata , whose gameplay and structure were similar to those of the final version of Flotilla . Chung intentionally limited the solo mode 's play time as an " experiment in making a short @-@ story generator " , such that an adventure could begin and end within a half hour . Following negative response , a patch was deployed to change this limitation . The patch included a new " hardcore " mode . Flotilla 's score incorporates several pieces of classical music , such as Chopin 's " Raindrop " prelude . According to Edge magazine , the " Raindrop " prelude gives the game 's battles " an emotional undercurrent " . Chung said that the soundtrack was designed to give the game " a tragic feel " and that he wanted the game to be portrayed as " the anti @-@ testosterone @-@ fueled " action game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Flotilla received a mixed response from video game journalists upon release . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the game received an average score of 72 based on 7 reviews . British magazine Edge included Flotilla in its 2010 list of the Best 20 Indie Games available in the Xbox Live Marketplace , and acknowledged that the game was " as exacting as it is quirky , a stiff challenge beneath a sugar coating . " Mike Rose included Flotilla in his book 250 Indie Games You Must Play . 
 The American version of PC Gamer commented that Flotilla " is a charmingly crafted bite @-@ size portion of tactical fun " . Meanwhile , the British version of the magazine elaborated that although the game had its share of " charm and character , " it was nonetheless a random experience . PC Zone UK characterized Flotilla as stylish and funny , but concluded that it was a " sadly disposable " experience . Edge gave a mixed response to the game , but praised the battles , which they considered " engaging despite their simplicity . " An editor from website Charge Shot praised the game 's artificial intelligence and overall design , but criticized the multiplayer mode . 
 Joe Martin from Bit @-@ Tech named Flotilla a " hilarious and brazenly original " game . However , he criticized the interface and navigation gameplay , which he condemned as " trying to pilot a radio @-@ controlled helicopter with someone else 's feet . " He also mentioned the lack of a speed @-@ up feature in battles ; he considered such a feature necessary for the game . GameZone 's Tom Dann also felt frustrated by the ship maneuvering mechanics , though he concluded that they " can also be rewarding and entertaining " . Flotilla was nominated for the 2011 Independent Games Festival Visions Award , but lost to Amnesia : The Dark Descent . It was also listed among the Honorable Mentions for the Excellence in Visual Art and Excellence in Design awards .

The protagonist of the series , Ichigo receives Soul Reaper powers as a result of a run @-@ in with Rukia Kuchiki , the Soul Reaper assigned to patrol his city , the fictional Karakura Town . These powers come at the cost of Rukia 's own , and as a result , Ichigo concedes to work as Rukia 's stand @-@ in , fighting to protect people from evil spirits called Hollows and sending good spirits , wholes , to Soul Society . In addition to the manga series , Ichigo appears in many other pieces of Bleach media , including the anime series , the four featured films , the two original video animations , rock musicals , several video games and light novels . 
 Kubo said that Ichigo 's character was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn 't suited for the role . His character has been well received among both readers and reviewers . Ichigo is often featured in Weekly Shōnen Jump character popularity polls . He was consistently ranked as one of the most popular characters in Bleach . The 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine polls ranked Ichigo as one of the top 100 most @-@ loved anime characters . Reviewers of the series have praised his personality , though some consider him to be a stereotypical anti @-@ hero . Merchandise based on Ichigo 's likeness has been released , including toys , clothing , and action figures . In the animated adaptations of Bleach , Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese . In the English adaptations , he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch .

 When drawing the manga series , Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki , the first Bleach character he introduced , was originally intended to be the protagonist . Through subsequent development of the series , however , Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character . Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses , and having dark hair and softer eyes . When designing Rukia , however , Kubo modified Ichigo 's appearance to contrast with hers , giving Ichigo orange hair , a trademark scowl , and removing the glasses . During the series ' first chapter , Ichigo 's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time . In later chapters , his wristwatch was based on Naoto <unk> 's <unk> cellphone . According to Kubo , Ichigo , along with Orihime Inoue , are the most arduous characters to sketch . While illustrating one of Ichigo 's scenes , Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile . 
 Kubo has stated that Ichigo 's greatest strength is his considerate and thoughtful nature ; he always thinks about other 's needs . However , he also noted it as his greatest weakness , since worrying about his friends tends to put him in danger . When asked in an interview if he had any plans to focus on the love triangle between Ichigo , Orihime , and Rukia , Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he didn 't want to focus on romance . Kubo likens Ichigo 's popularity among readers because he " looks cool " . He also mentioned that as people read more about him they will discover that he is a warm and kind @-@ hearted person . 
 Following over fifty volumes of the manga 's released , Kubo believes that Ichigo was the most developed character . He said that Ichigo leads the story and introduces readers to the events in it . When the Arrancar arc ended , Kubo rebooted the series which resulted in Ichigo losing his Soul Reaper powers . In the same way Ichigo became a Soul Reaper during the series ' first chapter ; he starts searching for methods to recover his original powers . Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime , while as a child he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka . Johnny Yong Bosch voices him in the English dub as a teenager , and Mona Marshall as an adolescent . While describing Ichigo as one of his best roles , Morita notes that voicing him can be at times difficult . Bosch has enjoyed voicing Ichigo 's character due to his personal interest in the character 's morals . However , he experienced difficulty voicing him in some scenes where Ichigo shouts for a long time .

His character is featured in two volumes from the Bleach Beat Collection CD soundtrack series which features themes composed by his Japanese voice actor , Masakazu Morita . These include the first of them , in which he is the only character and the fourth season 's fourth volume along with Rukia . Ichigo also appears in the first volume of Bleach Breathless Collection CD soundtrack series together with the embodiment of his Quincy powers that posed as the Zanpakutō spirit Zangetsu .

 Amongst the Bleach reader base , Ichigo has been always highly ranked in the Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity polls for the series . He has usually taken first place , though in early 2008 he dropped to third . His sword , Zangetsu , also ranked third in the Zanpakutō popularity polls . In the 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine poll , Ichigo was ranked one of the best male anime characters . In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation ( <unk> ) , Ichigo was elected for the best anime male character in 2008 . The Japanese music distributor Recochoku has made two annual survey of which anime characters that people would like to marry . Ichigo ranked tenth in the category " The Character I Want to Be My Groom " from the 2008 survey and eight in the 2009 poll . Wizard Entertainment considered Ichigo the best hero from 2007 , commenting that he doesn 't try to be a typical hero but he fights in order to protect his friends . He was also 20th in IGN 's " Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time " with comments focused on his design and personality . Ichigo has also appeared twice in the Anime Grand Prix polls , ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters . At the first Seiyu Awards in March 2007 , Masakazu Morita won in the category " Best Rookie Actor " for his role as Ichigo Kurosaki . Ichigo 's voice actor in the English adaptation , Johnny Yong Bosch , has also been praised for his voice work on Ichigo 's character by Anime News Network ( ANN ) , which favorably compared Bosch and Morita 's work . Various merchandise based on Ichigo 's appearance has been created , including action figures , plush toys and key @-@ chains . Since the series was released , replica models of Ichigo 's Zanpakutō and Bankai have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Ichigo 's character . ANN 's Melissa Harper commented that Ichigo 's initial rebellious actions make him almost a stereotypical anti @-@ hero , but note that he is soon revealed to be a more complex character with a sad past . Los Angeles Times 's Charles Solomon comments Ichigo 's character has little in common with protagonists from other series due to his bad temper and how he tends to fight . However , he added that readers from the series still " love " Ichigo . The way Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper was found to be relatively common by Carlos Alexandre . He noted that Ichigo 's character of a " tough guy with a heart of gold " had already been done in several series . Charles White from IGN praised Ichigo 's climactic fight against Byakuya Kuchiki as one of the best fights in the Bleach series , and later Ramsey Isler gave additional praise to both the design and voice acting for Ichigo 's inner Hollow . Ichigo 's development during the Rescue arc in which he sets to save Rukia Kuchiki from being executed have been praised by ANN 's Theron Martin . He praised the scenes in which Ichigo manages to stop Rukia 's execution and his subsequent demonstration of his Bankai as one of the " eminently satisfying landmark moments in the series " . Wired News 's Corrina Lawson stated that she liked Ichigo 's strong sense of responsibility , and commented it was one of the reasons of the series ' popularity . 
 = Sungei Road = 
 Sungei Road ( Chinese : <unk> ; literally River Road ) is a road in Singapore situated between Serangoon Road and Jalan Besar and runs along the Rochor Canal . The area around Sungei Road was formerly the homes of affluent Europeans and Asians , where many ornately designed buildings were built in its place . From the 1930s to the present , the road has been synonymous with the Thieves ' Market , the largest and oldest flea market in Singapore , where the locals can hunt for old bric @-@ a @-@ brac or second @-@ hand goods , as a cheap replacement for one 's faulty or lost item . It 's also the place where the well @-@ known Sungei Road <unk> , a local spicy noodle soup originated . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Sungei Road got its name because it runs along the banks of the Rochor River ( Sungei Rochor ) , hence its Malay name , <unk> , meaning " river " . Sungei Road starts opposite the former <unk> <unk> police station and was therefore known to the Chinese as " <unk> kah ma ta chu " , which means " <unk> kah police station " in Hokkien . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 1820s , the area around Sungei Road was designated by Sir Stamford Raffles , the founder of modern Singapore , for the homes of affluent Europeans and Asians , when he divided the early settlements according to different ethnic groups . The Arabs and Malays who had settled at Sungei Road previously were relocated eastwards to Kampong Glam . <unk> designed two @-@ storey and three @-@ storey shophouses that came with covered 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) way were built in its place . 
 At nearby Lavender Street was the <unk> house of Cho Ah Chee , the carpenter of the ship <unk> Indiana in which Raffles travelled to Singapore in 1819 . It is believed that Raffles gave the house to Guangdong @-@ born Cho , in recognition of his services at the time of the founding of Singapore . The house has been demolished in the 1970s and a small public park has taken its place . 
 During the Japanese Occupation , a street market known as Robinson <unk> meaning " evening Robinsons " , started along the banks of the Rochor Canal where the poor could buy cheap household wares and other merchandise in short supply , akin to what department store Robinson & Co. had sold . 
 = = = Thieves ' Market = = = 
 Since the 1930s , Sungei Road and its surrounding roads became a flea market better known as the Thieves ' Market , because all sorts of second @-@ hand merchandise as well as contraband goods were sold here . The peddlers may change from day to day and there were no receipts , so refunds are impossible . Until the British Army withdrawal in the late 1960s , it was also a place to buy army merchandise like uniforms , army gear and other army surplus , possibly looted earlier from British military stores . The open air market soon acquired a bad reputation as the major dissemination venue for stolen goods that would last to the present day . If an item was " lost " recently , people can try their luck in looking for it at the Thieves ' Market , and buying it back from the sellers who will always claim no knowledge of its source . 
 In the early 1970s , opium dens used to be common in the Sungei Road area . The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the hardship of the day 's toil . The opium addicts were mainly poor , elderly people from working @-@ class groups . In early 1991 , a spate of fires destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road . Most of the century @-@ old shophouses , crumbling with age , had become potential fire hazards for its residents . The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless . As a result , many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years . 
 = = = Success stories = = = 
 Despite its notorious reputation , there were a few cases of honest and hardworking karung guni men who made good , and became millionaires . One was Poon Buck Seng who started his business with only a capital of S $ 50 by picking up junk , or paying small amounts for things people were throwing away in the 1980s . He would then take his goods to sell at the Sungei Road Thieves ' Market . Within seven years , he had saved enough money to rent a shop space nearby , and expanded his business to sell bigger used items like computers , refrigerators , videotape recorders and television sets , in addition to old clothes , shoes and records . In 1993 , he registered his second @-@ hand goods trading business and began to focus his business in exporting used computer parts , as there were not many people doing that back then , and his business thrived . He made a few thousand dollars every month and five years later , Poon had saved enough money to buy a 1 @,@ 636 square feet ( 152 @.@ 0 m2 ) freehold property worth S $ 730 @,@ 000 and was offered S $ 1 @.@ 4 million for the unit in a collective sale later . His export business lasted only 10 years . By 2002 , Poon 's business was declining as too many people had jumped onto the bandwagon . He decided to end his export business and went back to his old karung guni trade again that lasts to this very day . 
 Another similar rags @-@ to @-@ riches story is Pang Lim , who was an illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s . His big break came when he saved enough money to rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle . They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves . The business took off and from one coffee shop , Pang is now the managing director of <unk> , which operates 20 <unk> , five coffee shops and five cafes around the island .

 Located nearby at Jin Shui <unk> ( " kopitiam " means " <unk> " in Hokkien ) is a stall selling Sungei Road laksa , a local spicy noodle soup that originated from Peranakan culture . The Sungei Road laksa legacy was started in 1956 when a Hainanese friend of Wong , Ah Tong , gave Wong and his brother Wong Yew Poh , his secret recipe for laksa on account of their long @-@ standing friendship . The Wong brothers set up a push @-@ cart stall to sell their laksa and the response to their recipe was overwhelming . It was sold with the thick bee hoon ( Chinese noodle ) cut up and served only with a spoon , without chopsticks , topped with cockles , bean sprouts and home @-@ made fried fish cakes in distinctive chicken motif bowls . Customers ate it while standing by the roadside and it cost only 20 cents a bowl back then . By day , they sold along Johor Road and by night , off Sungei Road . Today , the brothers have since lost contact with Ah Tong , but their children still serve the traditional recipe , using charcoal fire to keep his gravy constantly warm to maintain its distinctive flavour . It is regarded among the best laksa stalls in Singapore by many food reviewers . Starting from April 2015 , the stall has been relocated to 145 Jalan Besar , at a short walking distance from its previous location , though keeping its original name " 31 Sungei <unk> " .

 Today , the flea market is still thriving despite the fact that all the old shop house buildings have been torn down in the mid @-@ 1990s .

The peddlers do not pay rent but the Singapore government forbids them from selling brand @-@ new items . To keep up with the times , some of the peddlers have put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs , badges , medals and other collector 's items .

The remainder would be redeveloped by HDB at the later time . 
 = Magic : The Gathering = 
 Magic : The Gathering ( MTG ; also known as Magic ) is a trading card game created by Richard Garfield . 
 First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast , Magic was the first trading card game produced and it continues to thrive , with approximately twenty million players as of 2015 . Magic can be played by two or more players in various formats , the most common of which uses a deck of 60 + cards , either in person with printed cards or using a deck of virtual cards through the Internet @-@ based Magic : The Gathering Online , on a smartphone or tablet , or other programs . 
 Each game represents a battle between wizards known as " planeswalkers " , who employ spells , artifacts , and creatures depicted on individual Magic cards to defeat their opponents . Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role @-@ playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons , the gameplay of Magic bears little similarity to pencil @-@ and @-@ paper adventure games , while having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games . 
 New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets . An organized tournament system played at an international level and a worldwide community of professional Magic players has developed , as well as a substantial secondary market for Magic cards . Certain Magic cards can be valuable due to their rarity and utility in gameplay . Prices range from a few cents to thousands of dollars . 
 = = History = = 
 Richard Garfield was a doctoral candidate at University of Pennsylvania when he first started to design the game . During his free time he worked with local volunteer playtesters to help refine the game . He had been brought on as an adjunct professor at Whitman College in 1991 when Peter Adkison ( then CEO of Wizards of the Coast games company ) first met with Garfield to discuss Garfield 's new game RoboRally . Adkison saw the game as very promising , but decided that Wizards of the Coast lacked the resources to produce it at that point . He did like Garfield 's ideas and mentioned that he was looking for a portable game that could be played in the downtime that frequently occurs at gaming conventions . Garfield returned and presented the general outline of the concept of a trading card game . Adkison immediately saw the potential of this idea and agreed to produce it . Magic : The Gathering underwent a general release on August 5 , 1993 . 
 While the game was simply called Magic through most of playtesting , when the game had to be officially named a lawyer informed them that Magic was too generic to be trademarked . Mana Clash was instead chosen to be the name used in the first solicitation of the game , however , everybody involved with the game continued to refer to it as Magic . After further consultation with the lawyer , it was decided to rename the game Magic : The Gathering , thus enabling the name to be trademarked . 
 A patent was granted to Wizards of the Coast in 1997 for " a novel method of game play and game components that in one embodiment are in the form of trading cards " that includes claims covering games whose rules include many of Magic 's elements in combination , including concepts such as changing orientation of a game component to indicate use ( referred to in the Magic and Vampire : The Eternal Struggle rules as " tapping " ) and constructing a deck by selecting cards from a larger pool . The patent has aroused criticism from some observers , who believe some of its claims to be invalid . In 2003 , the patent was an element of a larger legal dispute between Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo , regarding trade secrets related to Nintendo 's Pokémon Trading Card Game . The legal action was settled out of court , and its terms were not disclosed . 
 Magic was an immediate success for Wizards of the Coast . Early on they were even reluctant to advertise the game because they were unable to keep pace with existing demand . Initially Magic attracted many Dungeons & Dragons players , but the following included all types of other people as well . The success of the game quickly led to the creation of similar games by other companies as well as Wizards of the Coast themselves . Companion Games produced the Galactic Empires CCG ( the first science fiction trading card game ) , which allowed players to pay for and design their own promotional cards , while TSR created the <unk> game , which eventually included five editions in six languages , plus twelve expansion sets . Wizards of the Coast produced <unk> ( now called Vampire : The Eternal Struggle ) , a game about modern @-@ day vampires . Other similar games included trading card games based on Star Trek and Star Wars . Magic is often cited as an example of a 1990s collecting fad , though the game 's makers were able to overcome the bubble traditionally associated with collecting fads . 
 The success of the initial edition prompted a reissue later in 1993 , along with expansions to the game . Arabian Nights was released as the first expansion in December 1993 . New expansions and revisions of the base game ( " Core Sets " ) have since been released on a regular basis , amounting to four releases a year . By the end of 1994 , the game had printed over a billion cards . Until the release of Mirage in 1996 , expansions were released on an irregular basis . Beginning in 2009 one revision of the core set and a set of three related expansions called a " block " were released every year . This system was revised in 2015 , with the Core Set being eliminated and blocks now consisting of two sets , released biannually . While the essence of the game has always stayed the same , the rules of Magic have undergone three major revisions with the release of the Revised Edition in 1994 , Classic Edition in 1999 , and Magic 2010 in July 2009 . With the release of the Eighth Edition in 2003 , Magic also received a major visual redesign . 
 In 1996 , Wizards of the Coast established the " Pro Tour " , a circuit of tournaments where players can compete for sizeable cash prizes over the course of a single weekend @-@ long tournament . In 2009 the top prize at a single tournament was US $ 40 @,@ 000 . Sanctioned through the DCI , the tournaments added an element of prestige to the game by virtue of the cash payouts and media coverage from within the community . For a brief period of time , ESPN2 televised the tournaments . 
 While unofficial methods of online play existed previously , Magic Online ( " <unk> " or " Modo " ) , an official online version of the game , was released in 2002 . A new , updated version of Magic Online was released in April 2008 . 
 In January 2014 , Hasbro announced a franchise film deal with 20th Century Fox for Magic : The Gathering , saying that they wanted " to launch a massive franchise on the scale of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings . " Simon Kinberg is serving as writer and producer for the project . In June 2014 , Fox hired screenwriter Bryan Cogman to write the script for the film .

 A 2004 article in USA Today suggested that playing Magic might help improve the social and mental skills of some of the players . The article interviewed players ' parents who believe that the game , similar to sports , teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose . Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis . Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble , such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs . On the other hand , the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive , leading to parents worried about the Magic obsession of their kids . In addition , until 2007 , some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships . 
 Jordan Weisman , an American game designer and entrepreneur , commented , " I love games that challenge and change our definition of adventure gaming , and Magic : The Gathering is definitely one of a very short list of titles that has accomplished that elusive goal . By combining the collecting and trading elements of baseball cards with the fantasy play dynamics of roleplaying games , Magic created a whole new genre of product that changed our industry forever .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 A game of Magic involves two or more players who are engaged in a battle acting as powerful wizards called planeswalkers . Each player has their own deck , either one previously constructed or made from a limited pool of cards for the event . A player starts the game with twenty " life points " and loses the game when he or she is reduced to zero . A player can also lose if he or she must draw from an empty deck . In addition , some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game . Garfield has stated that two major influences in his creation of Magic : the Gathering were the games Cosmic Encounter , which first used the concept that normal rules could sometimes be overridden , and Dungeons & Dragons . The " Golden Rule of Magic " states that " Whenever a card 's text directly contradicts the rules , the card takes precedence . " The Comprehensive Rules , a detailed rulebook , exists to clarify conflicts . 
 Players begin the game by shuffling their decks and then drawing seven cards . Players draw one card at the beginning of each of their turns , except the first player on their first turn . Players alternate turns . The two basic kinds of cards are " spells " and " lands " . Lands provide " mana " , or magical energy , which is used as magical fuel when the player attempts to cast spells . Players may only play one land per turn . More powerful spells cost more mana , so as the game progresses more mana becomes available , and the quantity and relative power of the spells played tends to increase . Spells come in several varieties : " sorceries " and " instants " have a single , one @-@ time effect before they go to the " graveyard " ( discard pile ) ; " enchantments " and " artifacts " are " <unk> " that remain in play after being cast to provide a lasting magical effect ; " creature " spells ( also a type of permanent ) summon creatures that can attack and damage an opponent . The set <unk> introduced the new " <unk> " card type , which represent powerful allies who fight with their own magic abilities . 
 = = = Deck construction = = = 
 In most tournament formats , decks are required to be a minimum of sixty cards , with no upper limit . Players may use no more than four copies of any named card , with the exception of " basic lands " , which act as a standard resource in Magic , and some specific cards that state otherwise . Certain formats such as Commander may limit the number of iterations of a single card players may have in their decks . 
 In " limited " tournament formats a small number of cards are opened for play from booster packs or tournament packs , and a minimum deck size of forty cards is used . Depending on the type of play , some individual cards have been " restricted " ( the card is limited to a single copy per deck ) or " banned " ( the card is no longer legal for tournament play ) . These limitations are usually for balance of power reasons , but have been occasionally made because of gameplay mechanics . 
 Deck building requires strategy as players must choose among thousands of cards which they want to play . This requires players to evaluate the power of their cards , as well as the possible synergies between them , and their possible interactions with the cards they expect to play against ( this " metagame " can vary in different locations or time periods ) . The choice of cards is usually narrowed by the player deciding which colors they want to include in the deck . This decision is a key part of creating a deck . In general , reducing the number of colors used increases the consistency of play and the probability of drawing the lands needed to cast one 's spells , at the expense of restricting the range of tactics available to the player . 
 = = = Colors of Magic = = = 
 Most spells come in one of five colors . The colors can be seen on the back of the cards , in a pentagonal design , called the " Color Wheel " or " Color Pie " . Clockwise from the top , they are : white , blue , black , red , and green . To play a spell of a given color , at least one mana of that color is required . This mana is normally generated by a basic land : plains for white , island for blue , swamp for black , mountain for red , and forest for green . The balances and distinctions among the five colors form one of the defining aspects of the game . Each color has strengths and weaknesses based on the " style " of magic it represents . 
 White is the color of order , equality , righteousness , healing , law , community , peace , absolutism / totalitarianism , and light . White 's strengths are a roster of small creatures that are strong collectively ; protecting and enhancing those creatures with enchantments ; gaining life ; preventing damage to creatures or players ; imposing restrictions on players ; reducing the capabilities of opposing creatures , and powerful spells that " equalize " the playing field by destroying all cards of a given type . White creatures are known for their " Protection " from various other colors or even types of card , rendering them nearly impervious to harm from those things . White 's weaknesses include a focus on smaller creatures , its unwillingness to simply kill creatures outright ( instead hobbling them with restrictions that can be undone ) , and the fact that many of its most powerful spells affect all players equally — including the casting player . 
 Blue is the color of intellect , reason , illusion , logic , knowledge , manipulation , and trickery , as well as the classical elements of air and water . Blue 's cards are best at letting a player draw additional cards ; permanently taking control of an opponent 's cards ; returning cards to their owner 's hand ; making cards go directly from a player 's deck to their graveyard ; and countering spells . Blue 's creatures tend to be weaker than creatures of other colors , but commonly have abilities and traits which make them difficult to damage or block . Blue 's weaknesses include having trouble permanently dealing with spells that have already been played , the reactive nature of most of its spells , and a small ( and expensive ) roster of creatures . 
 Black is the color of power , ambition , greed , death , illness , corruption , selfishness , amorality , and sacrifice ; it is not necessarily evil , though many of its cards refer directly or indirectly to this concept . Black cards are best at destroying creatures , forcing players to discard cards from their hand , making players lose life , and returning creatures from the players ' graveyards . Furthermore , because Black seeks to win at all costs , it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors ; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals , creatures , cards in hand , cards in library , and other difficult @-@ to @-@ replace resources . Black 's main weaknesses are an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts , its tendency to hurt itself almost as badly as it hurts the opponent , and difficulties in removing other Black creatures . 
 Red is the color of freedom , chaos , passion , creativity , impulse , fury , warfare , lightning , the classical element of fire , and the non @-@ living geological aspects of the classical element earth . Red 's strengths include destroying opposing lands and artifacts , sacrificing permanent resources for temporary but great power , and playing spells that directly damage creatures or players . Red has a wide array of creatures , but with the exception of extremely powerful dragons , most are fast and weak , or with low toughness , rendering them easier to destroy . Some of Red 's cards can turn against or hurt their owner in return for being more powerful for their cost . Red also shares the trickery theme with Blue and can temporarily steal opponents ' creatures or divert spells , although generally not permanently . Many of Red 's most famous creatures have " Haste " which lets them attack and use many abilities as soon as they enter the battlefield . The ability to raise a creature 's power temporarily is also common among Red 's creatures . Red 's weaknesses include its inability to destroy enchantments , the self @-@ destructive nature of many of its spells , and the way in which it trades early @-@ game speed at the cost of late @-@ game staying power . Red also has the vast majority of cards that involve random chance . 
 Green is the color of life , nature , reality , evolution / adaptability , ecology , interdependence , instinct , and indulgence . Green 's strengths are on the battlefield , usually winning through combat with creatures , of which it has a broad menagerie . These tend to be strong for their cost and have abilities that make them more survivable like Regenerate and <unk> . Green creatures also often have " <unk> " , an ability which allows them to deal attack damage to an opponent if blocked by a weaker creature . Many Green spells bolster its creatures ' power , either permanently or temporarily . Green spells often focus on growth , such as regaining life points , amassing large quantities of green mana , and getting land cards faster , thus allowing the player more resources and the capacity to get strong creatures on the battlefield faster . Green 's weakness is an inability to defend against indirect attacks . It has few cards that allow it to counterattack against the hand , library , or graveyard ; Green also has few defenses against creatures that bypass its own powerful creatures when attacking . 
 The colors adjacent to each other on the pentagon are " allied " and often have similar , complementary abilities . For example , Blue has a relatively large number of flying creatures , as do White and Black , which are next to it . The two non @-@ adjacent colors to a particular color are " enemy " colors , and are thematically opposed . For instance , Red tends to be very aggressive , while White and Blue are often more defensive in nature . The Research and Development ( R & D ) team at Wizards of the Coast aims to balance power and abilities among the five colors by using the " Color Pie " to differentiate the strengths and weaknesses of each . This guideline lays out the capabilities , themes , and mechanics of each color and allows for every color to have its own distinct attributes and gameplay . The Color Pie is used to ensure new cards are thematically in the correct color and do not infringe on the territory of other colors . 
 Multi @-@ color cards were introduced in the Legends set and typically use a gold frame to distinguish them from mono @-@ color cards . These cards require mana from two or more different colors to be played and count as belonging to each of the colors used to play them . Multi @-@ color cards typically combine the philosophy and mechanics of all the colors used in the spell 's cost , and tend to be proportionally more powerful compared to single @-@ color or hybrid cards , as requiring multiple colors of mana makes them harder to cast . More recently , two @-@ color " hybrid " cards were introduced in the Ravnica set , and appeared extensively throughout the <unk> and Eventide sets . Hybrid cards are distinguished by a gradient frame with those two colors , and can be paid with either of the card 's colors ; for instance , a card with two hybrid @-@ red / white icons can be cast using two red mana , two white mana , or one of each . Several sets have made multi @-@ colored cards a theme , including Shards of Alara , both Ravnica blocks and others . Core sets do not typically include multi @-@ color cards in them , although the Core 2013 set was the first to do so . 
 Colorless cards belong to no color , and most often appear in the form of Lands and Artifacts . Unlike the five colors , Colorless cards do not have a specific personality or style of play . Sometimes , colorless cards will imitate the mechanics of a particular color , though in a less @-@ efficient manner than a similar colored card . Often colorless cards are linked to one or more colors via their abilities , through story references , or through flavor text on the cards themselves . With the Rise of the Eldrazi expansion , however , colorless cards that are neither artifacts nor lands have been introduced for the first time in larger quantities . 
 = = = Luck vs. skill = = = 
 Magic , like many other games , combines chance and skill . One frequent complaint about the game involves the notion that there is too much luck involved , especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands . Early in the game especially , too many or too few lands could ruin a player 's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake . This in @-@ game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction , as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems . In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 , the land count is automatically adjusted to 40 % of the total deck size . 
 A " mulligan " rule was introduced into the game , first informally in casual play and then in the official game rules . The modern " Paris mulligan " allows players to shuffle an unsatisfactory opening hand back into the deck at the start of the game , draw a new hand with one fewer card , and repeat until satisfied , after which any player who has taken a mulligan may look at the top card of his or her deck and either return it or put it at the bottom of the deck . In multiplayer , a player may take one mulligan without penalty , while subsequent <unk> will still cost one card ( a rule known as " Partial Paris mulligan " ) . The original mulligan allowed a player a single redraw of seven new cards if that player 's initial hand contained seven or zero lands . A variation of this rule called a " forced mulligan " is still used in some casual play circles and in multiplayer formats on Magic Online , and allows a single " free " redraw of seven new cards if a player 's initial hand contains seven , six , one or zero lands . 
 Confessing his love for games combining both luck and skill , Magic creator Richard Garfield admitted its influence in his design of Magic . In addressing the complaint about luck influencing a game , Dr. Garfield points out that new and casual players tend to appreciate luck as a leveling field , in which a random effect increases their chances of winning . Meanwhile , a player with higher skills appreciates a game with less chance , as the higher degree of control increases their chances of winning . According to Dr. Garfield , Magic has and would likely continue decreasing its degree of luck as the game matured . The " Mulligan rule " , as well as card design , past vs. present , are good examples of this trend . He feels that this is a universal trend for maturing games . Dr. Garfield explained using chess as an example , that unlike modern chess , in predecessors , players would use dice to determine which chess piece to move . 
 = = = Gambling = = = 
 The original set of rules prescribed that all games were to be played for ante . Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks to play with the cards rather than collect them . For Magic , each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante . At the end of the match , the winner would take and keep both cards . Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect , allowing replacements of cards up for ante , adding more cards to the ante , or even permanently trading cards in play . 
 The ante concept became controversial because many regions had restrictions on games of chance . The rule was later made optional because of these restrictions and because of players ' reluctance to possibly lose a card that they owned . The gambling rule is forbidden at sanctioned events and is now mostly a relic of the past , though it still sees occasional usage in friendly games as well as the " five color " format . The last card to mention ante was printed in the 1995 expansion set Homelands . 
 = = = Variant rules = = = 
 While the primary method of Magic play is one @-@ on @-@ one using standard deck construction rules , there are many alternative formats for playing the game . The most popular alternatives describe ways of playing with more than two players ( with teams or free @-@ for @-@ all ) or change the rules about how decks can be built . 
 = = Organized play = = 
 Magic tournaments regularly occur in gaming stores and other venues . Larger tournaments with hundreds of competitors from around the globe sponsored by Wizards of the Coast are arranged many times every year , with substantial cash prizes for the top finishers . A number of websites report on tournament news , give complete lists for the most currently popular decks , and feature articles on current issues of debate about the game . The DCI , which is owned and operated by Wizards of the Coast , is the organizing body for sanctioned Magic events . The two major categories of tournament play are " Constructed " and " Limited " . 
 = = = Constructed = = = 
 In " Constructed " tournaments , each player arrives with a pre @-@ built deck , which must have a minimum of sixty cards and follow other deck construction rules . The deck may also have up to a fifteen card sideboard , which allows players to modify their deck . Normally the first player to win two games is the winner of the match . 
 Different formats of Constructed Magic exist , each allowing different cards . The DCI maintains a " Banned and Restricted List " for each format ; players may not use banned cards at all , and restricted cards are limited to one copy per deck . The DCI bans cards that it determines are damaging the health of a format ; it seeks to use this remedy as infrequently as possible , and only a handful of cards have been banned in recent years . 
 Block Constructed formats are defined by the cycle of three sets of cards in a given block . For example , the Ravnica block format consists of Ravnica : City of Guilds , <unk> , and Dissension . Only cards that were printed in one of the sets in the appropriate block can be used in these formats . 
 Standard , formerly known as Type 2 , contains the current block and the last two completed blocks . The Standard card pool undergoes a " rotation " twice a year , in April and October , when the first set of the next block is released . As of April 8 , 2016 , the Standard card pool consists of Dragons of Tarkir , Magic Origins , Battle for Zendikar , Oath of the Gatewatch , and Shadows Over Innistrad . ( For Standard rotation purpose , Dragons of Tarkir and Magic Origins , released under the previous three @-@ set block / core set model , are considered to be a block . ) 
 Modern is a format that was first played at the Magic Online 2011 Community Cup , a response to players ' desire for a non @-@ rotating format that is more accessible to newer players . Wizards of the Coast introduced Modern as a legal format on August 12 , 2011 , and saw its first paper magic play at Pro Tour Philadelphia 2011 . Modern consists of every block and core set using the modern card frame since the release of 8th Edition to the present . Certain cards that released in products that are not standard legal such as <unk> or Commander series cards , are not legal in Modern , even if they have the modern card frame . 
 Legacy Is a format that allows every card ever printed except the Legacy banned list . It is distinguished from Vintage in that certain cards are banned for power reasons . 
 Vintage , previously known as Type 1 , is an Eternal format . The only banned cards in Vintage are cards using the " ante " mechanic and a few other cards that the DCI considers inappropriate for competitive Magic . Because of the expense in acquiring the scarce old cards to play competitive Vintage , some unsanctioned Vintage tournaments permit players to proxy a certain number of cards . Currently , the only format with a Restricted List is Vintage . Proxy cards are forbidden in DCI @-@ sanctioned tournaments , except as replacements for damaged cards when created by the event judge . 
 Commander ( originally known as Elder Dragon Highlander or <unk> ) is a casual format , but can be played competitively . In this format each player constructs a 100 singleton deck that has a legendary creature that acts as a commander . The deck construction is limited to the colors that are represented by the chosen commander and there cannot be two or more cards with the same name with the exception of basic lands . The legendary creature chosen as commander is kept in a special " command zone " and may be cast at any time you can afford to cast the creature . If the commander card would enter any zone other than the battlefield from anywhere , its owner has the choice to return that card to the " command zone " , where it can be cast again for an additional two generic mana to its regular cost . The banned list and unique rules are governed by an independent body ( not by Wizards of the Coast ) . 
 = = = Limited = = = 
 In " Limited " tournaments , players construct decks using booster packs plus any additional basic lands of their choice . The decks in Limited tournaments must be a minimum of forty cards . All unused cards function as the sideboard , which , as in " Constructed " formats , can be freely exchanged between games of a match , as long as the deck continues to adhere to the forty card minimum . The rule that a player may use only four copies of any given card does not apply . 
 Sealed Deck tournaments give each player six 15 @-@ card booster packs from which to build his or her deck . 
 Booster Draft is usually played with eight players . The players are seated around a table and each player is given three booster packs . Each player opens a pack , selects a card from it , and passes the remaining cards to the next player . Each player then selects one of the remaining cards from the pack he or she just received , and passes the remaining cards again . This continues until all of the cards are depleted . Players pass left for the first and third packs , and right for the second . Players then build decks out of any of the cards that they selected during the drafting . Talking , signaling , and showing cards is forbidden during the drafting process , except for double faced cards from the Innistrad and Shadows over Innistrad blocks and " Magic Origins " , which cannot be hidden as each side of the physical card has a spell printed on it . 
 = = = Other Formats = = = 
 Players often create their own formats based on any number of criteria . Sometimes these can be based on limiting the financial value of a deck , mixing and matching different blocks or sets , or taking an existing format and modifying the DCI Banned List . Commander ( formerly <unk> ) was one such format , before being officially supported by wizards . Tiny Leaders is a variant of Commander , that is not officially supported . One of the most popular player created formats for Limited is Cube Drafting . Similar in structure to Draft , players will instead use a collection of cards instead of random boosters to draft from . Since 2014 player created formats are allowed as Friday Night Magic events , so long as they follow basic Tournament Magic rules ( no fake cards , no gambling etc . ) 
 = = = Tournament structure = = = 
 The DCI maintains a set of rules for being able to sanction tournaments , as well as runs its own circuit . Local shops often offer " Friday Night Magic " tournaments as a stepping @-@ stone to more competitive play . The DCI runs the Pro Tour as a series of major tournaments to attract interest . The right to compete in a Pro Tour has to be earned by either winning a Pro Tour Qualifier Tournament or being successful in a previous tournament on a similar level . A Pro Tour is usually structured into two days of individual competition played in the Swiss format . On the final day , the top eight players compete with each other in an elimination format to select the winner . 
 At the end of the competition in a Pro Tour , players are awarded Pro Points depending on their finishing place . If the player finishes high enough , they will also be awarded prize money . Frequent winners of these events have made names for themselves in the Magic community , such as Gabriel Nassif , Kai Budde and Jon Finkel . As a promotional tool , the DCI launched the Hall of Fame in 2005 to honor selected players . 
 At the end of the year the Magic World Championship is held . The World Championship functions like a Pro Tour , except that competitors have to present their skill in three different formats ( usually Standard , booster draft and a second constructed format ) rather than one . Another difference is that invitation to the World Championship can be gained not through Pro Tour Qualifiers , but via the national championship of a country . Most countries send their top four players of the tournament as representatives , though nations with minor Magic playing communities may send just one player . The World Championship also has a team @-@ based competition , where the national teams compete with each other . 
 At the beginning of the World Championship , new members are inducted into the Hall of Fame . The tournament also concludes the current season of tournament play and at the end of the event , the player who earned the most Pro Points during the year is awarded the title " Pro Player of the Year " . The player who earned the most Pro Points and did not compete in any previous season is awarded the title " Rookie of the Year " . 
 Invitation to a Pro Tour , Pro Points and prize money can also be earned in lesser tournaments called Grand Prix that are open to the general public and are held more frequently throughout the year . Grand Prix events are usually the largest Magic tournaments , sometimes drawing more than 1 @,@ 000 players . The largest Magic tournament ever held was Grand Prix : Las Vegas in June 2013 with a total of 4 @,@ 500 players . 
 = = Product and marketing = = 
 Magic : The Gathering cards are produced in much the same way as normal playing cards . Each Magic card , approximately 63 × 88 mm in size ( 2 @.@ 5 by 3 @.@ 5 inches ) , has a face which displays the card 's name and rules text as well as an illustration appropriate to the card 's concept . 15 @,@ 919 unique cards have been produced for the game as of May 2016 , many of them with variant editions , artwork , or layouts , and 600 – 1000 new ones are added each year . The first Magic cards were printed exclusively in English , but current sets are also printed in Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese , French , German , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Portuguese , Russian , and Spanish . 
 The overwhelming majority of Magic cards are issued and marketed in the form of sets . For the majority of its history there were two types : the Core Set and the themed expansion sets . Under Wizards of the Coast 's current production and marketing scheme , a new set is released quarterly . Various products are released with each set to appeal to different segments of the Magic playing community : 
 The majority of cards are sold in booster packs , which contain fifteen cards normally divided into four rarities , which can be differentiated by the color of the expansion symbol . A fifteen @-@ card Booster Pack will typically contain one rare ( gold ) , three <unk> ( silver ) , ten commons ( black ) , and one basic land ( colored black , as Commons ) . Sets prior to Shards of Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land . 
 Shards of Alara also debuted mythic <unk> ( red @-@ orange ) , which replace one in eight rare cards on average . There are also premium versions of every card with holographic foil , randomly inserted into some boosters in place of a common , which replace about one in seventy cards . 
 Four to five Intro Packs are released with each set . An Intro Pack is a pre @-@ constructed deck aimed at newcomers that highlights one of the set 's mechanical themes . It comes with two booster packs from that set , a rulebook , and a fixed selection of cards , including one foil rare . This product will be replaced with Planeswalker Decks in <unk> , where there will be two 60 card <unk> decks featuring a <unk> from the set . 
 Each set from Mirrodin Besieged to <unk> featured two Event Decks , which are pre @-@ constructed decks designed as an introduction to tournament play . Beginning with Dragon 's Maze , each set featured only one Event Deck . However , event decks were discontinued following the Khans of Tarkir block . 
 Previously , cards were also sold in Tournament Packs typically containing three <unk> , ten <unk> , thirty @-@ two commons , and thirty basic lands . Tournament Packs were discontinued after Shards of Alara . 
 Expansion sets are currently released in a two @-@ set block , starting with a large set and ending with a smaller one three months later . Prior to 2016 , expansion sets were released in a three @-@ set block ( again , beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets ) . These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards . Contrasting with the wide @-@ ranging Core Set , each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline . Expansions also dedicate several cards to a handful of particular , often newly introduced , game mechanics . 
 The Core Sets began to be released annually ( previously biennially ) in July 2009 coinciding with the name change from 10th Edition to Magic 2010 . This shift also introduced new , never before printed cards into the core set , something that previously had never been done . However , core sets were discontinued following the release of Magic Origins , on July 17 , 2015 , at the same time that two @-@ set blocks were introduced . 
 In addition to the quarterly set releases , Magic cards are released in other products as well , such as the <unk> and <unk> spin @-@ off games . These combine reprinted Magic cards with new , oversize cards with new functionality . Magic cards are also printed specifically for collectors , such as the From the Vault and Premium Deck Series sets , which contain exclusively premium foil cards . 
 In 2003 , starting with the Eighth Edition Core Set , the game went through its biggest visual change since its creation — a new card frame layout was developed to allow more rules text and larger art on the cards , while reducing the thick , colored border to a minimum . The new frame design aimed to improve contrast and readability using black type instead of the previous white , a new font , and partitioned areas for the name , card type , and power and toughness . 
 For the first few years of its production , Magic : The Gathering featured a small number of cards with names or artwork with demonic or occultist themes , in 1995 the company elected to remove such references from the game . In 2002 , believing that the depiction of demons was becoming less controversial and that the game had established itself sufficiently , Wizards of the Coast reversed this policy and resumed printing cards with " demon " in their names .

 Magic : The Gathering video games , comics , and books have been produced under licensing or directly by Wizards of the Coast . While comics and books have mostly been supplements to develop a background story for the game , several video games have been produced which lean in varying degree on the original game . For the first computer games Wizards of the Coast had sold licenses to Acclaim and MicroProse roughly at the same time . While MicroProse 's Magic : The Gathering received favorable reviews , Acclaim 's Magic : The Gathering : <unk> was mostly dismissed with negative reaction . 
 With Magic : The Gathering Online , Wizards developed and released a computer version of the game themselves that allows players to compete online against other players using the original Magic cards and rules . The latest computer implementation of Magic is Magic : The Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers which was developed by Stainless Games and released for the Xbox 360 in June 2009 . The game was ported to Windows in June of the next year . Six months after the PC release of Duels of the Planeswalkers , the game was ported to the PlayStation 3 platform . The game was the most @-@ played Xbox Live title for two weeks after its release . 
 In September 2011 , Hasbro and IDW Publishing accorded to make a 4 @-@ issue mini @-@ series about Magic : The Gathering with a new story but heavily based on MTG elements and with a new Planeswalker called <unk> <unk> , which story is mainly developed in the planes of Ravnica and Innistrad . The ongoing series started in February 2012 . 
 In 2015 Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro published Magic : The Gathering – Arena of the Planeswalkers . Arena of the Planeswalkers is a tactical boardgame where the players maneuver miniatures over a customizable board game , and the ruleset and terrain is based on <unk> , but with an addition of spell cards and summoning . The original master set includes miniatures that represent the five planeswalkers Gideon , Jace , Liliana , Chandra , and Nissa as well as select creatures from the Magic : The Gathering universe . They later released an expansion Battle for Zendikar featuring <unk> @-@ color planeswalkers <unk> and Ob <unk> and a colorless Eldrazi <unk> , and a second master set Shadows Over Innistrad which has 4 new planeswalkers and also includes the addition of <unk> .

 In 1998 , PGI Limited created <unk> : The <unk> , which was a parody of Magic : The Gathering . Wizards of the Coast , which owned the rights to Magic : The Gathering , took active steps to hinder the distribution of the game and successfully shut out PGI Limited from attending <unk> in July 1998 . In an attempt to avoid breaching copyright and Richard Garfield 's patent , each starter deck of <unk> had printed on the back side , " This is a Parody " , and on the bottom of the rule card was printed , " Do not have each player : construct their own library of predetermined number of game components by examining and selecting [ the ] game components from [ a ] reservoir of game components or you may infringe on U.S. Patent No. 5 @,@ 662 @,@ 332 to Garfield . " 
 = = Secondary market = = 
 There is an active secondary market in individual cards among players and game shops . Many physical and online stores sell single cards or " playsets " of four of a card . Common cards rarely sell for more than a few cents and are usually sold in bulk . Uncommon cards and weak rare cards typically sell from 10 ¢ up to $ 1 . The most expensive cards in standard tournament play are usually priced at $ 35 to $ 50 , although many commonly played cards in the modern and legacy formats sell for $ 60 to $ 180 . Foil versions of rare and mythic rare cards are typically priced at about twice as much as the regular versions . Some of the more sought @-@ after rare and mythic rare cards can have foil versions that cost up to three or four times more than the non @-@ foil versions . 
 A few of the oldest cards , due to smaller printings and limited distribution , are highly valued and extremely rare . This is in part due to the " Reserve List " , a list of cards from the sets Alpha to Urza 's Destiny ( 1994 – 1999 ) that Wizards has promised never to reprint . The most expensive card that was in regular print ( as opposed to being a promotional or special printing ) is Black Lotus . In 2013 , a " <unk> 9 @.@ 5 grade " Beckett Grading Services graded Alpha Black Lotus was bought by an anonymous buyer , for a record $ 27 @,@ 302 . 
 The secondary market started with comic book stores , and hobby shops displaying and selling cards , with the cards ' values determined somewhat arbitrarily by the employees of the store . With the expansion of the internet , prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in . If a card was played in a tournament more frequently , the cost of the card would be higher ( in addition to the market availability of the card ) . When eBay , Amazon , and other large online markets started to gain popularity , the Magic secondary market evolved substantially . Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market . Today , the secondary market is so large and complex , it has become an area of study for consumer research , and some people make a career out of market manipulation , creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards ' worth , and predict the market value of both individual cards , and entire sets of cards . 
 As of late 2013 , Wizards of the Coast has expressed concern over the increasing number of counterfeit cards in the secondary market . Wizards of the Coast has since made an effort to counteract the rise of counterfeits by introducing a new <unk> stamp on all rare and mythic rare cards as of Magic 2015 . 
 = = Artwork = = 
 Each card has an illustration to represent the flavor of the card , often reflecting the setting of the expansion for which it was designed . Much of Magic 's early artwork was commissioned with little specific direction or concern for visual cohesion . One infamous example was the printing of the creature <unk> without the " flying " ability even though its art showed a bird in flight . The art direction team later decided to impose a few constraints so that the artistic vision more closely aligned with the design and development of the cards . Each block of cards now has its own style guide with sketches and descriptions of the various races and places featured in the setting . 
 A few early sets experimented with alternate art for cards . However , Wizards came to believe that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance . Consequently , alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards . When older cards are reprinted in new sets , however , Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible . 
 Starting in 1995 , the copyright on all artwork commissioned is transferred to Wizards of the Coast once a contract is signed . However , the artist is allowed to sell the original piece and printed reproductions of it , and for established and prolific Magic artists , this can be a lucrative source of revenue . 
 As Magic has expanded across the globe , its artwork has had to change for its international audience . Artwork has been edited or given alternate art to comply with the governmental standards . For example , the portrayal of skeletons and most undead in artwork was prohibited by the Chinese government until 2008 . 
 = = Storyline = = 
 The way Magic storylines are conceived and deployed has changed considerably over the years . The main premise of Magic is that countless possible worlds ( planes ) exist in the Multiverse , and only unique and rare beings called Planeswalkers are capable of traversing the Multiverse . This allows the game to frequently change worlds so as to renew its mechanical inspiration , while maintaining planeswalkers as recurrent , common elements across worlds . An intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion and is shown in the art and flavor text of the cards , as well as in novels and anthologies published by Wizards of the Coast ( and formerly by Harper Prism ) . Important storyline characters , objects and locations often appear as cards in Magic sets , usually as " Legendary " creatures , artifacts , and lands , or as " Planeswalker " cards . 
 The original Magic : The Gathering Limited Edition has no overarching storyline , and the cards only have unconnected bits of lore and trivia to give the cards some individual depth . In the early expansion sets until Visions there is usually no real story arc either . Instead , some of these sets are inspired from mythologies of various cultures . This is most apparent in Arabian Nights , that takes some of the One Thousand and One Nights characters and makes them into Magic cards . Norse mythological influences can be seen worked into Ice Age and African influences into Mirage . However , not all of the early sets can be linked as directly to earth mythology . Antiquities touches on an independent storyline about two warring brothers , Urza and Mishra . Homelands is the exception in that period . For this set , a back story was first conceived and the cards in the set were designed afterwards to fit the storyline . 
 Beginning with the Weatherlight expansion there was a shift in the way Magic storylines were used . For the blocks Weatherlight through Apocalypse , the story was laid out in a character driven story , following the events of the Weatherlight ship and its crew . With help of the <unk> capabilities of the Weatherlight , the protagonists travel through the multiverse to fight <unk> and his army of <unk> . Odyssey through Scourge are an unconnected storyline set 100 years later on the <unk> where multiple factions battle for control of the Mirari , a powerful magical artifact left by Karn . After Scourge , Magic storylines have mostly panned away from <unk> . New planes were created to set the scene for new storylines . In contrast to the previous character driven stories , these releases focused on thematic worlds . This was the model from Mirrodin through Alara , a world split into five magically and culturally distinct " shards " but later reunited . 
 After Alara , Magic visited Zendikar , a world used as a prison to entrap a race of <unk> parasitic monsters called the Eldrazi , which were inspired by H. P. Lovecraft 's Old Ones . Beginning with Zendikar the world @-@ centric storytelling was complemented by an overlying story layer . Planeswalker cards had been introduced in <unk> and these Planeswalker characters were used to give the overarching storyline a sense of continuity , despite the constant change of setting . The block following Zendikar , Scars of Mirrodin , revisited the plane of Mirrodin , where the <unk> natives battled against an invading <unk> corruption <unk> left by Karn ( again interconnecting various storylines ) . To further integrate the storyline into the gameplay , certain events for the second set , Mirrodin Besieged , encouraged players to affiliate themselves with either the <unk> or <unk> faction . Much of the recent focus has been on both integrating the play experience with the story line and on making mechanics and individual cards which represent pivotal points in the story . 
 On Innistrad , a plane inspired heavily by gothic horror , its guardian angel has gone missing . Darkness has started to consume the plane , and the players must discover that the <unk> , a magical prison , has been holding the archangel Avacyn as well as demons . Thalia , a <unk> of the Church of Avacyn , broke open the <unk> and released Avacyn as well as all of the demons . In the ′ ' Return to Ravnica block , players were encouraged to affiliate themselves with a guild and take control of the city of Ravnica by completing the maze discovered by <unk> - <unk> . <unk> was a plane inspired by Greek mythology , containing many references to Greek mythological figures such as Prometheus and the pantheon of gods . Tarkir was a plane where dragons were long since dead . Through time travel , dragons took over the plane and ruled its people . 
 Battle for Zendikar was a return to the plane of Zendikar , which had been ravaged by the Eldrazi horrors . This marks a change in Magic 's storytelling where it uses a team of planeswalkers , called the Gatewatch , to tell the story . Shadows Over Innistrad is a return to Innistrad , where Avacyn has been corrupted . 
 The newest set , Eldritch Moon , focuses on the fact that <unk> , the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline , is now on Innistrad . Together , the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane of Innistrad . This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad . 
 = = Academic research = = 
 There are several examples of academic , peer @-@ reviewed research concerning different aspects of Magic : The Gathering . One example examined how players use their imaginations when playing . This research studied hobby players and showed how players sought to create and participate in an epic fantasy narrative . Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types . A final example uses probability to examine Magic card @-@ collecting strategies . Using a specific set of cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic : The Gathering to be Turing complete . 
 = Gardermoen Line = 
 The Gardermoen Line ( Norwegian : Gardermobanen ) is a high @-@ speed railway line between Oslo and Eidsvoll , Norway , running past Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport , Gardermoen . The line is 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) long and replaced the older Hoved Line as the main line north @-@ east of Oslo . The older Hoved Line now handles commuter and freight traffic , while the Gardermoen Line handles high @-@ speed passenger trains and freight trains laden with jet fuel for the airport . Both lines are owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . 
 The line was opened in 1998 , at the same time as the airport that gave the line its name . It is used by the Flytoget airport express train service as well as express trains by Norges Statsbaner . It is the only high @-@ speed railway in the kingdom , with a maximum permitted speed of 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) . Most of the line between Oslo and Lillestrøm is through the 14 @,@ 580 @-@ metre ( 47 @,@ 830 ft ) long Romeriksporten tunnel — the longest railway tunnel in Norway . The decision to build the line was made in 1992 ; construction started two years later . The line was subjected to severe criticism during construction when the Romerike Tunnel sprung severe leaks due to hurried construction . As a result , the tunnel was opened a year after the rest of the line . 
 = = History = = 
 When the Parliament of Norway decided on 8 October 1992 to build a new central airport for Eastern Norway , they also decided that the main mode of ground transport to the airport should be by railway . While the previous airport , Oslo Airport , Fornebu , was located just outside the city limits ; the new Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , would be located some 50 kilometers north of the city , outside the reach of the existing public transport systems . The political agreement to build the airport stated that the costs of construction should not be borne by the tax payers . As a result , the entire airport was financed with money borrowed through Oslo Lufthavn AS , a subsidiary of the Norwegian Airport Administration . The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link . The Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) created the subsidiary , NSB Gardermobanen AS , on 24 November 1992 to perform the construction of the line . This company would be able to charge train operators using the railway line ; and could use this income to cover its down payments and interest on the debt created to pay for the infrastructure investment . It was planned to give a profit margin of 7 @.@ 5 % . 
 In 1996 NSB Gardermoen stated that they expected to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year to use the new line . County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to have to pay for the new railway . Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll , and that passengers would have different prices , depending on which route they followed . Stor @-@ Oslo Lokaltrafikk , which was responsible for buses in Akershus , stated that they had no way to influence NSB 's prices , but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route , which would not charge the surcharge . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Construction of the railway started on 1 August 1994 . Gardermoen is located about 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) north of Oslo , but is not located on the Hoved Line . A different right @-@ of @-@ way had to be chosen north of Kløfta . The Hoved Line has heavy traffic , with many small stops until Lillestrøm , and continues northwards from Lillestrøm as single track . Therefore , an all @-@ new railway would have to be built ; it would bypass the intermediate railway until Lillestrøm , running through a tunnel , and continue northwards to the airport and onwards to Eidsvoll . This northernmost part is 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) used to allow trains operating on the Dovre Line to Lillehammer and Trondheim to use the Gardermoen Line . 
 The Gardermoen Line was the second attempt to build a high @-@ speed railway in Norway . The first was the 35 km line from Ski to Moss on the Østfold Line . However , operational speeds in excess of 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) could not be achieved due to the short distances and limitations on rolling stock . The Gardermoen Line , therefore , became the first real high @-@ speed railway line in Norway . Due to the domination of single track in Norway , the 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) Gardermoen Line increased the total length of double track in the kingdom by more than 50 % . 
 The projected costs of the railway line were NOK 4 @.@ 3 billion ± 20 % . Total costs ended at NOK 7 @.@ 7 billion , including 1 @.@ 3 billion extra used on extraordinary expenditures on the Romeriksporten . On 1 October 1996 it was decided that the construction company , NSB Gardermobanen , would also become the operator of the airport express train . However , due to limited profitability with the company , from 1 January 2001 the ownership of Gardermobanen was transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration , who also owns the rest of railway lines in Norway . The operating company changed its name to Flytoget AS . 
 = = = Construction challenges = = = 
 The most challenging part of the construction was the 14 @,@ 580 metres ( 47 @,@ 830 ft ) railway tunnel from Etterstad , just east of Oslo S , to Lillestrøm . Romeriksporten is the longest railway tunnel in Norway , and is underneath the recreational area Østmarka , in geologically highly unstable ground . During the construction in 1997 , the water level in some of the lakes above the tunnel , including Lutvann and Nordre Puttjern , fell dramatically . After they were discovered on 3 February 1997 sanctions were initiated by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate requiring leakage prevention measures in the tunnel . At the worst , 3 @,@ 000 liters of water per minute leaked into the tunnel . 
 The substance Rhoca @-@ Gil was used to fix the leakages , but the substance failed to work properly . Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks , it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide . The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed the process of building the tunnel by one year ; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999 . Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company . Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995 , and were never taken seriously . About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel . An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK 500 million was used on fixing the leaks ; however , the report claimed this was , to a large extent , a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures . The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway . 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 When the new airport opened on 8 October 1998 , and the Flytoget airport express train service started operations with sixteen Type 71 multiple units . Trains had to use the old Hoved Line from Oslo S to Lillestrøm , but could use the new high @-@ speed line from Lillestrøm to Gardermoen . Regular operations using Romeriksporten started on 22 August 1999 . To be able to use the new Gardermoen Line infrastructure , Norges Statsbaner had to buy new trains capable of higher speeds . Twenty @-@ two locomotive designated El 18 , based on the Swiss <unk> 2000 , where delivered in 1996 . They are capable of speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour ( 120 mph ) . However , the B7 passenger carriages used are not permitted to operate at more than 150 kilometres per hour ( 93 mph ) . Full speed utilization of long @-@ distance trains is only possible with the Type 73 units that started operation on <unk> in 2000 . These trains are nearly identical to those used by the Flytoget airport express train company , and capable of 210 kilometres per hour ( 130 mph ) on the Gardermoen Line . They are equipped with tilting technology allowing quicker operation on the rest of the line to Trondheim . Other trains used on the line by NSB are only capable of 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) .

 Plans for an expansion of the high @-@ speed line to Hamar have been launched , but have not been incorporated into any specific plans . This suggestion would increase the length of the high @-@ speed rail north of Oslo with 62 kilometres ( 39 mi ) — almost a doubling . The project may or may not incorporate a further high @-@ speed line to Trondheim .

 The Flytoget airport express train service is the largest user of the Gardermoen Line , with six departures from Oslo Central to Oslo Airport per hour . The trains only use the line as far as Gardermoen , and not the northernmost sixteen kilometers . Service is provided using sixteen Type 71 three @-@ car units , which together transported 5 @.@ 4 million passengers in 2007 . Direct services to Oslo S take 19 minutes . Half of the services make an intermediate stop at Lillestrøm , and continue on past Oslo Central to Asker Station . Flytoget has a 34 % market share on ground transport to Oslo Airport . 
 = = = Norges Statsbaner = = = 
 NSB uses Gardermobanen for express and some regional trains north of Oslo . This includes five daily departures to Trondheim ( including one NSB Night Train ) . There are two regional services northbound along the railway , including the Type 70 service between Lillehammer and Vestfold , as well as Type 72 used between Eidsvoll and Kongsberg . Both these have one hour headway , and are only capable of 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) on the line due to limitations with the rolling stock . The southernmost part of the line is used by commuter trains heading to the Kongsvinger Line . These trains divert from the Gardermo Line at Lillestrøm . Also the commuter trains operating to Dal along the Hoved Line use the Gardermoen Line until Lillestrøm . 
 = = = Other services = = = 
 Because there is a parallel line , the Hoved Line running all the way from Oslo S to Eidsvoll , some trains can choose to use this line instead . This is primarily done by some commuter trains , as well as all freight trains . The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport , who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta . This service is provided by CargoNet . 
 The Swedish state railways , SJ also operate on the southern part of Gardermoen on their intercity services X 2000 . This was for some years provided by Linx , a joint venture between SJ and NSB , using X2 stock , but the company was later dissolved .

 = Stephen I of Hungary = 
 Stephen I , also known as King Saint Stephen ( Hungarian : Szent István király ; Latin : Sanctus Stephanus ; Slovak : Štefan I. or Štefan Veľký ; c . 975 – 15 August 1038 AD ) , was the last Grand Prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001 , and the first King of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038 . The year of his birth is uncertain , but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in Esztergom . At his birth , he was given the pagan name Vajk . The date of his baptism is unknown . He was the only son of Grand Prince Géza and his wife , Sarolt , who was descended from the prominent family of the <unk> . Although both of his parents were baptized , Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian . He married Gisela of Bavaria , a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty . 
 After succeeding his father in 997 , Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative , Koppány , who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors . He defeated Koppány mainly with the assistance of foreign knights , including Vecelin , Hont and Pázmány , but also with help from native lords . He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II . In a series of wars against semi @-@ independent tribes and chieftains — including the Black Hungarians and his uncle , Gyula the Younger — he unified the Carpathian Basin . He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II , Holy Roman Emperor , to withdraw from Hungary in 1030 . 
 Stephen established at least one archbishopric , six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries ; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire . He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs . His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials . Hungary , which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign , became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe and the Holy Land or Constantinople . 
 He survived all of his children . He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in his new basilica , built in Székesfehérvár and dedicated to the Holy Virgin . His death caused civil wars which lasted for decades . He was canonized by Pope Gregory VII , together with his son , Emeric , and Bishop Gerard of Csanád , in 1083 . Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories . In Hungary , his feast day ( celebrated on 20 August ) is also a public holiday commemorating the foundation of the state . 
 = = Early years ( c . 975 – 997 ) = = 
 Stephen 's birth date is uncertain because it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents . Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years : 967 , 969 and 975 . The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th @-@ century or early 12th @-@ century hagiographies and other Hungarian sources , which state that Stephen was " still an adolescent " in 997 , substantiate the reliability of the later year ( 975 ) . Stephen 's Lesser Legend adds that he was born in Esztergom , which implies that he was born after 972 because his father , Géza , Grand Prince of the Hungarians , chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year . Géza promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force , but never ceased worshipping pagan gods . Both his son 's Greater Legend and the nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg described Géza as a cruel monarch , suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords . 
 Hungarian chronicles agree that Stephen 's mother was Sarolt , daughter of Gyula , a Hungarian chieftain with jurisdiction either in Transylvania or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros . Many historians — including Pál Engel and Gyula Kristó — propose that her father was identical with " Gylas " , who had been baptized in Constantinople around 952 and " remained faithful to Christianity " , according to Byzantine chronicler John Skylitzes . However , this identification is not unanimously accepted ; historian György Györffy states that it was not Sarolt 's father , but his younger brother , who was baptized in the Byzantine capital . In contrast with all Hungarian sources , the Polish @-@ Hungarian Chronicle and later Polish sources state that Stephen 's mother was Adelhaid , an otherwise unknown sister of Duke Mieszko I of Poland , but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians . 
 Stephen was born as Vajk , a name derived from the Turkic word <unk> , meaning " hero " , " master " , " prince " or " rich " . Stephen 's Greater Legend narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop Adalbert of Prague , who stayed in Géza 's court several times between 983 and 994 . However , Saint Adalbert 's nearly contemporaneous Legend , written by Bruno of Querfurt , does not mention this event . Accordingly , the date of Stephen 's baptism is unknown : Györffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth , while Kristó proposes that he only received baptism just before his father 's death in 997 . 
 Stephen 's official hagiography , written by Bishop Hartvic and sanctioned by Pope Innocent III , narrates that he " was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art " in his childhood . This implies that he studied Latin , though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write . His two other late 11th @-@ century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies , stating only that he " was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince " . Kristó says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen 's physical training , including his participation in hunts and military actions . According to the Illuminated Chronicle , one of his tutors was a Count <unk> from Italy , who later founded a monastery in Tata . 
 According to Stephen 's legends , Grand Prince Géza convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen " ascended to the first stage of adolescence " , at the age of 14 or 15 . Géza nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince . Györffy also writes , without identifying his source , that Géza appointed his son to rule the " Nyitra <unk> " around that time . Slovak historians , including Ján Steinhübel and Ján Lukačka , accept Györffy 's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra ( now Nitra , Slovakia ) from around 995 . 
 Géza arranged Stephen 's marriage , to Gisela , daughter of Henry the Wrangler , Duke of Bavaria , in or after 995 . This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house , as Gisela was closely related to the Ottonian dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors . According to popular tradition preserved in the Scheyern Abbey in Bavaria , the ceremony took place at the Scheyern castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert . Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights , many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary , helping to strengthen Stephen 's military position . Györffy writes that Stephen and his wife " presumably " settled in Nyitra after their marriage . 
 = = Reign ( 997 – 1038 ) = = 
 = = = Grand Prince ( 997 – 1000 ) = = = 
 Grand Prince Géza died in 997 . Stephen convoked an assembly at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince . Initially , he only controlled the northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin ; the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains . Stephen 's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture , which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son . On the other hand , it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority , according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the Árpád dynasty , which was Koppány at that time . Koppány , who held the title Duke of <unk> , had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton . 
 Koppány proposed to Géza 's widow , Sarolt , in accordance with the pagan custom of levirate marriage . He also announced his claim to the throne . Although it is not impossible that Koppány had already been baptized , in 972 , most of his supporters were pagans , opponents of the Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue . A charter of 1002 for the Pannonhalma Archabbey writes of a war between " the Germans and the Hungarians " when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Koppány . Even so , Györffy says that <unk> ( " Alan " ) , Besenyő ( " Pecheneg " ) , <unk> and other place names , referring to ethnic groups or Hungarian tribes in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Koppány 's duchy , suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriors — who had been settled there by Grand Prince Géza — fought in Stephen 's army . 
 Kristó states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Koppány was only a feud between two members of the Árpád dynasty , with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders . Koppány and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia , took many of Stephen 's forts and plundered his lands . Stephen , who according to the Illuminated Chronicle " was for the first time girded with his sword " , placed the brothers Hont and Pázmány at the head of his own guard and nominated Vecelin to lead the royal army . The latter was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of Géza . Hont and Pázmány were , according to Simon of Kéza 's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum and the Illuminated Chronicle , " knights of Swabian origin " who settled in Hungary either under Géza or in the first years of Stephen 's reign . On the other hand , Lukačka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and Pázmány were " Slovak " noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra . 
 Koppány was besieging Veszprém when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen 's army . In the ensuing battle , Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies . Koppány was killed on the battlefield . His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom , Győr , Gyulafehérvár ( Alba Iulia , Romania ) and Veszprém in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch . 
 Stephen occupied Koppány 's duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans . He also prescribed that Koppány 's former subjects were to pay tithes to the Pannonhalma Archabbey , according to the deed of the foundation of this monastery which has been preserved in a manuscript containing interpolations . The same document declares that " there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary " at that time . On the other hand , the nearly contemporary Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg stated that Stephen " established bishoprics in his kingdom " before being crowned king . If the latter report is valid , the dioceses of Veszprém and Győr are the most probable candidates , according to historian Gábor Thoroczkay . 
 = = = Coronation ( 1000 – 1001 ) = = = 
 By ordering the display of one part of Koppány 's quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár , the seat of his maternal uncle , Gyula the Younger , Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords . He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king . However , the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate . 
 Thietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown " with the favour and urging " of Emperor Otto III ( r . 996 – 1002 ) , implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor 's suzerainty before his coronation . On the other hand , all of Stephen 's legends emphasize that he received his crown from Pope Sylvester II ( r . 999 – 1003 ) . Kristó and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies , which implies that both reports are valid : Stephen " received the crown and consecration " from the Pope , but not without the Emperor 's consent . Around 75 years after the coronation , Pope Gregory VII ( r . 1075 – 1085 ) , who claimed suzerainty over Hungary , declared that Stephen had " offered and devotedly surrendered " Hungary " to Saint Peter " ( that is to the Holy See ) . In a contrasting report , Stephen 's Greater Legend states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary . Modern historians — including Pál Engel , and Miklós Molnár — write that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty . For instance , none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors , which would have been the case if he had been their vassal . Furthermore , Stephen declared in the preamble to his First Book of Laws that he governed his realm " by the will of God " . 
 The exact date of Stephen 's coronation is unknown . According to later Hungarian tradition , he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium , which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001 . Details of Stephen 's coronation preserved in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony , which took place in Esztergom or Székesfehérvár followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings . Accordingly , Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony . Stephen 's portrait , preserved on his royal cloak from 1031 , shows that his crown , like the Holy Roman Emperor 's diadem , was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones . 
 Besides his crown , Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty . For instance , his first coins bear the inscription <unk> <unk> ( " the king 's spear " ) and depict an arm holding a spear with flag . According to the contemporaneous Adémar de Chabannes , a spear had been given to Stephen 's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of Géza 's right to " enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country " . Stephen is styled in various ways — Ungarorum rex ( " king of the Hungarians " ) , <unk> rex ( " king of the Pannonians " ) or <unk> rex ( " king of Hungary " ) — in his charters . 
 = = = Consolidation ( 1001 – c . 1009 ) = = = 
 Although Stephen 's power did not rely on his coronation , the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm " by the Grace of God " . All his legends testify that he established an archbishopric with its see in Esztergom shortly after his coronation . This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire . The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom , named Domokos , has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002 . According to historian Gábor Thoroczkay , Stephen also established the Diocese of Kalocsa in 1001 . Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom . Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague , including <unk> and Astrik , arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign . The presence of an unnamed " Archbishop of the Hungarians " at the synod of 1007 of Frankfurt and the consecration of an altar in Bamberg in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen 's prelates maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire . 
 The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen 's principal concerns throughout his reign . Although the Hungarians ' conversion had already begun in his father 's reign , it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals . His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity . For example , his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death . His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans , or regulated the status of serfs . 
 If someone has such a hardened heart — God forbid it to any Christian — that he does not want to confess his faults according to the counsel of a priest , he shall lie without any divine service and alms like an infidel . If his relatives and neighbors fail to summon the priest , and therefore he should die <unk> , prayers and alms should be offered , but his relatives shall wash away their negligence by fasting in accordance with the judgement of the priests . Those who die a sudden death shall be buried with all ecclesiastical honor ; for divine judgment is hidden from us and unknown . 
 Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen 's suzerainty even after his coronation . The new King first turned against his own uncle , Gyula the Younger , whose realm " was most wide and rich " , according to the Illuminated Chronicle . Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003 . The contemporary Annals of Hildesheim adds that Stephen converted his uncle 's " country to the Christian faith by force " after its conquest . Accordingly , historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period . If the identification , proposed by Kristó , Györffy and other Hungarian historians , of Gyula with one Prokui — who was Stephen 's uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburg — is valid , Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Boleslav the Brave , Duke of Poland ( r . 992 – 1025 ) . 
 [ Duke Boleslav the Brave 's ] territory included a certain burg , located near the border with the Hungarians . Its guardian was lord Prokui , an uncle of the Hungarian king . Both in the past and more recently , Prokui had been driven from his lands by the king and his wife had been taken captive . When he was unable to free her , his nephew arranged for her unconditional release , even though he was Prokui 's enemy . I have never heard of anyone who showed such restraint towards a defeated foe . Because of this , God repeatedly granted him victory , not only in the burg mentioned above , but in others as well . 
 About a hundred years later , the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav , stating that the latter " defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube " . Györffy says that the chronicler 's report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Morava — a tributary of the Danube — by the Poles in the 1010s . On the other hand , the Polish @-@ Hungarian Chronicle states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century . According to Steinhübel , the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030 . In contrast with the Slovak historian , Györffy writes that this late chronicle " in which one absurdity follows another " contradicts all facts known from 11th @-@ century sources . 
 The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that Stephen " led his army against Kean , Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified " following the occupation of Gyula 's country . According to a number of historians , including Zoltán <unk> and Gábor Thoroczkay , Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003 . Other historians , including Györffy , say that the chronicle 's report preserved the memory of Stephen 's campaign against Bulgaria in the late 1010s . 
 Likewise , the identification of the " Black Hungarians " — who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Adémar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen 's proselytizing policy — is uncertain . Györffy locates their lands to the east of the river Tisza ; while Thoroczkay says they live in the southern parts of Transdanubia . Bruno of Querfurt 's report of the Black Hungarians ' conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when " the first mission of Saint Peter " — a papal legate , Cardinal <unk> — arrived in Hungary . The latter attended the meeting in Győr where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established Bishopric of Pécs was issued on August 23 , 1009 . 
 The Diocese of Eger was also set up around 1009 . According to Thoroczkay , " it is very probable " that the bishopric 's establishment was connected with the conversion of the Kabars — an ethnic group of Khazar origin — and their chieftain . The head of the Kabars — who was either Samuel Aba or his father — married Stephen 's unnamed younger sister on this occasion . The Aba clan was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy . The reports by Anonymus , Simon of Kéza and other Hungarian chroniclers of the Bár @-@ Kalán , Csák and other 13th @-@ century noble families descending from Hungarian chieftains suggest that other native families were also involved in the process . 
 Stephen set up a territory @-@ based administrative system , establishing counties . Each county , headed by a royal official known as a count or ispán , was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress . Most fortresses were earthworks in this period , but the castles at Esztergom , Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone . Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization . The settlements developing around them , where markets were held on each Sunday , were important local economic centers . 
 = = = Wars with Poland and Bulgaria ( c . 1009 – 1018 ) = = = 
 Stephen 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Henry II , became King of Germany in 1002 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1013 . Their friendly relationship ensured that the western borders of Hungary experienced a period of peace in the first decades of the 11th century . Even when Henry II 's discontented brother , Bruno , sought refuge in Hungary in 1004 , Stephen preserved the peace with Germany and negotiated a settlement between his two brothers @-@ in @-@ law . Around 1009 , he gave his younger sister in marriage to Otto Orseolo , Doge of Venice ( r . 1008 – 1026 ) , a close ally of the Byzantine Emperor , Basil II ( r . 976 – 1025 ) , which suggests that Hungary 's relationship with the Byzantine Empire was also peaceful . On the other hand , the alliance between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire brought her into a war with Poland lasting from around 1014 until 1018 . The Poles occupied the Hungarian posts along the river Morava . Györffy and Kristó write that a Pecheneg incursion into Transylvania , the memory of which has been preserved in Stephen 's legends , also took place in this period , because the Pechenegs were close allies of the Polish duke 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Grand Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev ( r . 1015 – 1019 ) . 
 Poland and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the Peace of Bautzen in January 1018 . Later in the same year , 500 Hungarian horsemen accompanied Boleslav of Poland to Kiev , suggesting that Hungary had been included in the peace treaty . The historian Ferenc Makk says that the Peace of Bautzen obliged Boleslav to hand over all the territories he had occupied in the Morava valley to Stephen . According to Leodvin , the first known Bishop of Bihar ( r. c . 1050 – c . 1060 ) , Stephen allied with the Byzantines and led a military expedition to assist them against " barbarians " in the Balkan Peninsula . The Byzantine and Hungarian troops jointly took " Cesaries " which Györffy identifies as the present @-@ day town of Ohrid . Leodvin 's report suggests that Stephen joined the Byzantines in the war ending with their conquest of Bulgaria in 1018 . However , the exact date of his expedition is uncertain . Györffy argues that it was only in the last year of the war that Stephen led his troops against the Bulgarians . 
 = = = Domestic policies ( 1018 – 1024 ) = = = 
 Bishop Leodvin wrote that Stephen collected relics of a number of saints in " Cesaries " during his campaign in the Balkans , including Saint George and Saint Nicholas of Myra . He donated them to his new triple @-@ naved basilica dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Székesfehérvár , where he also set up a cathedral chapter and his new capital . His decision was influenced by the opening , in 1018 or 1019 , of a new pilgrimage route that bypassed his old capital , Esztergom . The new route connected Western Europe and the Holy Land through Hungary . Stephen often met the pilgrims , contributing to the spread of his fame throughout Europe . Abbot Odilo of Cluny , for example , wrote in a letter to Stephen that " those who have returned from the shrine of our Lord " testify to the king 's passion " towards the honour of our divine religion " . Stephen also established four hostels for pilgrims in Constantinople , Jerusalem , Ravenna and Rome . 
 [ Almost ] all those from Italy and Gaul who wished to go to the Sepulchre of the Lord at Jerusalem abandoned the usual route , which was by sea , making their way through the country of King Stephen . He made the road safe for everyone , welcomed as brothers all he saw and gave them enormous gifts . This action led many people , nobles and commoners , to go to Jerusalem . 
 In addition to pilgrims , merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe . Stephen 's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary , but were attacked by Hungarian border guards . The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace . Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s . Stephen 's silver dinars bearing the inscriptions <unk> REX ( " King Stephen " ) and <unk> <unk> ( " royal city " ) were popular in contemporary Europe , as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden . 
 Stephen convinced some pilgrims and merchants to settle in Hungary . Gerard , a Benedictine monk who arrived in Hungary from the Republic of Venice between 1020 and 1026 , initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land , but decided to stay in the country after his meeting with the king . Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteries — including the abbeys at Pécsvárad , <unk> and <unk> — in this period . 
 The Long Life of Saint Gerard mentions Stephen 's conflict with Ajtony , a chieftain in the region of the river Maros . Many historians date their clash to the end of the 1020s , although Györffy and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier . The conflict arose when Ajtony , who " had taken his power from the Greeks " , according to Saint Gerard 's legend , levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river . The king sent a large army led by Csanád against Ajtony , who was killed in battle . His lands were transformed into a Hungarian county and the king set up a new bishopric at Csanád ( Cenad , Romania ) , Ajtony 's former capital , which was renamed after the commander of the royal army . According to the Annales Posonienses , the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030 .

 Stephen 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Emperor Henry , died on 13 July 1024 . He was succeeded by a distant relative , Conrad II ( r . 1024 – 1039 ) , who adopted an offensive foreign policy . Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolo — the husband of Stephen 's sister — from Venice in 1026 . He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son , Henry , as their duke in 1027 , although Stephen 's son , Emeric had a strong claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother . Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors , Bishop Werner of Strasbourg , to Constantinople . In the autumn of 1027 , the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim , but Stephen , who had been informed of his actual purpose , refused to let him enter into his country . Conrad II 's biographer <unk> of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029 , causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries . 
 Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River Rába . However , according to the Annals of Niederalteich , the emperor , suffering from consequences of the scorched earth tactics used by the Hungarian army , returned to Germany " without an army and without achieving anything , because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at Vienna " . Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers Lajta and Fischa to Hungary in the summer of 1031 . 
 At this same time , dissensions arose between the Pannonian nation and the Bavarians , through the fault of the Bavarians . And , as a result , King [ Stephen ] of Hungary made many incursions and raids in the realm of the <unk> ( that is , of the Bavarians ) . Disturbed on this account Emperor Conrad came upon the Hungarians with a great army . But King [ Stephen ] , whose forces were entirely insufficient to meet the Emperor , relied solely on the guardianship of the Lord , which he sought with prayers and fasts proclaimed through his whole realm . Since the Emperor was not able to enter a kingdom so fortified with rivers and forests , he returned , after he had sufficiently avenged his injury with lootings and burnings on the borders of the kingdom ; and it was his wish at a more opportune time to complete the things he had begun . His son , King Henry , however , still a young boy entrusted to the care of <unk> , bishop of Freising , received a legation of King [ Stephen ] which asked for peace ; and solely with the counsel of the princes of the realm , and without his father 's knowledge , he granted the favor of reconciliation .

 Stephen 's biographer , Hartvic , narrates that the King , whose children died one by one in infancy , " restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son " , Emeric . However , Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031 . After the death of his son , the elderly King could never " fully regain his former health " , according to the Illuminated Chronicle . Kristó writes that the picture , which has been preserved in Stephen 's legends , of the king keeping the vigils and washing the feet of paupers , is connected with Stephen 's last years , following the death of his son . 
 Emeric 's death jeopardized his father 's achievements in establishing a Christian state , because Stephen 's cousin , Vazul — who had the strongest claim to succeed him — was suspected of an inclination towards paganism . According to the Annals of Altaich Stephen disregarded his cousin 's claim and nominated his sister 's son , the Venetian Peter Orseolo , as his heir . The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded , and his three sons , Levente , Andrew and Béla , were expelled from Hungary . Stephen 's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king 's life by members of his court . According to Kristó , the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act . That Vazul 's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources , including the Illuminated Chronicle . 
 In the view of some historians , provisions in Stephen 's Second Book of Laws on the " conspiracy against the king and the kingdom " imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul 's unsuccessful plot against Stephen . However , this view has not been universally accepted . Györffy states that the law book was issued , not after 1031 , but around 1009 . Likewise , the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated : according to Györffy , it was issued during Stephen 's reign , but Berend , <unk> and <unk> argue that it " might be a later addition " . 
 Stephen died on 15 August 1038 . He was buried in the basilica of Székesfehérvár . His reign was followed by a long period of civil wars , pagan uprisings and foreign invasions . The instability ended in 1077 when Ladislaus , a grandson of Vazul , ascended the throne . 
 = = Family = = 
 Stephen married Gisela , a daughter of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria , who was a nephew of Otto I , Holy Roman Emperor . Gisela 's mother was Gisela of Burgundy , a member of the Welf dynasty . Born around 985 , Gisela was younger than her husband , whom she survived . She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the <unk> Abbey in Passau in Bavaria around 1060 . 
 Although the Illuminated Chronicle states that Stephen " begot many sons " , only two of them , Otto and Emeric , are known by name . Otto , who was named after Otto III , seems to have been born before 1002 . He died as a child . 
 Emeric , who received the name of his maternal uncle , Emperor Henry II , was born around 1007 . His Legend from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage . According to Györffy , Emeric 's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II . His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul 's blinding and civil wars . 
 Be obedient to me , my son . You are a child , descendant of rich parents , living among soft pillows , who has been caressed and brought up in all kinds of comforts ; you have had a part neither in the troubles of the campaigns nor in the various attacks of the pagans in which almost my whole life has been worn away .

 Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary . His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin , in contrast to the Huns , Avars and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory . As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes , Stephen also gave his kingdom " forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule " . 
 His successors , including those descended from Vazul , were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen 's achievements . Although Vazul 's son , Andrew I of Hungary , secured the throne due to a pagan uprising , he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should " live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them " , according to the 14th @-@ century Illuminated Chronicle . In medieval Hungary , communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own " liberties " often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen . An example is a 1347 letter from the people of <unk> telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted " the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen " . 
 = = = Holy King = = = 
 Stephen 's cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors . However , there is no evidence that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization . For instance , the first member of the royal family to be named after him , Stephen II , was born in the early 12th century . 
 Stephen 's canonization was initiated by Vazul 's grandson , King Ladislaus I of Hungary , who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin , Solomon . According to Bishop Hartvic , the canonization was " decreed by apostolic letter , by order of the Roman see " , suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII . The ceremony started at Stephen 's tomb , where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying . Legend tells that Stephen 's coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at Visegrád . The opening of Stephen 's tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles , according to Stephen 's legends . Historian Kristó attributes the healings either to mass psychosis or deception . Stephen 's legends also say that his " balsam @-@ scented " remains were elevated from the coffin , which was filled with " rose @-@ colored water " , on 20 August . On the same day , Stephen 's son , Emeric , and the bishop of Csanád , Gerard , were also canonized . 
 Having completed the office of Vespers the third day , everyone expected the favors of divine mercy through the merit of the blessed man ; suddenly with Christ visiting his masses , the signs of miracles poured forth from heaven throughout the whole of the holy house . Their multitude , which that night were too many to count , brings to mind the answer from the Gospel which the Savior of the world confided to John , who asked through messengers whether he was the one who was to come : the blind see , the lame walk , the deaf hear , the lepers are cleansed , the crippled are set straight , the paralyzed are cured ... 
 Stephen 's first legend , the so @-@ called Greater Legend , was written between 1077 and 1083 . It provided an idealized portrait of the king , one who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary . However , Stephen 's Lesser Legend — composed around 1100 , under King Coloman — emphasized Stephen 's severity . A third legend , also composed during King Coloman 's reign by Bishop Hartvic , was based on the two existing legends . Sanctioned in 1201 by Pope Innocent III , Hartvic 's work served as Stephen 's official legend . Gábor Klaniczay wrote that Stephen 's legends " opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre " , suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers . Stephen was the first triumphant miles Christi ( " Christ 's soldier " ) among the canonized monarchs . He was also a " confessor king " , one who had not suffered martyrdom , whose cult was sanctioned , in contrast with earlier holy monarchs . 
 Stephen 's cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary . Initially , he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and Bamberg , in Bavaria , but his relics were also taken to Aachen , Cologne , Montecassino and Namur . Upon the liberation of Buda from the Ottoman Turks , Pope Innocent XI expanded King Saint Stephen 's cult to the entire Roman Catholic Church in 1686 , and declared 2 September his feast day . As the feast of Saint Joachim was moved , in 1969 , from 16 August , the day immediately following the day of Stephen 's death , Stephen 's feast was moved to that date . Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary , and regarded as the protector of kings , masons , stonecutters , stonemasons and bricklayers , and also of children suffering from severe illnesses . His canonization was recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in 2000 . In the calendar of the Hungarian Catholic Church , Stephen 's feast is observed on 20 August , the day on which his relics were translated . In addition , a separate feast day ( 30 May ) is dedicated to his " Holy Dexter " . 
 = = = Holy Dexter = = = 
 Stephen 's intact dexter , or right hand ( Hungarian : Szent <unk> ) , became the subject of a cult . A cleric named Mercurius stole it , but it was discovered on 30 May 1184 in Bihar County . The theft of sacred relics , or <unk> sacra , had by that time become a popular topic of saints ' biographies . Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen 's right hand in accordance with this tradition , referring to adventures and visions . An abbey erected in Bihar County ( now <unk> , Romania ) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter . 
 Why is it , brothers , that his other limbs having become disjointed and , his flesh having been reduced to dust , wholly separated , only the right hand , its skin and sinews adhering to the bones , preserved the beauty of wholeness ? I surmise that the inscrutability of divine judgement sought to proclaim by the extraordinary nature of this fact nothing less than that the work of love and alms surpasses the measure of all other virtues . ... The right hand of the blessed man was deservedly exempt from putrefaction , because always <unk> from the flower of kindness it was never empty from giving gifts to nourish the poor . 
 The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey , except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242 , when it was transferred to Ragusa ( now Dubrovnik , Croatia ) . The relic was then taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420 . Following the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid @-@ 16th century , it was guarded in many places , including Bosnia , Ragusa and Vienna . It was returned to Hungary in 1771 , when Queen Maria Theresa donated it to the cloister of the Sisters of Loreto in Buda . It was kept in Buda Castle 's St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944 , in a cave near Salzburg in 1944 and 1945 , and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda , between 1945 and 1950 . Finally , since 1950 , the Holy Dexter has been in St. Stephen 's Basilica in Budapest . An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938 , and continued until 1950 , when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government . It was resumed in 1988 . 
 = = = Admonitions = = = 
 According to Stephen 's Greater Legend , the king " himself compiled a book for his son on moral education " . This work , now known as Admonitions or De <unk> morum , was preserved in manuscripts written in the Late Middle Ages . Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric , most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th century . 
 The Admonitions argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith . Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates , but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong . One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the " pillars of his rule " , meaning the prelates , aristocrats , ispáns and warriors . 
 My dearest son , if you desire to honor the royal crown , I advise , I counsel , I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and Apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example for all those placed under you by God , and that all the clergy may rightly call you a man of true Christian profession . Failing to do this , you may be sure that you will not be called a Christian or a son of the Church . Indeed , in the royal palace , after the faith itself , the Church holds second place , first constituted and spread through the whole world by His members , the apostles and holy fathers , And though she always produced fresh offspring , nevertheless in certain places she is regarded as ancient . However , dearest son , even now in our kingdom the Church is proclaimed as young and newly planted ; and for that reason she needs more prudent and trustworthy guardians lest a benefit which the divine mercy bestowed on us undeservedly should be destroyed and annihilated through your idleness , indolence or neglect .

 King St Stephen has been a popular theme in Hungarian poetry since the end of the 13th century . The earliest poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians . Secular poetry , especially poems written for his feast day , followed a similar pattern , emphasizing Stephen 's role as the first king of Hungary . Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989 . 
 A popular hymn , still sung in the churches , was first recorded in the late 18th century . It hails King St. Stephen as " radiant star of Hungarians " . Ludwig van Beethoven composed his King Stephen Overture for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in Pest in 1812 . According to musician James M. Keller , " [ t ] he descending unisons that open the King Stephen Overture would seem to prefigure the opening of the Ninth Symphony ; ... [ a ] nd then a later theme , introduced by flutes and clarinets , seems almost to be a variation ... of the famous Ode " To Joy " melody of the Ninth Symphony 's finale " . Hungarian composer Ferenc Erkel named his last complete opera from 1885 , István király ( " King Stephen " ) , after him . In 1938 , Zoltán Kodály wrote a choral piece titled <unk> Szent István <unk> ( " Hymn to King Stephen " ) . In 1983 , Levente Szörényi and János Bródy composed a rock opera — István , a király ( " Stephen , the King " ) — about the early years of his reign . Seventeen years later , in 2000 , Szörényi composed a sequel called <unk> , <unk> ! ( " You , Sir " ) . 
 = Bembo = 
 Bembo is a 1929 serif typeface created by the British branch of the Monotype Corporation and most commonly used for body text . It is a member of the " old @-@ style " of serif fonts , with a regular or roman style based on a design cut around 1495 by Francesco Griffo for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius , sometimes generically called the " Aldine roman " . Bembo is named for Manutius 's first publication with it , a small 1496 book by the poet and cleric Pietro Bembo . The italic is based on work by Giovanni Antonio Tagliente , a calligrapher who worked as a printer the 1520s , after the time of Manutius and Griffo . 
 Monotype created Bembo during a period of renewed interest in the printing of the Italian Renaissance , under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison . It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius 's work , Poliphilus , whose reputation it largely eclipsed . Monotype also created a second , much more eccentric italic for it to the design of calligrapher Alfred Fairbank , which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo . 
 Since its creation , Bembo has enjoyed continuing popularity as an attractive , legible book typeface . Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books , the Everyman 's Library series , Oxford University Press , Cambridge University Press , the National Gallery , Yale University Press and Edward Tufte . Bembo has been released in versions for phototypesetting and in several revivals as digital fonts by Monotype and other companies . 
 = = History = = 
 The regular ( roman ) style of Bembo is based on Griffo 's typeface for Manutius . Griffo , sometimes called Francesco da Bologna ( of Bologna ) , was an engraver who created designs by cutting punches in steel . These were used as a master to stamp matrices , the moulds used to cast metal type . 
 Manutius at first printed works only in the Greek language . His first printing in the Latin alphabet , in February 1496 ( 1495 by the Venetian calendar ) , was a book entitled Petri Bembi de Aetna <unk> <unk> liber . This book , usually now called De Aetna , was a short 60 @-@ page text about a journey to Mount Etna , written by the young Italian humanist poet Pietro Bembo , later a Cardinal and secretary to Pope Leo X. 
 Griffo was the one of the first punchcutters to fully express the character of the humanist hand that contemporaries preferred for manuscripts of classics and literary texts , in distinction to the book hand humanists dismissed as a gothic hand or the everyday chancery hand . One of the main characteristics that distinguished Griffo 's work from most of the earlier " Venetian " tradition of roman type by Nicolas Jenson and others is the horizontal cross @-@ stroke of the " e " , although he was not the first to introduce this style . Modern font designer Robert Slimbach described Griffo 's work as a breakthrough leading to an " ideal balance of beauty and functionality " . The style is sometimes known as the " Aldine roman " after Manutius ' name . 
 In France , his work inspired many French printers and punchcutters such as Geoffroy Tory and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards , even though the typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499 . Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that this may have been due to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume , perhaps created as a small pilot project . De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters , perhaps as an experiment , which included a lower @-@ case p in the same style as the capital letter with a flat top . In 1499 , Griffo recut the capitals , changing the appearance of the typeface slightly . This version was used to print Manutius ' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili . 
 Griffo 's roman typeface , with several replacements of the capitals , continued to be used by Manutius 's company until the 1550s , when a refresh of its equipment brought in French typefaces which had been created by Garamond , Pierre <unk> and Robert Granjon under its influence . UCLA curators , who maintain a large collection of Manutius 's printing , have described this as a " wholesale change ... the press followed precedent ; popular in France , [ these ] types rapidly spread over western Europe " . Ultimately , old @-@ style fonts like all of these fell out of use with the arrival of the much more geometric Didone types of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . They returned to popularity later in the century , with the arrival of the Arts and Crafts movement . 
 In 1500 , Manutius released the first books printed using italic type , again designed by Griffo . This was originally not intended as a complementary design , as is used today , but rather as an alternative , more condensed typeface suitable for small volumes . 
 = = = Italic = = = 
 Bembo 's italic is not based directly on the work of Griffo , but on the work of calligrapher and handwriting teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente ( sometimes written <unk> ) . He published a writing manual , The True Art of Excellent Writing , in Venice in 1524 , after the time of Manutius and Griffo , with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy . ( Tagliente did not only publish on handwriting , but also self @-@ help guides on learning to read , arithmetic , embroidery and a book of model love letters . ) It too was imitated in France , with imitations appearing from 1528 onwards . Another influential italic type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi , also a calligrapher who became involved in printing . His almost upright italic design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth @-@ century font designs . 
 = = Monotype history = = 
 Monotype Bembo is one of the most famous revivals of the Aldine typeface of 1495 . It was created under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison by the design team at the Monotype factory in Salfords , Surrey , south of London . 
 Bembo 's development took place following a series of breakthroughs in printing technology which had occurred over the last fifty years without breaking from the use of metal type . <unk> engraving had allowed punches to be precisely machined from large plan drawings . This gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand @-@ carved out of steel at the exact size of the desired letter . It also allowed rapid development of a large range of sizes . In addition , hand printing had been superseded by the hot metal typesetting systems of the period , of which Monotype 's was one of the most popular ( in competition with that of Linotype 's ) . Both allowed metal type to be quickly cast under the control of a keyboard , eliminating the need to manually cast metal type and slot it into place into a printing press . With no need to keep type in stock , just the matrices used as moulds to cast the type , printers could use a wider range of fonts and there was increasing demand for varied typefaces . Artistically , meanwhile , the preference for using mechanical , geometric Didone fonts introduced in the eighteenth and nineteenth century was being displaced by a revival of interest in " old @-@ style " serif fonts developed before this , a change that has proved to be lasting . At the same time , hot metal typesetting had imposed new restrictions : in Monotype 's system ( while less restrictive than Linotype 's ) , in order to mechanically count the number of characters that could be fitted on a line , letters could only be certain widths , and care was needed to produce letters that looked harmonious in spite of this . 
 Morison was interested in the history of the 15th century Italian printing , and had discussed the topic with his correspondent , the Italian @-@ based German printer Giovanni <unk> , in correspondence with whom he wrote a series of letters discussing Bembo 's development . He described the Aldine roman as " inspired not by writing , but by engraving ; not script but sculpture . " The design was executed by the highly experienced drawing office team , led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz <unk> , both of whom Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry , but with a staff that was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area , before being machined into metal punches . 
 Monotype commissioned from the calligrapher Alfred Fairbank a nearly upright italic design based on the work of Arrighi , and considered using it as Bembo 's companion italic before deciding it was too eccentric for this purpose . Monotype created a more conventional design influenced by Tagliente 's typeface and sold Fairbank 's design as Bembo Condensed Italic . It was digitised as " Fairbank " in 2003 , and sold independently of Monotype 's Bembo digitisations . Morison wrote in his memoir that the Fairbank design " looked its best when given sole possession of the page " . Monotype 's publicity team described the italic as " fine , tranquil " in a 1931 showing , emphasising their desire to avoid a design that seemed too eccentric . 
 As was normal in metal type fonts of the period from Monotype and other companies , the font was drawn differently at different sizes by modifying Griffo 's original design , a quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points . Jonathan <unk> and Charles Bigelow have cited Bembo as an example of how such modifications were made , with looser spacing and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes , and a finer , more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Among Bembo 's more distinctive characteristics , the capital " Q " ' s tail starts from the glyph 's centre , the uppercase " J " has a slight hook and the sides of the " M " splay outwards slightly . Many lowercase letters show subtle , sinuous curves ; the termination of the arm of both the r and the e flare slightly upward and outward . The lowercase " c " and " e " push slightly forwards . Characters " h " , " m " , and " n " are not quite vertical on their right @-@ hand stems , with a subtle curve towards the left going down the stroke . In italic , the k has an elegantly curved stroke in the lower @-@ right and descenders on the p , q and y end with a flat horizontal stroke . In the 1950s , Monotype noted that its features included : " serifs fine slab , fine @-@ bracketed and in <unk> prolonged to right along baseline . " This meant that many of the serifs ( especially the horizontals , for example on the W ) are fine lines of quite uniform width , rather than forming an obvious curve leading into the main form of the letter . The ascenders reach above the cap height . 
 In metal type , Bembo includes two capital " R " s , one with a long , extended leg following Griffo , one with a more tucked @-@ in leg suitable for body text . 
 Bembo does not attempt to strictly copy all the features of Renaissance printing , instead blending them with a twentieth @-@ century sensibility and the expectations of contemporary design . An eccentricity of Griffo 's first De Aetna capitals was an asymmetrical M that does not seem to have a serif at top right . So odd it has been suggested it may have been the result of faulty casting of type , it was nonetheless often copied in French imitations by Garamond and his contemporaries . Monotype 's revival declined to follow this , although it was recreated for a British Museum exhibition catalogue . Monotype also did not copy the curving capital Y used by Manutius in the tradition of the Greek letter <unk> which had been used in some versions of Poliphilus and Blado , although not in the digitisation of Poliphilus . Nesbitt has described the capitals as " a composite design in the spirit of [ Griffo 's ] type " . 
 In the italic , the expansive ascenders of Tagliente 's type were shortened and the curl to the right replaced with more conventional serifs . Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower @-@ case , whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition . The bold ( Monotype 's invention , since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type ) is extremely solid , providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles , and Monotype also added lining ( upper @-@ case height ) figures as well as the text figures ( at lower @-@ case height ) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . Historian James Mosley suggests that the numerals of Bembo were based on those Monotype had already developed for the typeface Plantin .

 = = = Poliphilus and Blado = = = 
 Monotype had already designed two other types inspired by the same period of Italian printing and calligraphy , the roman Poliphilus and italic Blado ( both 1923 ) . Made more eccentric and irregular than the sleek lines of Bembo to evoke the feel of antique printing , these remained in Monotype 's catalogue and have been digitised , but are much less known today . Bembo can therefore be seen as an iteration of a preexisting design concept towards mass market appeal , taking the basic idea of the Griffo design and ( unlike Poliphilus ) updating its appearance to match the more sophisticated printing possible by the 1920s . Bembo 's original working name was " Poliphilus Modernised " . 
 Poliphilus is named after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili , one of Manutius 's most famous books in the Latin alphabet , which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but recut capitals ; it was made for a publisher who planned to create an English translation . Blado is named after the printer Antonio Blado , a colleague of Arrighi . Morison preferred Bembo 's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus . He nevertheless noted that he felt the eccentricity of the Blado italic was more interesting than the smoothness of that on Bembo , as has Mosley more recently . Unlike Bembo , both in metal featured a Greek @-@ influenced Y with a curving head , as in the original . 
 = = = Centaur = = = 
 Monotype licensed and released the font Centaur around the same time as Bembo . It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers . Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo , the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 ( the so @-@ called Venetian style ) . Like Bembo , its italic comes from the 1520s , being again loosely based on the work of Arrighi from around 1520 . Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure , something particularly true in its digital facsimile . Penguin often used it for headings and titles of ' classic ' editions , particularly its capitals and italic ; its lower @-@ case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes . 
 = = = Titling fonts = = = 
 Monotype created several titling designs based on Renaissance printing that could be considered complementary to Bembo : Bembo Titling ( based directly on Bembo 's capitals , but more delicate to suit a larger text size ) and the more geometric Felix Titling in 1934 , inspired by humanist capitals drawn by Felice Feliciano in 1463 . In the hot metal type era Monotype also issued a titling version of Centaur , which was often used by Penguin ; Monotype 's digitisations of Centaur do not include it .

Arrighi 's friend Gian Giorgio <unk> writes of Arrighi that " in calligraphy he has surpassed all other men of our age so [ he now does ] in print all that was formerly done with the pen , in his beautiful types he has gone beyond all other printers . " His contemporary Antonio Blado publishes in Rome in an italic apparently derived from Arrighi 's work .

 1926 Edward Johnston develops a font based on his italic calligraphy , but it remains obscure . 
 1926 Frederic Warde creates an italic based on the work of Arrighi . It is now almost always used as the companion italic of the font Centaur , but initially had an independent existence . 
 1928 – 29 Monotype develops and releases Bembo , based on the work of Griffo but much smoother in texture . After considering releasing an italic by Fairbank @-@ based the work of Arrighi , Monotype abandons the idea , making Bembo 's default italic on the Tagliente model .

 Bembo has been very popular in book publishing , particularly in Britain . It was also recommended by HMSO in its style guide for outsourced printing jobs . Cambridge University Press 's history describes Bembo as one of its most commonly used typefaces ; Morison was closely connected to Cambridge and his personal archive ( as well as much of Monotype 's ) went to the university after his death . 
 Among reviews of typefaces , writing in the anthology Typographic Specimens : The Great <unk> , Jeff Price commented that Bembo became noted for its ability to " provide a text that is extremely consistent in colour " , helping it to " remain one of the most popular book types since its release " . Modern font designer Nick Shinn has also commented , " Bembo has a sleek magnificence , born of high @-@ precision technology at the service of accomplished production skills , which honours the spirit of the original , and an exotic grace of line which <unk> most new designs made more ostensibly for the new technology . "

 = = = Monotype digitisations = = = 
 Monotype has released two separate digitisations named Bembo and more recently Bembo Book , as well as the more slender caps @-@ only display font Bembo Titling and the alternate italic design Fairbank . Bembo Book is considered to be superior by being thicker and more suitable for body text , as well as for offering the alternate shorter R for better @-@ spaced body text . 
 Monotype 's original , early digitisation of Bembo was widely seen as unsuccessful . Two main problems have been cited with it : it was much lighter in type colour than the original metal type , perhaps through failure to anticipate the reduced ink spread on modern printing equipment . In addition , the digital Bembo was based on the 9 pt metal drawings , creating a font with different proportions to the metal type in the point sizes at which Bembo was most often used in books . This made the proportions of the digital font appear wrong , failing to match the subtlety of the metal type and phototype , which was released in three different optical sizes for different print sizes . Future Monotype executive Akira Kobayashi commented : 
 " I got into a slight panic . None of the letters looked like Bembo ! For a moment I froze in front of the computer , thinking about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font . After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo . I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type , and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size . That was why the images of the characters did not overlap . I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size , but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement . I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap . Then I looked into the types used in Western offset @-@ litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use ... the types that were originally designed for hot @-@ metal often looked too light and feeble ... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected . " 
 While Bembo Book is considered the superior digitisation , the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights ( semi- and extra @-@ bold ) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting ; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread . Cross @-@ licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors , often at very low prices . As an example of this , <unk> obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation , using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo , upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternate characters . Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo , which had a more delicate and elegant design . 
 = = = Other Griffo @-@ inspired fonts = = = 
 A major professional competitor to Bembo is <unk> , created by Jovica <unk> and released by Linotype in 2014 . Intended as a unified serif design supporting Roman , Greek and a range of Cyrillic alphabets such as Serbian , it features a more calligraphic italic than Bembo with swash capitals and support for Greek ligatures . 
 A looser interpretation of the Griffo designs is Iowan Old Style , designed by John Downer and also released by Bitstream . With a larger x @-@ height ( taller lower @-@ case letters ) than the print @-@ oriented Bembo and influences of <unk> ( Downer 's former profession ) , it was intended to be particularly clear for reading at distance , in displays and in signage . It is a default font in Apple 's iBooks application . 
 Not explicitly influenced by Bembo but also influenced by Griffo is Minion by Slimbach . Released by Adobe , a 2008 survey ranked it as one of the most popular typefaces used in modern fine printing . 
 Besides designs with similar inspiration , a number of unofficial releases and digitisations of Bembo have been made in the phototypesetting and digital periods , reflecting the lack of effective intellectual property protection for typefaces . Several unofficial versions were released during the phototypesetting period under alternate names ; for example one unofficial phototypesetting version was named " <unk> " after the hat worn by Roman Catholic clergy , and another by Erhard Kaiser was created for the East German printing concern <unk> , outside the reach of Western intellectual property laws . In the digital period , Rubicon created a version named " Bentley " intended for small sizes and Bitstream made a version under the name of " Aldine 401 " . Its licensee <unk> later created a set of Cyrillic characters for this in 2008 . The name " Bembo " remains a Monotype trademark and may not be used to describe such clones .

 Two open @-@ source designs based on Bembo are Cardo and ET Book . The Cardo fonts , developed by David J. Perry for use in classical scholarship and also including Greek and Hebrew , are freely available under the SIL Open Font License . Unimpressed by the first Bembo digitisation , statistician and designer Edward Tufte commissioned an alternative digitisation for his books in a limited range of styles and languages , sometimes called ' ET Bembo ' . He released it publicly as an open @-@ source font named ' ET Book ' in September 2015 . 
 = = = Privately used fonts = = = 
 Heathrow and other British airports used a highly divergent adaptation of Bembo for many years . Designed by Shelley Winters and named BAA Bembo or BAA Sign , it was very bold with a high x @-@ height . 
 The National Gallery in London used Bembo , then its corporate font , as a plan for the carving of its name into its frontage . 
 The Yale face , developed by Matthew Carter as a corporate font for Yale University , is based on Griffo 's work ; Yale commissioned a custom font from Carter , a member of the university faculty , after being dissatisfied with digital versions of Bembo . Carter commented on the design that " John <unk> , the Yale University printer who initiated and ran the project , also liked the idea of an Aldine face ... Monotype Bembo had been used for University printing at an earlier time , so there was a useful precedent . " It is available exclusively to " Yale students , employees , and authorized contractors for use in Yale publications and communications . It may not be used for personal or business purposes , and it may not be distributed to non @-@ Yale personnel . " 
 In the pre @-@ digital period , IBM offered Aldine , a font inspired by Bembo , as a font for the IBM Composer . This was an ultra @-@ premium electric <unk> typewriter system , intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small @-@ scale printing projects , or for high @-@ quality office documents . Ultimately the system proved a transitional product , as it was displaced by cheaper phototypesetting , and then in the 1980s by word processors and general @-@ purpose computers . 
 = Action of 5 May 1794 = 
 The Action of 5 May 1794 was a minor naval engagement fought in the Indian Ocean during the French Revolutionary Wars . A British squadron had been blockading the French island of Isle de France ( now Mauritius ) since early in the year , and early on 5 May discovered two ships approaching their position . As the strange vessels came closer , they were recognised as the French frigate Duguay Trouin , which had been captured from the East India Company the year before , and a small brig . Making use of a favourable wind , the British squadron gave chase to the new arrivals , which fled . The chase was short , as Duguay Trouin was a poor sailor with many of the crew sick and unable to report for duty . The British frigate HMS Orpheus was the first to arrive , and soon completely disabled the French frigate , successfully raking the wallowing ship . After an hour and twenty minutes the French captain surrendered , Captain Henry Newcome of Orpheus taking over the captured ship and bringing his prize back to port in India . 
 = = Background = = 
 Britain joined the French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793 , but the news did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months . The immediate priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India , especially their main port of Pondicherry . Once the British had completed this operation at the end of August 1793 , the squadron returned to Europe . This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly exposed , and privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels , including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal , which three privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait . 
 Princess Royal was a well @-@ armed ship , carrying twenty @-@ six 12 @-@ pounder cannon and a number of smaller calibre guns on the maindeck . The French Navy immediately took her into service as the 34 @-@ gun frigate Duguay Trouin and attached her to the Isle de France squadron of the frigates Prudente and Cybèle , and the brig Vulcain under Captain Jean @-@ Marie Renaud . This force skirmished inconclusively with a squadron of East India Company ships in the Sunda Strait in January 1794 , before returning to Isle de France with the captured East Indiaman Pigot . 
 By the early spring of 1794 , three vessels had come out from Britain - 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Orpheus under Captain Henry Newcome , the 50 @-@ gun fifth rate HMS Centurion under Captain Samuel Osbourne , and the 44 @-@ gun HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham to replace Cornwallis 's squadron . These ships passed the French bases on Isle de France en route to India , and briefly blockaded the port with some success against French merchant vessels : Orpheus alone sent three officers and twenty men to India in captured merchant ships . The French too had ships at sea during this period , Duguay Trouin and Vulcain cruising together in the Indian Ocean during the spring before returning to Isle de France . 
 = = Battle = = 
 As the French vessels approached the island on 5 May they were sighted by lookouts on the British squadron . The British captains then waited for the French to get closer , launching a chase in the mid @-@ morning when they held the weather gage so that the wind was behind them . This allowed them to rapidly close with the French vessels whose efforts to escape were hampered by Duguay Trouin 's poor sailing qualities . At 11 : 45 , Orpheus was the first to reach the French frigate , firing on Duguay Trouin from long range . Within ten minutes the British ship had pulled closer to the former East Indiaman and although Duguay Trouin briefly returned fire , Orpheus was soon positioned across the starboard quarter of the French ship , allowing Newcome to pour raking fire into the Duguay Trouin without reply . 
 By 13 : 15 , Duguay Trouin was a battered wreck , with the hull significantly damaged , the bowsprit shot away and heavy casualties among the crew . With his ship unmanageable and Centurion and Resistance now 3 nautical miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) away and approaching rapidly , the French captain struck his colours and surrendered . The brig Vulcain had taken the opportunity to escape as Duguay Trouin and Orpheus fought and later reached Isle de France . Newcome lost one midshipman killed and one officer and eight men wounded in the exchange from a crew of 194 . Losses on Duguay Trouin were far more severe : the French ship recorded 21 men killed and 60 wounded from a nominal complement of 403 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Newcome initially took his prize to Mahé in the Seychelles , where he demanded fresh supplies , particularly water , for his prisoners . The French governors of the islands refused , and Newcome stormed and seized the town , taking all of the supplies and military stores . The wounded and sick prisoners were disembarked , and the contents of a small French brig were turned over to the inhabitants to replace the seized supplies . Newcome then returned to India with his prize , but the ship was not subsequently purchased by the Royal Navy . 
 Historical reaction to the battle has focused on the significantly stronger British position in the encounter , with three large regular warships pitted against a hastily converted merchant vessel with a significant proportion of the crew suffering from illness . Duguay @-@ Trouin was also weakly built and weakly armed : early estimates that the Duguay Trouin 's main battery mounted twenty @-@ six 18 @-@ pounder long guns were revised to 12 @-@ pounders with eight smaller cannon on the upper deck . The British blockade of Isle de France continued throughout the year , with Centurion engaged in an inconclusive action against a French squadron in October . Although Isle de France remained in French hands throughout the conflict , the Indian Ocean was largely under British control by 1796 .

 Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) and Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) have slushies thrown in their faces by other students , who want to take them down now that their high social status as football quarterback and head cheerleader has slipped because of Quinn 's pregnancy and their membership in the glee club . Puck 's ( Mark Salling ) mother ( Gina Hecht ) encourages him to date a Jewish girl , and he decides to court Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) . At first she excuses herself by saying she needs a strong male who can perform a solo . As a result , Puck sings " Sweet Caroline " as his first solo for the glee club , dedicating it to Rachel and sealing the relationship . The two ultimately break up as a result of Rachel 's feelings for Finn and Puck 's feelings for Quinn . 
 Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) falls in love with Rod Remington ( Bill A.

 Musical performances in " Mash @-@ Up " received mixed reviews . Joal Ryan for E !

Entertainment Weekly 's Michael Slezak criticized the " Bust A Move " performance , writing that Morrison gave a " pale imitation " of the Young M.C. original . He was slightly more positive regarding the " Thong Song " performance , feeling that Morrison had " a slightly less overwrought vocal than Sisqó " , and observed that Salling did " more than a serviceable job " on " Sweet Caroline " . Fellow Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson called Morrison 's performances " pretty impressive " , and MTV 's Aly Semigran also enjoyed them , writing : " We want more ! " . Goldman too was positive regarding Morrison 's performances , noting : " There is of course something completely dorky about seeing this guy perform these songs , but Morrison infuses Will with such enjoyment in what he 's doing , he completely sells it . " 
 Glee 's writers have also been praised for the episode 's comedic content ; one particular joke ( performed by Lynch as Sue ) was called an " instant classic " by television writer / producer Jane Espenson . According to Espenson : 
 " The beauty of the joke is that ... [ it ] <unk> you to get ahead of it , and then subverts your expectation . This is extremely hard to pull off because you have to make certain that the audience is going to get ahead of the joke , but you can 't be so obvious about it that you know they 're going to anticipate the switch @-@ up . This particular version is a thing of joy . I think a lot of what makes it work is the violence of the final image — you lose nothing of the force of the threat by not getting to any violence against the kitten . " 
 = The Unnatural ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " The Unnatural " is the 19th episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files , which first aired on April 25 , 1999 , on the Fox network . Written and directed by lead actor David Duchovny , the episode is unconnected to the wider mythology of The X @-@ Files , and functions as a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story . " The Unnatural " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 1 , and its first broadcast was watched by 16 @.@ 88 million people . The episode received positive reviews from critics , and was well @-@ liked by members of the cast and crew , including series creator Chris Carter and co @-@ star Gillian Anderson . 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called " X @-@ Files " . Mulder is a believer ; although the skeptical Scully was initially assigned to debunk his work , the two have developed a deep friendship . In this episode , Arthur Dales ( M. Emmet Walsh ) , the brother of a previously recurring retired FBI agent with the same name , tells Mulder the story of a black baseball player who played for the Roswell Grays in Roswell , New Mexico in 1947 under the pseudonym " Josh Exley " ( Jesse L. Martin ) . Exley was actually an alien with a love of baseball . Exley is later tracked down by the Alien Bounty Hunter ( Brian Thompson ) and executed for betraying his people . 
 Among other things , the episode was inspired by the history of baseball in Roswell , as well as the infamous 1947 Roswell Incident . Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny noticed him in a production of the musical Rent and an episode of Ally McBeal . Originally , Darren McGavin was cast as Arthur Dales , but after he suffered a stroke , he was replaced by Walsh . Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield , an all @-@ wood stadium located in Ontario , California . The episode has been critically examined for its use of literary motifs , its fairy tale @-@ like structure , and its themes concerning racism and alienation . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1947 , a mixed group of black and white men play baseball in Roswell , New Mexico . Suddenly , a group of Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) members arrive on horseback , seeking one of the players : Josh Exley ( Jesse L. Martin ) , a talented black baseball player . Men from the team fight back against the KKK , and when the mask of the clan 's leader is taken off , the leader is revealed to actually be an alien . 
 In 1999 , FBI agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) look through Roswell newspapers from the 1940s . Mulder spots an article showing a young Arthur Dales ( Frederic Lane ) — the original investigator of the X @-@ Files division who had previously appeared in the fifth season episode " Travelers " and the sixth season episode " Agua Mala " — Josh Exley , and the shape @-@ shifting Alien Bounty Hunter ( Brian Thompson ) who has assisted the show 's antagonists throughout the series . Mulder seeks out Dales in Washington D.C. but finds that he still lives in Florida . Instead , Mulder meets Dales 's brother ( M. Emmet Walsh ) , who is also named Arthur . 
 In flashback , Dales tells Mulder about first meeting Exley in 1947 . Dales ( portrayed as a young man by Frederic Lane ) , a member of the Roswell Police Department , has been assigned to protect a hesitant Exley . Dales travels with Exley and his teammates on their bus , and one night sees that the sleeping Exley is reflected in a window as an alien . The next day , during a game , Exley is hit by a pitch and starts making utterances in a strange language before returning to his senses . Afterwards , Dales notices that a mysterious green ooze appeared where Exley 's bleeding head had rested . 
 Dales decides to investigate Exley 's hometown of Macon , Georgia , and discovers that a boy with Exley 's name had vanished about five years previously . That night at the hotel , Dales hears noises from Exley 's hotel room and breaks in , only to find Exley in his true form as an alien . Exley tells Dales that he was forbidden from intermingling with the human race but fell in love with the game of baseball and remained on Earth . Meanwhile , the Alien Bounty Hunter , who has been pursuing the renegade alien ever since he deserted his alien heritage , takes Exley 's form and murders a scientist who is investigating the green ooze that Dales found . After learning of the attack , Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police , and Exley goes into hiding . 
 The narrative returns to the events at the start of the episode . The KKK leader is revealed as the Alien Bounty Hunter , who has arrived to assassinate Exley . The Bounty Hunter demands that Exley revert to his true form before he dies . Exley refuses and the Bounty Hunter then kills him . However , Exley miraculously bleeds red , human blood . Back in 1999 , Mulder invites Scully to hit baseballs with him on an empty field .

 = = = Conception and writing = = = 
 " The Unnatural " was the first episode of the series that Duchovny wrote by himself . He had previously co @-@ developed the stories for the second season episodes " Colony " and " Anasazi " - both with series creator Chris Carter , and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes " Avatar " and " Talitha Cumi " . As The X @-@ Files entered its sixth season , Duchovny decided that it was an appropriate time to try writing a full episode . Before then , he had felt that he did not have the skills necessary ; he said , " I didn 't have the surety , the confidence in my mind , that I could write a teleplay ... It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas . " In late 1998 , Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late @-@ season installment for the series . 
 While both Duchovny and Carter had wanted to write an episode about baseball for several years , Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for " The Unnatural " during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he read a newspaper report about Joe Bauman . Bauman was a baseball player who , despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season — at the time , a record for a professional player — never made it to the Major Leagues . Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman , who played for the Roswell Rockets , with the 1947 Roswell Incident , saying " I just made the association ... What if this guy was an alien ? and I just started working on that idea . " Duchovny later said that " these happy chronological coincidences " facilitated the development of the story . Duchovny worked on his idea alone , later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help . 
 Duchovny decided to make the lead guest character black and set the story before the integration of the baseball leagues , inspired by Jackie Robinson , the first black player who was accepted into the Major Leagues in the 1940s . After Duchovny finished his first draft , Carter added additional plot points , such as the inclusion of the Alien Bounty Hunter and retired FBI agent Arthur Dales . The episode title is a play on the novel and movie The Natural . The tagline that appears in the opening credits for this episode is " In the Big Inning " , which serves as a pun on the phrase , " In the beginning " .
