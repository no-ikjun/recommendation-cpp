 = = Transport = = 
 Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London , however the mayor 's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London . In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines , which now form the London Overground network , adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground , trams and buses . The public transport network is administered by Transport for London ( TfL ) and is one of the most extensive in the world . 
 The lines that formed the London Underground , as well as trams and buses , became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or London Transport was created . Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London , and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London . 
 = = = Aviation = = = 
 London is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world . Eight airports use the word London in their name , but most traffic passes through six of these . London Heathrow Airport , in Hillingdon , West London , is the busiest airport in the world for international traffic , and is the major hub of the nation 's flag carrier , British Airways . In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened . There were plans for a third runway and a sixth terminal ; however , these were cancelled by the Coalition Government on 12 May 2010 . 
 Similar traffic , with some cheap short @-@ haul flights , is also handled at Gatwick Airport , south of London in West Sussex . 
 Stansted Airport , north east of London in Essex , is a local UK hub and Luton Airport to the north of London in Bedfordshire , caters mostly for cheap short @-@ haul flights . London City Airport , the smallest and most central airport , in Newham , East London , is focused on business travellers , with a mixture of full service short @-@ haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic . London Southend Airport , east of London in Essex , is a smaller , regional airport that mainly caters for cheap short @-@ haul flights . 
 = = = Rail = = = 
 = = = = Underground and DLR = = = = 
 The London Underground , commonly referred to as the Tube , is the oldest and second longest metro system in the world . The system serves 270 stations and was formed from several private companies , including the world 's first underground electric line , the City and South London Railway . It dates from 1863 . 
 Over three million journeys are made every day on the Underground network , over 1 billion each year . An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability , including £ 6 @.@ 5 billion ( € 7 @.@ 7 billion ) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics . The Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) , which opened in 1987 , is a second , more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram @-@ type vehicles that serve the Docklands , Greenwich and Lewisham . 
 = = = = Suburban = = = = 
 There are 366 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above @-@ ground suburban railway network . South London , particularly , has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines . Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London , running into eighteen terminal stations , with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports . London has Britain 's busiest station by number of passengers – Waterloo , with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex ( which includes Waterloo East station ) each year . Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing . 
 With the need for more rail capacity in London , Crossrail is due to open in 2018 . It will be a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport . It is Europe 's biggest construction project , with a £ 15 billion projected cost . 
 = = = = Inter @-@ city and international = = = = 
 London is the centre of the National Rail network , with 70 percent of rail journeys starting or ending in London . Like suburban rail services , regional and inter @-@ city trains depart from several termini around the city centre , linking London with the rest of Britain including Birmingham , Brighton , Reading , Bristol , Cardiff , Derby , Exeter , Sheffield , Southampton , Leeds , Manchester , Cambridge , Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne , Edinburgh and Glasgow . 
 Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains , such as the Admiraal de <unk> to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels . The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network , allowing Eurostar services to begin . Since 2007 , high @-@ speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille , Paris , Brussels and European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel . The first high @-@ speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London . There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands , North West England , and Yorkshire . 
 = = = = Freight = = = = 
 Although rail freight levels are far down compared to their height , significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail ; chiefly building materials and landfill waste . As a major hub of the British railway network , London 's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions , such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports , and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield . 
 = = = Buses and trams = = = 
 London 's bus network is one of the largest in the world , running 24 hours a day , with about 8 @,@ 500 buses , more than 700 bus routes and around 19 @,@ 500 bus stops . In 2013 , the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per annum , more than the Underground . Around £ 850 million is taken in revenue each year . London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world and , from the 3rd quarter of 2007 , became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio @-@ visual announcements were introduced . The distinctive red double @-@ decker buses are an internationally recognised trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the Tube . 
 London has a modern tram network , known as Tramlink , centred on Croydon in South London . The network has 39 stops and four routes , and carried 28 million people in 2013 . Since June 2008 Transport for London has completely owned Tramlink , and it plans to spend £ <unk> by 2015 on maintenance , renewals , upgrades and capacity enhancements . 
 = = = Cable car = = = 
 London 's first and only cable car , known as the Emirates Air Line , opened in June 2012 . Crossing the River Thames , linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in the east of the city , the cable car is integrated with London 's Oyster Card ticketing system , although special fares are charged . Costing £ 60 million to build , it carries over 3 @,@ 500 passengers every day , although this is very much lower than its capacity . Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme , the cable car is sponsored in a 10 @-@ year deal by the airline Emirates .

 Cycling is an increasingly popular way to get around London . The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received . The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision . 
 = = = Port and river boats = = = 
 From being the largest port in the world , the Port of London is now only the second @-@ largest in the United Kingdom , handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year . Most of this actually passes through the Port of Tilbury , outside the boundary of Greater London . 
 London has frequent river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers . These run up to every 20 minutes between Embankment Pier and North Greenwich Pier . The Woolwich Ferry , with 2 @.@ 5 million passengers every year , is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads . Other operators run both commuter and tourist boat services in London . 
 = = = Roads = = = 
 Although the majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport , car travel is common in the suburbs . The inner ring road ( around the city centre ) , the North and South Circular roads ( in the suburbs ) , and the outer orbital motorway ( the M25 , outside the built @-@ up area ) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes — but very few motorways penetrate into inner London . A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city ( the Ringways Plan ) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s . The M25 is the longest ring @-@ road motorway in the world at 121 @.@ 5 mi ( 195 @.@ 5 km ) long . The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds , and Newcastle and Edinburgh . 
 London is notorious for its traffic congestion , with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country . The average speed of a car in the rush hour is 10 @.@ 6 mph ( 17 @.@ 1 km / h ) . 
 In 2003 , a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre . With a few exceptions , motorists are required to pay £ 10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London . Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass . London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20 @,@ 000 people , reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent , increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent , and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent . Over the course of several years , the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195 @,@ 000 to 125 @,@ 000 cars – a 35 @-@ per @-@ cent reduction of vehicles driven per day .

 = = Plot = = 
 After Edward Elric recovers his arm and leg and his brother Alphonse 's body , Edward is dragged from his homeworld through the Gate of Alchemy — the source of alchemical energy — to a parallel world of Earth in 1923 . The world is fundamentally governed by the laws of modern science instead of alchemy . When Edward arrives there , he discovers that he has been stripped of his alchemical powers and his newly restored arm and leg . 
 Two years later , in Munich , Germany , Edward researches rocketry with his friend Alfons Heiderich , a young man who resembles Alphonse , in the hopes of returning to his world . Edward rescues a troubled , persecuted Romani woman named Noah from being sold . Noah is taken in by Edward to live with him and Alfons , and begins having visions concerning Edward 's life in his world . The next day , Edward meets Fritz Lang , a Jewish film director resembling King Bradley , who persuades Edward into helping him hunt down a dragon he has been seeking for inspiration for his next film . The dragon , which turns out to be homunculus Envy , attacks Edward , but is then weakened and captured by members of the Thule Society . 
 The Thule Society , led by Karl Haushofer and <unk> Eckhart , use Envy and Edward 's kidnapped father Hohenheim as catalysts to open a portal to Edward 's world , believing it to be the utopia Shamballa after learning about it from Hohenheim . A number of armored soldiers are sent through the portal , only to emerge on the other side in the city of <unk> as mutated zombie @-@ like creatures . Alphonse , who had come to visit <unk> , fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their suits to aid him in combat . Meanwhile , Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal , returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse 's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body , increasing Edward 's determination to return to his world . 
 Alphonse is guided by the homunculus Wrath to the underground city beneath Amestris ' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy . There , they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony , who fights and mortally wounds Wrath . At Wrath 's insistence , Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate . Meanwhile , in Munich , the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward 's mind . Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society plans to use the weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution , and heads to stop them . Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted at the same time that Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath . With the Gate opened , Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world , where she gains the ability to use alchemy . However , she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City . Alfons launches Edward in a rocket @-@ powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down . 
 Edward appears in his world , reunited with Alphonse and their friend Winry Rockbell , who fits Edward with new automail limbs . The Amestris military manages to stop most of Eckhart 's soldiers with the help of Roy Mustang . Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors , which attack her and force her to retreat . Upon reappearing in her own world , Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from the Gate and killed by an officer out of alarm of her new , monstrous appearance . Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds , Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on that side , knowing he will be trapped on Earth forever . Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world 's side as per Edward 's request , however , Alphonse has Mustang seal the Gate and follows Edward to remain with his brother . Following Alfons ' funeral , the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah , intending to destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler 's attack and enjoy their new lives together on Earth .

Upon seizing leadership of the Thule Society and entering the other world , however , her lust for power and shallow understanding of alchemy cause her to gradually go mad with fear of her new surroundings and try to destroy Amestris 's capital of Central City . When she is forced back into her world , she is covered with shadow creatures from the Gate of Truth and takes on a fearsome appearance , leading her to be shot to death ( before returning to her lifeless human form ) by an officer resembling Maes Hughes .

 = = Production = = 
 Production of the film began shortly after the television series finishing its original broadcasting on Japanese channels , although pre @-@ production started during the show 's run in March 2004 . The film 's production was led by director Seiji Mizushima , who also had directed the series as well . Mizushima allowed a camera crew and interviewers into the show 's conference room at the Bones studios where he described how production went , as seen in a special feature on the DVD release of the film . The conference room was filled with every cut and drawing created for the show and movie , but it was eventually cleared out to make room for other projects . 
 The original draft of the film 's script was written by Sho Aikawa at a hundred pages long , making the film over three hours long . Mizushima and others had to cut a third of the script 's scenes out in order to make the film an appropriate length . Some scenes and characters were removed from the final cut , including a character named Steiner who could see auras , having a role similar to Noah 's . A scene which was cut involved characters Roy Mustang and Winry Rockbell meeting in front of the late Maes Hughes ' grave . By October 2004 , the script was completed and the pre @-@ check storyboards were produced . The pre @-@ check storyboards showed the movements of objects and characters in each shot along with the characters ' lines . Production on the proper storyboards began in November of the same year , but the schedule in producing the film was immensely busy , so the directors of the film split the storyboards into six sections , one for each of the directors to create . 
 The opening and ending scenes were drawn by Mizushima ; the scene involving the debut of the film 's villain was drawn by Soichi <unk> ; the middle section of the film was drawn by Shingo Kaneko ; Edward Elric 's return to his homeworld was drawn by Masahiro Ando ; action scenes were drawn by Shinji Aramaki ; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony was drawn by Yutaka Nakamura . Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards . The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel @-@ animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film . Seven hundred of the film 's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film 's release . 
 A trailer was produced for the film in December 2004 with Romi Park , the voice actor for Edward Elric , narrating it . Three posters were produced for the film , two teaser posters and a third for the release of the film . A " Fullmetal Festival " was held on December 26 , 2004 to celebrate the show and film . Most of the directors finished their assigned storyboards by February 2005 except Shingo Kaneko , who was taking longest due to the general slow process , but his storyboards were nevertheless impressive .

 Critical response to the film has generally been positive . Theron Martin from Anime News Network found Conqueror of Shamballa as a very entertaining film " as it has all of the action , flashy magic , comedy , snappy dialogue , drama , and intrigue that made the TV series so great . " The few negative points he found about the plot were lack of discussions of morality which were featured in the anime series and that " the writing and plotting just don 't feel as sharp as they were for the series . " He praised the additional content from the limited edition DVD as well as the English dub , but criticized the subtitles for having grammatical mistakes . Although Dani Moure from Mania Entertainment did not find the story to be very original , he still favored it due to its mix of themes , turning it into an entertaining film .

 It also received praise by IGN 's Jeremy Mullin , who gave it an overall 9 over 10 , having had good opinion of the graphics used during the film and how the film expands Fullmetal Alchemist 's story . The film was compared to The End of Evangelion due to how both titles expand their anime 's endings , resulting in a " proper ending " due to the characters ' development featured in the film . Mullin also liked the audio from Conqueror of Shamballa , but added that some of the English voice actors lacked accents . DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. also liked the film as he was " pleased to report that the story was handled nigh @-@ flawlessly . The inclusion of real world events helps ground the fact that Edward is in our world , but there was just something surreal about that after seeing it . " He found the film 's ending to be fitting for Fullmetal Alchemist and said it will be well received by fans from the series . While reviewing the special edition DVD , Douglass commented the extras featured in the DVD " are worth the price . " However , he also added that " some people just don 't care about the extras " and concluded that " this is a strong reissue that could have possibly been better , but is fine just the same . "

 No. 75 Wing was raised on 13 October 1943 at Garbutt in Townsville , Queensland , under the command of Wing Commander ( later Group Captain ) Edgar Bruce Courtney . On formation it had a staff of ten , including three officers . The wing was responsible for RAAF units at Horn Island , Thursday Island , and Higgins Field on Cape York Peninsula . An advance party departed Garbutt for Horn Island on 21 October , and the wing headquarters was fully established there six days later . The same month , No. 84 Squadron , based at Horn Island and recently converted from CAC Boomerangs to P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks , was transferred from the control of No. 72 Wing ( headquartered at Merauke , New Guinea ) to No. 75 Wing . 
 Other units at Horn Island included No. 28 Operational Base Unit , which had been located there since being formed in May 1942 ; No. 112 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters ( formerly No. 12 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters ) ; and a detachment of No. 7 Squadron ( headquartered at Townsville ) , operating Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance bombers .

No. 1 Repair and Salvage Unit was also headquartered at Higgins , but maintained a detachment on Thursday Island . No. 23 Air Stores Park , based on Thursday Island , was responsible for logistical support of No. 75 Wing units . 
 No. 84 Squadron had been responsible for air defence in the Torres Strait since arriving at Horn Island in April 1943 , and No. 7 Squadron for anti @-@ shipping duties . A Beaufort of No. 7 Squadron was credited with shooting down a Japanese " Jake " seaplane during a patrol west of Horn Island on 11 November .

 = Nassak Diamond = 
 The Nassak Diamond ( also known as the <unk> Diamond and the Eye of the Idol ) is a large , 43 @.@ 38 carats ( 8 @.@ 676 g ) diamond that originated as a larger 89 carat diamond in the 15th century in India . Found in the <unk> mine located in <unk> , Telangana , India , and originally cut in India , the diamond was the adornment in the <unk> Shiva Temple , near Nashik , in the state of Maharashtra , India from at least 1500 to 1817 . The British East India Company captured the diamond through the Third Anglo @-@ Maratha War and sold it to British jewellers Rundell and Bridge in 1818 . Rundell and Bridge recut the diamond in 1818 , after which it made its way into the handle of the 1st Marquess of Westminster 's dress sword . 
 The Nassak Diamond was imported into the United States in 1927 , and was considered one of the first 24 great diamonds of the world by 1930 . American jeweller Harry Winston acquired the Nassak Diamond in 1940 in Paris , France and recut it to its present flawless 43 @.@ 38 carats ( 8 @.@ 676 g ) emerald cut shape . Winston sold the diamond to a New York jewellery firm in 1942 . Mrs. William B. Leeds of New York received the gem in 1944 as a sixth anniversary present and wore it in a ring . The Nassak Diamond was last sold at an auction in New York in 1970 to Edward J. Hand , a 48 @-@ year @-@ old trucking firm executive from Greenwich , Connecticut . 
 = = History = = 
 The Nassak Diamond originated in the 15th century in India . Although the date of the original cutting is unknown , the original cutting was performed in India and had sacrificed everything to size while giving the diamond a form and appearance similar to that of the Koh @-@ i @-@ Noor diamond . From at least 1500 to 1817 , the Nassak Diamond adorned the Shivalinga in the <unk> Shiva Temple , near Nashik ( Nassak ) , India on the upper Godavari River . As priests worshiped Shiva , the diamond eventually acquired its name from its long @-@ term proximity to Nashik . 
 In 1817 , the British East India Company and the Maratha Empire in India began the Third Anglo @-@ Maratha War . During the Maratha war , the Nassak Diamond disappeared from the Shiva temple . The war ended in 1818 and the British East India Company was left decisively in control of most of India . 
 The Nassak Diamond quickly resurfaced in the possession of Baji Rao II the last independent Indian Peshwa Prince , who handed over the diamond to an English colonel named J. Briggs . In turn , Briggs delivered the diamond to Francis Rawdon @-@ Hastings , the 1st Marquess of Hastings who had conducted the military operations against the Peshwa . Rawdon @-@ Hastings delivered the diamond to the East India Company as part of the spoils of the Maratha war . The East India Company then sent the Nassak Diamond to England , to be sold on the London diamond market in 1818 . 
 At the London diamond market , the Nassak Diamond was presented as an approximately 89 carats ( 17 @.@ 8 g ) diamond of great purity " but of bad form , " having a somewhat pear @-@ shape . The diamond further was characterised as a " rudely faceted , lustreless mass . " Illustrations in Herbert <unk> 's book " Diamond Cuts in Historic Jewelry – 1381 to 1910 " show it as being a semi @-@ triangular <unk> cut with a plateau top , similar looking to the 115 @-@ carat Taj @-@ E @-@ Mah Diamond which resides in the Iranian Crown Jewels . Despite its appearance , the diamond was sold for about 3 @,@ 000 pounds ( equivalent today to £ 198 @,@ 000 ) to Rundell and Bridge , a British jewellery firm based in London . 
 Rundell and Bridge held onto the diamond for the next 13 years . During that time , the jewellery firm instructed its diamond cutter " to keep as closely as possible to the traces of the Hindu cutter , ' amending his defects , and accommodating the pattern to the exigencies of the subject matter . ' " The recut by Rundell and Bridge from 89 @.@ 75 carats ( 17 @,@ 950 mg ) to 78 @.@ 625 carats ( 15 @,@ 725 @.@ 0 mg ) resulted of a loss of no more than 10 percent of the original weight of the diamond . 
 In 1831 , Rundell and Bridge sold the diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7 @,@ 200 pounds ( today about £ 590 @,@ 000 ) . Six years later in 1837 , the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor , the 1st Marquess of Westminster . At one point , the Marquess mounted the diamond in the handle of his dress sword . In 1886 , the diamond was valued at between 30 @,@ 000 and 40 @,@ 000 pounds ( today between £ 2 @,@ 947 @,@ 000 and £ 3 @,@ 930 @,@ 000 ) , due in part to its vast gain in brilliancy from the re @-@ cut by Rundell and Bridge . 
 = = Mauboussin and the lawsuit = = 
 In 1922 , George Mauboussin had become the named partner of " Mauboussin , <unk> de <unk> , " a French jewellery house that traced its roots to its founding by M. Rocher in 1827 . In March 1927 , the Duke of Westminster used US importers Mayers , <unk> & <unk> to sell the diamond to Parisian jeweller George Mauboussin , who was living in the United States at the time . Mauboussin 's importation of the diamond into the United States was tax free , since the diamond was determined to be an artistic antiquity produced more than one hundred years prior to the date of importation . However , E. F. <unk> , an American wholesaler and dealer in diamonds and a rival of Mauboussin , filed a protest that resulted in a lawsuit to determine whether a tax should be imposed on the diamond 's entry into the United States . By November 1927 , Mauboussin considered selling the diamond to friends of General Primo de Rivera , who planned to give the diamond to the dictator on the occasion of his forthcoming investiture as marshal of Spain . That sale never materialised and the lawsuit continued . The diamond was nearly lost in a theft that occurred in January 1929 , when four gunmen robbed the Park Avenue jewellery store where the Nassak Diamond was being kept . However , the thieves missed finding the diamond because it was being stored in a soiled envelope . 
 After the first robbery attempt , Mauboussin 's jewellery firm opened a branch in New York City on 1 October 1929 , only to be met by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 at the end of October . To compound matters , the same gang of international robbers tried to steal the Nassak Diamond again in May 1930 , but once again missed it . 
 Prior to the outcome of the lawsuit , the insured diamond was valued between US $ 400 @,@ 000 and $ 500 @,@ 000 ( allowing for inflation , this would now be $ 5 @.@ 67 million and $ 7 @.@ 08 million ) . At the time the lawsuit was pending , imported diamonds that were cut and suitable for use in the manufacture of jewellery , without actually being set as jewellery were subject to an ad valorem tax of 20 % its value . However , artistic antiquities produced more than one hundred years prior to the date of importation could be imported into the United States duty @-@ free ; that is to say , without having to pay a 20 % tax . The final decision of the lawsuit was released on 4 June 1930 . In that decision , the court determined that the unset 78 @.@ 625 carats ( 15 @,@ 725 @.@ 0 mg ) Nassak Diamond was not an artistic antiquity and was suitable for use in manufacture of jewellery . In particular , the court said that the 1930 Nassak Diamond was nothing more than " a large diamond , cut in an ordinary way . " As a result , the importer owed an ad valorem tax of 20 % of the diamond 's value under US Tariff Act of 1922 . 
 = = Harry Winston 's influence = = 
 In 1930 , the Nassak Diamond had a somewhat elongated triangle form with rounded corners . The depth of one side of the triangle was thicker than the other . The diamond was " without flaw , unusually brilliant , and so cut as to well display its clear , crystal brilliancy . " While on exhibit at the 1933 World 's Fair in Chicago , Illinois , the " Official guide book of the fair , 1933 " described the diamond as a flawless , blue- white stone with a reputation of being " the finest diamond outside crown jewels collections . " 
 In 1940 , American jeweller Harry Winston acquired the Nassak Diamond in Paris , France and recut it to its present flawless 43 @.@ 38 carats ( 8 @.@ 676 g ) emerald cut shape . Winston sold the diamond to a New York jewellery firm in 1942 . In 1944 , Commander William Bateman Leeds , Jr . , millionaire son of the inventor of a tin plating process and friend of George Mauboussin , purchased the diamond for his wife , <unk> Olive Leeds ( born Olive Hamilton ) , and gave it to her in a set ring as a sixth anniversary present .

It features Snoop Dogg throughout the songs bridge and is built around a sample of the 1988 song " Piece of My Love , " originally performed by Guy and written by Teddy Riley , Aaron Hall , Timmy Gatling and Gene Griffin . Throughout the song , the protagonist reveals the struggles of dealing with insomnia and thoughts of a past relationship during the night , as she spirals out of control and declares " I gotta get me some sleep . " 
 The song was the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label Sony Music Entertainment , due to their lack of promotion of it as a commercial single . It , alongside its A @-@ side " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " were not eligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 , due to the charts rules at the time of their release .

After the first two singles from Rainbow were released , Carey was gearing up for a third single to be released . She intended for " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " to be the next single , as it held very personal lyrical content . However , after getting wind of her plan , Sony made it clear that the album needed a more up @-@ beat and urban track to warm airwaves . These different opinions led to a very public feud in between them , as Carey began posting messages on her webpage during early and mid @-@ 2000 , telling fans inside information on the scandal , as well as instructing them to request " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " on radio stations . One of the messages Carey left on her page read : 
 " Basically , a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive . It 's been really , really hard . I don 't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don 't know if they want you to hear this . I 'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people . But I am not willing to give up . " 
 Carey 's actions were given mixed reception , with critics and executives both commending her bold actions towards a song she felt needed to be heard , while others criticized her for publicizing the scandal further . Soon after , Sony involved themselves further , stripping Carey 's webpage of any messages and began trying to reach an agreement with her . Fearing to lose their label 's highest seller , and the best @-@ selling artist of the decade , Sony chose to release the song as a double A @-@ side with " Crybaby " . Carey , initially content with the agreement , soon found out that the song had only been allowed a very limited and low @-@ promotion release , not allowing the song to chart on the official US chart , and making international charting extremely difficult and unlikely .

 Critical reviews for " Crybaby " were generally positive . Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly called the song " sexy " and wrote " the rapper 's words tumble like dice across her velvety vocals . " Editor from Rolling Stone , Arion Berger , also complimented " Crybaby , " especially the way Snoop Dogg 's verses blended with Carey 's vocals . Berger called his rap verses " fittingly careless . " Robert Christgau , an editor from The Village Voice , commented that the song was " not real R & B thrush , " but wrote " its good enough to fake it . " While reviewing Rainbow , Dara Cook from MTV wrote that " Mariah amazes , " on the song also calling the collaboration " Snoop Dogg enhanced . " Cook wrote further " Perhaps culled from remnant Derek Jeter @-@ directed rage , a frenzied and fed @-@ up Mariah aggravates herself into a soulful , improvisational tizzy . "

 " Crybaby " was released as the third single from Rainbow in 2000 , as a double A @-@ side with " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " . " Can 't Take That Away " was emphasized at Top 40 Mainstream radio stations and " Crybaby " at mainstream urban stations . It was intended that the former would chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the latter would focus on the R & B charts . The songs had very limited airplay , and because Billboard magazine rules at that time stipulated that the song from a double A @-@ side with the most airplay ( in this case , " Crybaby " ) would be credited only , " Crybaby " was eligible to chart . Double A @-@ sided singles were credited together on the charts until 1998 , when the Hot 100 changed from a " singles " chart to a " songs " chart , and consequently every song was credited individually . " Crybaby " did not appear on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart . It debuted on the Hot 100 at number 28 only after its release as a commercial single , but its minimal airplay prevented it from ascending the Hot 100 . It remained in the top forty for two weeks and on the chart for just seven weeks , becoming Carey 's first single to miss the US top twenty . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The song 's music video was directed by Sanaa Hamri , who also directed the video for " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) . " Both videos were shot back to back , and were released simultaneously to music programs and channels for immediate circulation . The video begins with Carey lying in her bed , as she receives a text message from Snoop Dogg reading " Yo what 's happening ? What you crying for ? Now you know you look 2 damn good 2 be crying ... Come here ... Holla at a playa DPG style ... Ya know , " to which Carey responds " I can 't sleep . " As the video progresses as the lyrics continue , it appears to be 5 AM , and Carey is still unable to sleep . She lies in bed with the lamp on , pondering on thoughts of a past lover until she takes a bath . Afterwards , she makes her way to the kitchen , and begins pouring an abundant amount of cereal and milk into a bowl , spilling it over the counter in a restless rage . As the scene finishes , Snoop 's face is seen on a small monitor , directing his verse to Carey in the video . As the last chorus plays , Carey becomes restless and tosses a champagne glass and bottle at a large window , shattering it and sending glass around the living room . The video ends with Carey lying down on the couch one more , attempting to sleep once more .

 Carey performed " Crybaby " live during every show on the Rainbow World Tour . For the song 's performances , the stage was set with a large bed , pillows and <unk> , as well as a small desk and homely props . Carey , dressed in pajamas , sang while re @-@ enacting segments of the video . During her performance at Madison Square Garden on April 11 , 2000 , she threw the audience small stuffed bears and completed the song while lying in the bed on stage . After the song 's bridge , Snoop 's pre @-@ recorded verse was played over the background vocals . The song was also performed on select nights of The Elusive Chanteuse Show tour in 2014 .

 = Scotch Run ( Catawissa Creek ) = 
 Scotch Run is one of the main tributaries of Catawissa Creek in Columbia County , Pennsylvania , in the United States . It is approximately 7 @.@ 8 miles ( 12 @.@ 6 km ) long and flows through Beaver Township and Main Township . The stream 's watershed has an area of 9 @.@ 10 square miles ( 23 @.@ 6 km2 ) . The stream is infertile and acidic . It is 7 @.@ 2 feet ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) wide in its upper reaches and 17 @.@ 0 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) wide in its lower reaches . The main rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation , the Pocono Formation , the Pottsville Formation , and the Spechty Kopf Formation . The main soils include Leck Kill soil and Hazleton soil . It flows between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain . 
 Nearly all of Scotch Run 's length is within 1 @,@ 640 feet ( 500 m ) of a road . However , most of its length is not within 328 feet ( 100 m ) of one . Part of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 is in the watershed and ephemeral natural pool system is located near the stream . The area in the vicinity of the stream was settled relatively late compared to the surrounding areas . The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission carried out a survey of the creek in 1977 . Scotch Run is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery . In 1997 , three species of fish were observed in the upper reaches of the stream , while eight species were observed in the lower reaches . Both reaches contained brown trout and brook trout . There is a hemlock @-@ mixed hardwood palustrine forest along the stream . 
 = = Course = = 
 Scotch Run begins in a lake in a valley in eastern Beaver Township . It flows west and slightly south for several miles between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain . The stream eventually passes through the unincorporated community of Mifflin Cross Roads . Near this community , it turns south briefly before turning west @-@ southwest again and flowing between Nescopeck Mountain and Dry Ridge . A short distance later , the stream exits Beaver Township and enters Main Township . In Main Township , it flows between Nescopeck Mountain and Full Mill Hill for slightly more than half a mile . It then reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek . 
 Scotch Run joins Catawissa Creek 8 @.@ 30 miles ( 13 @.@ 36 km ) upstream of its mouth . 
 = = = Tributaries = = = 
 Scotch Run has no named tributaries . However , it does have one unnamed tributary , which is unofficially known as " Trib <unk> to Scotch Run " and enters the stream from the right . 
 = = Hydrology = = 
 Throughout its entire length , Scotch Run is infertile and acidic . It has the potential to be affected by acid precipitation . 
 In June 1997 , the air temperature in the vicinity of Scotch Run was measured to be 25 @.@ 0 ° C ( 77 @.@ 0 ° F ) at river mile 5 @.@ 1 , 24 @.@ 0 ° C ( 75 @.@ 2 ° F ) at river mile 1 @.@ 3 , and 25 @.@ 0 ° C ( 77 @.@ 0 ° F ) at its mouth . The water temperature of the stream at these locations was measured to be 15 @.@ 1 ° C ( 59 @.@ 2 ° F ) , 14 @.@ 7 ° C ( 58 @.@ 5 ° F ) , and 15 @.@ 0 ° C ( 59 @.@ 0 ° F ) , respectively . The specific conductance of the stream was 67 micro @-@ siemens at river mile 5 @.@ 1 and 51 micro @-@ siemens at river mile 1 @.@ 3 . It was 64 micro @-@ siemens at the stream 's mouth . 
 At river mile 5 @.@ 1 , the pH of the waters of Scotch Run is 6 @.@ 6 and at river mile 1 @.@ 3 , the pH is 7 @.@ 0 . At the stream 's mouth , the pH is 6 @.@ 8 . The concentration of alkalinity in the stream is 5 milligrams per liter at river mile 5 @.@ 1 and 8 milligrams per liter at river mile 1 @.@ 3 and at the mouth . At river mile 5 @.@ 1 , the level of water hardness in the stream is 23 milligrams per liter , while at river mile 1 @.@ 3 , the water hardness is 15 milligrams per liter . It is 18 milligrams per liter at the stream 's mouth . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 The elevation near the mouth of Scotch Run is 554 feet ( 169 m ) above sea level . The elevation of the stream 's source is between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 020 feet ( 300 and 310 m ) above sea level . Near its headwaters , the stream has a width of 7 @.@ 2 feet ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) . At this location , its gradient is 23 feet per mile ( 4 @.@ 4 m / km ) . However , further downstream , its width is 16 @.@ 9 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) . Its gradient at this location is 141 feet per mile ( 26 @.@ 7 m / km ) . 
 Scotch Run flows over rock of the Mauch Chunk Formation for its entire length . However , the headwaters of its unnamed tributary , " Trib <unk> to Scotch Run " are on rock of the Pocono Formation . The Spechty Kopf Formation occurs on the northernmost edge of the watershed and the Pottsville Formation occurs not far to the south of the stream . Mining land in various stages of reclamation also occurs to the south of the stream , on McCauley Mountain . 
 Scotch Run flows over Leck Kill soil , a deep and well @-@ drained fine loamy soil for its entire length . However , the northern and southern edges of the watershed are on Hazleton soil , a deep , loamy , siliceous , well @-@ drained soil . 
 Scotch Run flows through the Scotch Valley . The stream flows over the lowest point between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain . Scotch Valley is relatively narrow , but becomes somewhat wider downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads . A pond or small lake is located at the stream 's headwaters . A few patches of wetland on the National Wetlands Inventory are near the stream . It is flanked by a 100 year floodplain throughout its entire length . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The watershed of Scotch Run has an area of 9 @.@ 10 square miles ( 23 @.@ 6 km2 ) . The watershed is mostly in Beaver Township , but a portion of its lower reaches is in Main Township . The watershed 's northern edge is on the border between Beaver Township and Mifflin Township . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of <unk> . However , its source is in the quadrangle of Nuremberg . Part of it flows through Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 . 
 In its upper reaches , ( upstream of river mile 5 @.@ 1 ( river kilometer 8 @.@ 2 ) ) , 24 percent of the length of Scotch Run is within 328 feet ( 100 m ) of a road . A total of 71 percent is within 984 feet ( 300 m ) and 100 percent is within 1 @,@ 640 feet ( 500 m ) . Further downstream , between river mile 5 @.@ 1 ( river kilometer 8 @.@ 2 ) and the mouth , 23 percent of the stream is within 328 feet ( 100 m ) of a road , 57 percent is within 984 feet ( 300 m ) of a road , and 90 percent is within 1 @,@ 640 feet ( 500 m ) of one . In 1990 , the population density near its headwaters was 26 people per square mile ( 10 people per square kilometer ) . The population density further downstream was 41 people per square mile ( 16 people per square kilometer ) . The stream flows predominantly through rural areas . 
 In its upper reaches , most of Scotch Run is closed to public access . For this reason , a 1997 report stated that this section of the stream offered poor recreational opportunities . However , the report stated that the stream provided good recreational opportunities in its lower reaches . According to the report , both sections of the stream are poor sites for angling . 
 The upper reaches of the watershed of Scotch Run , upstream of Mifflin Cross Roads , are predominantly forested land . However , there are some residential areas near the headwaters of the stream . Downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads , the watershed contains both forested land and agricultural land . The forested land occurs primarily on the valley slopes , while the bottom of the valley contains a number of small farms . A road known as Scotch Valley Drive follows the stream 's general direction up valley of the stream . A road known as LR <unk> also runs alongside to the stream for some distance . 
 An ephemeral natural pool system is located in the vicinity of Scotch Run . In the past , a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it . In the 21st century , a small residential area and a number of roads are present near it . The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads . The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles . Additionally , the vernal pools may be used as breeding grounds for mosquitos . 
 The mouth of Scotch Run is near Mainville . 
 = = History = = 
 Scotch Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2 , 1979 . Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is <unk> . 
 Due to the topography of the area in the vicinity of Scotch Run , the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas . Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774 . Some time before 1820 , a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville . In 1820 , it started to be used as a school , which was run by Jacob <unk> . 
 The Sunbury Hazleton , and Wilkes @-@ Barre Railroad ( the later name of the Danville , Hazleton and Wilkes @-@ Barre Railroad ) , followed the bank of Scotch Run throughout its length . The stream was historically well known as a trout stream . 
 Scotch Run was surveyed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission prior to the 1990s . This survey was carried out by Daniels and others in 1977 . However , Graff also performed water chemistry samples at the stream 's mouth in 1966 . 
 Two bridges more than 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) long have been built over Scotch Run . The first is a steel girder bridge that was built in 1911 and is 26 @.@ 9 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) long . The second is a concrete culvert bridge that was built in 1974 and is also 26 @.@ 9 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) long . 
 = = Biology = = 
 The entire drainage basin of Scotch Run is designated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery . The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has stocked it with adult trout . The Black Creek <unk> Club and the Beaver Township Rod and Gun Club also stock the stream with trout . A 1997 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission discovered a small population of wild brook trout and hatchery brook trout in the stream . 
 In 1997 , brook trout , brown trout , and white suckers inhabited Scotch Run in its upper reaches . Two decades earlier , this part of the stream was also inhabited by pumpkinseeds and blacknose dace , but not by brown trout . The reason for the disappearance of the blacknose dace is unknown . The pumpkinseeds were only present in the 1970s due to their escape from nearby farm ponds . 
 The lower reaches of Scotch Run were inhabited by eight species of fish in 1997 : <unk> , brook trout , brown trout , blacknose dace , creek chubs , longnose dace , pumpkinseeds , white suckers . <unk> and longnose dace were not present in this part of the stream two decades earlier , but rainbow trout and golden shiners were present at that time . The rainbow trout disappeared from the stream because the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission stopped stocking them and the golden shiners were only present in the 1970s due to bait bucket introductions . 
 The total biomass of wild trout in Scotch Run in its upper reaches is 2 @.@ 98 kilograms per hectare . 2 @.@ 93 kilograms per hectare come from brook trout ( 2 @.@ 42 kilograms per hectare of which are less than 175 millimeters long and 0 @.@ 51 kilograms per hectare of which are more than 175 millimeters long ) . The remaining 0 @.@ 05 kilograms per hectare come from brown trout , all of which are less than 175 millimeters long . This segment of the stream contains 66 brook trout less than 175 millimeters long and 3 brook trout more than 175 millimeters long per kilometer . It contains only three brown trout per kilometer , all less than 175 millimeters long . There are 174 brook trout per hectare , 166 of which are less than 175 millimeters long and eight brown trout per hectare , all of which are less than 175 millimeters long . 
 The total biomass of wild trout in Scotch Run in its lower reaches is 4 @.@ 39 kilograms per hectare . All of the biomass comes from brook trout ( 3 @.@ 40 kilograms per hectare of which are less than 175 millimeters long and 0 @.@ 99 kilograms per hectare of which are more than 175 millimeters long ) . This segment of the stream contains 487 brook trout per kilometer , 480 of which are less than 175 millimeters long . There are 955 brook trout per hectare , 942 of which are less than 175 millimeters long . 
 Amphibians use the ephemeral natural pools on Scotch Run as a breeding ground . Amphibians inhabiting the vernal pools on the stream include spring peepers , spotted salamanders , and wood frogs . 
 A hemlock @-@ mixed hardwood palustrine forest is present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream . The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools . Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak , red oak , tulip poplar , yellow birch , eastern hemlock , American beech , and red maple . Other plants in the forest include teaberry , sphagnum moss , wood anemone , false hellebore , skunk cabbage , <unk> , and sensitive fern . 
 The Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory recommends establishing a riparian buffer around Scotch Run and discouraging further development and All Terrain Vehicle usage . 
 = Iowa archaeology = 
 The archaeology of Iowa is the study of the buried remains of human culture within the state of Iowa from the earliest prehistoric through the late historic periods . When the American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13 @,@ 000 years ago , they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape . By the time European explorers visited Iowa , American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic , social , and political systems . This transformation happened gradually . During the Archaic period ( 10 @,@ 500 – 2 @,@ 800 years ago ) American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems , slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased . More than 3 @,@ 000 years ago , during the Late Archaic period , American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants . The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on the reliance on agriculture and social complexity , with increased use of mounds , ceramics , and specialized subsistence . During the Late Prehistoric period ( beginning about AD 900 ) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements . The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval , with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders . During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state . 
 = = Iowa archaeologists = = 
 Archaeologists have studied the prehistory of Iowa since the mid @-@ 19th century , when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi . Early archaeologists such as <unk> <unk> and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks , mounds , and <unk> . Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with Charles R. Keyes and Ellison Orr ’ s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s . Documenting hundreds of sites , often just before they disappeared under the plow , Keyes ’ and Orr ’ s work led to the formation of the Iowa Archaeological Survey , the Iowa Archeological Society , and the designation of Effigy Mounds National Monument . After their deaths in 1951 , the Survey was disbanded , and their efforts were continued by the University of Iowa ’ s Department of Sociology and Anthropology , which formed the Office of the State Archaeologist ( OSA ) in 1959 . The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23 @,@ 000 recorded archaeological sites in Iowa , and conducts survey and excavation across the state . Other institutions conducting archaeological research in Iowa include the State Historical Society of Iowa , the Iowa Archeological Society , the University of Iowa , Iowa State University , Grinnell College , Luther College , and private archaeological firms . Professional archaeologists in Iowa are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists . Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of Cultural Resources Management legislation that required archaeological survey and excavation at many federal projects in Iowa . 
 = = Paleoindian ( 13 @,@ 500 – 10 @,@ 500 years ago ) = = 
 Paleoindian hunters and gatherers were the first occupants of Iowa , entering the state at the end of the Pleistocene glacial period . At the time the state was covered by tundra , conifer forests , and deciduous forests . Areas immediately north of Des Moines extending to Minnesota were covered by the receding Des Moines Lobe , a large glacier system . Highly mobile , their sites are scattered across Iowa and are noted for their large stone points . While <unk> were traditionally viewed as big game hunters , more recent research suggests much of their subsistence was derived from small game and wild plants . Paleoindian points are found throughout Iowa , but almost no intact Paleoindian sites have been excavated , probably because they were ephemeral and are now either destroyed by plowing or are very deeply buried in river valleys . 
 = = = Clovis and other Early Paleoindian = = = 
 The oldest artifacts found in Iowa are Clovis points , large lanceolate points found occasionally in all parts of the state except for the Des Moines Lobe . Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna , including mammoth , mastodon , and giant forms of bison , all of which are now extinct . While widespread , only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa . The <unk> @-@ Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County ; unfortunately , this site was damaged by plowing , although 20 points and point fragments were recovered . The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period , but these results have not yet been published . 
 Other Iowa Early Paleoindian points include Gainey , a point that appears to be intermediate between Clovis and Folsom . Gainey points were also recovered at <unk> @-@ Maske . While Folsom points are found throughout Iowa , especially western Iowa , none have been excavated in a well @-@ preserved site . 
 = = = Dalton and other Late Paleoindian = = = 
 At the beginning of the glacial @-@ free Holocene Epoch , humans in Iowa utilized projectile point found throughout the mid @-@ continent , including Dalton , Fayette , Agate Basin , and Hell Gap . Humans were still highly mobile , and by this time most of the Pleistocene megafauna had gone extinct . As with the Early Paleoindian period , no intact Late Paleoindian sites have been excavated in Iowa . 
 = = Archaic Period = = 
 The Archaic is the longest period of Iowa prehistory , lasting about 8 @,@ 000 years . Overall , populations appear to have increased in Iowa during the Archaic , despite a changing climate . During this time American Indians transitioned from highly mobile hunters and gatherers with large ranges towards a focus on local resources and ecosystems . Domesticated plants appeared in Iowa towards the end of the Archaic . 
 = = = Early Archaic ( 10 @,@ 500 – 7 @,@ 500 years ago ) = = = 
 During the Early Archaic period regional variation in point forms is seen in Iowa , and Indians adapted to more localized forms of hunting and gathering while probably maintaining seasonal movements from camp to camp . Common stone tool types are Corner @-@ notched St. Charles points and Thebes Knives . Soon Hardin and Kirk points appear in Iowa as well . Excavated Early Archaic sites in Iowa include the <unk> Site , Horizons IIIa and II of the Cherokee Sewer Site , and the Simonsen Site . 
 = = = Middle Archaic ( 7 @,@ 500 – 5 @,@ 000 years ago ) = = = 
 Temperatures rose in the mid @-@ continent during the Middle Archaic , a warming trend known as the Hypsithermal . Grasslands expanded east , forests became less common , and many Iowa lakes shrank or disappeared . Humans responded by diversifying their subsistence strategy : eastern Iowa saw a shift towards river resources , and western Iowa towards Plains resources . Excavated sites in eastern and central Iowa include the Brash Site , the Gast Spring Site , and the Ed ’ s Meadow Site . Western Iowa sites include the Turin Site , Horizon I of the Cherokee Sewer Site , and the Pony Creek Site . 
 = = = Late Archaic ( 5 @,@ 000 – 2 @,@ 800 years ago ) = = = 
 In the Late Archaic the climate became more similar to modern with the end of the Hypsithermal . The number of Late Archaic Sites increased in Iowa , perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies . The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa , as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants , and large , long @-@ term settlements . The Red <unk> Culture appeared in northeast Iowa , associated with copper artifacts and mound building . Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa , some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens , including squash , little barley , marsh elder , and barnyard grass . Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville , the Gast Spring Site , and the Sand Run Slough West Site . In western Iowa , Late Archaic sites are common , however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before , and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants . 
 = = Woodland Period = = 
 During the Woodland period , many American Indians in Iowa shifted away from hunting and gathering and used more domesticated plants , although wild food was still important . Ceramics , the bow and arrow , burial mounds , and evidence of political and social hierarchy became common at Woodland sites in Iowa . 
 = = = Early Woodland ( 800 BC – 200 BC ) = = = 
 The Early Woodland period saw the introduction of ceramics to Iowa , including Marion Thick and Black Sand types . Marion Thick may have originated with the nucleated Late Archaic cultures of the Upper Midwest , and was widespread in distribution . Early Woodland Indians in eastern Iowa built large burial mounds in the Mississippi River region , and participated in long @-@ distance trade of exotic raw material . This long @-@ distance trade may have been the forerunner of the later <unk> @-@ Hopewell trading sphere . In north @-@ central Iowa , Early Woodland peoples appear to have interacted more directly with the Prairie Lakes region of Minnesota . Numerous Early Woodland sites have been excavated in Iowa , including the Gast Spring Site , and many sites which have not been formally published . 
 = = = Middle Woodland ( 200 BC – 400 AD ) = = = 
 The Middle Woodland Indians of eastern Iowa participated at the edge of the Havana and Hopewell interaction networks . This cultural connection to the East is seen in the construction of large mounds , earthworks , and the trade of exotic goods over very long distances . There were several large earthwork enclosures in Iowa along the Mississippi that date to the Middle Woodland period , but none in the interior of the state , indicating Iowa is the western edge of Havana @-@ Hopewell influence . The <unk> Mound Group in Louisa County included a large octagonal earthen enclosure that covered several acres ; earthworks of this style are indicative of the monumental construction once seen in Havana , Illinois along the Illinois River and sites in the Ohio River drainage including Chillicothe and Newark , Ohio . Hopewell trading networks were quite extensive , with obsidian from the Yellowstone area , copper from Lake Superior , and shells from the Gulf Coast appearing in Middle Woodland Iowa sites . Sites in eastern Iowa appeared to nucleate , vacating much of the hinterlands . Western Iowa appears to have been not directly involved in this exchange network , and the Havana @-@ Hopewell flourishing did not extend much above the Kansas City area of the Missouri River . 
 = = = Late Woodland ( 400 – 1250 AD ) = = = 
 The Late Woodland Period was once considered to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods , but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity . Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites , but they are apparently more numerous . Gone are the complex earthworks and long @-@ distance trade networks , but this does not appear to be a cultural collapse , since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites . Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads , thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations , and the adaptation of new crops , including maize . Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa , based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration . Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common , some of these sites showing surprising complexity . The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter . Large storage and food processing pits , trash middens , and other features were excavated . Occupants utilized acorns , other nuts and fruits , goosefoot , little barley , <unk> , sunflower , fish , birds , deer , muskrat , and turtle . There was little evidence of long @-@ distance trade . The Rainbow and M.A.D. sites provide a glimpse into the Late Archaic of western Iowa . At Rainbow , a large house was excavated , showing evidence of reuse and possible joint occupation by two families . Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period , large groups of mounds appeared including the <unk> Mound Group , and the Fish Farm Mound Group . 
 = = = Effigy Mounds = = = 
 The Late Woodland in Iowa is perhaps best known for effigy mounds , large , low mounds shaped like animals such as birds and bears . Effigy mounds are distributed across southern Wisconsin , northern Illinois , and northeast Iowa . A large concentration of mounds in several groups is preserved at Effigy Mounds National Monument . Like most mounds in Iowa , excavation reveals that these mounds were commonly used as sacred burial locations but contain few artifacts . Recent ground @-@ penetrating radar survey of selected mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument reveal that many are badly disturbed , but others appear to be comparatively intact . The <unk> Mound Group in central Iowa contains an enigmatic cruciform mound that may or may not be astronomically aligned . 
 = = Late Prehistoric ( 900 – 1600 ) = = 
 Maize appears to have been the catalyst for change in the Late Prehistoric period in Iowa . While maize had been a minor crop in the Woodland Period , many archaeologists believe new varieties of maize were introduced to the region that produced higher yields , allowing for a population boom . This increase in population , combined with the potential for surplus and growing tensions over control of territory , appears to have led to large nucleated settlements throughout the eastern U.S. Although this manifested itself earliest along the Mississippi south of Iowa , the earliest Late Prehistoric cultures appeared in the western part of the state . 
 = = = Great Oasis ( ca . 900 – 1100 ) = = = 
 Great Oasis sites appeared in the Missouri River drainage , and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures . Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota . Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures , Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces , increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering , substantial pit earth lodges , and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms . Overall , Great Oasis appears to have been a regional adaptation of new forms of farming and settlement patterns , including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones , that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition . 
 = = = Mill Creek and Glenwood ( 1100 – 1300 ) = = = 
 In northwestern Iowa , Great Oasis underwent dramatic changes as Mill Creek sites appeared . While Mill Creek has many stylistic similarities with Great Oasis and some Mill Creek sites contain Great Oasis ceramic forms , Mill Creek sites are substantially different . Mill Creek sites became nucleated , often fortified , had a much higher dependence on maize and bison hunting , show substantial evidence of long @-@ distance trade , and appear to have been occupied year @-@ round . The Phipps and Chan @-@ Ya @-@ Ta sites are classic examples . Glenwood culture sites in southwest Iowa near the Missouri River appear to be unrelated to the earlier Great Oasis sites , and are notable for their large <unk> sites . Glenwood sites appear to have been more oriented in <unk> and trade with the Central Plains Tradition cultures to the west than with the Mississippian cultures to the southeast . Around 1300 AD Mill Creek and Glenwood sites in Iowa disappeared , replaced by the rapidly spreading Oneota cultures . 
 = = = Oneota ( 1250 – 1700 ) = = = 
 Very large Mississippian centers appeared around AD 1000 , with enormous earthen pyramids , palisades , and extreme social hierarchy . The earliest large Mississippian center was Cahokia , east of St. Louis . Cahokia appears to have dominated trade in the upper Mississippi , with satellite or closely aligned settlements as far as <unk> in Wisconsin . In Iowa , there is little evidence of Mississippian occupation , and the Late Woodland lasts longer in the east than in the west . This is puzzling , given the proximity to Mississippian cultures ; it is possible that the nearby presence of the large , hierarchal Mississippian trading network inhibited local development . After the decline of the Cahokia network after AD 1250 the local Late Woodland populations expanded in complexity , developing large nucleated villages and their own trading network , known as Oneota . Oneota , named by Charles Keyes for a river in northeast Iowa , was a large cultural manifestation that covered the Upper Midwest at the edge of the Mississippian cultures . Oneota sites are easily identifiable by the globular , shell tempered pots , which typically have strap handles and incised designs . Pots of this kind were well designed for the cooking of porridge and foods made from the various cultivated foods of the area . Important Oneota sites in Iowa include Kingston , <unk> , Christenson , Blood Run , Hartley Fort , the Lane Enclosure , three sites in downtown Des Moines , and sites along the Upper Iowa River , including several large earthwork enclosures . After the decline of the Mill Creek and Glenwood cultures in western Iowa , Oneota cultures appeared across the state . It is widely accepted that the Oneota were the ancestors of modern American Indian tribes associated with Iowa , including the <unk> , Ho @-@ Chunk ( Winnebago ) , Otoe , Missouria , and Omaha . 
 = = Protohistoric ( 1600 – 1800 ) = = 
 Protohistoric refers to the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large population shifts occurred because of introduced European diseases and warfare , but there is very little direct written documentation . Explorers such as Marquette and Joliet occasionally documented American Indians along the Mississippi in Iowa , but it was not until the early 19th century that regular written accounts of American Indians in Iowa became common . American Indians in the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture , but soon almost all indigenous technology disappeared , including ceramics and stone tool production . It was during this period that the Meskwaki ( Fox ) and Sauk appeared in eastern Iowa , displaced from their homelands in the east . Important <unk> sites include Milford ; Blood Run ; Gillett Grove ; and <unk> . 
 = = Historical ( 1800 – present ) = = 
 The earliest European forts and settlements were established by traders beginning in the 1680s . Almost none of these ephemeral early historical sites have been located archaeologically . Julien Dubuque ’ s Mines of Spain settlement and adjacent Meskwaki village occupied in the late 18th century and early 19th century , has been the subject of numerous archaeological surveys . Fort Madison ( 1808 – 1813 ) , the first American settlement and the first American fort in Iowa , was partially excavated in 1965 . American settlement began in earnest in the 1830s , and the official removal of American Indians from Iowa was completed by 1852 . Several of these historical sites have been excavated , including Gilbert ’ s Trading <unk> and Fort Atkinson . Archaeologists have also studied historical American settlements , including excavations at the Plum Grove Historic House , the Buxton African @-@ American community , and the Bowen ’ s Prairie community .

 " ' The Curse of Frank Black " is the sixth episode of the second season of the crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on October 31 , 1997 . The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by Ralph Hemecker . " The Curse of Frank Black " featured a guest appearance from Dean Winters . 
 Millennium centers on offender profiler Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) , who investigates unusual crimes as part of the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group . In this episode , Black tries to spend Halloween with his daughter , but is continually reminded of a figure from his past . 
 " The Curse of Frank Black " , which was inspired by the 1964 Japanese horror film Kwaidan , has received positive reviews from critics , with its minimalist plot being seen as its main strength . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On Halloween , Millennium Group member Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) is carving a jack @-@ o ' -lantern while preparing to take his daughter Jordan ( Brittany Tiplady ) trick @-@ or @-@ treating . As he leaves to collect her , he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street . That night , Jordan deliberately passes by one house , telling Black that it is haunted . Black tells her there are no such thing as ghosts , but is reminded of a moment from his past . In a flashback , we see a five @-@ year @-@ old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house ; a man named Crocell ( Dean Winters ) answers and invites Black inside . Crocell is a Second World War veteran , and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black , telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living . Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war , and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts . 
 After bringing Jordan back to her mother , Catherine ( Megan Gallagher ) , Black is driving home when he notices several youths egging a house — the house he once shared with Catherine and Jordan , and in which his friend Bob Bletcher was killed . He goes inside , and overhears several teenagers gathered in the basement trying to scare each other with the story of Bletcher 's murder . Black interrupts , scaring off the youths — and is again reminded of his past , recalling his reaction when Crocell was found to have committed suicide . As Black leaves the house , he picks up an egg carton discarded by the fleeing teenagers and throws the remaining eggs at the walls . 
 When Black arrives home , he leafs through the day 's mail , finally noticing that the numbers " 268 " and the letters " ACT " have been appearing to him throughout the day , including Crocell 's door number being 268 . Black takes these coincidences to be pointing him towards a Bible verse , Acts of the Apostles 26 : 8 — " why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead ? " . Black then hears something moving in his attic , and investigates . He discovers Crocell 's ghost , who claims to have been sent back to warn Black that he should abandon his work with the Millennium Group , and return to live with his wife and child instead . Crocell warns that Black will end up as lonely as he did , but when Black dismisses this , the spirit vanishes . The following day , Black returns to his old house to clean up where it was egged . As he cleans , he momentarily glimpses the same demonic figure as the day before , but he ignores it and continue his work .

 " The Curse of Frank Black " was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by Ralph Hemecker . Hemecker had previously helmed the first season episode " The Well @-@ Worn Lock " , and a further three in the third season . He would return for the third season episode " Exegesis " . Morgan and Wong had previously collaborated to write several episodes of the first season . The duo would go on to pen a number of episodes over the course of the second season , having taken the roles of co @-@ executive producers for the season . 
 Morgan and Wong 's script for the episode was influenced by the 1964 Japanese horror film Kwaidan and features very little dialogue . Morgan felt that Henriksen was the right actor for such a script , describing him as " so great with looks " . Morgan also credited Hemecker with " a lot of the episode 's tone " , finding the director 's work to have been " beautiful " . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " The Curse of Frank Black " was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 31 , 1997 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 7 during its original broadcast , meaning that 5 @.@ 7 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented approximately 5 @.@ 59 million households , and left the episode the eighty @-@ fourth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 The episode received positive reviews from critics . The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen rated the episode an A , calling it " the best episode of Millennium yet , by a long chalk " . Handlen felt that the episode effectively scaled the series ' grandiose apocalyptic tone down to one man 's struggle , making both the series and Frank Black more understandable to viewers . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 4 out of 5 , " moody , <unk> " and " truly creepy " . Gibron also felt that the episode 's structure , based on " hidden hints and secret connections " , foreshadowed Morgan and Wong 's later work on the film Final Destination . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " The Curse of Frank Black " five stars out of five , feeling that " it 's simple , and it 's brave , and it 's curiously moving " . Shearman felt that the episode 's minimalism — its paucity of dialogue and music — was key to its tone , and praised Henriksen 's expressiveness for helping to shape this .

 No. 81 Wing is the wing responsible for operating the McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornet multi @-@ role fighters of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales , the wing comprises three combat units , Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown and No. 75 Squadron based at RAAF Base Tindal , Northern Territory , as well as an operational conversion unit at Williamtown . No. 81 Wing headquarters oversees squadron training in air @-@ to @-@ air combat , air @-@ to @-@ ground tactics , and support for the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy . Tasked with offensive and defensive counter @-@ air operations , the Hornets have been deployed to Diego Garcia in 2001 – 02 , when they provided local air defence , and to Iraq in 2003 , when they saw action flying fighter escort and close air support missions in concert with Coalition forces . They have also been employed to patrol high @-@ profile events in Australia , including the Commonwealth Games and visits by foreign dignitaries , and acted as contingency support for peacekeeping operations in East Timor in 1999 – 2000 . 
 Formed in April 1944 , No. 81 Wing comprised three flying units , Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons , operating P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighters in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II . Following the end of hostilities , the wing converted to P @-@ 51 Mustangs and was based in Japan as part of the Allied occupational forces ; it disbanded there in November 1948 .

The Sabres were deployed to RAAF Base Darwin , Northern Territory , in 1964 to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces during the Konfrontasi with Malaysia . No. 81 Wing converted to Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighters before disbanding in December 1966 . It was re @-@ formed again at Williamtown in February 1987 , to operate the Hornet . The wing also controlled Nos. 25 ( later 79 ) and 76 Squadrons , flying Macchi lead @-@ in fighters , until they were transferred to No. 78 Wing in 2000 .

 Established at Ballarat , Victoria , on 12 April 1944 , No. 81 Wing operated P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighters in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II . Group Captain Gordon Steege set up headquarters on Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands on 30 August . Comprising Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons , the formation joined Nos. 77 and 78 Wings on Noemfoor as part of No. 10 Operational Group in September 1944 . No. 10 Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force ( No. 1 TAF ) in October . The same month , No. 81 Wing undertook offensive sweeps and ground attacks against targets in West Papua . In November , Nos. 77 and 82 Squadrons dive bombed Japanese airfields on Halmahera . The wing flew 1 @,@ 125 sorties in October and November , dropping over 400 @,@ 000 pounds ( 180 @,@ 000 kg ) of bombs , for the loss of 15 aircraft and 11 pilots . The relegation of No. 1 TAF to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale . In December 1944 , No. 81 Wing 's new commander , Group Captain Wilfred Arthur , produced a " balance sheet " to demonstrate that the formation 's combat results were not worth the cost in ordnance and casualties , setting in train events that would culminate in the so @-@ called " Morotai Mutiny " the following year . 
 By January 1945 , the number of missions flown by No. 81 Wing had dropped to less than 400 , from over 1 @,@ 000 the previous month . In March , the Kittyhawks carried out some 80 patrols around Noemfoor but encountered enemy activity on less than half of these . The wing was slated to take part in Operation Oboe One , the invasion of Tarakan , in May 1945 but was unable to move in time from Noemfoor to its new base on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies ; only No. 76 Squadron played any part in the battle , undertaking patrols and convoy escort . The following month , No. 81 Wing flew close support missions for the Australian 9th Division in Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of Labuan . In addition to its three Kittyhawk squadrons , the wing 's order of battle included No. 457 Squadron flying Spitfires , No. 25 Air Stores Park , No. 24 Medical Clearing Station , No. 22 Repair and Servicing Unit , No. 9 Repair and Servicing Unit Detachment , No. 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit , and seven Radar Stations — a total of over 2 @,@ 000 personnel . Its commander on Morotai and Labuan was Group Captain Ian McLachlan . No. 81 Wing was to have provided two squadrons in support of Operation Oboe Two , the assault on Balikpapan , in June but Tarakan airfield , from which it was to operate , was not ready in time . The wing was still based on Labuan when the Pacific War ended in August 1945 . Calls soon came to serve with the formation as part of the proposed Commonwealth occupation forces in Japan , and many personnel volunteered to do so . 
 = = = Allied occupation of Japan = = = 
 No. 81 Wing began re @-@ equipping with P @-@ 51D Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945 . No. 481 ( Maintenance ) Squadron was formed in December from elements of No. 22 Repair and Servicing Unit , No. 25 Air Stores Park , and other units based on Labuan . No. 381 ( Base ) Squadron , established in January 1946 , also utilised personnel and equipment from No. 81 Wing 's specialist units at Labuan , including No. 47 Operational Base Unit , No. 24 Medical Clearing Station , No. 25 Air Stores Park and No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron . The base squadron was an administrative and logistical unit , intended to make its wing self @-@ supporting and mobile . Under the leadership of Wing Commander Glen Cooper , No. 81 Wing subsequently transferred to new headquarters at Bofu , a former kamikaze base , where it formed the Australian air contingent of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan until 1948 , when the RAAF presence was reduced . The first of its units to arrive in Japan had been No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron ( No. 5 ACS ) in December 1945 , followed by the three flying squadrons in March 1946 . No. 82 Squadron lost three Mustangs and an escorting de Havilland Mosquito in bad weather en route to Bofu , killing all crew members . The wing 's strength was augmented by Nos. 381 and 481 Squadrons , and later No. 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit ( No. 111 MFCU ) . Also making the journey to Japan was the wing 's mascot , Flying Officer ( later Flight Lieutenant ) Raleigh , " a small yellow dog and combat @-@ seasoned veteran with over 40 hours operational flying to his credit " . 
 As the Japanese offered no serious resistance to the Allied occupation , No. 81 Wing 's prime operational duty was surveillance patrols . The RAAF personnel also helped maintain law and order , and supervised elections , while No. 5 ACS , in addition to military construction , contributed to rebuilding local infrastructure . Otherwise they generally maintained a peacetime training regime . By late 1946 , No. 381 Squadron was providing technical support to all BCOF squadrons , including five from Britain , New Zealand and India , as well as to the RAAF contingent . Group Captain Brian Eaton took over command of No. 81 Wing from Cooper in September 1947 . The wing transferred to Iwakuni in April 1948 , the same month that the Federal government determined to reduce Australia 's contribution to BCOF and disband the formation , retaining only No. 77 Squadron in Japan . Nos. 76 and 82 Squadrons disbanded in October , the former subsequently re @-@ emerging and joining No. 78 Wing when it deployed to Malta in 1952 . No. 81 Wing headquarters and No. 481 Squadron were disbanded in November 1948 , followed by No. 111 MFCU in January 1949 . Detachments of No. 381 Squadron and No. 5 ACS remained with No. 77 Squadron under the aegis of a new organisation called RAAF Component , eventually disbanding in February and April 1950 , respectively . No. 77 Squadron personnel were preparing to return to Australia when , on 25 June 1950 , they were placed on standby for action in the Korean War , which had just broken out ; the unit began flying missions over Korea a week later .

 In January 1961 , No. 81 Wing was re @-@ established at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales . Flying CAC Sabres , its complement included Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons , as well as No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit ( No. 2 OCU ) and a re @-@ formed No. 481 Maintenance Squadron . In September 1964 , Nos. 76 and 481 Squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Darwin , Northern Territory , as part of Operation Handover , a little @-@ publicised contingency plan put into effect during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia . No. 76 Squadron 's Sabres , armed with Sidewinder missiles , were to defend against possible attack by Indonesian forces following the recent establishment of the Federation of Malaysia . This was the first time since World War II that an RAAF flying squadron was positioned " in harm 's way " on Australian territory . As No. 75 Squadron was effectively out of action pending conversion to the Dassault Mirage III , the deployment meant that practically the entire mainland fighter force had been committed to the north . The Officer Commanding No. 81 Wing , Group Captain A.F. Mather , took on the role of Area Air Defence Commander . No combat ensued , the Sabres ' only interception being a Canberra bomber of No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit , but the experience did reveal deficiencies in the defence of Northern Australia and contributed to the decision to maintain a permanent detachment of No. 81 Wing fighters in Darwin , and later at RAAF Base Tindal . The wing converted from Sabres to Mirages between 1964 and 1966 , commencing with No. 2 OCU and concluding with No. 76 Squadron ; the last @-@ mentioned disbanded in 1973 . No. 81 Wing itself disbanded at Williamtown in December 1966 . No. 75 Squadron was based at RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaysia , from 1967 until 1983 , when it relocated to Darwin . Following conversion to the F / A @-@ 18 Hornet in 1988 , it transferred to Tindal . Owing to its remote location , it became the largest Hornet squadron , employing an extensive maintenance section to ensure readiness . 
 No. 81 Wing re @-@ formed at Williamtown on 2 February 1987 . Along with No. 75 Squadron at Tindal , its flying units consisted of Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown with No. 2 OCU , all of which had converted from the Mirage to the Hornet between 1985 and 1987 , the last @-@ mentioned being the prime operator of the two @-@ seat F / A @-@ 18B trainers . Having continued to perform fighter maintenance through the 1960s and ' 70s , No. 481 Squadron was disbanded on 31 January 1987 . It re @-@ formed the next day as No. 481 Wing under No. 81 Wing 's parent organisation , Tactical Fighter Group ( TFG ) , and consisted of two squadrons , Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Williamtown ( <unk> ) and Aircraft Equipment Maintenance Squadron Williamtown ( <unk> ) . By 1996 , No. 81 Wing had been augmented by Nos. 25 and 76 Squadrons , operating Macchi MB @-@ 326 lead @-@ in fighters , the former based at RAAF Base Pearce , Western Australia , and the latter at Williamtown , where it also employed Pilatus PC @-@ 9s for forward air control ( FAC ) . On 1 July 1996 , No. 481 Wing was reorganised as No. 402 Wing , incorporating a newly re @-@ formed No. 481 Squadron as well as Weapon Systems Support Flight and Field Training Flight . No. 402 Wing transferred its functions to No. 81 Wing 's flying squadrons on 31 July 1998 before disbanding in October . The same year , No. 25 Squadron was split , its Macchis now being operated by a re @-@ formed No. 79 Squadron . No. 78 Wing was re @-@ established in 2000 as an operational training formation , taking over Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons , and No. 2 OCU . By 2007 , No. 2 OCU had returned to the control of No. 81 Wing . 
 From 2000 to 2003 , No. 77 Squadron flew the FAC PC @-@ 9s previously operated by No. 76 Squadron ; this role was subsequently assigned to the newly formed Forward Air Control Development Unit . A detachment of No. 81 Wing , consisting of Hornets from No. 75 Squadron and PC @-@ 9s from No. 77 Squadron , was prepared to support INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000 , but was not required . Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 , Hornets from both No. 3 and No. 77 Squadrons were deployed for air defence at the USAF base on Diego Garcia ; no combat ensued and the planes returned in May 2002 . That year , Hornets from No. 75 Squadron undertook combat air patrols in connection with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Queensland . No. 81 Wing became part of RAAF Air Command 's new Air Combat Group when TFG merged with Strike Reconnaissance Group in February 2002 . The following year , 14 Hornets from No. 75 Squadron deployed to the Middle East to support the invasion of Iraq , escorting high @-@ value Coalition aircraft and later providing close air support to ground troops and air interdiction against Iraqi forces , the first time the RAAF had delivered bombs in anger since the Vietnam War . The Hornets were led by Wing Commander Mel <unk> , who became Officer Commanding No. 81 Wing in 2006 – 07 , Commander Air Combat Group in 2009 – 12 , and subsequently Air Commander Australia . The Hornets have also continued to play an air defence role in securing high @-@ profile events in Australia , including the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , the 2007 APEC meeting in Sydney , and the 2011 visit by US President Barack Obama .

 = = Background = = 
 Jayne Seymour Fonda was born on December 21 , 1937 , in New York City , the daughter of actor Henry Fonda and the Canadian @-@ born socialite Frances Ford Brokaw ( née Seymour ) . According to her father , their surname came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s . There , they intermarried and began to use Dutch given names , with Jane 's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650 . She also has English , Scottish , and French ancestry . She was named for the third wife of Henry VIII , Jane Seymour , to whom she is distantly related on her mother 's side . She has a brother , Peter , an actor , and a maternal half @-@ sister , Frances de Villers Brokaw ( aka " Pan " ) , whose daughter is Pilar <unk> , owner of Pilar <unk> Gallery in London . On April 14 , 1950 , when Fonda was twelve , her mother committed suicide while under treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in Beacon , NY . Later that year , Fonda 's father married socialite Susan Blanchard ( born 1928 ) , just nine years his daughter 's senior ; this marriage ended in divorce . At 15 Fonda taught dance at Fire Island Pines , New York . She attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich , Connecticut . 
 Fonda attended the Emma Willard School in Troy , New York , and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie , where she was an undistinguished student . Before starting her acting career , Fonda was a model , gracing the cover of Vogue twice . 
 = = Acting career = = 
 Fonda became interested in acting in 1954 , while appearing with her father in a charity performance of The Country Girl , at the Omaha Community Playhouse . After dropping out of Vassar , she went to Paris for two years to study art . Upon returning to the states , in 1958 , she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting changed the course of her life , Fonda saying , " I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent . Real talent . It was the first time that anyone , except my father — who had to say so — told me I was good . At anything . It was a turning point in my life . I went to bed thinking about acting . I woke up thinking about acting . It was like the roof had come off my life ! " 
 = = = 1960s = = = 
 Her stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s . She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade , starting in 1960 with Tall Story , in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star , played by Anthony Perkins . Period of Adjustment and Walk on the Wild Side followed in 1962 . In Walk on the Wild Side , Fonda played a prostitute and earned a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer . 
 In 1963 , she appeared in Sunday in New York . Newsday called her " the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses " . However , she also had detractors — in the same year , the Harvard Lampoon named her the " Year 's Worst Actress " for The Chapman Report . Fonda 's career breakthrough came with Cat Ballou ( 1965 ) , in which she played a <unk> turned outlaw . This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations and was one of the year 's top ten films at the box office . It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom . After this came the comedies Any Wednesday ( 1966 ) , opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones , and Barefoot in the Park ( 1967 ) , co @-@ starring Robert Redford . 
 In 1968 , she played the title role in the science fiction spoof Barbarella , which established her status as a sex symbol . In contrast , the tragedy They Shoot Horses , Don 't They ? ( 1969 ) won her critical acclaim , and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role . Fonda was very selective by the end of the 1960s , turning down lead roles in Rosemary 's Baby and Bonnie and Clyde , which went to Mia Farrow and Faye Dunaway , respectively . 
 = = = 1970s = = = 
 Fonda won her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1971 , again playing a prostitute , the gamine Bree Daniels , in the murder mystery Klute . She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for Klute and another in 1978 for Coming Home as well as the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1978 , for the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran 's difficulty in re @-@ entering civilian life . 
 Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977 , Fonda did not have a major film success . She appeared in A Doll 's House ( 1973 ) , Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird ( 1976 ) . From comments ascribed to her in interviews , some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views : " I can 't say I was blacklisted , but I was <unk> . " However , in her 2005 autobiography , My Life So Far , she rejected such simplification . " The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career , far from being destroyed after the war , flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed . " She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life . Her return to acting in a series of ' issue @-@ driven ' films reflected this new focus . 
 In 1972 , Fonda starred as a reporter alongside Yves Montand in Tout Va Bien , directed by Jean @-@ Luc Godard and Jean @-@ Pierre Gorin . The two directors then made Letter to Jane , in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda . 
 Through her production company , IPC Films , she produced films that helped return her to star status . The 1977 comedy film Fun With Dick and Jane is generally considered her " comeback " picture . Also in 1977 , she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia , receiving positive reviews , BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress , and an Oscar nomination . During this period , Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues , and she generally stuck to her word . She turned down An Unmarried Woman because she felt the part was not relevant . She won another BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with The China Syndrome , about a cover @-@ up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant . The same year , she starred in The Electric Horseman with her previous co @-@ star , Robert Redford . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 In 1980 , Fonda starred in 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton . The film was a huge critical and box office success , becoming the second highest @-@ grossing release of the year . Fonda had long wanted to work with her father , hoping it would help their strained relationship . She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond , specifically for her father and her . On Golden Pond , which also starred Katharine Hepburn , brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor , which Jane accepted on his behalf , as he was ill and could not leave home . He died five months later . 
 Fonda continued appearing in feature films throughout the 1980s , winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1984 for The <unk> , and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in Agnes of God ( 1985 ) . She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of an alcoholic murder suspect in the 1986 thriller The Morning After , opposite Jeff Bridges . She ended the decade by appearing in Old Gringo . This was followed by the romantic drama Stanley & Iris ( 1990 ) with Robert De Niro , which would be her final film for 15 years .

 For many years Fonda took ballet class to keep fit , but after fracturing her foot while filming The China Syndrome , she was no longer able to participate . To compensate , she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni <unk> . The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout , which began a second career for her , continuing for many years . This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers , then approaching middle age . In 1982 , Fonda released her first exercise video , titled Jane Fonda 's Workout , inspired by her best @-@ selling book , Jane Fonda 's Workout Book . Jane Fonda 's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years , selling over a million copies . The video 's release led many people to buy the then @-@ new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home . The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney <unk> , who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl , of Karl Home Video . <unk> produced the first video and 11 more after that . She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined , more than any other exercise series . She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs , through 1995 . After a fifteen @-@ year hiatus , she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010 , aiming at an older audience .

 In June 2016 , the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting ; in the video , Fonda and others told the stories of the people killed there . 
 = = Political activism = = 
 During the 1960s , Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement , and in opposition to the Vietnam War . Fonda 's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war , an experience that she later characterized as " small @-@ c communism " . Along with other celebrities , she supported the Alcatraz Island occupation by American Indians in 1969 , which was intended to call attention to failures of the government in treaty rights and the movement for greater Indian sovereignty . 
 She supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers in the early 1970s , stating " Revolution is an act of love ; we are the children of revolution , born to be rebels . It runs in our blood . " She called the Black Panthers " our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love , money , propaganda and risk . " She has been involved in the feminist movement since the 1970s , which dovetails with her activism in support of civil rights . 
 = = = Opposition to Vietnam War = = = 
 In April 1970 , Fonda , with Fred Gardner and Donald Sutherland formed the FTA tour ( " Free The Army " , a play on the troop expression " Fuck The Army " ) , an anti @-@ war road show designed as an answer to Bob Hope 's USO tour . The tour , described as " political vaudeville " by Fonda , visited military towns along the West Coast , with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam . The dialogue was made into a movie ( <unk> ) which contained strong , frank criticism of the war by servicemen and servicewomen ; it was released in 1972 . 
 On May 4 , 1970 , Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico , in Albuquerque , to speak on GI rights and issues . The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence . The quiet was broken when Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage . Drunk , Corso challenged Fonda , using a four @-@ letter expletive : Why hadn 't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard , which had just taken place ? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident : " I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool . " On the same day , she joined a protest march on the home of university president , Ferrel Heady . The protestors called themselves " They Shoot Students , Don 't They ? " — a reference to Fonda 's recently released film , They Shoot Horses , Don 't They ? , which had just been screened in Albuquerque . 
 In the same year , Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War ( VVAW ) in Valley Forge , Pennsylvania . She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and , for her efforts , was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator . On November 3 , 1970 , Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization . As noted by The New York Times , Fonda was a " major patron " of the VVAW . 
 = = = = Controversial visit to Hanoi = = = = 
 Fonda visited Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes . After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam , she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River . Columnist Joseph Kraft , who was also touring North Vietnam , said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi , and that , if the U.S. Air Force were " truly going after the dikes , it would do so in a methodical , not a <unk> @-@ <unk> way " . 
 Fonda was photographed seated on a anti @-@ aircraft gun ; the controversial photo outraged a number of Americans , and earned her the nickname " Hanoi Jane " . In her 2005 autobiography , she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery ; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures and regretted they were taken . In a 2011 entry at her official website , Fonda explained : 
 It happened on my last day in Hanoi . I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2 @-@ week visit ... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song . He translated as they sung . It was a song about the day ' Uncle Ho ' declared their country 's independence in Hanoi 's Ba Dinh Square . I heard these words : " All men are created equal ; they are given certain rights ; among these are life , Liberty and Happiness . " These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony . I began to cry and clap . These young men should not be our enemy . They celebrate the same words Americans do . The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return ... I memorized a song called " Day Ma Di " , written by anti @-@ war South Vietnamese students . I knew I was slaughtering it , but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt . I finished . Everyone was laughing and clapping , including me ... Here is my best , honest recollection of what happened : someone ( I don 't remember who ) led me towards the gun , and I sat down , still laughing , still applauding . It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting . I hardly even thought about where I was sitting . The cameras flashed ... It is possible that it was a set up , that the Vietnamese had it all planned . I will never know . But if they did I can 't blame them . The buck stops here . If I was used , I allowed it to happen ... a two @-@ minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever ... But the photo exists , delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling . I carry this heavy in my heart . I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph . It was never my intention to cause harm . 
 Fonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two @-@ week tour , commenting on her visits to villages , hospitals , schools , and factories damaged in the war and denouncing U.S. military policy in Vietnam . Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam and her radio broadcasts . During the course of her visit , Fonda visited American prisoners of war ( POWs ) , and brought back messages from them to their families . When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration , Fonda called the returning POWs " hypocrites and liars and pawns " , adding about the prisoners she visited , " These were not men who had been tortured . These were not men who had been starved . These were not men who had been brainwashed . " In addition , Fonda told The New York Times in 1973 , " I 'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture ... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic , I believe that 's a lie . " Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely in the press and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later . Fonda , as well as the named POWs , have personally denied the rumors , and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these rumored allegations to be false as the persons named had never met Fonda . 
 In 1972 , Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign , which continued to mobilize antiwar activists across the nation after the 1973 Paris Peace Agreement , through 1975 , when the United States withdrew from Vietnam . 
 Because of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors circulated about her visit , resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists . For example , when U.S. Naval Academy plebes , who had not yet been born when Fonda protested the Vietnam war , shouted out " Goodnight , Jane Fonda ! " , the company replied " Goodnight , bitch ! " This practice has since been prohibited by the academy 's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures . In 2005 , Michael A. Smith , a U.S. Navy veteran , was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City , Missouri , after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda 's face during a book @-@ signing event for her autobiography , My Life So Far . He told reporters that he " consider [ ed ] it a debt of honor " , adding " she spit in our faces for 37 years . It was absolutely worth it . There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did . " Fonda refused to press charges . 
 = = = = Regrets = = = = 
 In a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters , Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions , stating : 
 I would like to say something , not just to Vietnam veterans in New England , but to men who were in Vietnam , who I hurt , or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did . I was trying to help end the killing and the war , but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I 'm very sorry that I hurt them . And I want to apologize to them and their families . [ ... ] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti @-@ aircraft gun , which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes . It hurt so many soldiers . It galvanized such hostility . It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done . It was just thoughtless . 
 Some critics responded that her apology came at a time when a group of New England Veterans had launched a campaign to disrupt a film project she was working on , leading to the charge that her apology was motivated at least partly by self @-@ interest . 
 In a 60 Minutes interview on March 31 , 2005 , Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972 , with the exception of the anti @-@ aircraft @-@ gun photo . She stated that the incident was a " betrayal " of American forces and of the " country that gave me privilege " . Fonda said , " The image of Jane Fonda , Barbarella , Henry Fonda 's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine . " She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti @-@ war activism : " There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs . Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It 's not something that I will apologize for . " Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi , something she asked the North Vietnamese to do : " Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it , and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war . "

 In 2013 , it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1 @,@ 600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency ( NSA ) as part of Project Minaret , a program that some NSA officials have described as " disreputable if not downright illegal " . Fonda 's communications , as well as those of her husband , Tom Hayden , were intercepted by Britain 's Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) . Under the <unk> Agreement , the GCHQ sent the intercepted data on Americans to the U.S. government . 
 = = = Feminist causes = = = 
 Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes , including V @-@ Day , a movement to stop violence against women , inspired by the off @-@ Broadway hit The Vagina Monologues , of which she is an honorary chairperson . She was present at their first summit in 2002 , bringing together founder Eve Ensler , Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban , and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation . 
 In 2001 , she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development . 
 On February 16 , 2004 , Fonda led a march through Ciudad Juárez , with Sally Field , Eve Ensler and other women , urging Mexico to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city . That same year , she served as a mentor to the first ever all @-@ transsexual cast of The Vagina Monologues . 
 In the days before the September 17 , 2006 Swedish elections , Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party <unk> <unk> in their election campaign . 
 In My Life So Far , Fonda stated that she considers patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women . She also states that for many years , she feared to call herself a feminist , because she believed that all feminists were " anti @-@ male " . But now , with her increased understanding of patriarchy , she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women , and states that she " still loves men " , adding that when she divorced Ted Turner , she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy , and was very happy to have done so . 
 = = = Native Americans = = = 
 Fonda went to Seattle , Washington , in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie <unk> . The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton , which was in the process of being <unk> by the United States Army and turned into a park . The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population , protesting that " Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs . " The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city 's Discovery Park . 
 = = = Israeli – Palestinian conflict = = = 
 In December 2002 , Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women . She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel 's Prime Minister . She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors and patients at a Jerusalem hospital , followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center , and a Palestinian refugee camp . She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived for a meeting with leading Israeli feminists . 
 In September 2009 , she was one of more than 1 @,@ 500 signatories to a letter protesting the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival 's spotlight on Tel Aviv . The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of " the Israeli propaganda machine " because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir <unk> as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel 's conflict with the Palestinians . Other signers included actor Danny Glover , musician David Byrne , journalist John Pilger , and authors Alice Walker , Naomi Klein , and Howard Zinn . 
 Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that " People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two @-@ state solution . By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv , they are supporting a one @-@ state solution , which means the destruction of the State of Israel . " Hier continued , saying that " it is clear that the script [ the protesters ] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas . " 
 Fonda , in The Huffington Post , said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it " was perhaps too easily misunderstood . It certainly has been wildly distorted . Contrary to the lies that have been circulated , the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers . " She continued , writing " the greatest ' re @-@ branding ' of Israel would be to celebrate that country 's long standing , courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict , and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements . That 's the way to show Israel 's commitment to peace , not a PR campaign . There will be no two @-@ state solution unless this happens . " Fonda emphasized that she , " in no way , support [ s ] the destruction of Israel . I am for the two @-@ state solution . I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people . " Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda , who they described as " a strong supporter and friend of Israel " . 
 = = = Opposition to the Iraq War = = = 
 Fonda argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America , and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war . In July 2005 , Fonda announced plans to make an anti @-@ war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans , saying that some of the war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War . She later canceled the tour , because of concerns that she would distract attention from Cindy Sheehan 's activism . 
 In September 2005 , Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti @-@ war activist George Galloway at two stops on his U.S. book tour , Madison , Wisconsin and Chicago . She canceled her appearances at the last minute , citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery . 
 On January 27 , 2007 , Fonda participated in an anti @-@ war rally and march held on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , declaring that " silence is no longer an option " . Fonda spoke at an anti @-@ war rally earlier in the day at the Navy Memorial , where members of the organization Free Republic picketed in a counter protest .

 In the 2004 presidential election , her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry , the former VVAW leader , who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate . Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a " Jane Fonda Democrat " . Also , Kerry 's opponents circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti @-@ war rally , although they were sitting several rows apart . A faked composite photograph , which gave the false impression that the two had shared a speaker 's platform , was also circulated .

 In 2015 , Fonda expressed disapproval with President Barack Obama 's permitting of arctic drilling ( Petroleum exploration in the Arctic ) at the Sundance Film Festival . In July , she marched in a Toronto protest called the " March for Jobs , Justice , and Climate , " which was organized by dozens of nonprofits , labor unions , and environmental activists , including Canadian author Naomi Klein . The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated .

 = = Plot = = 
 Cassie ( Emily Osment ) is a thirteen @-@ year @-@ old goth girl who just moved with her family to a new neighborhood and school . She loves to trick the popular kids at school and her younger brother Max ( Alex Winzenread ) . 
 On the way to a library , Cassie finds a mysterious Halloween store in an alley and goes inside . The store owner ( Tobin Bell ) insists on selling her an old book titled The Evil Thing , which contains a warning not to read it aloud or think about its monster called " The Evil Thing " , a two @-@ headed creature that sucks blood while the other head eats meat . That night , Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max as revenge for him unplugging her computer in the middle of a report she was writing . Priscilla Wright ( Brittany Curran ) , a school bully who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie 's bag in school , films her jumping in fear , after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life . 
 After Cassie 's parents leave for a Halloween party and later that night , The Evil Thing is brought to life by Max 's thoughts , and captures him , Priscilla and a Papa John 's Pizza delivery man . It is up to Cassie and Sean ( Cody Linley ) , a popular boy who Cassie likes , to save them . At first , they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own , but fail . Cassie then asks the owner of the shop , where she bought the book , for help . Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween , searching for a person who loves to scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud , releasing The Evil Thing , possibly in order to teach them a lesson . He leaves them with the riddle " two heads are better than one ; that 's the way to get the bloody job done " before his shop disappears . After he disappears , Sean solves the riddle . Together , they formulate that if they get blood from a roast that Cassie 's mother made and throw it onto The Evil Thing , it will be forced to suck up the blood . In doing so , it will devour itself . While they plan their attack , The Evil Thing 's babies hatch and tries to eat the victims . Luckily , Sean and Cassie make it in time . By using Sean 's CD of monster sound effects , they are able to lure the monster to the CD player ; however , when the monster nudges it , the music turns into hip hop , thus ruining their plan . While fumbling , Sean and Cassie accidentally drop the blood near Max , who must conquer his fears . When Cassie encourages him , Max tosses the blood onto The Evil Thing , causing its heads to begin attacking each other . The monster eats itself , eventually exploding in a shower of yellow blood , killing itself and its offspring .

After Priscilla leaves , they save the pizza delivery man , who offers them free pizza in return for releasing him , then follows Priscilla to hit on her , to her disgust . Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing . Sean leaves shortly afterward . Cassie and Max 's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace .

 = = Production = = 
 Margaret Loesch , who founded Fox Kids and the Hallmark Channel , served as the executive producer . The film 's music score was composed by Chris <unk> . Dan Angel , who wrote the script , said " The key is to do no gore , no violence , no [ bad ] language , no sex , no one dies , but you can take the audience to a scary place and bring them back " . 
 R. L. Stine was consulted for how the script should be written . There was supposed to be a series based on the short stories in R. L. Stine 's book , but the executive producers decided to film their own original story , and Stine contributed what he thought should be added to it . Stine said that the film is no different from his short stories , saying , " It 's a really good , creepy adventure for kids , but it never really goes too far , sort of like my stories . " 
 Filming took place in the borough of Carnegie , Pennsylvania as well as Cranberry Township in October and November 2006 . Filmed in Pittsburgh , the local Steeltown Entertainment Project has a credit in the film 's beginning for investing in the film 's production . Other people in Pittsburgh have credits at the end of the film . Over 100 local citizens had a part in the film 's production . Loesch stated the filming could not have happened in Pittsburgh without the help of Steeltown . A problem during the production was how many hours children can work each day , due to child labor laws . 
 Product placement for the film includes a cookie from the restaurant chain Eat 'n Park and Papa John 's Pizza . The use of pizza delivery by Papa John 's Pizza in the film was regarded by Common Sense Media , a media website for parents , reviewer Heather <unk> , as " overly integrated product placement " . She criticized the product placement , writing , " Not only is the pizza delivery guy included in more than half of the DVD , but the logo is present and the kids are shown munching ecstatically on the pizza at the end of the movie . They even say that the pizza is great , and how the delivery guy was nice . It 's enough to make a commercial @-@ conscious parent gag " . 
 Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger designed the animatronic monster , The Evil Thing . The Evil Thing was created by Nicotero 's company KNB FX , the same company that did the special effects for The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . The monster 's two heads were controlled by two people . Cody Linley described the monster as " nasty " , while the director Alex Zamm said , " That 's lunch " .

 = Jake Diekman = 
 Jacob Tanner Diekman ( born January 21 , 1987 ) is an American professional baseball pitcher with the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He previously played for the Philadelphia Phillies . He throws left @-@ handed . Diekman grew up in Wymore , Nebraska , where he attended a high school too small for a baseball team , so he instead focused on golf , playing baseball in the summer for an American Legion team . He played two seasons of baseball in college at Doane College and Cloud County Community College respectively before attending a junior college baseball showcase , at which he was offered a scholarship to play Division I baseball . However , in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft , the Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the 30th round , and he ultimately signed . 
 With the Phillies , Diekman began as a starting pitcher and progressed through a few levels of the Phillies ' farm system in his first two years as a starter before adjusting his mechanics and lowering his arm slot to throw sidearm out of the bullpen as a relief pitcher . The adjustment worked , and helped him move through the remaining levels of the Phillies ' farm system and , in 2012 , making his major league debut . Over the next two seasons , he split time between the major league Phillies and their Triple @-@ A ( AAA ) affiliate , the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs , though while he was with the major league team , was considered one of the " lone bright spots " in both 2012 and 2013 . Diekman throws a fastball in the mid @-@ 90s ( mph ) , a slider , and an occasional changeup ; his fastball is among the fastest of any left @-@ handed reliever in the major leagues . 
 Diekman 's parents have been key parts of his life , especially his mother , who died soon before the Phillies drafted him , and from whom he now draws inspiration . He holds a degree in business administration , and resides in Beatrice , Nebraska in the offseason . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Diekman was born to Paul and Billie Diekman in 1987 . He has one brother . He attended Southern High School in Wymore , Nebraska , which was too small to field a baseball team , so Diekman played golf there instead . Eventually , he joined an American Legion baseball team with players from Wymore and several surrounding towns , which Diekman called " the best experience of my life ... so much fun " . Concurrently , he worked full @-@ time at a lawn mower factory to earn money to pursue post @-@ secondary education . 
 After graduating high school , he enrolled at Doane College , where he pitched for one season . He transferred to Cloud County Community College in Kansas . Following his sophomore season , he attended a showcase at which , with a fastball well over 90 miles per hour ( 140 km / h ) , he drew much interest . He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska Cornhusker , which he would have accepted had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft 's 30th round . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 = = = Philadelphia Phillies = = = 
 Between 2007 and 2010 , he pitched in the lower levels of the Philadelphia Phillies ' Minor League system initially as a starter , and subsequently as a reliever . Although he initially saw success in 2007 , posting a 2 @.@ 72 ERA in 10 starts with GCL Phillies and Williamsport Crosscutters , he struggled in 2008 , posting an ERA of 5 @.@ 09 in 27 starts , split between Williamsport and the Lakewood Blue Claws . At the conclusion of both 2008 and 2009 , he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills on the mound . 
 He converted from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009 , along with several other Phillies pitching prospects . Around that time , he also , at the suggestion of the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief , lowered his release point to his current low angle . Success did not manifest itself immediately , as he still posted a 4 @.@ 04 ERA in 2009 , his first season in relief , but in 2010 , he cut his ERA to 2 @.@ 91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers , the Phillies High @-@ A affiliate . At the end of the 2010 season , he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League . He spent the 2011 season with the Double @-@ A Reading Phillies , accruing a 0 – 1 record and a 3 @.@ 05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games . Thereafter , the Phillies added him to their 40 @-@ man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft . 
 After receiving praise from Phillies ' pitching coach Rich Dubee for his performance in spring training , Diekman opened the 2012 season with the Triple @-@ A ( AAA ) Lehigh Valley IronPigs . With Lehigh Valley , he posted a 1 – 0 record and a 0 @.@ 59 ERA with 5 saves in 13 games in the season 's first month . He was added to the Phillies ' 25 @-@ man Major League roster on May 11 , and four days later recorded a win against the Houston Astros in his MLB debut . He finished the year an established lefty specialist , and had a 3 @.@ 95 ERA , though walked 6 @.@ 6 batters per 9 innings , and was erratic in his control . 
 Entering 2013 , Diekman was expected to be a key part of the Phillies bullpen after his success in 2012 , however he did not break camp with the big league club , beginning the season in AAA . In AAA , he struggled , which delayed his arrival to the major league team until June . While with the big league club , he continued his dominance of left @-@ handed hitters , however was not as good against right @-@ handed hitters ( a 150 @-@ point differential in opponent batting average and over 300 point differential in On @-@ base plus slugging ( OPS ) ) . Diekman improved his control , which made him a presumptive member of the 2014 bullpen , as he was one of 2013 's " lone bright spots " for the otherwise dismal Phillies ' bullpen . Ultimately , he did make the Phillies ' opening day roster as a member of the bullpen . 
 Early in the season , Diekman emerged as a reliable reliever in the Phillies ' bullpen , and was used extensively by manager Ryne Sandberg . As the season progressed , Diekman was more successful against left @-@ handed hitters than right @-@ handed hitters , but was used against both in a variety of situations . On September 1 , 2014 , Diekman was one of four pitchers who combined for a no @-@ hitter in the Phillies ' 7 @-@ 0 win over the Atlanta Braves in Turner Field . By the end of the season , the Phillies had one of the best bullpens in the league , and it consisted predominantly of young players such as Diekman . There was excitement from both Phillies ' personnel and writers that the bullpen could remain solid for a long time because of young pitchers such as Diekman , Ken Giles , and Justin De Fratus . Moreover , Diekman and Giles had potential as closers should the Phillies trade Jonathan Papelbon . Overall , Diekman emerged as a name to be mentioned among the " elite " relievers of the National League , but was overused against right @-@ handed batters , which hurt his statistics .

 On July 31 , 2015 , Diekman was traded to the Texas Rangers along with Cole Hamels in exchange for Matt Harrison , Nick Williams , Jorge Alfaro , Jake Thompson , Alec Asher , and <unk> Eickhoff .

Like most left @-@ handed pitchers , particularly those who throw out of an arm angle similar to Diekman 's , he is tough on left @-@ handed hitters . In 2013 , he held lefties to just a .368 OPS , though allowed a <unk> OPS to right @-@ handed hitters . Despite suggestions he remain a lefty specialist , he emerged in 2014 as a favorite middle reliever for manager Ryne Sandberg against both righties and lefties . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Diekman 's maturation was characterized by two parents that were equally loving , but embodied a stark juxtaposition in terms of demeanor . His mother , Billie , was Diekman 's " biggest fan " , and had to order her husband , Paul , to stop pacing , and watch Diekman pitch . However , Billie died at age 57 , just months before the Phillies drafted her son . Diekman has sought therapy to cope with the loss , and meditates thinking about her during " The Star Spangled Banner " prior to each game . 
 " ( After his mother 's death ) Diekman started to appreciate the little things . The game slowed down when he had fun . He invoked his mother 's spirit rather than avoiding it . ' The drive and determination she had for all the projects she did , how hard she worked , the dedication she had for her job , ' Diekman said . ' It really paid off . It really came to me . I thought , ' If I have a job , I want to put in the time and dedication like she did . ' ' That is how Billie Diekman 's legacy perseveres . It is why a young man from tiny Wymore , Neb . , will cherish Sunday 's rendition of " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " at a baseball stadium ... " 
 Diekman describes his father as his " best friend " , and one who has helped him cope with his mother 's death . Away from baseball , Diekman holds an associate 's degree in business administration from Cloud County Community College , and enjoys listening to music , working out , and playing golf . He resides in Beatrice , Nebraska during the offseason .

The Ottoman troops numbered up to 120 @,@ 000 , facing about 40 @,@ 000 Moldavian troops , plus smaller numbers of allied and mercenary troops . 
 Stephen inflicted a decisive defeat on the Ottomans , described as " the greatest ever secured by the Cross against Islam , " with casualties , according to Venetian and Polish records , reaching beyond 40 @,@ 000 on the Ottoman side . Mara Brankovic ( Mara Hatun ) , the former younger wife of Murad II , told a Venetian envoy that the invasion had been worst ever defeat for the Ottomans . Stephen was later awarded the title " <unk> Christi " ( Champion of Christ ) by Pope Sixtus IV , who referred to him as " verus <unk> fidei <unk> " ( " the true defender of the Christian faith " ) . 
 According to the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz , Stephen did not celebrate his victory ; instead , he fasted for forty days on bread and water and forbade anyone to attribute the victory to him , insisting that credit be given only to the Lord . 
 = = Background = = 
 The conflict between Stephen and Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II worsened when both laid their claims to the historical region of Bessarabia , now known under the name of Budjak . The region had belonged to Wallachia , but later succumbed to Moldavian influence under Petru I of Moldavia and was possibly annexed to Moldavia in the late 14th century by Roman I of Moldavia . Under Alexandru cel Bun , it had become an integral part of Moldavia and was successfully defended in 1420 against the first Ottoman attempt to capture castle Chilia . The ports of Chilia and Akkerman ( Romanian : Cetatea <unk> ) were essential for Moldavian commerce . The old trade route from Caffa , Akkerman , and Chilia passed through Suceava in Moldavia and Lwow in Poland ( now in Ukraine ) . 
 Both Poland and Hungary had previously made attempts to control the region , but had failed ; and for the Ottomans , " the control of these two ports and of Caffa was as much an economic as a political necessity , " as it would also give them a better grip on Moldavia and serve as a valuable strategic point from which naval attacks could be launched against the Commonwealth of Poland @-@ Lithuania . This is confirmed by a German chronicle which explains that Mehmet wanted to turn Moldavia into " some kind of fortress , " and from there , to launch attacks against Poland and Hungary . The Ottomans also feared the strategic position of Moldavia , from whence it would only take 15 to 20 days to reach Constantinople . 
 In 1448 , Petru II of Moldavia awarded Chilia to John Hunyadi , the governor of Transylvania ; and in effect , it gave Hungary control of the strategic area on the Danube , with access to the Black Sea . With the assassination of Bogdan II of Moldavia in 1451 by his brother Petru Aron , the country fell into civil war , as two pretenders fought for the throne : Aron and <unk> . Bogdan 's son , Stephen , fled Moldavia together with his cousin , Vlad Dracula — who had sought protection at the Moldavian court – to Transylvania , at the court of Hunyadi . Even though Hungary had made peace with the Turks in 1451 , Hunyadi wanted to transform Wallachia and Moldavia into a barrier that would protect the kingdom from Ottoman expansion . In the fall of 1453 , after the Ottoman capture of Constantinople , Moldavia received an ultimatum to start paying tribute to the Porte ; two years later , on October 5 , 1455 , Aron sent the first Moldavian tribute to the Porte : a payment of 2 @,@ 000 ducats . With both Wallachia and Moldavia conducting a pro @-@ Ottoman policy , the plan to install Vlad Țepeș as prince of Wallachia began to take shape . Sometime between April to July 1456 , with the support of a few Hungarian troops and Wallachian boyars , Prince Vladislav II was dethroned and slain , as Vlad Țepeș took possession of the Wallachian throne ; and as such , Chilia became a shared Wallachian @-@ Hungarian possession . In April 1457 , Vlad Țepeș supported Stephen with 6 @,@ 000 horsemen , which the latter used to invade Moldavia and occupy the Moldavian throne , ending the civil war as Aron fled to Poland . The new prince continued sending the tribute that his uncle and Mehmed had agreed upon , and in such way , avoided any premature confrontation with his enemy . His first priority was to strengthen the country and to retrieve its lost territory . Because Aron resided in Poland , Stephen made a few incursions in southern Poland . The hostilities ended on April 4 , 1459 , when in a new treaty between the two countries , Moldavia accepted vassalage and Poland returned <unk> back to Moldavia ; the latter also assumed the obligation to support Moldavia in retrieving Chilia and Cetatea Albă . It was also in the interest of Poland to have the area belonging to Moldavia , as it would increase their commerce in the region . On March 2 , 1462 , in a renewed treaty between the two countries , it was agreed that no Moldavian territory should remain under foreign rulership , and if such territory was under foreign rulership , that territory should be regained . Later that year , it is believed that Stephen asked Vlad to return Chilia back to Moldavia – a demand which was most likely refused . 
 On June 22 , when Vlad was fighting Mehmed , Stephen allied himself with the Sultan and with some Turkish assistance , he launched an attack on Chilia . The fortress , defended by tall stone walls and 12 cannons , was in the middle of the 15th century the strongest fortification located in the Danube area . The Wallachians rushed to the scene with 7 @,@ 000 men , and together with the Hungarian garrison battled the Moldavians and the Turks for eight days . They managed to defend the town , while wounding Stephen in his foot with a shrapnel . In 1465 , while Vlad was imprisoned in Hungary , Stephen again advanced towards Chilia with a large force and siege weapons ; but instead of besieging the fortress , he showed the garrison – who favoured the Polish King – a letter in which the King required them to surrender the fortress . This they did , and Stephen entered the fortress where he found " its two captains , rather tipsy , for they have been to a wedding . " Mehmed was furious about the news and claimed Chilia for being a part of Wallachia – which now was a vassal to the Porte – and demanded Stephen to give it over to him . The latter refused , however , and recruited an army , forcing Mehmed – who was not yet ready to wage war – to accept the situation , if only for the time being . The Moldavian prince , realizing that a future war with Mehmed could not be avoided , tried to gain time by increasing his tribute to the Porte by 50 percent ( to 3 @,@ 000 ducats ) ; and also sent an envoy to Constantinople with gifts for the sultan . In 1467 , Matthias Corvinus of Hungary launched an expedition against Moldavia in order to punish Stephen for annexing the region . The invasion ended in a disaster for the Hungarians as they suffered a bitter defeat at the Battle of Baia , where Corvinus was thrice wounded by arrows and had to be “ carried from the battlefield on a stretcher , to avoid him falling into the hands of the enemy . ” 
 In order to secure his southern frontier from Ottoman threats , Stephen wanted to liberate Wallachia – where the hostile Radu the Handsome , the <unk> of Vlad Țepeș ruled – from Ottoman dominion . In 1470 , he invaded the country and burned down the town of Brăila and in 1471 , Stephen and Radu confronted each other in Moldavia , where the latter was defeated . Meanwhile , Genoa , which possessed several colonies in the Crimea , began to worry about Stephen 's growing influence in the region ; and ordered her colonies to do whatever was needed to revenge past mischief from which allegedly , the Genovese had suffered . The colonies in turn pursued the Tatars to attack Moldavia . Later that year , the Tatars invaded the country from the north , causing great damage to the land and enslaving many . Stephen replied by invading Tatar territory with Polish assistance . In 1472 , Uzun Hassan of Ak Koyunlu invaded the Ottoman Empire from the east , causing a great crisis to the empire . He was defeated the following year , but this unexpected event , as it is explained in a contemporary source , encouraged Venice and Hungary to renew their war on the Ottomans , and Moldavia to free herself from any Ottoman influence . In 1473 , Stephen stopped paying the annual tribute to the Porte and as a reaction to this , an Italian letter , dated from 1473 to Bartolomeo Scala , secretary of the Republic of Florence , reveals that Mehmed had left Constantinople on April 13 and was planning to invade Moldavia from land and sea . Stephen still hoped to make peace with Radu and asked the Polish king to work as mediator . The peace attempts failed and the conflict intensified with three leaders challenging each other for the Wallachian throne : Radu , who was supported by Mehmed ; the seemingly loyal Basarab Laiotă , who at first was supported by Stephen ; and Basarab Ţepeluş cel <unk> — who would gain the support of Stephen after Laiotă 's betrayal . A series of " absurd " clashes followed , starting with another confrontation between Stephen and Radu on November 18 – 20 , at Râmnicu <unk> , where the latter suffered his second defeat at the hands of the Moldavian " warlike " prince . A few days later , on November 28 , the Ottomans intervened with an army consisting of 12 @,@ 000 Ottomans and 6 @,@ 000 Wallachians , but " they incurred heavy losses and fled across the Danube . " After capturing the castle of Bucharest , Stephen put Laiotă on the throne , but on December 31 , a new Ottoman army of 17 @,@ 000 set camp around river <unk> , laying waste to the countryside , and intimidating the new prince into abandoning his Wallachian throne and fleeing to Moldavia . In the spring of 1474 , Laiotă took the Wallachian throne for the second time ; and in June , he made the decision to betray his protégé by submitting to Mehmet . Stephen then invested his support into a new candidate , named Ţepeluş ( little spear ) , but his reign was even shorter , as it only lasted a few weeks after being defeated by Laiotă in battle on October 5 . Two weeks later , Stephen returned to Wallachia and forced Laiotă to flee . Mehmed , tired of what transpired in Wallachia , gave Stephen an ultimatum to forfeit Chilia to the Porte , to abolish his aggressive policy in Wallachia , and to come to Constantinople with his delayed homage . The Prince refused and in November 1474 , he wrote to the Pope to warn him of further Ottoman expansion , and to ask him for support .

 Mehmed ordered his general , Suleiman Pasha , to end the siege of Venetian @-@ controlled Shkodër ( now in Albania ) , to assemble his troops in Sofia , and from there to advance with additional troops towards Moldavia . For these already exhausted Ottoman troops , who had besieged the city from May 17 to August 15 , the transit from Shkodër to Moldavia was a month 's journey through bad weather and difficult terrain . According to Długosz , Suleiman was also ordered that after inflicting defeat on Stephen , he was to advance towards Poland , set camp for the winter , then invade Hungary in spring , and unite his forces with the army of the Sultan . The Ottoman army consisted of Janissaries and heavy infantry , which were supported by the heavy cavalry <unk> and by the light cavalry ( <unk> ) , who would scout ahead . There were also Tatar cavalry and other troops ( such as the <unk> ) from vassal states . Twenty thousand Bulgarian peasants were also included in the army ; their main tasks were to clear the way for the rest of the army by building bridges over waters and removing snow from the roads , and to drive supply wagons . In total , the Ottoman cavalry numbered 30 @,@ 000 . In September 1474 , the Ottoman army gathered in Sofia , and from there , Suleiman marched towards Moldavia by crossing the frozen Danube on foot . His first stop was Wallachia , which he entered via Vidin and Nicopolis . His army rested in Wallachia for two weeks , and was later met by a Wallachian contingent of 17 @,@ 000 under Basarab Laiotă , who had changed sides to join the Ottomans . 
 = = = Moldavians = = = 
 Stephen was hoping to gain support from the West , and more specifically from the Pope . However , the help that he received was modest in numbers . The Hungarian Kingdom sent 1 @,@ 800 Hungarians , while Poland sent 2 @,@ 000 horsemen . Stephen recruited 5 @,@ 000 Székely soldiers . The Moldavian army consisted of twenty cannon ; light cavalry ( <unk> ) ; elite , heavy cavalry – named <unk> , <unk> , and Boyars – and professional foot soldiers . The army reached a strength of up to 40 @,@ 000 , of whom 10 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 comprised the standing army . The remainder consisted of 30 @,@ 000 peasants armed with maces , bows , and other home @-@ made weapons . They were recruited into <unk> Mare ( the Great Army ) , into which all able @-@ bodied free men over the age of 14 were conscripted . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The invading army entered Moldavia in December 1474 . In order to fatigue the Ottomans , Stephen had instituted a policy of scorched earth and poisoned waters . Troops who specialised in setting ambushes harassed the advancing Ottomans . The population and livestock were evacuated to the north of the country into the mountains . 
 Ottoman scouts reported to Suleiman that there were untouched villages near Vaslui , and the Ottomans headed for that region . The winter made it difficult to set camp , which forced the Ottomans to move quickly and head for the Moldavian capital , Suceava . In order to reach Vaslui , where the Moldavian army had its main camp , they needed to cross Podul Înalt over the <unk> River . The bridge was made of wood and not suitable for heavy transportation of troops . Stephen chose that area for the battle – the same location where his father , Bogdan II , had defeated the Poles in 1450 ; and where he , at an age of 17 , had fought side @-@ by @-@ side with Vlad ' the Impaler ' . The area was ideal for the defenders : the valley was a semi @-@ oval surrounded on all sides by hills covered by forest . Inside the valley , the terrain was marshy , which restricted troop movement . Suleiman had full confidence in his troops and made few efforts to scout the area . On January 10 , on a dark and misty Tuesday morning , the battle began . The weather was frigid , and a dense fog limited vision . The Ottoman troops were exhausted , and the torrent made them look like " plucked chickens . " Stephen fortified the bridge , while setting and aiming his cannons at the structure . Peasants and archers were hidden in the forest , together with their Prince and his boyar cavalry . 
 The Moldavians made the first move by sending musicians to the middle of the valley . The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there . Instead , the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian professional army , which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy . Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and , when they made enough progress , the Moldavian artillery started to fire , followed by archers and <unk> firing from three different directions . The archers could not see the enemy for the fog , and , instead , had to follow the noise of their footsteps . The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks . Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge , causing it to collapse . Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers , and who did not get caught in the marshes , had to confront the Moldavian army , together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley . The 5 @,@ 000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7 @,@ 000 Ottoman infantrymen . Thereafter , they made a slow retreat , as instructed by Stephen , but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi , while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks . 
 Suleiman tried to reinforce his offensive , not knowing what had happened in the valley , but then Stephen , with the full support of his boyars , ordered a major attack . All his troops , together with peasants and heavy cavalry , attacked from all sides . Simultaneously , Moldavian buglers concealed behind Ottoman lines started to sound their bugles , and in great confusion some Ottoman units changed direction to face the sound . When the Moldavian army hit , Suleiman lost control of his army . He desperately tried to regain control , but was later forced to signal a retreat . The battle lasted for four days ; with the last three days seeing the fleeing Ottoman army being pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Polish cavalry until they reached the town of <unk> ( now <unk> , Romania ) , in Dobruja . 
 The Wallachians fled the field without joining battle and Laiotă now turned his sword against the Turks , who had hoped for a safe passage in Wallachia ; on January 20 , he exited his castle and confronted some of the Turks that were lurking on his land . Thereafter , he took one of their flags and sent it to a Hungarian friend as proof of his bravery . The Ottoman casualties were counted as 45 @,@ 000 , including four Pashas killed and a hundred standards taken . Jan Długosz writes that " all but the most eminent of the Turkish prisoners are impaled " , and their corpses burned . Only one was spared – the only son of the Ottoman general Isaac Bey , of the Gazi Evrenos family , whose father had fought with Mircea the Old . Another Polish chronicler reported that on the spot of the battle rested huge piles of bones upon each other , next to three immured crosses .

 After the battle , Stephen sent " four of the captured Turkish commanders , together with thirty @-@ six of their standards and much splendid booty , to King Casimir in Poland " , and implored him to provide troops and money to support the Moldavians in the struggle against the Ottomans . He also sent letters and a few prisoners and Turkish standards to the Pope and Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus , asking for support . In response , " the arrogant Matthias writes to the Pope , the Emperor and other kings and princes , telling them that he has defeated a large Turkish army with his own forces under the Voivode of Wallachia . " The Pope 's reply to Stephen denied him help , but awarded him with the " <unk> Christi " , while King Casimir pleaded " poverty both in money and men " and did nothing ; his own men then accused him of sloth , and advised him to change his shameful behaviour or hand over his rule to someone else . Chronicler Jan Długosz hailed Stephen for his victory in the battle : 
 Hassan tried to create a new coalition with the European powers , arguing that Mehmed 's best troops were lost at Vaslui . Upon hearing about the devastating defeat , Mehmed refused for several days to give audience to anyone ; his other plans of expansion were put to rest as he planned revenge on Stephen . In the following year , Mehmed invaded the country with an army of 150 @,@ 000 , which was joined by 10 @,@ 000 Wallachians under Laiotă and 30 @,@ 000 Tatars under Meñli I Giray . The Tatars , who called for a Holy War , attacked with their cavalry from the north and started to pillage the country . The Moldavians took chase after them , and routed and killed most of them . " The fleeing Tatars discard their weapons , their saddles and clothes , while some , as though crazed , jump into the River Dniepr . " Giray wrote to Mehmed that he could not wage more war against Stephen , as he had lost his son and two brothers , and had returned with only one horse . 
 In July 1476 , after killing 30 @,@ 000 Ottomans , Stephen was defeated at the Battle of Valea Albă . However , the Ottomans were unsuccessful in their siege of the Suceava citadel and the <unk> fortress , while Laiotă was forced to retreat back to Wallachia when Vlad and Stefan Báthory , Voivode of Transylvania , gave chase with an army of 30 @,@ 000 . Stephen assembled his army and invaded Wallachia from the north , while Vlad and Báthory invaded from the west . Laiotă fled , and in November , Vlad Țepeș was installed on the Wallachian throne . He received 200 loyal knights from Stephen to serve as his loyal bodyguards , but his army remained small . 
 When Laiotă returned , Vlad Tepes went to battle and was killed by the Janissaries near Bucharest in December 1476 . Laiotă again occupied the Wallachian throne , which urged Stephen to make another return to Wallachia and dethrone Laiotă for the fifth and last time , while a <unk> , Ţepeluş , was established as ruler of the country . 
 In 1484 , the Ottomans under Bayezid II , managed to conquer Chilia and Cetatea Albă and incorporate it into their empire under the name of Budjak , leaving Moldavia a landlocked principality for many years to come . 
 Between May and September 1488 , Stephen built the Voroneţ Monastery to commemorate the victory at Vaslui ; " the exterior walls – including a representation of the Last Judgment on the west wall – were painted in 1547 with a background of vivid cerulean blue . This is so vibrant that art historians refer to Voroneţ blue the same way they do Titian red . " In 1490 , he extended his work by building another monastery of Saint John the Baptist . These monasteries served as cultural centres ; today , they are on UNESCO 's World Heritage List . Stephen 's victory at Vaslui is considered one of the greatest Moldavian victories over the Ottomans , and as such " played a role in universal history " by securing the " culture and civilization of the Christian West from the onslaught of Islam .

 = Confederate Memorial ( Romney , West Virginia ) = 
 The Confederate Memorial ( also referred to as the First Confederate Memorial ) at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney , West Virginia , commemorates residents of Hampshire County who died during the American Civil War while fighting for the Confederate States of America . It was sponsored by the Confederate Memorial Association , which formally dedicated the monument on September 26 , 1867 . The town of Romney has claimed that this is the first memorial structure erected to memorialize the Confederate dead in the United States and that the town performed the nation 's first public decoration of Confederate graves on June 1 , 1866 . 
 The idea to memorialize the Confederate war dead of Hampshire County was first discussed in the spring of 1866 . Following the decoration of the graves that summer , the Confederate Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial , and by 1867 the necessary funds were raised . The inscription " The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights " was selected , and the contract for the memorial 's construction was awarded to the Gaddes Brothers firm of Baltimore . The memorial 's components were delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September 14 , 1867 , and the memorial was dedicated on September 26 of that year . The construction of the Confederate Memorial marked the beginning of an era of post @-@ war revitalization for Hampshire County following the American Civil War . 
 The Confederate Memorial is in the form of an obelisk , and it stands on a raised mound . The list of 125 names engraved on the monument includes four captains , seven lieutenants ( one of which was a chaplain ) , three sergeants , and 119 privates . The memorial underwent a restoration in 1984 , and is decorated annually with a handmade evergreen garland and wreath on Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day .

 The idea to memorialize the men of Hampshire County who had died fighting in the Military of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War was first discussed at a meeting in early spring of 1866 at the Romney residence of former Confederate Colonel Robert White . In addition to White , those present at the meeting included his brother Christian Streit White , his future sister @-@ in @-@ law Elizabeth " Bessie " Jane Schultze , and his sister Frances Ann White , who later married Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy . 
 Following the meeting , the concept gained support among other residents of Romney . Later in the spring of 1866 , a group of Hampshire County women held a public meeting to organize the Confederate Memorial Association with the mission of honoring the men who had died fighting for the Confederacy and providing financial aid to their families . At this meeting , the association appointed officers , adopted a constitution , and organized committees to arrange for the decoration of Confederate interments . 
 The people of Hampshire County had been overwhelmingly pro @-@ Confederate during the American Civil War , but the county now lay within Unionist West Virginia . West Virginia 's first state constitution disenfranchised Confederate veterans and partisans and forbade them from holding elected office . In spite of these impediments and risking the ire of Unionist authorities , members of the Confederate Memorial Association and their families marched through Romney to Indian Mound Cemetery and formally decorated the gravestones at the interment sites of Confederate dead on June 1 , 1866 . Few Hampshire County residents participated in this first decoration of the Confederate graves , fearing reproach from Federal authorities ; some who had pledged to take part in the decoration later refused to do so for the same reason . 
 This adornment in Indian Mound Cemetery has been called the first such public decoration of Confederate burials , but the claim is disputed by other towns in the Southern United States . Romney 's decoration contributed to a precedent that spread throughout the South during the Reconstruction Era . Relatives and loved ones of the Union dead buried in Indian Mound Cemetery also began to follow this precedent by decorating the cemetery 's Union headstones . 
 = = Fundraising = = 
 Following the first decoration of the graves in 1866 , momentum built for the erection of a permanent monument to the Confederate dead at Indian Mound Cemetery . The Confederate Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial , including sewing circles , bazaars , and fairs . Confederate veterans and others in Hampshire County undertook additional fundraising efforts , including entertainment shows and general solicitation . In addition to raising funds for the construction of the memorial , the Confederate Memorial Association also raised money for the widows and children of the Confederate dead . By October 15 , 1866 , the gross receipts returned to the association 's treasury amounted to $ 1 @,@ 170 @.@ 91 USD , of which the Confederate Memorial Association provided $ 421 @.@ 58 USD to the Confederate widows and orphaned children . Fundraising continued until June 1867 . 
 = = Design selection = = 
 By June 6 , 1867 , the Confederate Memorial Association had raised the necessary funds and proceeded to select the design , inviting and considering the opinions of Confederate veterans and others across Hampshire County . 
 In July 1867 , a committee of the Confederate Memorial Association narrowed the numerous proposals it had received for the memorial 's inscription to three finalists . The first inscription finalist said the Confederate soldiers " died in defense of what they believed to be right " , the second said they were " our sons and brothers , who fell as soldiers in the Confederate army " , and the third , which was ultimately adopted by the committee , read in full : " The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights " .

 Once the design and inscription had been chosen , the association appointed committees to select a contractor . At the end of the process , the contract was awarded to the Gaddes Brothers firm of Baltimore . They were asked to fabricate a white Italian marble monument . The memorial was designed , sculpted , and manufactured at a cost of $ 1 @,@ 133 @.@ 63 USD . According to United Daughters of the Confederacy historian Mary Bell Foote , the words " Southern Rights " were initially omitted from the end of the memorial 's inscription during its fabrication due to the " bitter feelings at the time " following the American Civil War , and Federal statutes banning such monuments . After the memorial 's components were packaged for shipping to Romney , the words " Southern Rights " were secretly etched into the white marble and the components quickly boarded over and shipped . 
 The memorial 's components were delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September 14 , 1867 , and it was erected at its present location by a group of Romney volunteers . Bob Fisher was paid $ 5 @.@ 00 USD for raising the earthen mound around the monument 's location and $ 4 @.@ 11 USD for providing lodging to one of the Gaddes brothers at his residence . William Sheetz was paid $ 18 @.@ 80 USD for building the memorial 's raised mound and supporting foundation . Twelve days later on September 26 , the Confederate Memorial was formally dedicated in a public ceremony .

 The Confederate Memorial stands upon a raised mound ringed by five boxwoods within the original section of Indian Mound Cemetery , not far from the cemetery 's entrance . Several family interment plots surround the memorial and its circular raised lawn . A burial ground where Confederate and Union dead were buried during the American Civil War lies adjacent to the memorial . 
 The Confederate Memorial is in the form of an obelisk , measuring 4 square feet ( 0 @.@ 37 m2 ) at its base and 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) in height . The structure 's pedestal consists of two major stylized blocks of white marble , topped by a sculpture of a cloth draped urn . Carved into the façade of the smaller top block of the memorial is a high relief that represents either Fame or an angel placing a laurel wreath upon the head of a dying soldier clasping his sword . Below , on the façade of the larger block , is the inscription : " The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights . " The other three sides of the memorial contain the engraved names of 125 Hampshire County men who died for the Confederate cause . A number representing the total fallen Confederates was not included in the memorial as it was not precisely known at the time of the monument 's construction . The memorial 's foundation block bears the date of its erection , " 1867 " .

 The list of 125 names engraved on the monument consists of four captains , seven lieutenants ( one of which was a chaplain ) , three sergeants , and 119 privates . Since the memorial 's erection in 1867 , several names of Hampshire County 's Confederate dead were found to have been omitted from the memorial . These names have been included in the " Confederate Honor Roll " along with those names etched in the memorial and the names of Confederate veterans . Each of these names is recited during the annual ceremony held on Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day . The following is the list of Confederate dead etched into the Confederate Memorial :

 The tradition of decorating the Confederate graves in Indian Mound Cemetery has continued annually since June 1 , 1866 , and occurs on the first Saturday in June , which is known as Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day or June Decoration Day . On this day , participants in the ceremony march down Main Street ( U.S. Route 50 ) through Romney with American Civil War reenactors carrying Confederate flags . A handmade evergreen garland measuring 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) in length is suspended from the Confederate Memorial , along with evergreen wreaths . Flowers and Confederate flags are also placed at each of the Confederate headstones . The decorations are usually placed at the memorial and upon the Confederate gravestones by reenactors .

 The construction of the Confederate Memorial marked the beginning of an era of post @-@ war revitalization for Hampshire County following the American Civil War . The memorial became a symbol of the county 's restored confidence . The citizens of Hampshire County worked together to reestablish and rebuild the institutions , municipal buildings , and businesses destroyed during the war . The Confederate Memorial Association that constructed the monument was a part of a larger movement throughout the post @-@ war American South , especially in Virginia , which sought to provide suitable interments for Confederate war dead . Historian Caroline E. Janney averred that these " Ladies ' Memorial Associations " used " gender in the interest of Confederate politics " , which laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy belief . 
 The memorial is among the first monuments erected to memorialize the Confederate dead in the United States . Romney 's claim to have the first Confederate Memorial is disputed by Cheraw , South Carolina , as its monument was dedicated two months prior on July 26 , 1867 . However , the Cheraw memorial omits the mention of " Confederacy " , " Confederate " , or " Southern " .

It developed on July 31 from non @-@ tropical origins between Bermuda and Cape Cod , and with favorable conditions , Chantal rapidly attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . The storm accelerated northeastward over an area of progressively colder water temperatures , and after a decrease in convection the National Hurricane Center ceased issuing advisories as Chantal began undergoing extratropical transition early on August 1 . Shortly thereafter , the extratropical remnant crossed over southeastern Newfoundland before tracking into the open waters of the north Atlantic Ocean . Prior to forming , the storm dropped moderate rainfall on Bermuda . Subsequent to becoming extratropical , the remnants of Chantal produced gusty winds and heavy precipitation across the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland , causing flooding and wind damage ; insured damage totaled $ 25 million ( 2007 CAD , $ 24 @.@ 3 million 2007 USD ) .

However , conditions were forecast to become more conducive for development , and by July 29 the National Hurricane Center remarked it had " potential for tropical or subtropical development . " On July 30 , the low passed to the west of Bermuda as it continued northeastward , under the influence of a large mid @-@ latitude trough . The system contained an exposed low @-@ level circulation , which intermittently passed beneath a persistent area of convection to its northeast . By early on July 31 , ship reports and QuikSCAT observations suggested winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) , and the center was well @-@ involved enough with the convection for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Three while it was located about 270 miles ( 435 km ) north @-@ northwest of Bermuda , or about 445 miles ( 710 km ) south @-@ southeast of Chatham , Massachusetts . 
 Upon receiving its classification , the depression consisted of a partially exposed low @-@ level center with deep convection occupying the northeastern semicircle . Located over sea surface temperatures of about 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) , one forecaster noted the depression had " a small window of opportunity ... for it to reach tropical storm strength before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone . " Convection increased further over the center , and at around 0600 UTC on July 31 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantal while located about 530 miles ( 855 km ) south of Halifax , Nova Scotia . The storm continued northeastward , under the influence of a mid @-@ level trough , and Chantal quickly developed well @-@ defined curved banding features ; six hours after becoming a tropical storm , Chantal reached peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . The storm tracked through an area of progressively cold waters and cooler air , resulting in the weakening of its convection . The circulation became embedded within the approaching frontal zone , and by 0600 UTC on August 1 Chantal transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . 
 After becoming an extratropical cyclone , Chantal maintained scattered convection near its center , though its main area of convection and clouds extended to its north . Midday on August 1 , the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula , hitting the Placentia Area with full force . It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane @-@ force . On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening trend in the far northern Atlantic Ocean , and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone to the east of Iceland . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The precursor disturbance to Chantal began affecting Bermuda on July 30 , producing scattered storms and increased cloud cover . The next day the system dropped more rainfall as it passed to the west of the island , and in the two @-@ day period precipitation accumulated to 2 @.@ 12 inches ( 53 @.@ 8 mm ) at the Bermuda International Airport , accounting for 35 % of the monthly rainfall total . Thunderstorms were reported on the island , and maximum reported winds on the island reached 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . After Chantal passed Bermuda , a ship with the call sign <unk> recorded sustained winds of 37 mph ( 59 km / h ) over the open waters of the north Atlantic Ocean . At around 2300 UTC on July 31 , a buoy to the southeast of Nova Scotia reported a pressure of 995 mbar as Chantal passed nearby . 
 Shortly after it first became a tropical storm , the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center of Canada issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off Newfoundland . Later , the Newfoundland Labrador Weather Office issued heavy rainfall warnings for southeastern Newfoundland . In offshore waters , wave heights reached 20 feet ( 6 m ) . Onshore , the storm produced moderately strong winds , with an unofficial peak gust of 54 mph ( 88 km / h ) reported near where the storm moved ashore . The extratropical remnants of Chantal dropped heavy rainfall in a short duration across Newfoundland ; 1 @.@ 7 inches ( 43 mm ) fell in 1 hour at St. John 's West , the highest hourly rainfall total . Across the province , precipitation peaked at 7 @.@ 89 inches ( 200 @.@ 4 mm ) at Argentia . The rainfall caused flooding and street washouts in several towns along the Avalon Peninsula , such as Ship Harbour , Fox Harbour , and <unk> . Several communities in the region declared states of emergencies . 
 In Ship Harbour citizens were isolated for 5 days until a temporary road was made . Also in Spaniard 's Bay , the flooding caused a bridge to depress about 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 50 cm ) ; a temporary bridge was built within two months , with a permanent replacement scheduled to be finished by the summer of 2008 . Insured damage across the area totaled $ 25 million ( 2007 CAD , $ 24 @.@ 3 million 2007 USD ) . 
 = National Register of Historic Places = 
 The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the United States federal government 's official list of districts , sites , buildings , structures , and objects deemed worthy of preservation . A property listed in the National Register , or located within a National Register Historic District , may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property . 
 The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80 @,@ 000 are listed individually . The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts . Each year approximately 30 @,@ 000 properties are added to the National Register as part of districts or by individual listings . 
 For most of its history the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , an agency within the United States Department of the Interior . Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups , such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation , coordinate , identify , and protect historic sites in the United States . While National Register listings are mostly symbolic , their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties . Protection of the property is not guaranteed . During the nomination process , the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation , as well as the public and politicians . 
 Occasionally , historic sites outside the country proper , but associated with the United States ( such as the American Embassy in Tangiers ) are also listed . Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms , including individual properties , historic districts , and multiple property submissions ( MPS ) . The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties : district , site , structure , building , or object . National Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non @-@ contributing properties . Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service . These include National Historic Landmarks ( NHL ) , National Historic Sites ( NHS ) , National Historical Parks , National Military Parks / Battlefields , National Memorials , and some National Monuments . ( Federal properties can be proclaimed National Monuments under the Antiquities Act because of either their historical or natural significance . They are managed by multiple agencies . Only monuments that are historic in character and managed by the National Park Service are listed administratively in the National Register . ) 
 = = History = = 
 On October 15 , 1966 , the Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places and the corresponding State Historic Preservation Offices ( SHPO ) . Initially , the National Register consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register 's creation , as well as any other historic sites in the National Park system . Approval of the act , which was amended in 1980 and 1992 , represented the first time the United States had a broad @-@ based historic preservation policy . The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency , the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ( ACHP ) , to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation . 
 To administer the newly created National Register of Historic Places , the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior , with director George B. Hartzog , Jr . , established an administrative division named the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation ( OAHP ) . Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law . Ernest Connally was the Office 's first director . Within OAHP new divisions were created to deal with the National Register . The division administered several existing programs , including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey , as well as the new National Register and Historic Preservation Fund . 
 The first official Keeper of the Register was William J. Murtagh , an architectural historian . During the Register 's earliest years in the late 1960s and early 1970s , organization was lax and SHPOs were small , understaffed , and underfunded . However , funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants @-@ in @-@ aid to listed property owners , first for house museums and institutional buildings , but later for commercial structures as well . 
 A few years later in 1979 , the NPS history programs affiliated with both the U.S. National Parks system and the National Register were categorized formally into two " Assistant Directorates . " Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation . From 1978 until 1981 , the main agency for the National Register was the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service ( <unk> ) of the United States Department of the Interior . 
 In February 1983 , the two assistant directorates were merged to promote efficiency and recognize the interdependency of their programs . Jerry L. Rogers was selected to direct this newly merged associate directorate . He was described as a skilled administrator , who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPOs , academia , and local governments . 
 Although not described in detail in the 1966 act , SHPOs eventually became integral to the process of listing properties on the National Register . The 1980 amendments of the 1966 law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the National Register . Several 1992 amendments of the NHPA added a category to the National Register , known as Traditional Cultural Properties : those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups . 
 The National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its legislative origins in 1966 . In 1986 , citizens and groups nominated 3 @,@ 623 separate properties , sites , and districts for inclusion on the National Register , a total of 75 @,@ 000 separate properties . Of the more than one million properties on the National Register , 80 @,@ 000 are listed individually . Others are listed as contributing members within historic districts . 
 = = Property owner incentives = = 
 Properties are not protected in any strict sense by the Federal listing . States and local zoning bodies may or may not choose to protect listed historic places . Indirect protection is possible , by state and local regulations on development of National Register properties , and by tax incentives . 
 Until 1976 , federal tax incentives were virtually non @-@ existent for buildings on the National Register . Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing , sometimes historical , structures . In 1976 , the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income @-@ producing historic properties . The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives . A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior 's Standards for Rehabilitation . Properties and sites listed in the Register , as well as those located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts , became eligible for the federal tax benefits . 
 Owners of income @-@ producing properties listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or of properties that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may be eligible for a 20 % investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure . The rehabilitation may be of a commercial , industrial , or residential property , for rentals . The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program , which is managed jointly by the National Park Service , individual State Historic Preservation Offices , and the Internal Revenue Service . Aside from the 20 % tax credit , the tax incentive program offers a 10 % tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non @-@ historic , non @-@ residential buildings constructed before 1936 . 
 Some property owners may qualify for grants as well , for instance the Save America 's Treasures grants , which apply specifically to properties entered in the Register with national significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks . The Save America 's Treasures office has closed . The United States Congress did not renew the funding for the program for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 , and does not plan to re @-@ establish funding . 
 The NHPA did not distinguish between properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants . This was deliberate , as the authors of the act had learned from experience that distinguishing between categories of significance for such incentives caused the lowest category to become expendable . Essentially , this made the Landmarks a kind of " honor roll " of the most significant properties of the National Register of Historic Places . 
 = = Nomination process = = 
 Any individual can prepare a National Register nomination , although historians and historic preservation consultants often are employed for this work . The nomination consists of a standard nomination form and contains basic information about a property 's physical appearance and the type of significance embodied in the building , structure , object , site , or district . The State Historic Preservation Office receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group . After preliminary review , the SHPO sends each nomination to the state 's historic review commission , which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register . For any non @-@ Federally owned property , only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register . After the nomination is recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO , the nomination is sent to the National Park Service , which approves or denies the nomination . If approved , the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places . Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state 's historic review commission . If an owner objects to a nomination of private property , or in the case of a historic district , a majority of owners , then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places . 
 = = = Criteria = = = 
 For a property to be eligible for the National Register , it must meet at least one of the four National Register main criteria . Information about architectural styles , association with various aspects of social history and commerce , and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination . Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local , state , or national history . The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following . 
 Criterion A , " Event , " the property must make a contribution to the major pattern of American history . 
 Criterion B , " Person , " is associated with significant people of the American past . 
 Criterion C , " Design / Construction , " concerns the distinctive characteristics of the building by its architecture and construction , including having great artistic value or being the work of a master . 
 Criterion D , " Information potential , " is satisfied if the property has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to prehistory or history . 
 The criteria are applied differently for different types of properties ; for instance , maritime properties have application guidelines different from those of buildings . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 There are specific instances where properties usually do not merit listing in the National Register . As a general rule , cemeteries , birthplaces , graves of historical figures , properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes , moved structures , reconstructed historic buildings , commemorative properties , and properties that have achieved significance during the last fifty years are not qualified for listing on the Register . There are , however , exceptions to all the preceding ; mitigating circumstances allow properties classified in one of those groups to be included . 
 = = = Properties listed = = = 
 A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district , site , building , or property . However , the Register is mostly " an honorary status with some federal financial incentives . " The National Register of Historic Places automatically includes all National Historic Landmarks as well as all historic areas administered by the National Park Service . Landmarks such as these include : National Historic Sites ( NHS ) , National Historical Parks , National Military Parks / Battlefields , National Memorials , and some National Monuments . Occasionally , historic sites outside the country 's borders , but associated with the United States , such as the American Legation in Tangiers , also are listed . 
 Listing in the National Register does not restrict private property owners from the use of their property . Some states and municipalities , however , may have laws that become effective when a property is listed in the National Register . If federal money or a federal permitting process is involved , Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is invoked . Section 106 requires the federal agency involved to assess the effect of its actions on historic resources . <unk> , the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ( ACHP ) has the most significant role by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act . The section requires that the director of any federal agency with direct or indirect jurisdiction of a project that may affect a property listed or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places , must first report to the Advisory Council . The director of said agency is required to " take into account the effect of the undertaking " on the National Register property , as well as to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment . 
 While Section 106 does not mandate explicitly that any federal agency director accept the advice of the ACHP , their advice has practical influence , especially given the statutory obligations of the NHPA that require federal agencies to " take into account the effect of the undertaking . " 
 In cases where the ACHP determines federal action will have an " adverse effect " on historic properties , mitigation is sought . Typically , a Memorandum of Agreement ( MOA ) is created by which the involved parties agree to a particular plan . Many states have laws similar to Section 106 . In contrast to conditions relating to a federally designated historic district , municipal ordinances governing local historic districts often restrict certain kinds of changes to properties . Thus , they may protect the property more than a National Register listing does . 
 The Department of Transportation Act , passed on October 15 , 1966 , the same day as the National Historic Preservation Act , included provisions that addressed historic preservation . The DOT Act is much more general than Section 106 NHPA in that it refers to properties other than those listed in the Register . 
 The more general language has allowed more properties and parklands to enjoy status as protected areas by this legislation , a policy developed early in its history . The United States Supreme Court ruled in the 1971 case Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe that parklands could have the same protected status as " historic sites . " 
 = = = Multiple Property Submission = = = 
 A Multiple Property Submission ( MPS ) is a thematic group listing of the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group . Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties to be included in the National Register . 
 The process begins with the Multiple Property Documentation Form , which acts as a cover document rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places . The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties . The information of the Multiple Property Documentation Form can be used to nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously , or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future . Thus , additions to an MPS can occur over time . 
 The nomination of individual properties in an MPS is accomplished in the same manner as other nominations . The name of the " thematic group " denotes the historical theme of the properties . It is considered the " multiple property listing . " Once an individual property or a group of properties is nominated and listed in the National Register , the Multiple Property Documentation Form , combined with the individual National Register of Historic Places Nomination Forms , constitute a Multiple Property Submission . Examples of MPS include the Lee County Multiple Property Submission , the Warehouses in Omaha , the Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia , and the Illinois Carnegie Libraries . Before the term " Multiple Property Submission " was introduced in 1984 , such listings were known as " Thematic Resources " , such as the Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource , or " Multiple Resource Areas . " 
 = = Types of properties = = 
 Listed properties are generally in one of five broad categories , although there are special considerations for other types of properties that in any one , or into more specialized subcategories . The five general categories for National Register properties are : building , structure , site , district , and object . In addition , historic districts consist of contributing and non @-@ contributing properties . 
 Buildings , as defined by the National Register , are distinguished in the traditional sense . Examples include a house , barn , hotel , church , or similar construction . They are created primarily to shelter human activity . The term building , as in outbuilding , can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units , such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn and a house . 
 Structures differ from buildings in that they are functional constructions meant to be used for purposes other than sheltering human activity . Examples include an aircraft , a grain elevator , a gazebo , and a bridge . 
 Objects are usually artistic in nature , or small in scale compared to structures and buildings . Although objects may be movable , they are generally associated with a specific setting or environment . Examples of objects include monuments , sculptures , and fountains . 
 Sites are the locations of significant events , which can be prehistoric or historic in nature and represent activities or buildings ( standing , ruined , or vanished ) . When sites are listed , it is the locations themselves that are of historical interest . They possesses cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any structures that currently exist at the locations . Examples of types of sites include shipwrecks , battlefields , campsites , natural features , and rock shelters . 
 Historic districts possess a concentration , association , or continuity of the other four types of properties . Objects , structures , buildings , and sites in a historic district are united historically or aesthetically , either by choice or by the nature of their development . 
 There are several other different types of historic preservation associated with the properties of the National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts . Through the National Park Service , the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of different types of properties . Although the criteria are always the same , the manner they are applied may differ slightly , depending upon the type of property involved . The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation , historic battlefields , archaeological sites , aviation properties , cemeteries , and burial places , historic designed landscapes , mining sites , post offices , properties associated with significant persons , properties achieving significance within the last fifty years , rural historic landscapes , traditional cultural properties , and vessels and shipwrecks . 
 = = Recent past = = 
 In American historic preservation , the fifty @-@ year rule is the generally held belief that a property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places unless it is at least fifty years old . Actually , this rule is not a hard rule at all ; it is an exception to the National Register 's criteria for evaluation . As stated by John H. Sprinkle , Jr . , Deputy Director of the Federal Preservation Institute , “ this ‘ rule ’ is only an exception to the criteria that shape listings within the National Register of Historic Places . Of the eight ' exceptions ' [ or criteria considerations ] , Consideration G , for properties that have achieved significance within the past fifty years , is probably the best @-@ known , yet also misunderstood preservation principle in America . ” 
 With each passing year , a new group of resources crosses the fifty @-@ year threshold , that were before considered “ too recent ” for listing on the National Register of Historic Places ( unless they were exceptionally significant ) . The preservation of these “ underage ” resources has gained increasing attention in recent years .
