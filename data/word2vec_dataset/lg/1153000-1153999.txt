 Ehrhoff attended the Sharks ' subsequent training camp following the draft , but was returned to Germany as an early cut on 11 September 2001 . Continuing to play for Krefeld , he notched 24 points in 46 games . Despite impressing with his skating and offensive skills at the Sharks ' 2002 training camp , he was returned to Krefeld for the second straight year . After notching a German career @-@ high 27 points in 48 games in 2002 – 03 , Ehrhoff helped Krefeld win a German championship in his final season with the club . He recorded nine points in the post @-@ season .

 With the expectation from Sharks management that Ehrhoff would join their organization either with the NHL club or in the AHL , he was signed to a contract on 22 June 2003 . Ehrhoff made his NHL debut on 9 October 2003 , against the Edmonton Oilers . He recorded his first point , an assist , on 15 November against the Toronto Maple Leafs . Later that month , he scored his first NHL goal , a game winner against Michael Leighton in a 3 – 2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks on 26 November . Ehrhoff was selected to play in the 2004 NHL YoungStars Game , along with teammate Jonathan Cheechoo . <unk> helping the Western Conference YoungStars to a 7 – 3 win over the East , Ehrhoff also did colour commentary during the All @-@ Star Game for a German telecast . 
 Ehrhoff was often a healthy scratch with the Sharks during his rookie season and spent time with their AHL affiliate , the Cleveland Barons . In 41 games with the Sharks during the 2003 – 04 season , Ehrhoff recorded 12 points in 41 games , while in the 27 games he played for the Barons , he notched 14 points . He began asserting himself early in his NHL career as an excellent skater with offensive capabilities . Ehrhoff then played a full season with the Barons in 2004 – 05 due to the NHL lockout , tallying 35 points in 79 games . He was chosen to represent PlanetUSA in the 2005 AHL All @-@ Star Game in Manchester , New Hampshire . 
 Returning to the Sharks in 2005 – 06 , Ehrhoff recorded a 23 @-@ point campaign . He began earning more ice time near the end of the season as he improved his defensive play . On 13 April 2006 , he scored the game @-@ winning overtime goal against the Vancouver Canucks for the Sharks to clinch a playoff berth , despite San Jose having previously been eight points out of a playoff spot with a month @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half remaining in the season . Ehrhoff added eight points over 11 post @-@ season games — first among team defencemen — in his first Stanley Cup playoffs as the Sharks were eliminated in the second round by the Edmonton Oilers . He then signed a two @-@ year contract worth US $ 1 @.@ 7 million in the off @-@ season . 
 Ehrhoff responded with a career @-@ high 33 points in 2006 – 07 . He notched a personal @-@ best three assists in one game late in the season in a 3 – 2 win against the Los Angeles Kings on 27 March 2007 . San Jose were once again losers in the second round of the playoffs , being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games . Ehrhoff had two assists in 11 post @-@ season games . His regular season production decreased to 22 points in the 2007 – 08 season . On 28 December 2007 , Ehrhoff was awarded a penalty shot during a game against the St. Louis Blues ; he missed against Manny Legace , though the Sharks nonetheless still won , 1 – 0 . Later in the season , Ehrhoff missed four games due to a lower body injury , suffered on 6 April 2008 . After finishing as the second seed in the West , San Jose were defeated in the second round against the Dallas Stars . Ehrhoff notched five assists in ten playoff games . 
 Ehrhoff became a restricted free agent once more in July 2008 and re @-@ signed with the Sharks to a three @-@ year contract worth $ 9 @.@ 3 million . The following season , 2008 – 09 , he reached the 40 @-@ point mark for the first time in his career with 42 points in 77 games . He had missed three games in March 2009 due to a lower body injury . Ehrhoff 's personal success coincided with a franchise year for the Sharks , who earned their first Presidents ' Trophy as regular season champions in team history with 117 points . In the ensuing playoffs , however , they suffered a first @-@ round defeat to the eighth @-@ seeded Anaheim Ducks . Ehrhoff was held pointless in six games .

 In the summer of 2009 , Ehrhoff was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on 28 August 2009 , along with defenceman Brad Lukowich , in exchange for prospects Patrick White and Daniel Rahimi . The deal was done primarily to clear salary cap space in anticipation of the Sharks ' acquisition of star forward Dany Heatley from the Ottawa Senators . For the Canucks , Ehrhoff 's acquisition addressed the need for a puck @-@ moving defenceman to rush the puck up the ice . 
 Ehrhoff scored his first goal in a Canucks uniform on 5 October 2009 , in a 5 – 3 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets . The following month , he notched his first two @-@ goal game in the NHL , adding an assist , in a 5 – 2 win over the Colorado Avalanche on 20 November . Late in the season , he missed two games in April 2010 due to a sprained left knee . Prior to the last game of the regular season against the Calgary Flames , Ehrhoff was awarded the Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks ' fan @-@ voted best defenceman . He finished his first season in Vancouver leading all team defencemen with career @-@ highs of 14 goals , 44 points , a + 36 rating and an average ice time of 22 : 47 minutes per game . His 44 points tied Uwe Krupp for the most points by a German @-@ born defenceman in an NHL season , while his + 36 rating broke the single @-@ season team record shared by Pavel Bure and Marek <unk> by one point ( Daniel Sedin tied with Ehrhoff for the record in 2009 – 10 , as well ) . In the subsequent 2010 playoffs , he added seven points in 12 games as Vancouver was eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round . 
 In December 2010 , Ehrhoff was struck in the ear by a puck during a game against Anaheim . He left the contest with what was initially considered a concussion ; however , he was later diagnosed with vertigo instead and missed three games . Recording new career @-@ highs in assists ( 36 ) and points ( 50 ) , he led all Canucks defencemen in scoring , while ranking seventh among League defencemen . Ehrhoff was awarded his second consecutive Babe Pratt Trophy for his regular season efforts . Having won the Presidents ' Trophy for the first time in team history , the Canucks entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West . They eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks , Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in the first three rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years . Facing the Boston Bruins , the Canucks lost the series in seven games . While Ehrhoff led Canucks defencemen and ranked second in the League overall with 12 points ( two goals and ten assists ) over 23 games , he had a team @-@ worst – 13 rating . It was revealed following the Canucks ' Game 7 defeat to Boston that he had been playing with an injured shoulder .

 Set to become an unrestricted free agent on 1 July 2011 , Ehrhoff and the Canucks failed to come to terms on a new contract . Three days ahead of his free agency , 28 June 2011 , his negotiating rights were traded to the New York Islanders in exchange for a fourth @-@ round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft . It was reported that Ehrhoff had turned down the same deal that former defensive teammate Kevin Bieksa had signed the previous day — a five @-@ year , $ 23 million contract — to remain with the Canucks . Although the Islanders had three days of exclusive negotiating rights with Ehrhoff , General Manager Garth Snow self @-@ imposed a one @-@ day deadline to sign him . Unable to agree on a contract ( Snow commented that the proposed deal was " well north " of the Canucks ' offer ) , Ehrhoff was traded to the Buffalo Sabres on 29 June in exchange for a fourth @-@ round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft . Two days later , Ehrhoff signed a ten @-@ year , $ 40 million deal with the Sabres . The contract pays him $ 18 million in the first two years , then $ 4 million annually from the third to sixth years , $ 3 million in the seventh and $ 1 million in the remaining three . Ehrhoff admitted having a desire for the freedom of unrestricted free agency , but was ultimately won over by the Sabres ' contract offer and quality as an organization able to compete for the Stanley Cup . 
 Ehrhoff made his debut with the Sabres in Helsinki as the NHL opened the 2011 – 12 season abroad , on 7 October 2011 , against the Anaheim Ducks . He recorded an assist on a Thomas Vanek goal in a 4 – 1 win . Ehrhoff recorded his first goal as a Sabre 11 days later , an empty @-@ netter to secure a 3 – 1 win over the Montreal Canadiens . He finished the year with five goals and 32 points in 66 games as the Sabres finished ninth in the Eastern Conference , failing to make the 2012 playoffs . 
 The Sabres began the process of buying @-@ out the remainder of Ehrhoff 's contract on 29 June 2014 . They will be paying Ehrhoff $ 12 million over 14 years ( around $ 850 @,@ 000 per year ) .

 On 23 August 2015 , it was confirmed by General Manager Dean Lombardi that the Los Angeles Kings signed Ehrhoff to a one @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 5 million deal . In the 2015 @-@ 16 season , Ehrhoff began the season as a regular on the blueline for the Kings . Ehrhoff struggled to perform to past expectations , and after scoring just 2 goals in 40 games was waived by the Kings and assigned to AHL affiliate , the Ontario Reign on February 11 , 2016 . 
 After 5 games with the Reign , Ehrhoff 's tenure within the Kings organization came to a close when he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for former teammate and Kings defenceman Rob Scuderi on February 26 , 2016 .

 As a junior , Ehrhoff competed for Germany 's under @-@ 18 team at the inaugural 1999 IIHF World U18 Championships , hosted in Füssen and <unk> , Germany . He returned the following year for the 2000 IIHF World U18 Championships in Switzerland , where Germany finished in seventh place . Ehrhoff then debuted at the under @-@ 20 level in Division I of the 2001 World Junior Championships . Hosting the tournament in the cities of Füssen and Landsberg , Germany missed a promotion to the main tournament the following year by finishing in second place behind France . Ehrhoff made his second appearance at the Division I level for the 2002 World Junior Championships in Austria , leading all tournament defencemen with three goals and 10 points in five games . He helped Germany earn a promotion to the main tournament for the following year , defeating Austria 7 – 1 in the gold medal game . In both years competing in the tournament , Ehrhoff earned Top Defenceman honours . 
 Two months after his final international junior appearance , Ehrhoff debuted with Germany 's senior team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City . He played in seven games as the second youngest player in the tournament . Germany was eliminated by the United States in the quarterfinal with a 5 – 0 shutout loss . Later that year , he competed in the 2002 World Championships , scoring five points in seven games . Germany was defeated in the quarterfinal by Sweden 6 – 2 . Ehrhoff made his second World Championships appearance in 2003 , but failed to register a point as Germany were once again losers in the quarterfinal round . After his rookie season in the NHL , Ehrhoff competed for Germany in the 2004 World Cup . They lost 2 – 1 to Finland in the quarterfinal . The following year , he registered an assist in six games at the 2005 World Championships . Germany finished second @-@ to @-@ last in the tournament . After failing to qualify for the quarterfinal , they won one of three games in the relegation round . 
 On 21 December 2005 , Ehrhoff was named to the German Olympic team , along with Sharks teammate Marcel Goc , for the 2006 Winter Games in Turin . His lone goal of the tournament came against Canada , a 5 – 1 loss . He added an assist in the tournament for two points in five games as Germany failed to win a preliminary game , missing out on the playoff rounds . Four years later , he was named to Germany 's Olympic team for the 2010 Winter Games in his NHL hometown of Vancouver . He went pointless in four games , while leading his team in ice time . Germany was eliminated by Canada in an 8 – 2 qualifier for the quarterfinal . 
 Shortly after the Vancouver Canucks were eliminated from the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs several months later , Ehrhoff joined Germany for the 2010 World Championships . Germany played as tournament host in the cities of Cologne and Mannheim . Joining his team midway through the tournament , he missed the first three games before scoring a goal and an assist in six contests . Germany made it to the semifinal , where they were defeated by Russia 2 – 1 . Ehrhoff assisted on Germany 's lone goal and was named his team 's player of the game . They went on to lose the bronze medal game 3 – 1 to Sweden . Their fourth @-@ place finish marked their best placing at the World Championships since 1953 when they won silver . Leading Germany in average ice time with 23 : 34 minutes per game , Ehrhoff was named to the Tournament All @-@ Star Team , along with German goaltender Dennis <unk> .

 Ehrhoff is known as an offensive defenceman . He has strong skating ability , which allows him to quickly carry the puck up the ice , starting plays from his team 's defensive zone , as well as join offensive plays deep in the opposing team 's zone .

 = Howmet TX = 
 The Howmet TX ( Turbine <unk> ) was an American sports prototype racing car designed in 1968 to test the competitive use of a gas turbine engine in sports car racing . Planned by racing driver Ray Heppenstall , the TX combined a chassis built by McKee Engineering , turbine engines leased from Continental Aviation & Engineering , and financial backing and materials from the Howmet Corporation . 
 Although not the first attempt at using a turbine powerplant in auto racing , the Howmet TX was the first and is still the only turbine to win a race , earning two Sports Car Club of America ( SCCA ) race victories and two qualifying sprint victories during its only year of competition . The TX later set six Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) land speed records for turbines after being retired from racing . 
 = = Development = = 
 Interest in the use of gas turbines as an alternative to the piston engine had been gaining support in the automobile industry during the 1960s . Chrysler had begun testing in the 1950s and began leasing their Turbine Car to the public in 1963 , while British manufacturer Rover and racing team BRM combined to build a racing car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1963 and 1965 . Both cars showed reliability but were unable to win over the public or to win at Le Mans respectively . By 1967 , team owner and car developer Andy <unk> had created the STP @-@ Paxton <unk> for the Indianapolis 500 . The car nearly won the race driven by Parnelli Jones , but suffered a mechanical failure after leading over two @-@ thirds of the event . A similar attempt with a Lotus 56 in 1968 also led to retirement after showing winning potential . 
 At the same time as <unk> 's turbine debut at Indy , racer Ray Heppenstall began to conceive a design for his own sports car to make use of a gas turbine , improving in some areas where the Rover @-@ BRM had failed several years before . Heppenstall felt that a more simplified design for the chassis could make a turbine @-@ powered car more competitive . Heppenstall originally proposed the car to Allison Engine Company and later to Williams Research . He eventually turned to fellow racer Tom Fleming for aid . Fleming was at the time vice @-@ president of Howmet Corporation , which provided castings for turbines in the aerospace industry . Heppenstall and Fleming were able to convince Howmet that their backing of a competitive and unique sports car could promote public awareness of the company . Howmet agreed to fund the project , lending their name to the car . 
 = = = Chassis = = = 
 Heppenstall began the project by purchasing a Cooper Monaco sports car , but later decided it was not the best choice for a turbine and the car was sold off . Bob McKee , owner of McKee Engineering , was then contracted by Heppenstall to build two cars brand new . The first space frame chassis was actually built from an older McKee car initially built for the Can Am series in 1966 , but adapted to house the turbine engine . The second car # GTP2 was built from scratch , allowing it to be purposely designed around the use of a turbine engine , including a chassis 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 57 mm ) longer . The chassis were known as the <unk> to McKee , but only ever raced as turbines under the Howmet TX guise . 
 The <unk> was designed around the FIA 's Group 6 regulations for sports prototypes , allowing for a completely custom mid @-@ engine layout that was only limited in terms of engine sizes available to competitors . Closed cockpit bodywork with gullwing doors was designed by Bob McKee to shroud the mid @-@ engine layout . Standard double wishbone suspension with coil springs were used with disc brakes on each wheel . A 32 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 120 L ) fuel tank was placed between the cockpit and turbine , housing Jet A fuel . 
 = = = Turbine = = = 
 The turbines to power the two Howmet TXs were leased from Continental Aviation & Engineering . The <unk> @-@ 1 gas turbines were prototypes from an aborted bid for a military helicopter contract which Continental was not putting to use at the time . The loaned turbines weighed 170 pounds ( 77 kg ) and were able to provide 350 bhp ( 260 kW ) and 650 lbf · ft ( 880 N · m ) of torque . A maximum of 57 @,@ 000 rpm was able to be reached . 
 A two @-@ stage setup used an internal power turbine to drive the rear wheels through the use of reduction gearing . Due to the wide variable output of the turbine and the high level of torque , a standard gearbox was not necessary , leaving the Howmet TX with only a single gearing speed . However , the gearing ratios were able to be quickly changed in the differential , allowing the car to be adapted to various circuits . Due to the use of a single @-@ speed transmission , there was no gearing for reverse . Although Heppenstall initially wished to do without reverse , the FIA mandated its use and a small electric motor powered by the turbine was installed , allowing the car to move in reverse . 
 The turbine itself used two large exhaust pipes . However , a third pipe was situated off @-@ center for use with a wastegate . The wastegate was designed to eliminate the lag between the driver pressing the accelerator and the turbine increasing its revolutions . Once the turbine was at its maximum revolutions , the wastegate helped regulate the amount of fuel actually entering the turbine , thus increasing or decreasing the power output . 
 Although turbines cannot have their displacement measured in the same way as a piston engine , the FIA used an equivalence formula to determine the Continental <unk> @-@ 1 's displacement of 2 @,@ 960 cubic centimetres ( 181 cu in ) , although Heppenstall has since admitted that the engine was actually above the three litre limit . This allowed the Howmet to compete in the Prototype Under 3000 cc category of the Group 6 formula . 
 = = Racing history = = 
 Following completion of the two Howmet TXs , the cars were brought to the 24 Hours of Daytona , the opening round of the 1968 International Championship for Makes . Before even entering competition the TX earned attention , and was featured prominently on the cover of the race program . Although both cars were in attendance , only the newer ( # GTP2 ) of the two was entered in the race ; the other car ( # GTP1 ) was kept as a spare . The driving team of Heppenstall , Dick Thompson , and Ed Lowther qualified with a lap time seventh fastest overall . Several competitors made early refueling stops allowing the Howmet to improve to third place but on lap 34 the turbine wastegate failed to reopen , giving the driver too much power for the corner he was in . The car spun and hit a barrier , forcing the team to retire . 
 By the 12 Hours of Sebring a few months later , the TX was able to improve its pace , this time qualifying third , only a second behind a Porsche 907 and a Ford GT40 . The turbine ran reliably at first but , as the race continued , debris damaged the turbine and caused it to shake loose from its mounts . The TX was eventually retired after six hours . Following Sebring , the International Championship returned to Europe , and the Howmet team followed . They entered the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch . <unk> problems once again caused the car to wreck , this time after only seven laps . Staying in Britain , the Howmet team entered a national sprint race at Oulton Park for British driver Hugh Dibley . The failure of a starter motor during a pit stop , however , once again denied the TX the possibility of finishing the hour @-@ long event . 
 The TX returned to the United States to contest the SCCA National Championship rather than stay in Europe for the remainder of the International Championship . Closer to home , the problems with the experimental TX were able to be overcome as the car finished its first race , the <unk> Trophy in New Cumberland , West Virginia . Heppenstall drove the car to a second @-@ place finish , setting a new lap record for the circuit . Following a retirement in Michigan , the TX next arrived at the Heart of Dixie event in Huntsville , Alabama . A short sprint race was held on the day prior to the main race in order to determine the starting order of the field . The Howmet TX was able to earn victory in the sprint , allowing it to start on pole position for the main event . From there the TX dominated the event and earned another win . These two victories marked the first @-@ ever wins by a turbine @-@ powered car in a racing event . 
 With the first victory earned by the Howmet TX , Heppenstall was once again joined by Dick Thompson for the Marlboro 300 . Once again the car won the short qualifying race to earn pole position and went on to lead every lap of the main event , winning by an eleven @-@ lap margin . Feeling that the TX was now capable of taking on European entries , both TXs were entered in the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen , another round of the International Championship . Hugh Dibley and newcomer Bob Tullius were entered in the first car , while Heppenstall and Thompson shared the second . The cars qualified eighth and ninth fastest . Following early accidents by the factory Porsches the TX cars were running third and fourth overall . The Dibley and Tullius car suffered a transmission problem in the closing hour requiring the car to crawl around the circuit until the end of the race . The other entry remained on pace until the end , finishing on the podium overall and was the highest finisher in its class . The podium earned Howmet four points towards the International Championship . 
 After the Watkins Glen success , the two cars were prepared for an attempt at the 24 Hours of Le Mans , which had been postponed until September . French aluminium company <unk> sponsored the team 's bid at the 24 hours . The same drivers were assigned to the cars , but their qualifying performance at the Circuit de la Sarthe was hampered by the long straights . Twentieth fastest was the best performance from the two cars . 
 For the race itself , mechanical problems appeared early as Thompson 's car suffered after only three laps . The fuel system was not providing enough Jet A to the turbine to allow it to produce its full power output , meaning the car had to limp down the circuit 's long straights . While that car continued at a slowed pace , the other suffered a wheel bearing failure two hours later , requiring a lengthy three @-@ hour repair . By the sixth hour of the event the car was disqualified by race officials , having covered an insufficient distance of only 60 laps . The remaining fuel @-@ starved TX did not last much longer as Thompson crashed in the Indianapolis corner . 
 With the 1968 season over , Heppenstall planned for the following year , including the development of a new multi @-@ gear transmission to replace the single speed unit . However , Howmet felt that the program was not providing adequate promotion for the company and decided to discontinue it . 
 = = = Land speed records = = = 
 Howmet decided in 1969 that although the racing program was too expensive to continue , the two cars it owned could still be put to promotional use . Heppenstall decided that he would attempt to repair the second TX chassis ( # GTP2 ) to adapt new open @-@ cockpit bodywork , earning it the name Howmet TX <unk> The new vehicle attempted to break world land speed records for turbine @-@ powered cars . With the TX Mk.II weighing approximately 1 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) , the car was able to make attempts at two classes of records thanks to the addition or subtraction of ballast . 
 On a road next to Talladega Superspeedway in August 1970 , Heppenstall drove the TX Mk.II to six records recognized by the FIA , with the timing recorded by the new International Motor Sports Association ( IMSA ) . 
 = = = Later use = = = 
 In 1971 , Howmet ended their promotional use of the two TX cars . The two chassis were sold to Rey Heppenstall for one dollar . However , because the two Continental turbines had been leased to Howmet , they had to be returned once the cars were no longer under Howmet 's control . Heppenstall eventually sold the two chassis . 
 Chassis # GTP1 was bought by Jim Brucker and stored in his personal collection in California . On display , it featured a mock @-@ up of the Continental turbine in the engine bay . The car was bought in 2006 by Bruce <unk> of Avon Aero and has been restored with an original Continental turbine . Following restoration , # GTP1 won the Sebring Trophy at the 2007 Amelia Island Concours d 'Elegance . 
 The second car , chassis # GTP2 , was converted from its open @-@ cockpit bodywork back into its original closed @-@ cockpit design in a restoration carried out in by McKee Engineering at the behest of new owner Chuck Haines . The restoration of Chassis # GTP2 was completed in July 1996 . Original Continental turbines could not be obtained , so an Allison <unk> turbine was installed . Chuck Haines participated three times to Goodwood Festival of Speed . In 2006 , It was later sold to Xavier <unk> who adapted the <unk> system to the Allison turbine . # GTP2 has since participated in the Le Mans Classic event in 2008 , 2010 and 2012 , as well as in the Classic Endurance Racing series from 2009 to 2012 . It also came back to Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2009 . It is now in the <unk> collection . 
 During Haines ' ownership of chassis # GTP2 , Bob McKee completed a spare frame , known as # <unk> , to original specification for Haines . Again , due to the lack of a Continental turbine , the Allison unit was used instead . The different powerplant required some redesign , as the exhaust was now vented out of the top of the engine cover instead of out the rear of the car . # <unk> do not have the <unk> system . Haines has entered the car in historic motorsport events , including the 2007 Goodwood Festival of Speed .

The film premiered at the 65th Cannes Film Festival , and both the film and Qureshi received positive reviews from critics Govind Nihalani noted her screen presence , comparing the actress to Smita Patil : " an earthiness , sincerity , intensity and warmth of personality , qualities that distinguished Smita , apart from the fact that she was a very fine and instinctive actress . Huma is a good enough actress on her own , someone who can stand apart from the crowd and hold her own " . Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noted , " Huma Qureshi , who 's introduced much later in the film ... is wonderful " . The Express Tribune added , " When it comes to looks , [ Huma ] is different from the typical Bollywood actors " . In 2012 Qureshi was ranked third , the highest female position , on Rediff.com 's annual list of " Bollywood 's Top Ten <unk> " ( male and female ) . Following the success of the first part , she reprised her role of <unk> in the second instalment of the Gangs of Wasseypur series , Gangs of Wasseypur – Part 2 . The film premiered in the Cannes Directors ' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival with its prequel . It opened to wide critical acclaim , and her portrayal again received positive reviews . Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India said " Huma Qureshi , with her gaudy clothes , designer sun @-@ glasses and unusual attractiveness is the hottest <unk> in Wasseypur . She beautifully lends support as a powerful man 's ' prouder ' better @-@ half , even in his worst crimes " , and Taran Adarsh found her " simply fantastic " . Both films earned her Best Female Debut and Best Supporting Actress nominations at several award ceremonies ( including the Filmfare Award ) . Qureshi described Gangs of Wasseypur as a " life @-@ changing film " . 
 That same year , Qureshi completed her three @-@ film contract with Anurag Kashyap Films by starring in Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana , a romantic comedy , which describes a quest for an ancient family dish chicken Khurana . Directed by Sameer Sharma , she played the role of a feisty Punjabi girl , Harman ( star Kunal Kapoor 's love interest ) . The film was a financial success , and Rediff.com noted that " Huma Qureshi looks right for the role and she delivers a wonderful performance " . Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis said , " [ Qureshi ] , on the other hand , is charming as the fiery <unk> , Harman . Her refreshingly natural acting style impresses again in a role that has shades of her character in the Gangs of Wasseypur " . However , Anupama Chopra found her performance to be a " little bland " .

 For her next feature , Qureshi was cast as a witch in the supernatural thriller Ek Thi Daayan ( 2013 ) , alongside Emraan Hashmi , Konkona Sen Sharma and Kalki Koechlin . Dealing with the themes of witchcraft , the film was based on ' Mobius Trips ' , a short story written by Konkona Sen Sharma 's father . It received mixed reviews from critics , but proved to be a profitable venture at the box @-@ office . Qureshi 's performance was also well received . The Indian Express said : " Qureshi has just a few good moments , but makes the most of them " while , Koimoi noted that " Qureshi has a remarkably pleasant and confident screen presence " . Raja Sen particularly praised the female cast and wrote " The three leading ladies are smashing in their roles ... Each plays their given role with frighteningly good flair , and each deserves a big hand . " After appearing in Ek Thi Daayan , Qureshi along with R. Madhavan hosted the 60th ceremony of the National Film Awards , an event presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals to honor the Best Films of the year ( then 2012 ) in the Indian cinema by the President of India . The ceremony was held on May 3 , 2013 at the <unk> Bhavan during the presidency of Pranab Mukherjee . 
 Shortly afterwards , Qureshi played the titular character in the short movie Sujata — released as one of the segments of Shorts , an anthology film by Anurag Kashyap . She played the eponymous lead as a young girl who is struggling to come out of the clutches of her tormenting cousin brother ( played by Satya Anand ) . The film was screened at Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles before its release and received generally positive reviews , and Qureshi 's performance was critically acclaimed and earned her a Special Mention Award at the ceremony . Her subsequent release that year included the underworld drama D @-@ Day , in which she was featured as Zoya Rehman , an <unk> <unk> agent with an ensemble cast including Irfan Khan , Arjun Rampal , Rishi Kapoor and Shruti Hassan . During the script narration , the director Nikhil Advani offered Qureshi the choice of which women to play , either Suraiya ( later played by Hassan ) or Zoya ; she decided on Zoya to expand her horizons as an actress . The film was a flop at the box office and received mixed feedback from critics , while Qureshi 's performance received favourable reviews ; Subhash K. Jha mentioned that Qureshi 's acting is " effortlessly appealing and effective . " 
 In 2014 , Qureshi featured in Abhishek Chaubey 's black comedy Dedh Ishqiya ( 2014 ) , a sequel to the 2010 film Ishqiya , co @-@ starring Madhuri Dixit , Arshad Warsi and Naseeruddin Shah . Dedh Ishqiya was a commercial success with earning ₹ 270 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 1 million ) in India and abroad and Qureshi received praise for her portrayal of the promiscuous companion of a con woman ( played by Dixit ) . In a 5 @-@ star review , Raja Sen commented that " Qureshi uses her fiercely intelligent eyes to great effect " , whilst Mohar Basu agreed , saying that " Huma Qureshi is brilliant and confident . The actress has in her the vivacious energy that proves her talent . " Qureshi 's last appearance of 2014 was <unk> Kohli 's music video " <unk> Di <unk> " with Ayushmann Khurrana . India Today noted ; " The chemistry the two Ayushmann and Huma share onscreen has the raw flavor of the countryside romance " . 
 The following year , Qureshi appeared as a prostitute in Sriram Raghavan 's crime thriller Badlapur , alongside Varun Dhawan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui . Raja Sen praised her acting and wrote that she " is hauntingly good as a call @-@ girl " . The film was a commercial success , and Qureshi received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress nomination . Umesh Kulkarni 's Marathi film Highway , marked her debut in the <unk> cinema . It received mixed reviews from critics , and proved to be a moderate box @-@ office success . The same year she acted in the collaborative film X : Past Is Present . It was directed by a team of eleven filmmakers with Qureshi appearing in " Knot " , a segment directed by film critic Raja Sen , where she appeared alongside <unk> Jha .

 = Landing at Nadzab = 
 The Landing at Nadzab was an airborne landing on 5 September 1943 during the New Guinea campaign of World War II in conjunction with the landing at Lae . The Nadzab action began with a parachute drop at Lae Nadzab Airport , combined with an overland force . 
 The parachute drop was carried out by the US Army 's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment and elements of the Australian Army 's 2 / 4th Field Regiment into Nadzab , New Guinea in the Markham Valley , observed by General Douglas MacArthur , circling overhead in a B @-@ 17 . The Australian 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion , 2 / 6th Field Company , and B Company , Papuan Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab after an overland and river trek that same day and began preparing the airfield . The first transport aircraft landed the next morning , but bad weather delayed the Allied build up . Over the next days , the 25th Infantry Brigade of the Australian 7th Division gradually arrived . An air crash at Jackson 's Field ultimately caused half the Allied casualties of the battle . 
 Once assembled at Nadzab , the 25th Infantry Brigade commenced its advance on Lae . On 11 September , it engaged the Japanese soldiers at Jensen 's Plantation . After defeating them , it engaged and defeated a larger Japanese force at Heath 's Plantation . During this skirmish , Private Richard Kelliher won the Victoria Cross , Australia 's highest award for gallantry . The Japanese Army elected not to fight for Lae , preferring instead to withdraw over the Saruwaged Range . This proved to be a gruelling test of endurance for the Japanese soldiers who had to struggle over the rugged mountains ; in the end , the Japanese Army managed to withdraw its forces from Salamaua and Lae , though with extensive losses from exposure and starving during the retreat . Troops of the 25th Infantry Brigade reached Lae shortly before those of the 9th Division that had been advancing on Lae from the opposite direction . 
 The development of Nadzab was delayed by the need to upgrade the Markham Valley Road . After strenuous efforts in the face of wet weather , the road was opened on 15 December . Nadzab then became the major Allied air base in New Guinea .

 = = = = Allied = = = = 
 In July 1942 , the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a series of operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul , which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk . In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first , the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of the threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia . 
 By agreement among the Allied nations , in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands , each with its own commander @-@ in @-@ chief . The South West Pacific Area , which included Australia , Indonesia , and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander . Most of the remainder , known as the Pacific Ocean Areas , came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz . There was no overall commander , and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources , setting priorities , or shifting resources from one command to the other . Such decisions had to be made on the basis of compromise , cooperation and consensus . 
 Rabaul fell within MacArthur 's area , but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz . The Japanese reaction to Task One , the seizure of the southern part of the Solomon Islands , was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion . Meanwhile , General MacArthur 's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign , Battle of Milne Bay , Battle of Buna – Gona , the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea . 
 Following these victories , the initiative in the South West Pacific passed to the Allies and General Douglas MacArthur pressed ahead with his plans for Task Two . At the Pacific Military Conference in Washington , D.C. in March 1943 , the plans were reviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The chiefs were unable to supply all the requested resources , so the plans had to be scaled back , with the capture of Rabaul postponed to 1944 . On 6 May 1943 , MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( GHQ ) in Brisbane issued Warning Instruction No. 2 , officially informing subordinate commands of the plan , which divided the Task Two operations on the New Guinea axis into three parts : 
 Occupy Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands and establish air forces thereon . 
 Seize the Lae @-@ Salamaua @-@ Finschhafen @-@ Madang area and establish air forces therein . 
 Occupy western New Britain , establishing air forces at Cape Gloucester , Arawe and Gasmata . Occupy or neutralise Talasea . 
 The second part was assigned to General Sir Thomas Blamey 's New Guinea Force . As a result , " It became obvious that any military offensive in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army , just as during the bitter campaigns of 1942 . " 
 = = = = Japanese = = = = 
 The Japanese maintained separate army and navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated with each other but were responsible to different higher authorities . Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka . Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura 's Eighth Area Army , consisting of the Seventeenth Army in the Solomon Islands , Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi 's Eighteenth Army in New Guinea , and the 6th Air Division , based at Rabaul . As a result of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae , but to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak and move them forward to Lae by barge or submarine . In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys . 
 Imamura ordered Adachi to capture the Allied bases at Wau , Bena Bena and Mount Hagen . To support these operations , Imperial General Headquarters transferred the 7th Air Division to New Guinea . On 27 July 1943 , Lieutenant General <unk> <unk> 's Fourth Air Army was assigned to Imamura 's command to control the 6th and 7th Air Divisions , the 14th Air Brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons . By June , Adachi had three divisions in New Guinea ; the 41st Division at Wewak and the 20th Division around Madang , both recently arrived from Palau , and the 51st Division in the Salamaua area , a total of about 80 @,@ 000 men . Of these only the 51st Division was in contact with the enemy . Like Blamey , Adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to bring his troops into battle . 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 The Markham River originates in the Finisterre Range and flows for 110 miles ( 180 km ) , emptying into the Huon Gulf near Lae . The Markham Valley , which rises to an elevation of 1 @,@ 210 feet ( 370 m ) , runs between the Finisterre Range to the north and the Bismarck Range to the south and varies from 6 to 12 miles ( 10 to 19 km ) wide . The valley floor is largely composed of gravel and is generally infertile . Half of its area was covered by dense kangaroo grass 4 – 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 5 m ) high , but in parts where there had been a build @-@ up of silt , Kunai grass grew from 6 to 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 5 m ) high . Rainfall was around 39 inches ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) per annum . The Markham Valley was traversable by motor vehicles in the dry season , which ran from December to April , and therefore formed part of a natural highway between the Japanese bases at Lae and Madang . 
 = = = Planning and preparation = = = 
 At Blamey 's Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters ( <unk> LHQ ) in St Lucia , Queensland , the Deputy Chief of the General Staff , Major General Frank Berryman , headed the planning process . A model of the Lae @-@ Salamaua area was constructed in a secure room at St Lucia , the windows were boarded up and two guards were posted on the door round the clock . On 16 May , Blamey held a conference with Berryman and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring , the commander of I Corps , around the model at which the details of the operation were discussed . Blamey 's operational concept was for a double envelopment of Lae , using " two of the finest divisions on the Allied side " . Major General George Wootten 's 9th Division would land east of Lae in a shore @-@ to @-@ shore operation and advance on Lae . Meanwhile , Major General George Alan Vasey 's 7th Division , in a reprise of the Battle of Buna – Gona in 1942 , would advance on Lae from the west by an overland route . Its primary role was to prevent reinforcement of the Japanese garrison at Lae by establishing itself in a blocking position across the Markham Valley . Its secondary task was to assist the 9th Division in the capture of Lae . The plan was generally known as Operation <unk> , although this was actually the GHQ code name for Lae itself . 
 Meanwhile , Major General Stanley Savige 's 3rd Division in the Wau area and Major General Horace Fuller 's US 41st Infantry Division around Morobe were ordered to advance on Salamaua so as to threaten it and draw Japanese forces away from Lae . The result was the arduous Salamaua Campaign , which was fought between June and September , and which at times looked like succeeding all too well , capturing Salamaua and forcing the Japanese back to Lae , thereby throwing Blamey 's whole strategy into disarray . 
 The <unk> plan called for the 7th Division to move in transports to Port Moresby and in coastal shipping to the mouth of the Lakekamu River . It would travel up the river in barges to Bulldog , and in trucks over the Bulldog Road to Wau and Bulolo . From there it would march overland via the Watut and Wampit Valleys to the Markham River , cross the Markham River with the aid of paratroops , and secure an airfield site . There were a number of suitable airfield sites in the Markham Valley ; Blamey selected Nadzab as the most promising . 
 Vasey pronounced the plan " a dog 's breakfast " . There were a number of serious problems . It relied on the Bulldog Road being completed , which it was not , due to the rugged nature of the country to be traversed and shortages of equipment . Even if it was , the 7th Division would have been unlikely to make the operation target date . It had taken heavy casualties in the Battle of Buna – Gona and was seriously under @-@ strength , with many men on leave or suffering from malaria . It would take time to concentrate it at its camp at Ravenshoe , Queensland on the Atherton Tableland . To bring it up to strength , the 1st Motor Brigade was disbanded in July to provide reinforcements . Reinforcements passed through the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at Canungra , Queensland , where they spent a month training under conditions closely resembling those in New Guinea . 
 The delays in getting the overland supply route organised and the 7th Division itself ready meant that , in the initial stages of the operation at least , the 7th Division would have to be maintained by air . Vasey further proposed that the bulk of his forces avoid a tiring overland march by moving directly to Nadzab by air , which increased the importance of capturing Nadzab early . MacArthur agreed to make the 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment based at nearby Gordonvale , Queensland , available to New Guinea Force to capture Nadzab . He further authorised the regiment to conduct training with the 7th Division and a number of exercises were conducted . Colonel Kenneth H. Kinsler , the commander of the 503rd , eager to discuss the Battle of Crete with the 21st Infantry Brigade 's Brigadier Ivan Dougherty , took the unusual step of parachuting into Ravenshoe . On 31 July , Vasey raised the prospect of utilising the entire regiment with Kinsler . Blamey took up the matter with MacArthur , who authorised it on 8 August . Blamey made the Australian Army transport MV Duntroon available to ship the regiment from Cairns to Port Moresby , except for the 2nd Battalion and advance party , which moved by air as originally planned . 
 The 7th Division was treated to a training film , " Loading the Douglas C @-@ 47 " , and the commander of the Advanced Echelon of Lieutenant General George Kenney 's Fifth Air Force , Major General Ennis Whitehead , made five C @-@ 47 Dakota transports available to the 7th Division each day so they could practise loading and unloading . Whitehead also made a Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress available so Vasey could fly low over the target area on 7 August . Meanwhile , the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion and 2 / 6th Field Company practiced crossing the <unk> River with folding boats . They flew to Tsili Tsili Airfield on 23 and 24 August . 
 To give the paratroops some artillery support , Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2 / 4th Field Regiment proposed dropping some of its eight short 25 @-@ pounders by parachute . A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected . On 30 August , Vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at Rogers Airfield . This turned out to be the easy part . Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August . Two were handed over for training while , as a precaution , the remaining six were sent the 2 / 117th Field Workshops for inspection and checking . All six were condemned , owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture . On 30 August , the gunners received orders to move out the next day , so the 2 / 51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns , which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun . Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight . Eight of the 2 / 4th Field Regiment ’ s Mark II 25 @-@ pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of filings in the buffer system . Vasey was less than impressed . 
 Vasey was concerned about the Japanese strength in the Lae area , which his staff estimated at 6 @,@ 400 , in addition to the 7 @,@ 000 that Herring 's I Corps staff estimated were in the Salamaua area . However , a more immediate danger was posed by the Japanese Fourth Air Army at Wewak . Photographs taken by Allied reconnaissance planes showed 199 Japanese aircraft on the four fields there on 13 August . On 17 August , Whitehead 's heavy and medium bombers and fighters , escorted by fighters , bombed Wewak . Taking the Japanese by surprise , they destroyed around 100 Japanese aircraft on the ground . In September , the Japanese Army air forces had at their disposal only 60 or 70 operational aircraft to oppose the Allied air forces in New Guinea , although both the 6th and 7th Air Divisions were in the area . 
 On the south bank of the Markham River lay Markham Point , where the Japanese maintained a force of about 200 men on commanding ground . Part of the 24th Infantry Battalion was ordered to capture the position . The attack on the morning of 4 September went wrong from the start , with two scouts being wounded by a land mine . The force fought its way into the Japanese position but took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw . Twelve Australians were killed and six were wounded in the attack . It was then decided to merely contain the Japanese force at Markham Point , which was subjected to mortar fire and an airstrike . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Assault = = = 
 Transport aircraft were controlled by the 54th Troop Carrier Wing , which was commanded by Colonel Paul H. Prentiss , with his headquarters at Port Moresby . He had two groups under his command : the 374th Troop Carrier Group at Ward 's Field and the 375th Troop Carrier Group at Dobodura , plus the 65th and 66th Troop Carrier Squadrons of the <unk> Troop Carrier Group at Jackson 's Field . In addition , Prentiss could draw on the 317th Troop Carrier Group at Archerfield Airport and RAAF Base Townsville , although it was not under his command . <unk> the operation from August to September 1943 allowed for the arrival of the 433rd Troop Carrier Group from the United States . Each squadron was equipped with 13 C @-@ 47 aircraft , and each group consisted of four squadrons , for a total of 52 aircraft per group . 
 The actual date was chosen by General Kenney based on the advice of his two weather @-@ forecasting teams , one Australian and one American . Ideally , Z @-@ Day would be clear from Port Moresby to Nadzab but foggy over New Britain , thereby preventing the Japanese air forces at Rabaul from intervening . Forecasting the weather days in advance with such precision was difficult enough in peacetime , but more so in wartime , when many of the areas from which the weather patterns developed were occupied by the enemy and data from them was consequently denied to the forecasters . When the two teams differed over the best possible date , Kenney " split the difference between the two forecasts and told General MacArthur we would be ready to go on the morning of the 4th for the amphibious movement of the 9th Division to Hopoi Beach and about nine o ’ clock on the morning of the 5th we would be ready to fly the 503rd Parachute Regiment to Nadzab . " 
 Z @-@ Day , 5 September 1943 , dawned with inauspiciously bad weather . Fog and rain shrouded both the departure airfields , Jackson 's and Ward 's but , as the forecasters had predicted , by 0730 the fog began to dissipate . The first C @-@ 47 took off at <unk> . The formation of 79 C @-@ 47s , each carrying 19 or 20 paratroops , was divided into three flights . The first , consisting of 24 C @-@ 47s from the <unk> Troop Carrier Group from Jackson 's , carried 1st Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment . The second , of 31 C @-@ 47s from the 375th Troop Carrier Group from Ward 's , carried the 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment . The third , consisting of 24 C @-@ 47s of 317th Troop Carrier Group , from Jackson 's , carried the 3rd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment . Each battalion had its own drop zone . The transports were escorted by 48 P @-@ 38 Lightning fighters from the 35th and 475th Fighter Groups , 12 P @-@ 39 Airacobras from the 36th Fighter Squadron , 8th Fighter Group and 48 P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts from the 348th Fighter Group . 
 When Kenney informed MacArthur that he planned to observe the operation from a B @-@ 17 , MacArthur reminded Kenney of his orders to keep out of combat , orders that Brigadier General Kenneth Walker had disobeyed at the cost of his life . Kenney went over the reasons why he thought he should go , ending with " They were my kids and I was going to see them do their stuff . " MacArthur replied " You ’ re right , George , we ’ ll both go . They ’ re my kids , too . " 
 Three hundred and two aircraft from eight different airfields in the Moresby and Dobodura areas , made a rendezvous over Tsili Tsili at 10 : 07 , flying through clouds , passes in the mountains , and over the top . " Not a single squadron , " wrote General Kenney , " did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on the final flight down the Watut Valley , turned to the right down the Markham , and went directly to the target . " Leading the formation were 48 B @-@ 25s from the 38th and 345th Bombardment Groups whose job was to " sanitise " the drop zones by dropping their loads of sixty 20 @-@ pound ( 9 @.@ 1 kg ) fragmentation bombs and strafing with the eight .50 @-@ calibre machine guns mounted in their noses . They were followed by seven A @-@ 20s of the 3rd Bombardment Group ( Light ) . Each carried four M10 smoke tanks mounted under the wings . The smoke tanks were each filled with 19 US gallons ( 72 l ) of the smoke agent FS . In two groups of two and one of three flying at 250 feet ( 76 m ) at 225 mph ( 362 km / h ) , they laid three smoke curtains adjacent to the three drop zones . The lead aircraft discharged two tanks , waited four seconds , then discharged the other two . The following aircraft went through the same procedure , creating a slight overlap to insure a continuous screen . Conditions were favourable , while the 85 % humidity kept the screens effective for five minutes and stopped their dispersal for ten . 
 Next came the C @-@ 47s , flying at 400 to 500 feet ( 122 to 152 m ) at 100 to 105 mph ( 161 to 169 km / h ) . Dropping commenced at 10 : 22 . Each aircraft dropped all its men in ten seconds and the whole regiment was unloaded in four and a half minutes . Following the transports came five B @-@ 17s with their racks loaded with 300 lb ( 140 kg ) packages with parachutes , to be dropped to the paratroopers on call by panel signals as they needed them . This mobile supply unit stayed for much of the day , eventually dropping 15 tons of supplies . A group of 24 B @-@ 24s and four B @-@ 17s , which left the column just before the junction of the Watut and the Markham attacked the Japanese defensive position at Heath 's Plantation , about halfway between Nadzab and Lae . Five B @-@ 25 weather aircraft were used along the route and over the passes , to keep the units informed on weather to be encountered during their flights to the rendezvous . Generals MacArthur , Kenney , and Vasey observed the operation , from separate B @-@ 17s . Later , MacArthur received the Air Medal for having " personally led the American paratroopers " and " skillfully directed this historic operation " . During the operation , including the bombing of Heath ’ s , a total of 92 long tons ( 93 t ) of high @-@ explosive bombs was dropped , 32 long tons ( 33 t ) of fragmentation bombs were dropped and 42 @,@ 580 rounds of .50 calibre and 5 @,@ 180 rounds of .30 calibre ammunition were expended . 
 No air opposition was encountered , and only one C @-@ 47 failed to make the drop . Its cargo door blew off during the flight , damaging its elevator . It safely returned to base . Three paratroopers were killed in the drop ; two fell to their deaths when their parachutes malfunctioned while another landed in a tree and then fell some 66 feet ( 20 m ) to the ground . There were 33 minor injuries caused by rough landings . The three battalions met no opposition on the ground and formed up in their assembly areas . This took some time due to the tropical heat and the high grass . 
 Five C @-@ 47s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group carrying the gunners of the 2 / 4th Field Regiment took off from Ward 's Airfield after the main force and landed at Tsili Tsili . After an hour on the ground , they set out for Nadzab . Most jumped from the first two aircraft . The next three aircraft dropped equipment , including the dismantled guns . The " pushers out " followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop . One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop . The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in the tall grass . Enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within two and a half hours of dropping , although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning . It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun . At 1515 , two B @-@ 17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition . Their dropping was accurate , but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes .

 Meanwhile , a force under Lieutenant Colonel J. T. Lang , consisting of the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion , 2 / 6th Field Company , and detachments from the 7th Division Signals , 2 / 5th Field Ambulance and ANGAU , with 760 native carriers , set out from Tsili Tsili on 2 September . Most of the force moved overland , reaching Kirkland 's Crossing on 4 September , where it rendezvoused with B Company , Papuan Infantry Battalion . That night , a party of engineers and pioneers set out from Tsili Tsili in 20 small craft , sailed and paddled down the Watut and Markham Rivers to join Lang 's force at Kirkland 's Crossing . The small river @-@ borne task force included 10 British 5 @-@ ton folding assault boats and Hoehn military <unk> which met up with 2 / 6 Independent Commandos who had reconnoitered the proposed crossing area with 8 of these <unk> the day before . While neither river was deep , both were fast flowing , with shoals and hidden snags . Three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned . On the morning of 5 September , Lang 's force was treated to the sight of the air force passing overhead . At this point , the Markham River formed three arms , separated by broad sand bars . Two were fordable but the other was deep and flowing at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . Using the folding boats and local timber , they constructed a pontoon bridge , allowing the whole force to cross the river safely with all their equipment . That evening , they reached the Americans ' position . 
 The next day they went to work on the airstrip with hand tools . Trees were felled , potholes filled in and a windsock erected . Fourteen gliders were supposed to fly in three light tractors , three mowers , a wheeled rake and other engineering equipment from Dobodura . Because the lack of opposition made immediate resupply non @-@ urgent , and because he had doubts about the proficiency of the glider pilots , whom he knew had undergone only minimal training , General Blamey decided that the glider operation was not worth the risk to the glider pilots or their passengers and cancelled it , substituting instead the afternoon supply run by specially modified B @-@ 17s . Lacking mowers , the Kunai grass was cut by hand by the pioneers , sappers , paratroops and native civilians and burned , causing the destruction of some stores and equipment that had been lost in the long grass and " a swirl of black dust " . By 11 : 00 on 6 September , the 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) strip — which had not been used for over a year — had been extended to 3 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 The first plane to land was an L @-@ 4 Piper Cub at <unk> 6 September , bringing with it Colonel Murray C. Woodbury , the commander of the U.S. Army 's 871st Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion . Three transports followed , nearly running down some of the throng working on the strip . Another 40 aircraft followed in the afternoon , many containing American and Australian engineers . The 871st followed the next day with its small air @-@ portable bulldozers and graders . They located a site for a new airstrip , which became known as No. 1 , the existing one becoming No. 2 . The site proved to be an excellent one ; an old , dry riverbed with soil largely composed of gravel . A gravel base and steel plank was laid to accommodate the fighters based at Tsili Tsili that were in danger of bogging down when the weather deteriorated . By the end of October there were four airstrips at Nadzab , one of which was 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) long and sealed with bitumen . 
 While engineers and anti @-@ aircraft gunners arrived from Tsili Tsili , no infantry arrived from Port Moresby on 6 September because of bad flying weather over the Owen Stanley Range , although the 2 / 25th Infantry Battalion was flown to Tsili Tsili . On 7 September , reveille was sounded for the 2 / 33rd Infantry Battalion at 03 : 30 and the unit boarded trucks of the 158th General Transport Company that took it to marshalling areas near the airfields in preparation for the movement to Nadzab . At 04 : 20 , B @-@ 24 Liberator 42 @-@ <unk> " Pride of the Cornhuskers " of the 43rd Bombardment Group piloted by 2nd Lieutenant Howard Wood set out from Jackson 's Airfield on a reconnaissance sortie to Rabaul , with a full load of 2 @,@ 800 imperial gallons ( 13 @,@ 000 l ) of fuel and four 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bombs . It clipped a tree at the end of the runway , crashed into two other trees and exploded , killing all eleven crewmen on board instantly and spraying burning fuel over a large area . Five of the 158th General Transport Company 's trucks containing men of the 2 / 33rd Infantry Battalion were hit and burst into flames . Every man in those trucks was killed or injured ; 15 were killed outright , 44 died of their wounds and 92 were injured but survived . Despite the disaster , the 2 / 33rd Infantry Battalion flew out to Tsili Tsili as scheduled . 
 Due to the unpredictable weather , aircraft continued to arrive at Nadzab sporadically . Only the 2 / 25th Infantry Battalion and part of the 2 / 33rd had reached Nadzab by the morning of 8 September when Vasey ordered the commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade , Brigadier Ken Eather , to initiate the advance on Lae . That day there were 112 landings at Nadzab . On 9 September , as the advance began , the rest of the 2 / 33rd Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab from Tsili Tsili , but while there were 116 landings at Nadzab , bad weather prevented the 2 / 31st Infantry Battalion from leaving Port Moresby . Finally , on 12 September , after three non @-@ flying days , the 2 / 31st Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab on some of the 130 landings on the two strips at Nadzab that day . 
 On 13 September , a platoon of the 2 / 25th Infantry Battalion came under very heavy fire from a concealed Japanese machine gun near Heath 's Plantation that wounded a number of Australians , including Corporal W. H. ( Billy ) Richards , and halted the platoon 's advance . Private Richard Kelliher suddenly , on his own initiative , dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it , which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all . He returned to his section , seized a Bren gun , dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it . He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards , which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position . Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 North of the main advance , a patrol from Lieutenant Colonel John J. Tolson 's 3rd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment , encountered a force of 200 Japanese crossing the Bumbu River on 15 September . The Americans engaged the Japanese force and reported inflicting heavy losses . The arrival of that day of the first units of Brigadier Ivan Dougherty 's 21st Infantry Brigade at Nadzab at last allowed the paratroopers to be relieved . 
 By this time , the 9th Division was about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) East of Lae , while the 7th Division was 7 miles ( 11 km ) away and " it appeared an odds @-@ on bet that the 9th would reach Lae first " . The 7th Division resumed its advance at dawn on 16 September . The last ten Japanese troops facing the 2 / 33rd Infantry Battalion were killed and the 2 / 25th Infantry Battalion passed through its position and headed for Lae . As they moved down the Markham Valley Road , they occasionally encountered sick Japanese soldiers who held the column momentarily . Brigadier Eather came up in his jeep and started urging the diggers to hurry up . They were unimpressed . Eather , armed with a pistol , then acted as leading scout , with his troops following in a column of route behind him . The column entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese but aircraft of the Fifth Air Force strafed the 2 / 33rd Infantry Battalion and dropped parachute fragmentation bombs , wounding two men . Whitehead soon received a message sent in the clear from Vasey that read : " Only the Fifth Air Force bombers are preventing me from entering Lae . " By early afternoon , the 2 / 31st Infantry Battalion reached the Lae airfield where it killed 15 Japanese soldiers and captured one . The 25th Infantry Brigade then came under fire from the 9th Division 's 25 @-@ pounders , wounding one soldier . Vasey and Eather tried every available means to inform Wootten of the situation . A message eventually reached him through RAAF channels at 14 : 25 and the artillery was silenced . 
 = = = Japanese withdrawal = = = 
 On 8 September , Adachi ordered Nakano to abandon Salamaua and fall back on Lae . Nakano had already evacuated his hospital patients and artillery to Lae . On 11 September , his main body began to withdraw . By this time , it was clear that Blamey intended to cut off and destroy the 51st Division . After discussing the matter with Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo , Imamura and Adachi called off their plans to capture Bena Bena and Mount Hagen and instructed Nakano and <unk> to move overland to the north coast of the Huon Peninsula while the 20th Division moved from Madang to Finschhafen , sending one regiment down the Ramu valley to assist the 51st Division . The Salamaua garrison assembled at Lae on 14 September , and the Japanese evacuated the town over the next few days . It was a retreating band that contacted the 3rd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment . The Japanese hurriedly altered their route before the Australians could intercept them . 
 Crossing the Saruwaged Range proved to be a gruelling test of endurance for the Japanese soldiers . They started out with ten days ' rations but this was exhausted by the time they reached Mount <unk> . The 51st Division had already abandoned most of its heavy equipment ; now , many soldiers threw away their rifles . " The <unk> crossing " , wrote Lieutenant General Kane <unk> , " took far longer than had been expected , and its difficulties were beyond discussion . Near the mountain summits the cold was intense and sleep was quite impossible all the cold night ; they could only doze beside the fire . Squalls came , the ice spread and they advanced through snow under this tropical sky . Gradually the road they were climbing became a descending slope , but the inclination was so steep that if they missed their footing they would fall thousands and thousands of feet — and how many men lost their lives like that ! " 
 In the end , the Japanese Army could take pride in conducting a creditable defence in the face of an impossible tactical situation . " Fortune and Nature , however , favoured a valiant defender despite the equally valiant striving of the attackers . "

 = = = Casualties = = = 
 The 503rd Parachute Infantry lost three men killed and 33 injured in the jump . Another eight were killed and 12 wounded in action against the Japanese , and 26 were evacuated sick . The 2 / 5th Field Ambulance treated 55 jump casualties on 7 September . Between 5 and 19 September , the 7th Division reported 38 killed and 104 wounded , while another 138 were evacuated sick . To this must be added the 11 Americans and 59 Australians killed and 92 Australians injured in the air crash at Jackson 's Airfield . Thus , 119 Allied servicemen were killed , 241 wounded or injured , and 166 evacuated sick . Japanese casualties were estimated at 2 @,@ 200 , but it is impossible to apportion them between the 7th and 9th Divisions . 
 = = = Base development = = = 
 The development of Nadzab depended on heavy construction equipment which had to be landed at Lae and moved over the Markham Valley Road . The job of improving the road was assigned to the 842nd Engineer Aviation Battalion , which arrived at Lae on 20 September but after a few days ' work it was ordered to relieve the 871st Airborne Aviation Battalion at Nadzab . The 842nd reached Nadzab on 4 October but a combination of unseasonable rainfall and heavy military traffic destroyed the road surface and closed the road , forcing Nadzab to be supplied from Lae by air . The 842nd then had to resume work on the road , this time from the Nadzab end . Heavy rain was experienced on 46 of the next 60 days . The road was reopened on 15 December , allowing the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Engineer Aviation Battalions and No. 62 Works Wing RAAF to move to Nadzab to work on the development of the airbase . 
 The airbase would eventually consist of four all @-@ weather airfields . No 1 had a 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) runway surfaced with Marsden Matting and a 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) runway surfaced with bitumen . No. 2 had a 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) runway partially surfaced with bitumen . No. 3 had a 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) runway surfaced with bitumen in the centre with 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) of Marsden mat at either end . No. 4 , an RAAF airfield named Newton after Flight Lieutenant William Ellis Newton , had two parallel 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) runways surfaced with bitumen . Nadzab became the Allied Air Forces ' main base in New Guinea . 
 = = = Outcome = = = 
 General Blamey declared the capture of Lae and Salamaua to be " a signal step on the road to Victory " . Lieutenant General John J. Tolson described the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment 's operation at Nadzab as " probably the classic text @-@ book airborne operation of World War II " . Coming after the impressive but flawed performance of the airborne arm in the Allied invasion of Sicily , Nadzab influenced thinking about the value of airborne operations . 
 However , the impact was far greater than anyone on the Allied side realised , and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea . Imperial General Headquarters had regarded the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna – Gona as setbacks only , and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific . Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over @-@ extended . A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea , the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands . Henceforth , positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line . General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory , but only with holding on as long as possible so as to delay the Allied advance . 
 = SMS Königsberg ( 1905 ) = 
 SMS Königsberg ( " His Majesty 's Ship Königsberg " ) was the lead ship of her class of light cruisers built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . Named after Königsberg , the capital of East Prussia , she was laid down in January 1905 , launched in December of that year , and completed by June 1906 . Her class included three other ships : Stettin , Stuttgart , and Nürnberg . Königsberg was armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and had a top speed of 24 @.@ 1 knots ( 44 @.@ 6 km / h ; 27 @.@ 7 mph ) . 
 After her commissioning , Königsberg served with the High Seas Fleet 's reconnaissance force . During this period , she frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht on visits to foreign countries . In April 1914 , the ship was sent on what was to have been a two @-@ year deployment to German East Africa , but this was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in August of that year . Königsberg initially attempted to raid British and French commercial traffic in the region , but only destroyed one merchant ship in the course of her career . Coal shortages hampered her ability to attack shipping . On 20 September 1914 , she surprised and sank the British protected cruiser HMS Pegasus in the Battle of Zanzibar . 
 Königsberg then retreated into the Rufiji River to repair her engines . Before the repairs could be completed , British cruisers located Königsberg , and , unable to steam into the river to destroy her , set up a blockade . After several attempts to sink the ship during the Battle of Rufiji Delta , the British sent two monitors , Mersey and Severn , to destroy the German cruiser . On 11 July 1915 , the two monitors got close enough to severely damage Königsberg , forcing her crew to scuttle the ship . The surviving crew salvaged all ten of her main guns and joined Lieutenant Colonel Paul von Lettow @-@ Vorbeck 's guerrilla campaign in East Africa . Königsberg was partially broken up in 1963 – 65 for scrap , and the remains sank into the riverbed . 
 = = Design = = 
 Königsberg and her sisters were designed to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in Germany 's colonial empire . This was a result of budgetary constraints that prevented the Kaiserliche Marine from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles . 
 Königsberg was 115 @.@ 3 meters ( 378 ft 3 in ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 2 m ( 43 ft 4 in ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 29 m ( 17 ft 4 in ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 814 t ( 3 @,@ 754 long tons ; 4 @,@ 204 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by eleven coal @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers rated at 13 @,@ 020 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 709 kW ) . These provided a top speed of 24 @.@ 1 knots ( 44 @.@ 6 km / h ; 27 @.@ 7 mph ) and a range of approximately 5 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 650 km ; 6 @,@ 620 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Königsberg had a crew of 14 officers and 308 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . There were two side by side forward on the forecastle , six amidships , three on either side , and two side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . Königsberg also carried ten 5 @.@ 2 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) SK guns in single mounts . She was also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower sides were 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Königsberg was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Meteor " and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 12 January 1905 . She was launched on 12 December 1905 , when the Oberbürgermeister of Königsberg , Siegfried <unk> , christened the ship , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet for sea trials on 6 April 1907 . Her trials were interrupted at the beginning of June when she was tasked with escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht Hohenzollern during three sailing regattas including Kiel Week . The two ships then cruised the North Sea and stopped at Nordkapp , where from 3 to 6 August , Wilhelm II met Czar Nicholas II of Russia . After returning to Germany , Königsberg resumed her sea trials , which lasted from 9 August to 9 September . She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later assigned to the fleet scouting forces to replace the cruiser Medusa on 5 November . At this time , Königsberg was again used to escort Wilhelm II 's yacht , this time in company with the new armored cruiser Scharnhorst and the dispatch boat Sleipner on a visit to Britain . The ships stopped in Portsmouth and the Thames , and were visited by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands . 
 On 17 December , Königsberg was tasked with another goodwill visit , this time escorting the Kaiser 's brother , Prince Heinrich , and a delegation of naval officers to Malmö , Sweden to meet King Oscar II . The visit lasted until 20 December . Königsberg participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual and squadron training for 1908 without incident . The year ended with a major training cruise , first in the Baltic and North Sea and later into the Atlantic , that ended in early December . The ship then went into drydock over the winter of 1908 – 09 for periodic maintenance , emerging for service again in early February 1909 . A typical training routine followed for the next two years , interrupted only by a collision with the new cruiser Dresden on 16 February 1910 in the Kiel Bay , and two trips escorting the Kaiser in 1910 ; the first to Helgoland on 9 – 13 March and the second to Britain from 8 to 27 May . The collision with Dresden caused significant damage to both ships , though no one on either vessel was injured . Both ships were repaired in Kiel . Dresden also won the Kaiser 's Schießpreis ( Shooting Prize ) for excellent gunnery in the reconnaissance force during this period . From December 1909 to September 1910 , Fregattenkapitän ( Frigate Captain ) Adolf von Trotha served as the ship 's commander . 
 From 8 March to 22 May 1911 , Königsberg cruised in the Mediterranean Sea with Wilhelm II aboard Hohenzollern . On 10 June , Königsberg was replaced in the reconnaissance force by the new cruiser Kolberg ; Königsberg was transferred to Danzig , where she was placed out of service on 14 June for modernization work . On 22 January 1913 , the ship was recommissioned for service with the fleet , to replace the cruiser Mainz which was also being modernized . This service lasted until 19 June , when Königsberg was again placed in reserve in Kiel . During this period of active service , she was assigned to the training squadron from 1 to 18 April . In early 1914 , the high command decided to send Königsberg to German East Africa , where she would replace the current station ship , the old unprotected cruiser Geier . 
 On 1 April 1914 , Fregattenkapitän Max Looff took command of the ship . Königsberg left Kiel on 25 April , stopped in Wilhelmshaven , and then left three days later for a two @-@ year deployment to German East Africa . She steamed into the Mediterranean Sea and stopped in Spanish and Italian ports before entering the Suez Canal . After passing through the canal , she stopped briefly in Aden before arriving in Dar es Salaam , the capital of German East Africa , on 5 June . Two days later , the Schutztruppe ( Protection Force ) celebrated their 25th anniversary in the colony ; the deputy commander of the Schutztruppe presented Looff with a model of the cruiser Schwalbe , which had been the longest serving warship with the unit . Königsberg surveyed the harbor at Bagamoyo later in the year . The African colonial subjects considered the ship to be quite impressive , particularly her three funnels , which were assumed to signify a warship more powerful than one with only two funnels . The ship acquired the nickname <unk> na bomba tatu , or " the man of war with three pipes " . 
 As tensions in Europe rose in the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores . He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area . On 27 July , Looff received a message from the Admiralstab ( Admiralty Staff ) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe . Concurrently , the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron , HMS Astraea , Hyacinth , and Pegasus , arrived with the intention of bottling up Königsberg at the colony 's capital Dar es Salaam . Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914 , with the three slower British ships shadowing him . Looff used a rain squall and his ship 's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day . Königsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August , when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I , Königsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around the entrance to the Red Sea . A lack of coal hampered Looff 's efforts ; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to Königsberg . Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal , where she would have been confiscated . Königsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels , whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop . Königsberg was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war . 
 On 6 August , Königsberg found a British ship off the coast of Oman , the freighter City of Winchester . A prize crew took the ship along with Königsberg , and the two vessels met Zieten four days later in the <unk> <unk> Islands , where coal from City of Winchester was transferred to Königsberg . The freighter was thereafter sunk . The British crew was taken aboard Zieten , which departed the following day and stopped in Mozambique . Meanwhile , the steamer Somali , under the command of Korvettenkapitän ( Corvette Captain ) Zimmer , had left Dar es Salaam with a cargo of 1 @,@ 200 t ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ; 1 @,@ 300 short tons ) of coal on the night of 3 – 4 August to resupply Königsberg ; the two ships met ten days later . By the time Looff rendezvoused with Somali , his ship was down to a mere 14 t ( 14 long tons ; 15 short tons ) of coal . Somali transferred some 850 t ( 840 long tons ; 940 short tons ) of coal to the cruiser , which permitted a sweep to Madagascar . No British or French ships were found , however , and so Königsberg met Somali again on 23 August and took on coal for four days of cruising . 
 In the meantime , British warships bombarded Dar es Salaam and destroyed the German wireless station there . By this time , Königsberg 's engines required a thorough overhaul , and Looff needed to find a secluded area where the work could be completed . He settled on the Rufiji Delta , which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe . On 3 September 1914 at high tide , Königsberg passed over the bar at the mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river . Coast watchers were stationed at the mouth of the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them . Zimmer , who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg , observed a British cruiser — Pegasus — patrolling the coast for two weeks . He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays , and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul . He considered the action justified , since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885 . 
 On 19 September , Königsberg left the Rufiji and arrived off Zanzibar the following morning . She opened fire at a range of about 7 @,@ 000 meters ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) at 05 : 10 , starting the Battle of Zanzibar ; within 45 minutes , Pegasus caught fire , rolled over to port , and sank . Crewmen aboard Pegasus had raised a white flag , but it could not be seen aboard Königsberg due to the heavy smoke . Pegasus 's crew suffered 38 dead and 55 wounded , while Königsberg was undamaged and had no casualties . After sinking Pegasus , Königsberg bombarded the wireless station and dumped barrels filled with sand into the harbor entrance to simulate mines . While leaving the harbor , Königsberg spotted the picket ship Helmut and sank her with three shells . 
 The cruiser then returned to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines ; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt . While moored in the town of <unk> , the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected . These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships . An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river . 
 Concerned with the threat Königsberg posed to troop transports from India , the British reinforced the flotilla tasked with tracking down the elusive German raider , and placed the ships under the command of Captain Sidney R. Drury @-@ Lowe . The sinking of Pegasus convinced the British that Königsberg must still be in German East Africa . On 19 October , the cruiser Chatham found the German East Africa Line ship <unk> at Lindi . A boarding party searched the ship and discovered documents indicating she had supplied Königsberg with coal in the Rufiji the previous month . On 30 October , the cruiser Dartmouth located Königsberg and Somali in the delta . The cruisers Chatham , Dartmouth , and Weymouth blockaded the Rufiji Delta to ensure Königsberg could not escape . 
 = = = = Battle of Rufiji Delta = = = = 
 On 3 November , the British began a bombardment in an attempt to destroy or neutralize Königsberg and Somali . Königsberg was protected by the thick mangrove swamps , which concealed the ship and offered a degree of cover from British shellfire , especially while the British ships remained outside the river . A collier , Newbridge , was converted into a blockship to be sunk in the main channel of the delta to prevent Königsberg 's escape . Despite heavy German fire from both sides of the river , the British successfully sank Newbridge across one of the delta mouths on 10 November , though the German raider could still put to sea via other channels . Looff decided to move his ship further upriver , to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her . In doing so , his ship would occupy a disproportionate number of British vessels that could otherwise have been employed elsewhere . In the course of the campaign , the British reinforced the squadron blockading the Rufiji with additional cruisers , including Pyramus and the Australian HMAS Pioneer . 
 A civilian pilot , Denis Cutler of Durban , South Africa , was commissioned into the Royal Marines and persuaded to make his private Curtiss seaplane available for the British Empire . The Royal Navy requisitioned the passenger ship Kinfauns Castle to serve as a makeshift tender for Cutler 's aircraft . On his first attempt to locate the cruiser , Cutler , who did not have a compass , got lost and was forced to land on a desert island . On his second flight , he successfully located Königsberg , and a third flight with a Royal Navy observer confirmed his observations . His aircraft 's radiator was damaged on the flight and he was grounded until replacement parts could be brought from Mombasa . A pair of Royal Naval Air Service Sopwiths were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship . They soon fell apart in the tropical conditions . A trio of Short seaplanes fared a little better , though they too were quickly disabled by the conditions . 
 Also in November , the British sought to use the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns of the old battleship Goliath to sink the cruiser . The attempt was unsuccessful , once again because the shallow waters prevented the battleship from getting within range . In December , Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) Paul von Lettow @-@ Vorbeck requested as many crew members from the ship as possible for the East Africa Campaign against the British ; a total of 220 men were left aboard to keep the ship in fighting condition . This was not enough , however , to permit the ship to go to sea . Königsberg moved further up the river on 18 December . On 23 December , the British used a pair of shallow @-@ draft ships to sail up the delta . They hit Somali once before German defensive fire forced them to retreat . 
 In the meantime , conditions were deteriorating on Königsberg . There were shortages of coal , ammunition , food , and medical supplies . Although safe from the British , the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments . Generally cut off from the outside world , the morale of the sailors fell . However , the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home . A captured British merchant ship , Rubens , was renamed Kronborg . It was given a Danish flag , papers , and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish . It was then packed with coal , field guns , ammunition , small arms , and various supplies . As the freighter approached East Africa , Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany . Instead , Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels . Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached , and chased her to <unk> Bay . The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire , but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign . 
 Finally , in April 1915 , the British Admiralty agreed to a plan submitted by Drury @-@ Lowe the previous November , which envisioned attacking the German cruiser with shallow @-@ draft monitors , capable of navigating the Rufiji River . Two of the warships , Mersey and Severn , armed with a pair of 6 in ( 152 mm ) guns each , were brought from Britain . Königsberg had in the meantime been moved a third time , even further upriver . On 6 July 1915 , the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river , despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks . They stopped at a point they thought to be 10 @,@ 000 yd ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) from Königsberg , which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply . Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot . The monitors ' navigation was faulty , however , and after opening fire , they found themselves to be within range of Königsberg 's guns . She hit Mersey twice in the engagement ; one shell disabled the forward 6 @-@ inch gun , and another holed the ship below the waterline . Königsberg was hit four times in return , one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding . In the span of three hours , Königsberg forced both British ships to withdraw . 
 They returned again on 11 July , after having repaired the damage sustained in the first attempt . The two monitors conducted a five @-@ hour bombardment . Königsberg opened fire at 12 : 12 , initially with four guns , but only three guns remained in action after 12 : 42 , two guns after 12 : 44 , and one gun after 12 : 53 . The two monitors did not respond until 12 : 31 , once they had been anchored into their firing positions , and scored several serious hits that caused a major fire at the ship 's stern and inflicted heavy casualties . By 13 : 40 , Königsberg had run low on ammunition and her gun crews had suffered very heavy casualties , and so Looff ordered the crew to abandon ship and to drop the breech blocks for the guns overboard to disable them . Two torpedo warheads were detonated in the ship 's bow to scuttle her ; the ship rolled over slightly to starboard and sank up to the upper deck with her flags still flying . Nineteen men had been killed in the battle , with another forty @-@ five wounded , including Looff . 
 Later that day , the crew returned to haul down the ship 's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser . The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day . The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns ; together with the ship 's crew , they went on to see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow @-@ Vorbeck . All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months ; one was mounted on the converted ferry Götzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet . The surviving sailors , organized as the Königsberg @-@ Abteilung ( Königsberg @-@ Detachment ) , eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt . In 1919 , after the war , the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship . 
 In 1924 , John Ingle , the former captain of Pegasus , was tasked with clearing wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam . At that time , he bought the salvage rights to Königsberg for the price of £ 200 ; he sent divers to extract non @-@ ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights . Salvage work continued into the 1930s , and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side . As late as 1965 , salvage work continued , but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed . Three of the ship 's 10 @.@ 5 cm guns are preserved , one in Pretoria , South Africa , one in Jinja , Uganda , and one in Mombasa , along with a gun from Pegasus . 
 = Sex Pistols = 
 The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975 . Although they initially lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album , Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols , they are considered one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music , having initiated a punk movement in the United Kingdom , and inspired many later punk rock , thrash metal and alternative rock musicians . 
 The first incarnation of the Sex Pistols included singer Johnny Rotten ( John Lydon ) , lead guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious ( John Ritchie ) early in 1977 . Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , a visual artist , performer , clothes designer and boutique owner , the band provoked controversies that garnered a significant amount of publicity . Their concerts repeatedly faced difficulties with organisers and local authorities , and public appearances often ended in mayhem . Their 1977 single " God Save the Queen " , attacking social conformity and deference to the Crown , precipitated the " last and greatest outbreak of pop @-@ based moral pandemonium " . Subjects addressed in their frequently obscene lyrics included the music industry , consumerism , abortion , violence , apathy , anarchy , fascism , the British Royal Family and the Holocaust . 
 In January 1978 , at the end of a turbulent tour of the United States , Rotten left the Sex Pistols and announced its break @-@ up . Over the next several months , the three other band members recorded songs for McLaren 's film version of the Sex Pistols ' story , The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979 , following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend . In 1996 , Rotten , Jones , Cook and Matlock reunited for the Filthy <unk> Tour ; since 2002 , they have staged further reunion shows and tours . On 24 February 2006 , the Sex Pistols — the four original , surviving members and Sid Vicious — were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony , calling the museum " a piss stain " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins and early days = = = 
 The Sex Pistols evolved from the Strand , a London band formed in 1972 with working @-@ class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals , Paul Cook on drums , and Wally Nightingale on guitar . According to a later account by Jones , both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen . They would go to music performances , and when the concert was over they would go up on stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry . 
 Early line @-@ ups of the Strand — sometimes known as the <unk> — also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes ( and later , briefly , Del <unk> ) on bass . The band members hung out regularly at two clothing shops on Kings Road in London 's Chelsea neighbourhood : John <unk> , and Steph Raynor 's Acme Attractions ( where Don Letts worked as manager ) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live , Too Young to Die . 
 The McLaren – Westwood shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock , with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme . It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend , the rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed , " Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of <unk> : they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto . " The shop would become a focal point of the punk rock scene , bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni ( who became a guitarist , songwriter and record producer ) , Gene October ( who became the singer for the punk band Chelsea ) , and Mark Stewart , among many others . Jordan , the English model and actress noted for her work with Vivienne Westwood and the SEX boutique , was a wildly styled shop assistant who is credited with " pretty well single @-@ handedly paving the punk look " . 
 In early 1974 , Jones convinced McLaren to help out the Strand . Effectively becoming the group 's manager , McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space . Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at Too Fast to Live , Too Young to Die , was recruited as the band 's regular bassist . In November , McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City . Before his departure , McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop : renamed SEX , it changed its focus from retro couture to S & M @-@ inspired " anti @-@ fashion " , with a billing as " Specialists in <unk> , <unk> & <unk> " . 
 After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months , McLaren returned to London in May 1975 . Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan — in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television — McLaren began taking a greater interest in the Strand . 
 The group had been rehearsing regularly , overseen by McLaren 's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time . Soon after McLaren 's return , Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones , uncomfortable as frontman , took over guitar duties . According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman , around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols ( or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols , as one Rhodes @-@ designed T @-@ shirt put it ) . McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls ' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group . 
 When those plans fell through , McLaren , Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties . As described by Matlock , " Everyone had long hair then , even the milkman , so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer . " Among those they approached was Midge Ure , who was involved with his own band , Slik . Kevin Rowland — who would co @-@ found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later — auditioned , but apart from Matlock , no one was impressed . With the search going nowhere , McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell , who turned down the invitation . 
 = = = John Lydon joins the band = = = 
 In August 1975 , Rhodes spotted nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T @-@ shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band 's name and holes scratched through the eyes . Reports vary at this point : the same day , or soon after , either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook . According to Jones , " He came in with green hair . I thought he had a really interesting face . I liked his look . He had his ' I Hate Pink Floyd ' T @-@ shirt on , and it was held together with safety pins . John had something special , but when he started talking he was a real arsehole — but smart . " When the pub closed , the group moved on to SEX , where Lydon , who had given little thought to singing , was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's " I 'm Eighteen " on the shop jukebox . Though the performance drove the band members to laughter , McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon . Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together : 
 Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place . It was completely run @-@ down with trash on the streets , and total unemployment — just about everybody was on strike . Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks ... then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all . Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us . 
 New Musical Express journalist Nick Kent jammed occasionally with the band , but left upon Lydon 's recruitment . " When I came along , I took one look at him and said , ' No . That has to go , ' " Lydon later explained . " He 's never written a good word about me ever since . " In September , McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group , which had been practising in pubs . Cook , who had a full @-@ time job he was loath to give up , was making noises about quitting . According to Matlock 's later description , Cook " created a smokescreen " by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band 's sole guitarist . An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a " <unk> Kid Guitarist . Not older than 20 . Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders " ( referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene ) . Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent , but in McLaren 's view , the process created a new sense of solidarity among the four band members . Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join . Jones was improving rapidly , and the band 's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept . He departed after a month . 
 Lydon had been renamed " Johnny Rotten " by Jones , apparently because of his bad dental hygiene . The band also settled on a name . After considering options such as Le Bomb , Subterraneans , the Damned , Beyond , Teenage Novel , Kid <unk> , and Crème de la Crème , they decided on Sex Pistols — a shortened form of the name they had apparently been working under informally . 
 McLaren said the name derived " from the idea of a pistol , a pin @-@ up , a young thing , a better @-@ looking assassin " . Not given to modesty , false or otherwise , he added : " [ I ] launched the idea in the form of a band of kids who could be perceived as being bad . " The group began writing original material : Rotten was the lyricist and Matlock the primary melody writer ( though their first collaboration , " Pretty Vacant " , had a complete lyric by Matlock , which Rotten tweaked a bit ) ; official credit was shared equally among the four . 
 Their first gig was arranged by Matlock , who was studying at Saint Martins College . The band played at the school on 6 November 1975 , in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe , arranging to use their amps and drums . The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs , including the Who 's " Substitute " , the Small Faces ' " Whatcha Gonna Do About It " , " ( Don 't you Give Me ) No Lip " by Dave Berry , and " ( I 'm Not Your ) Steppin ' Stone " , made famous by the Monkees ; according to observers , they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud . Before the Pistols could play the few original songs they had written to date , Bazooka Joe pulled the plugs as they saw their gear being trashed . A brief physical altercation between members of the two bands took place on stage . 
 = = = Building a following = = = 
 The Saint Martins gig was followed by other performances at colleges and art schools around London . One of these on 9 December 1975 was at Ravensbourne College , Chislehurst , near Bromley in Southeast London , where they supported the Newcastle @-@ based rock band Fogg . The band played for free as according to McLaren they were ' turning professional ' the following year , although as McLaren 's letter confirming the booking stated : ' free beer for the band would be appreciated ' . Despite the band 's punk posturing , their PA equipment ( including EV Eliminator bass bins ) was so much better than that of the established touring band Fogg that their equipment was used for the gig . The result of them staying later was a bar bill of over £ 50 during the headliner 's performance . Simon Barker , a friend of Steve Severin , saw the gig and enthused about the band . This resulted in them seeing the band at the Marquee on 12 February 1976 . The Sex Pistols ' core group of followers — including Siouxsie Sioux , Steven Severin , Soo Catwoman , and Billy Idol — came to be known as the Bromley Contingent , after the large suburban town several were from . Their cutting @-@ edge fashion , much of it supplied by SEX , ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted . McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle for more than just couture . They were both captivated by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris , particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists , as well as the anarchist thought of Buenaventura Durruti and others . 
 These interests were shared with Jamie Reid , an old friend of McLaren 's who began producing publicity material for the Sex Pistols in spring 1976 . ( The cut @-@ up lettering employed to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band was actually introduced by McLaren 's friend Helen Wellington @-@ Lloyd . ) " We used to talk to John [ Lydon ] a lot about the Situationists , " Reid later said . " The Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren 't getting the message from left @-@ wing politics . " McLaren was also arranging for the band 's first photo sessions . As described by music historian Jon Savage , " With his green hair , hunched stance and ragged look , [ Lydon ] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell . " 
 The first Sex Pistols gig to attract broader attention was as a supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods , a leading pub rock group , at the Marquee on 12 February 1976 . Rotten " was now really pushing the barriers of performance , walking off stage , sitting with the audience , throwing Jordan across the dance floor and chucking chairs around , before smashing some of Eddie and the Hot Rods ' gear . " The band 's first review appeared in the NME , accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared , " Actually we 're not into music . We 're into chaos . " Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology , Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley , who headed down to London in search of the Sex Pistols . After chatting with McLaren at SEX , they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs . The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols @-@ style group , the Buzzcocks . As Devoto later put it , " My life changed the moment that I saw the Sex Pistols . " 
 The Pistols were soon playing other important venues , debuting at Oxford Street 's 100 Club on 30 March . On 3 April , they played for the first time at the Nashville , supporting the <unk> . The pub rock group 's lead singer , Joe Strummer , saw the Pistols for the first time that night — and recognised punk rock as the future . A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April demonstrated the band 's growing musical competence , but by all accounts lacked a spark . Westwood provided that by instigating a fight with another audience member ; McLaren and Rotten were soon involved in the melee . Cook later said , " That fight at the Nashville : that 's when all the publicity got hold of it and the violence started creeping in .... I think everybody was ready to go and we were the catalyst . " The Pistols were soon banned from both the Nashville and the Marquee . 
 23 April also saw the release of the debut album by the leading punk rock band in the New York scene , the Ramones . Though it is regarded as seminal to the growth of punk rock in England and elsewhere , Lydon has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that it influenced the Sex Pistols : " [ the Ramones ] were all long @-@ haired and of no interest to me . I didn 't like their image , what they stood for , or anything about them " ; " They were hilarious but you can only go so far with ' duh @-@ dur @-@ dur @-@ duh ' . I 've heard it . Next . Move on . " On 11 May , the Pistols began a four @-@ week @-@ long Tuesday night residency at the 100 Club . They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding . The following month they played their first gig in Manchester , arranged by Devoto and Shelley . The Sex Pistols ' performance of 4 June at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city . On 4 and 6 July , respectively , two newly formed London punk rock acts , the Clash — with Strummer as lead vocalist — and the Damned , made their live debuts opening for the Sex Pistols . On their off night in between , the Pistols ( despite Lydon 's later professed disdain ) showed up for a Ramones gig at Dingwalls , like virtually everyone else at the heart of the London punk scene . During a return Manchester engagement , 20 July , the Pistols premiered a new song , " Anarchy in the U.K. " , reflecting elements of the radical ideologies to which Rotten was being exposed . 
 According to Jon Savage , " there seems little doubt that Lydon was fed material by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid , which he then converted into his own lyric . " " Anarchy in the U.K. " was among the seven originals recorded in another demo session that month , this one overseen by the band 's sound engineer , Dave Goodman . McLaren organised a major event for 29 August at the Screen on the Green in London 's Islington district : the Buzzcocks and the Clash opened for the Sex Pistols in punk 's " first metropolitan test of strength " . Three days later , the band were in Manchester to tape what would be their first television appearance , for Tony Wilson 's So It Goes . Scheduled to perform just one song , " Anarchy in the U.K. " , the band ran straight through another two numbers as pandemonium broke out in the control room . 
 The Sex Pistols played their first concert outside Britain on 3 September , at the opening of the Chalet du Lac disco in Paris . The Bromley Contingent accompanied them , with Siouxsie Sioux 's swastika armband causing a stir . The following day , the So It Goes performance aired ; the audience heard " Anarchy in the U.K. " introduced with a shout of " Get off your arse ! " On 13 September , the Pistols began a tour of Britain . A week later , back in London , they headlined the opening night of the 100 Club Punk Special . Organised by McLaren ( for whom the word " festival " had too much of a hippie connotation ) , the event was " considered the moment that was the catalyst for the years to come . " Belying the common perception that punk bands couldn 't play their instruments , contemporary music press reviews , later critical assessments of concert recordings , and testimonials by fellow musicians indicate that the Pistols had developed into a tight , ferocious live band . As Rotten tested out wild vocalisation styles , the instrumentalists experimented " with overload , feedback and distortion ... pushing their equipment to the limit " . 
 = = = EMI and the Grundy incident = = = 
 On 8 October 1976 , the major record label EMI signed the Sex Pistols to a two @-@ year contract . In short order , the band was in the studio recording a full @-@ dress session with Dave Goodman . As later described by Matlock , " The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance . We were pressurised to make it faster and faster . " The riotous results were rejected . Chris Thomas , who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd 's The Dark Side of the Moon , was brought to see them live for the first time by Chrissie Hynde . Then Thomas was brought in by Virgin Records to produce The band 's first single , " Anarchy in the U.K. " , was released on 26 November 1976 . John Robb — a music journalist — described the record 's impact : " From Steve Jones ' opening salvo of descending chords , to Johnny Rotten 's fantastic sneering vocals , this song is the perfect statement ... a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics ... a lifestyle choice , a manifesto that heralds a new era " . Colin Newman , who had just cofounded the band Wire , heard it as " the clarion call of a generation . " 
 " Anarchy in the U.K. " was not the first British punk single , pipped by the Damned 's " New Rose " . " We <unk> " had also appeared from the Vibrators , a pub rock band formed early in 1976 that had become associated with punk — though , according to Jon Savage " with their long hair and mildly risque name , the Vibrators were passers @-@ by as far as punk taste @-@ makers were concerned . " Unlike those songs , whose lyrical content was comfortably within rock ' n ' roll traditions , " Anarchy in the U.K. " linked punk to a newly politicised attitude — the Pistols ' stance was aggrieved , euphoric and nihilistic , all at the same time . Rotten 's howls of " I am an anti @-@ Christ " and " Destroy ! " repurposed rock as an ideological weapon . The single 's packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground . Reid and McLaren came up with the notion of selling the record in a completely wordless , featureless black sleeve . The primary image associated with the single was Reid 's " anarchy flag " poster : a Union Flag ripped up and partly safety @-@ pinned back together , with the song and band names clipped along the edges of a gaping hole in the middle . This and other images created by Reid for the Sex Pistols quickly became punk icons . 
 The Sex Pistols ' behaviour , as much as their music , brought them national attention . On 1 December 1976 , the band and members of the Bromley Contingent created a storm of publicity by swearing during an early evening live broadcast of Thames Television 's Today programme . Appearing as last @-@ minute replacements for fellow EMI artists Queen , the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air . During the interview , Steve Jones said the band had " fucking spent " its label advance and Rotten twice used the word " shit " . Host Bill Grundy , who claimed to be as drunk as his interviewees , engaged in repartee with Siouxsie Sioux , who declared that she had " always wanted to meet " him . Grundy responded , " Did you really ? We 'll meet afterwards , shall we ? " This prompted the following exchange between Jones and the host : 
 Jones : You dirty sod . You dirty old man . 
 Grundy : Well keep going , chief , keep going . Go on . You 've got another five seconds . Say something outrageous . 
 Jones : You dirty bastard . 
 Grundy : Go on , again . 
 Jones : You dirty fucker . 
 Grundy : What a clever boy . 
 Jones : What a fucking rotter . 
 Although the programme was broadcast only in the London region , the ensuing furore occupied the tabloid newspapers for days . The Daily Mirror famously ran the headline " The Filth and the Fury ! " ; other papers such as the Daily Express ( " Fury at Filthy TV Chat " ) and the Daily Telegraph ( " 4 @-@ Letter Words Rock TV " ) followed suit . Thames Television suspended Grundy , and though he was later reinstated , the interview effectively ended his career . 
 The episode made the band household names throughout the country and brought punk into mainstream awareness . The Pistols set out on the Anarchy Tour of the UK , supported by the Clash and Johnny Thunders ' band the Heartbreakers , over from New York . The Damned were briefly part of the tour , before McLaren kicked them off . Media coverage was intense , and many of the concerts were cancelled by organisers or local authorities ; of approximately twenty scheduled gigs , only about seven actually took place . Following a campaign waged in the south Wales press , a crowd including carol singers and a Pentecostal preacher protested against the group outside a show in Caerphilly . Packers at the EMI plant refused to handle the band 's single . 
 Bernard Brook @-@ Partridge , a Conservative member of the Greater London Council and chairman of the Arts committee from 1977 , declared , " Most of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death . The worst of the punk rock groups I suppose currently are the Sex Pistols . They are unbelievably nauseating . They are the antithesis of humankind . I would like to see somebody dig a very , very large , exceedingly deep hole and drop the whole bloody lot down it . " 
 Following the end of the tour in late December , three concerts were arranged in the Netherlands for January 1977 . The band , hungover , boarded a plane at London Heathrow Airport early on 4 January ; a few hours later , the Evening News was reporting that the band had " vomited and spat their way " to the flight . Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group , the label , which was under political pressure , released the band from their contract . As McLaren fielded offers from other labels , the band went into the studio for a round of recordings with Goodman , their last with either him or Matlock . 
 = = = Sid Vicious joins the band = = = 
 In February 1977 , word leaked out that Matlock was leaving the Sex Pistols . On 28 February , McLaren sent a telegram to the NME confirming the split . He claimed that Matlock had been " thrown out ... because he went on too long about Paul McCartney .... the Beatles was too much . " In an interview a few months afterwards , Steve Jones echoed the charge that Matlock had been sacked because he " liked the Beatles . " Jones expanded on the matter of the band 's issues with Matlock : " He was a good writer but he didn 't look like a Sex Pistol and he was always washing his feet . His mum didn 't like the songs . " Matlock told the NME that he had voluntarily left the band by " mutual agreement " . 
 Later , in his autobiography , Matlock would describe the primary impetus for his departure as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten , which he described as being exacerbated by the rampant inflation of Rotten 's ego " once he 'd had his name in the papers " and instigated by McLaren . Lydon would later claim that " God Save the Queen , " the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band 's second single , had been the final straw : " [ Matlock ] couldn 't handle those kinds of lyrics . He said it declared us fascists . " Though the singer could hardly see how anti @-@ royal @-@ ism equated with fascism , he claimed , " Just to get rid of him , I didn 't deny it . " ( The claim was denied by Matlock . ) Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out in an effort to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren . Matlock almost immediately formed his own band , Rich Kids , with Midge Ure , Steve New , and Rusty Egan . 
 Matlock was replaced on bass by Rotten 's friend and self @-@ appointed " ultimate Sex Pistols fan " Sid Vicious , despite not being able to play bass . Born John Simon Ritchie , later known as John Beverley , Vicious was previously drummer of two inner circle punk bands , Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Flowers of Romance . He was also credited with introducing the pogo dance to the scene at the 100 Club . John Robb claims it was at the first Sex Pistols residency gig , 11 May 1976 ; Matlock is convinced it happened during the second night of the 100 Club Punk Special in September , when the Pistols were off playing in Wales . In Matlock 's description , Rotten wanted Vicious in the band because " [ i ] nstead of him against Steve and Paul , it would become him and Sid against Steve and Paul . He always thought of it in terms of opposing camps " . 
 Julien Temple , then a film student whom McLaren had put on the Sex Pistols payroll to create a comprehensive audiovisual record of the band , concurs : " Sid was John 's protégé in the group , really . The other two just thought he was crazy . " McLaren later stated that , much earlier in the band 's career , Vivienne Westwood had told him he should " get the guy called John who came to the store a couple of times " to be the singer . When Johnny Rotten was recruited for the band , Westwood said McLaren had got it wrong : " he had got the wrong John . " It was John Beverley , the future Vicious , she had been recommending . McLaren approved the belated inclusion of Vicious , who had virtually no experience on his new instrument , on account of his look and reputation in the punk scene . 
 <unk> aside , Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special . Arrested for hurling a glass at the Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye , he had served time in a remand centre — and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands . At a previous 100 Club gig , he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain . Indeed , McLaren 's NME telegram said that Vicious 's " best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club " . According to a later description by McLaren , " When Sid joined he couldn 't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band . He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist . " 
 " Everyone agreed he had the look , " Lydon later recalled , but musical skill was another matter . " The first rehearsals ... in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish .... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot " . Marco Pirroni , who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees , has said , " After that , it was nothing to do with music anymore . It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all . Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story " . 
 Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious . As Lydon later observed , " Up to that time , Sid was absolutely childlike . Everything was fun and giggly . Suddenly he was a big pop star . Pop star status meant press , a good chance to be spotted in all the right places , adoration . That 's what it all meant to Sid . " Westwood had already been feeding him material , like a tome on Charles Manson , likely to encourage his worst instincts . Early in 1977 , he met Nancy Spungen , an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York . Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin , and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from the other members of the band . Lydon later wrote , " We did everything to get rid of Nancy .... She was killing him . I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission .... Only she didn 't want to go alone . She wanted to take Sid with her .... She was so utterly fucked up and evil . " Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury . 
 = = = " God Save the Queen " = = = 
 On 10 March 1977 , at a press ceremony held outside Buckingham Palace , the Sex Pistols publicly signed to A & M Records ( the real signing had taken place the day before ) . Afterwards , intoxicated , they made their way to the A & M offices . Vicious smashed in a toilet bowl and cut his foot ( there is some disagreement about which happened first ) . As Vicious trailed blood around the offices , Rotten verbally abused the staff and Jones got frisky in the ladies ' room . A couple of days later , the Pistols got into a rumble with another band at a club ; one of Rotten 's pals threatened the life of a good friend of A & M 's English director . On 16 March , A & M broke contract with the Pistols . Twenty @-@ five thousand copies of the planned " God Save the Queen " single , produced by Chris Thomas , had already been pressed ; virtually all were destroyed . 
 Vicious debuted with the band at London 's Notre Dame Hall on 28 March . In May , the band signed with Virgin Records , their third new label in little more than half a year . Virgin was more than ready to release " God Save the Queen " , but new obstacles arose . Workers at the pressing plant laid down their tools in protest at the song 's content . Jamie Reid 's now famous cover , showing Queen Elizabeth II with her features obscured by the song and band names in cutout letters , offended the sleeve 's plate makers . After much talk , production resumed and the record was finally released on 27 May . 
 The scabrous lyrics — " God save the Queen / She ain 't no human being / There is no future / In England 's dreaming " — prompted widespread outcry . Several major chains refused to stock the single . It was banned not only by the BBC but also by every independent radio station , making it the " most heavily censored record in British history " . That week , there * was * no number 1 hit in Britain - according to Lydon , et al. in The Filth and The Fury , the top spot was empty , because so many radio stations , the BBC , and individuals protested the song 's content . Rotten boasted , " We 're the only honest band that 's hit this planet in about two thousand million years . " Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied — or took nihilism to a logical endpoint : " I don 't see how anyone could describe us as a political band . I don 't even know the name of the Prime Minister . " The song , and its public impact , are now recognised as " punk 's crowning glory " . 
 The Virgin release had been timed to coincide with the height of Queen Elizabeth 's Silver Jubilee celebrations . By Jubilee weekend , a week and a half after the record 's release , it had sold more than 150 @,@ 000 copies — a massive success . On 7 June , McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames , passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament . The event , a mockery of the Queen 's river procession planned for two days later , ended in chaos . Police launches forced the boat to dock , and constabulary surrounded the <unk> at the pier . While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell , McLaren , Westwood , and many of the band 's entourage were arrested . 
 With the official UK record chart for Jubilee week about to be released , the Daily Mirror predicted that " God Save the Queen " would be number one . As it turned out , the record placed second , behind a Rod Stewart single in its fourth week at the top . Many believed that the record had actually qualified for the top spot , but that the chart had been rigged to prevent a spectacle . McLaren later claimed that CBS Records , which was distributing both singles , told him that the Sex Pistols were actually outselling Stewart two to one . There is evidence that an exceptional directive was issued by the British Phonographic Institute , which oversaw the chart @-@ compiling bureau , to exclude sales from record @-@ company operated shops such as Virgin 's for that week only . 
 Violent attacks on punk fans were on the rise . In mid @-@ June Rotten himself was assaulted by a knife @-@ wielding gang outside Islington 's Pegasus pub , causing tendon damage to his left arm . Jamie Reid and Paul Cook were beaten up in other incidents ; three days after the Pegasus assault , Rotten was attacked again . A tour of Scandinavia , planned to start at the end of the month , was consequently delayed until mid @-@ July . During the tour , a Swedish interviewer observed to Jones that " a lot of people " regarded the band as McLaren 's " creation " . Jones replied , " He 's our manager , that 's all . He 's got nothing to do with the music or the image ... he 's just a good manager . " In another interview , Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group : " I don 't understand it . All we 're trying to do is destroy everything . " At the end of August came <unk> — Sex Pistols On Tour Secretly , a surreptitious UK tour with the band playing under pseudonyms to avoid cancellation . 
 McLaren had wanted for some time to make a movie featuring the Sex Pistols . Julien Temple 's first major task had been to assemble Sex Pistols Number 1 , a twenty @-@ five @-@ minute mosaic of footage from various sources , much of it refilmed by Temple from television screens . Number 1 was often screened at concert venues before the band took the stage . Using media footage from the Thames incident , Temple created another propagandistic short , Jubilee Riverboat ( aka Sex Pistols Number 2 ) . During summer 1977 , McLaren had been making arrangements for the feature film of his dreams , Who Killed Bambi ? , to be directed by Russ Meyer from a script by Roger Ebert . After a single day of shooting , 11 September , production ceased when it became clear that McLaren had failed to arrange financing . In The Filth and The Fury , it is revealed that Sting 's first acting gig was in the film .

 Since the spring of 1977 , the three senior Sex Pistols had been returning to the studio periodically with Chris Thomas to lay down the tracks for the band 's debut album . Initially to be called God Save Sex Pistols , it became known during the summer as Never Mind the Bollocks . According to Jones , " Sid wanted to come down and play on the album , and we tried as hard as possible not to let him anywhere near the studio . Luckily he had hepatitis at the time . " Cook later described how many of the instrumental tracks were built up from drum and guitar parts , rather than the usual drum and bass . 
 Given Vicious 's incompetence , Matlock had been invited to record as a session musician . In his autobiography , Matlock says although he agreed to " help out " , that he cut all ties after McLaren issued 28 February NME telegram announcing Matlock had been fired for liking the Beatles , and that he only appeared on the songs previously recorded as singles and b @-@ sides . According to Jon Savage , Matlock did play as a hired hand on 3 March , for what Savage describes as an " audition session " . In his autobiography , Lydon claims that Matlock 's work @-@ for @-@ hire for his ex @-@ band was extensive — much more so than any other source reports — seemingly to amplify a putdown : " I think I 'd rather die than do something like that . " Music historian David Howard states unambiguously that Matlock did not perform on any of the Never Mind the Bollocks recording sessions . 
 It was Jones who ultimately played most of the bass parts during the Bollocks recordings ; Howard calls his rudimentary , rumbling approach the " explosive missing ingredient " of the Sex Pistols ' sound . Vicious 's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release , " Bodies " . Jones recalls , " He played his <unk> old bass part and we just let him do it . When he left I dubbed another part on , leaving Sid 's down low . I think it might be barely audible on the track . " Following " God Save the Queen " , two more singles were released : " Pretty Vacant " ( largely written by Matlock ) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions , " Holidays in the Sun " on 14 October . Each was a Top Ten hit . 
 Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols ( which includes " Anarchy in the U.K. " and another earlier recording , " No Feelings " ) was released on 28 October 1977 . Rolling Stone praised the album as " just about the most exciting rock & roll record of the Seventies " , applauding the band for playing " with an energy and conviction that is positively transcendent in its madness and fever " . Some critics , disappointed that the album contained all four previously released singles , dismissed it as little more than a " greatest hits " record . 
 Containing both " Bodies " in which Rotten utters " fuck " six times ( primarily at the start of the second verse - " fuck this and fuck that , fuck it all and fuck her fucking brat ! " , quoted notoriously in Sid and Nancy , Love Kills ) and the previously censored " God Save the Queen " , and also the word bollocks ( popular slang for testicles ) in its title , the album was banned by Boots , W. H. Smith and Woolworth 's . The Conservative Shadow Minister for Education condemned it as " a symptom of the way society is declining " and both the Independent Television Companies ' Association and the Association of Independent Radio Contractors banned its advertisements . Nonetheless , advance sales were sufficient to make it an undeniable number one on the album chart . 
 The album title led to a legal case that attracted considerable attention : a Virgin Records store in Nottingham that put the album in its window was threatened with prosecution for displaying " indecent printed matter " . The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that bollocks was an Old English term for a small ball , that it appeared " in place names without stirring any sensual desires in the local communities " , and that in the nineteenth century it had been used as a nickname for clergymen : " Clergymen are known to talk a good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense . " In the context of the Pistols ' album title , the term does in fact primarily signify " nonsense " . Steve Jones off @-@ handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album . An exasperated Jones said , " Oh , fuck it , never mind the bollocks of it all . " 
 After playing a few dates in the Netherlands — the beginning of a planned multinational tour — the band set out on a Never Mind the Bans tour of Britain in December 1977 . Of eight scheduled dates , four were cancelled due to illness or political pressure . The band played at Cromer Links Pavilion in Norfolk on Christmas Eve 1977 after assurances that the performance would finish strictly on time and no obscenities would be heard . The tickets went on sale at the local Regal cinema priced at £ 1 @.@ 75 . On Christmas Day , the Sex Pistols played two shows at Ivanhoe 's in Huddersfield . Before a regular evening concert , the band performed a benefit matinee for the children of " striking firemen , laid @-@ off workers and one @-@ parent families . " These would turn out to be the band 's final UK performances . 
 = = = US tour and the end of the band = = = 
 In January 1978 , the Sex Pistols embarked on a US tour , consisting mainly of dates in America 's Deep South . Originally scheduled to begin a few days before New Year 's , it was delayed due to American authorities ' reluctance to issue visas to band members with criminal records . Several dates in the North had to be cancelled as a result . Though highly anticipated by fans and media , the tour was plagued by in @-@ fighting , poor planning and physically belligerent audiences . McLaren later admitted that he purposely booked redneck bars to provoke hostile situations . Over the course of the two weeks , Vicious , by now heavily addicted to heroin , began to live up to his stage name . " He finally had an audience of people who would behave with shock and horror " , Lydon later wrote . " Sid was easily led by the nose . " 
 Early in the tour , Vicious wandered off from his Holiday Inn in Memphis , Tennessee , looking for drugs . He was found in a hospital with the words " Gimme a fix " on his chest ; he had written them with a marker pen . During a concert in San Antonio , Texas , Vicious called the crowd " a bunch of faggots " , before striking an audience member across the head with his bass guitar . In Baton Rouge , Louisiana , he received simulated oral sex on stage , later declaring " that 's the kind of girl I like " . Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas , Texas , he spat blood at a woman who had climbed onstage and punched him in the face . He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries . Offstage he is said to have kicked a female photographer , attacked a security guard , and eventually challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight — beaten up , he is reported to have exclaimed , " I like you . Now we can be friends . " 
 Rotten , meanwhile , suffering from flu and coughing up blood , felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones , and disgusted by Vicious . On 14 January 1978 , during the tour 's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco , a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band 's encore saying , " You 'll get one number and one number only ' cause I 'm a lazy bastard . " That one number was a Stooges cover , " No Fun " . At the end of the song , Rotten , kneeling on the stage , chanted an unambiguous declaration , " This is no fun . No fun . This is no fun — at all . No fun . " As the final cymbal crash died away , Rotten addressed the audience directly — " Ah @-@ ha @-@ ha . Ever get the feeling you 've been cheated ? Good night " — before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage . He later observed , " I felt cheated , and I wasn 't going on with it any longer ; it was a ridiculous farce . Sid was completely out of his brains — just a waste of space . The whole thing was a joke at that point .... [ Malcolm ] wouldn 't speak to me .... He would not discuss anything with me . But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn 't agree to anything . " 
 On 17 January , the band split , making their ways separately to Los Angeles . McLaren , Cook and Jones prepared to fly to Rio de Janeiro for a working vacation . Vicious , in increasingly bad shape , was taken to Los Angeles by a friend , who then brought him to New York , where he was immediately hospitalised . Rotten later described his own situation : " The Sex Pistols left me , stranded in Los Angeles with no ticket , no hotel room , and a message to Warner Bros saying that if anyone phones up claiming to be Johnny Rotten , then they were lying . That 's how I finished with Malcolm — but not with the rest of the band ; I 'll always like them . " Rotten flew to New York , where he announced the band 's break @-@ up in a newspaper interview on 18 January . Virtually broke , he telephoned the head of Virgin Records , Richard Branson , who agreed to pay for his flight back to London , via Jamaica . In Jamaica , Branson met with members of the band Devo , and tried to install Rotten as their lead singer . Devo declined the offer . 
 Cook , Jones and Vicious never performed together again live after Rotten 's departure . Over the next several months , McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil ( with Jones and Cook ) , Paris ( with Vicious ) and London ; each of the three and others stepped in as lead vocalists on tracks that in some cases were far from what punk was expected to sound like . These recordings were to make up the musical soundtrack for the reconceived Pistols feature film project , directed by Julian Temple , to which McLaren was now devoting himself . On 30 June , a single credited to the Sex Pistols was released : on one side , notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang " No One Is Innocent " accompanied by Jones and Cook ; on the other , Vicious sang the classic " My Way " , over both a Jones – Cook backing track and a string orchestra . The single reached number seven on the charts , eventually outselling all the singles with which Rotten was involved . McLaren was seeking to reconstitute the band with a permanent new frontman , but Vicious — McLaren 's first choice — had sickened of him . In return for agreeing to record " My Way " , Vicious had demanded that McLaren sign a sheet of paper declaring that he was no longer Vicious 's manager . In August , Vicious , back in London , delivered his final performances as a nominal Sex Pistol : recording and filming cover versions of Eddie Cochran 's " Something Else " and Sinatra 's " My Way . " The bassist 's return to New York in September put an end to McLaren 's reunion dream .

 After leaving the Pistols , Johnny Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon , and formed Public Image Ltd . ( PiL ) with former Clash member Keith Levene and school friend Jah Wobble . The band went on to score a UK Top Ten hit with their debut single , 1978 's " Public Image " . Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Sex Pistols ' management company , <unk> , which McLaren controlled . Among the claims were non @-@ payment of royalties , improper usage of the title " Johnny Rotten " , unfair contractual obligations , and damages for " all the criminal activities that took place " . In 1979 , PiL recorded the classic post @-@ punk album Metal Box . Lydon performed with the band until 1992 , as well as participating in other projects such as Time Zone with Afrika Bambaataa and Bill Laswell . 
 Vicious relocated to New York and began performing as a solo artist , with Nancy Spungen acting as his manager . He recorded a live album , backed by " The Idols " featuring Arthur Kane and Jerry Nolan of the New York Dolls — Sid Sings was released posthumously in 1979 . On 12 October 1978 , Spungen was found dead in the Hotel Chelsea room she was sharing with Vicious , with a single stab wound to her stomach and dressed only in her underwear . Police recovered drug paraphernalia from the scene and Vicious was arrested and charged with her murder . In an interview at the time , McLaren said , " I can 't believe he was involved in such a thing . Sid was set to marry Nancy in New York . He was very close to her and had quite a passionate affair with her . " ( Apart from Vicious , heroin dealer and sometime actor Rockets <unk> has also been posited as Spungen 's killer . ) 
 While free on bail , Vicious smashed a beer mug in the face of Todd Smith , Patti Smith 's brother , and was arrested again on an assault charge . On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail , where he spent 55 days and underwent enforced cold @-@ turkey detox . He was released on 1 February 1979 ; sometime after midnight , following a small party to celebrate his release , Vicious died of a heroin overdose , aged 21 . Reflecting on the event , Lydon said , " Poor Sid . The only way he could live up to what he wanted everyone to believe about him was to die . That was tragic , but more for Sid than anyone else . He really bought his public image . " 
 On 7 February 1979 , just five days after Vicious 's death , hearings began in London on Lydon 's lawsuit . Cook and Jones were allied with McLaren , but as evidence mounted that their manager had poured virtually all of the band 's revenue into his beloved film project , they switched sides . On 14 February , the court put the film and its soundtrack into receivership — no longer under McLaren 's control , they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members ' financial claims . McLaren , with substantial personal debts and legal fees , took off for Paris to sign a record deal for an LP of standards , including " Non , je ne regrette rien " . A month later , back in London , he disassociated himself from the film to which he had devoted so much time and money . McLaren went on to manage Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow . In the mid @-@ 1980s he released a number of successful and influential records as a solo artist , including the UK 's first ever hip @-@ hop chart single , Buffalo Gals . 
 The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle , the soundtrack album for the still @-@ uncompleted film , was released by Virgin Records on 24 February 1979 . It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the Sex Pistols : There are the new recordings with vocals by Jones , Vicious , Cook , and Ronnie Biggs , as well as Edward Tudor @-@ Pole , briefly considered as a permanent replacement for Rotten . McLaren himself takes the mic for a couple of numbers . Several tracks feature Rotten 's vocals from early , unissued sessions , in some cases with re @-@ recorded backing by Jones and Cook . There is one live cut , from the band 's final concert in San Francisco . The album is completed by a couple of tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols classics . Four Top Ten singles were culled from the Swindle recordings , one more than had appeared on Never Mind the Bollocks . 
 The 1978 " No One Is Innocent " / " My Way " was followed in 1979 by Vicious 's cover of " Something Else " ( number three , and the biggest @-@ selling single ever under the Sex Pistols name ) ; Jones singing an original , " Silly Thing " ( number six ) ; and Vicious 's second Cochran cover , " C 'mon Everybody " ( number three ) . Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the Pistols brand — Tudor @-@ Pole , among others , singing " The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle " and a Rotten vocal from 1976 , " ( I 'm Not Your ) Steppin ' Stone " ; both fell just shy of the Top Twenty . On 21 November 1980 , the final " new " studio recordings attributed to the Sex Pistols were released by Virgin : " Black Leather " and " Here We Go Again " , recorded by Jones and Cook during the mid @-@ 1978 Swindle sessions , were paired as one of a half @-@ dozen 7 @-@ inch records ( the other five reconfiguring previously released material ) sold together as Sex Pack . 
 The Sex Pistols film was completed by Temple , who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production . Finally released in 1980 , The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren 's vision . It is a fictionalised , farcical , partially animated retelling of the band 's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role , Jones as second lead , and contributions from Vicious ( including his memorable performance of " My Way " ) and Cook . It incorporates promotional videos shot for " God Save the Queen " and " Pretty Vacant " and extensive documentary footage as well , much of it focusing on Rotten . In Temple 's description , he and McLaren conceived it as a " very stylised ... polemic " . They were reacting to the fact that the Pistols had become the " poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god . And that was never the point .... The myth had to be dynamited in some way . We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans " . In the film , McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation ; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren 's teaching a series of " lessons " to be learned from " an invention of mine they called the punk rock " . 
 Cook and Jones continued to work through guest appearances and as session musicians . In 1980 , they formed The Professionals , which lasted for two years . Jones went on to play with the bands <unk> Past and Neurotic Outsiders . He also recorded two solo albums , Mercy and Fire and Gasoline . Now a resident of Los Angeles , he hosts a daily radio program called Jonesy 's Jukebox . Having played with the band Chiefs of Relief in the late 1980s and with Edwyn Collins in the 1990s , Cook is now a member of Man Raze . Following The Rich Kids ' break @-@ up in 1979 , Matlock played with various bands , toured with Iggy Pop , and recorded several solo albums . He is currently a member of Slinky Vagabond . 
 The 1979 court ruling had left many issues between Lydon and McLaren unresolved . Five years later , Lydon filed another action . Finally , on 16 January 1986 , Lydon , Jones , Cook and the estate of Sid Vicious were awarded control of the band 's heritage , including the rights to The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle and all the footage shot for it — more than 250 hours . That same year , a fictionalised film account of Vicious 's relationship with Spungen was released : Sid and Nancy , directed by Alex Cox . In his autobiography , Lydon <unk> the film , saying that it " celebrates heroin addiction " , goes out of its way to " humiliate [ Vicious 's ] life " , and completely misrepresents the Sex Pistols ' part in the London punk scene . Although he praised Gary Oldman 's performance as Vicious , Lydon felt Oldman only captured " the stage persona as opposed to the real person . " 
 = = = Reunions and later group activities = = = 
 The original four Sex Pistols reunited in 1996 for the six @-@ month Filthy <unk> Tour , which included dates in Europe , North and South America , New Zealand , Australia and Japan . The band members ' access to the archives associated with The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle facilitated the production of the 2000 documentary The Filth and the Fury . This film — directed , like its predecessor , by Temple — was formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band 's point of view , in contrast to Swindle 's focus on McLaren and the media . In 2002 — the year of the Queen 's Golden Jubilee — the Sex Pistols reunited again to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London . In 2003 , their Piss Off Tour took them around North America for three weeks . 
 On 9 March 2006 , the band sold the rights to their back catalogue to Universal Music Group . The sale was criticised by some commentators as a " sell out " . In November 2006 , the Sex Pistols were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , whose citation named Vicious as well as the four living members . The band rejected the honour in coarse language on their website . In a television interview , Lydon accompanied a suggestion that the Hall of Fame " Kiss this ! " with an obscene gesture . According to Jones , " Once you want to be put into a museum , Rock & Roll 's over ; it 's not voted by fans , it 's voted by people who induct you , or others ; people who are already in it . " 
 The Sex Pistols reunited for five performances in the UK in 2007 . In 2008 , they undertook a series of European festival appearances , titled the Combine Harvester Tour . In August , after performing at the Dutch festival A <unk> to Lowlands Paradise , Lowlands director Eric van <unk> declared the Pistols ' performance " saddening " : " They left their swimming pools at home only to scoop up some money here . Really , they 're nothing more than that . " That same year , they released the DVD There 'll Always Be An England , recorded at their Brixton Academy appearance on 10 November 2007 . In 2010 , Fragrance and Beauty Limited announced the release of an authorised Sex Pistols scent . According to a statement from the cosmetics firm , " the fragrance exudes pure energy , pared down and pumped up by leather , shot through with heliotrope and brought back down to earth by a raunchy patchouli . " The band signed with Universal Music Group in 2012 to re @-@ release Never Mind the Bollocks .

 = = = Cultural influence = = = 
 The Trouser Press Record Guide entry on the Sex Pistols declares that " their importance — both to the direction of contemporary music and more generally to pop culture — can hardly be overstated " . Rolling Stone has argued that the band , " in direct opposition to the star trappings and complacency " of mid @-@ 1970s rock , " came to spark and personify one of the few truly critical moments in pop culture — the rise of punk . " In 2004 , the magazine ranked the Sex Pistols No. 58 on its list of the " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " . Leading music critic Dave Marsh called them " unquestionably the most radical new rock band of the Seventies . " 
 Although the Sex Pistols were not the first punk band , the few recordings that were released during the band 's brief initial existence were singularly catalytic expressions of the punk movement . The releases of " Anarchy in the U.K. " , " God Save the Queen " and Never Mind the Bollocks are counted among the most important events in the history of popular music . Never Mind the Bollocks is regularly cited in <unk> of all @-@ time great albums : In 2006 , it was voted No. 28 in Q magazine 's " 100 Greatest Albums Ever " , while Rolling Stone listed it at No. 2 in its 1987 " Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years " . It has come to be recognised as among the most influential records in rock history . An AllMusic critique describes it as " one of the greatest , most inspiring rock records of all time " . 
 The Sex Pistols directly inspired the style , and often the formation itself , of many punk and post @-@ punk bands during their first two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year run . The Clash , Siouxsie and the Banshees , the Adverts , Vic Godard of Subway Sect , and Ari Up of the Slits are among those in London 's " inner circle " of early punk bands that credit the Pistols . Pauline Murray of Durham punk band Penetration saw the Pistols perform for the first time in Northallerton in May 1976 . She later explained their importance : 
 Nothing would have happened without the Pistols . It was like , " Wow , I believe in this . " What they were saying was : " It 's a load of shite . I 'm going to do what I do and I don 't care what people think . " That was the key to it . People forget that , but it was the main ideology for me : we don 't care what you think — you 're shit anyway . It was the attitude that got people moving , as well as the music . 
 Although much of the Sex Pistols ' energy was directed against the establishment , not all of rock 's elder statesmen dismissed them . Pete Townshend of the Who said : 
 When you listen to the Sex Pistols , to Anarchy in the UK and Bodies and tracks like that , what immediately strikes you is that this is actually happening . This is a bloke , with a brain on his shoulders , who is actually saying something he sincerely believes is happening in the world , saying it with real venom , and real passion . It touches you and it scares you ; it makes you feel uncomfortable . It 's like somebody saying " The Germans are coming ! And there 's no way we 're gonna stop ' em ! " 
 The Sex Pistols ' concert of 4 June 1976 at Manchester 's Lesser Free Trade Hall was to become one of the most significant and mythologised events in rock history . Among the audience of forty people or so were many who became leading figures in the punk and post @-@ punk movements : Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto , who organised the gig and were in the process of auditioning new members for the Buzzcocks ; Bernard Sumner , Ian Curtis and Peter Hook , later of Joy Division ; Mark E. Smith , later of the Fall ; and Morrissey , later of the Smiths . Anthony H. Wilson , founder of Factory Records , saw the band for the first time at the return engagement on 20 July - A stylised version of his view of the concert appears in the film 24 Hour Party People . Among the many musicians of a later time who have acknowledged their debt to the Pistols are members of Motörhead , NOFX , the Stone Roses , Nirvana , Social Distortion , Circle Jerks , Black Flag , Bad Religion , the Germs , Green Day , the Jesus and Mary Chain , and Oasis . Mike Ness of Social Distortion went on the explain in his documentary Another State of Mind how early in his career , he wanted to be " Orange County 's Sid Vicious " . Describing the band as " immensely influential " , a London College of Music study guide notes that " many styles of popular music , such as grunge , indie , thrash metal and even rap owe their foundations to the legacy of ground breaking punk bands — of which the Sex Pistols was the most prominent . " 
 According to the Trouser Press Record Guide , " the Pistols and manager / provocateur Malcolm McLaren challenged every aspect and precept of modern music @-@ making , thereby inspiring countless groups to follow their cue onto stages around the world . A confrontational , nihilistic public image and <unk> nihilistic socio @-@ political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands . " Critic Toby Creswell locates the primary source of inspiration somewhat differently . Noting that " [ i ] mage to the contrary , the Pistols were very serious about music " , he argues , " The real rebel yell came from Jones ' guitars : a mass wall of sound based on the most simple , retro guitar riffs . Essentially , the Sex Pistols reinforced what the garage bands of the ' 60s had demonstrated — you don 't need technique to make rock & roll . In a time when music had been increasingly complicated and <unk> , the Sex Pistols ' generational shift caused a real revolution . " 
 Jamie Reid 's work for the band is regarded as among the most important graphic design of the 1970s and still impacts the field in the 21st century . By the age of twenty @-@ one , Sid Vicious was already a " t @-@ shirt @-@ selling icon " . While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk 's social ambitions , it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth . British punk fashion , still widely influential , is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren ; as Johnny Rotten , Lydon had a lasting effect as well , especially through his bricolage approach to personal style : he " would wear a velvet collared drape jacket ( ted ) festooned with safety pins ( Jackie Curtis through the New York punk scene ) , massive pin @-@ stripe pegs ( modernist ) , a pin @-@ collar <unk> ( mod ) customised into an Anarchy shirt ( punk ) and brothel creepers ( ted ) . " 
 Christopher Nolan , director of the Batman movie The Dark Knight , has said that Vicious inspired the characterisation of The Joker , played by Heath Ledger . According to Nolan , " We very much took the view in looking at the character of the Joker that what 's strong about him is this idea of anarchy . This commitment to anarchy , this commitment to chaos . " Ledger 's costar Christian Bale has claimed that Ledger drew inspiration from watching tapes of Vicious . 
 = = = Conceptual basis and the question of credit = = = 
 The Sex Pistols were defined by ambitions that went well beyond the musical — indeed , McLaren was at times openly contemptuous of the band 's music and punk rock generally . " Christ , if people bought the records for the music , this thing would have died a death long ago , " he said in 1977 . The degree to which the Pistols ' anti @-@ establishment stance resulted from the members ' spontaneous attitudes as opposed to being cultivated by McLaren and his associates is a matter of debate — as is the very nature of that stance itself . <unk> the music , McLaren elevated the concept , for which he later took full credit . 
 He would claim that the Sex Pistols were his personal , Situationist @-@ style art project : " I decided to use people , just the way a sculptor uses clay . " But what had he supposedly made ? The Sex Pistols were as substantial as pop culture could get : " Punk became the most important cultural phenomenon of the late 20th century " , McLaren would later assert . " Its authenticity stands out against the karaoke ersatz culture of today , where everything and everyone is for sale .... [ P ] <unk> is not , and never was , for sale . " Or they were a cynical con : something with which " to sell trousers " , as McLaren said in 1989 ; a " carefully planned exercise to embezzle as much money as possible out of the music industry " , as Jon Savage characterises McLaren 's core theme in The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle ; " cash from chaos " as the movie repeatedly puts it . 
 Lydon , in turn , would dismiss McLaren 's influence : " We made our own scandal just by being ourselves . Maybe it was that he knew he was redundant , so he <unk> . All the talk about the French Situationists being associated with punk is bollocks . It 's nonsense ! " Cook concurs : " <unk> had nothing to do with us . The Jamie Reids and <unk> were excited because we were the real thing . I suppose we were what they were dreaming of . " According to Lydon , " If we had an aim , it was to force our own , working @-@ class opinions into the mainstream , which was unheard of in pop music at the time . " 
 Toby Creswell argues that the " Sex Pistols ' agenda was inchoate , to say the least . It was a general call to rebellion that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny . " Critic Ian Birch , writing in 1981 , called " stupid " the claim that the Sex Pistols " had any political significance .... If they did anything , they made a lot of people content with being nothing . They certainly didn 't inspire the working classes . " While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position , Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols " wasn 't your kind of two @-@ up , two @-@ down working class normal families , most of it . It was over the edge of the precipice in social terms . They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale . " Within a year of " Anarchy in the U.K. " that voice was being echoed widely : scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country — groups composed largely of working @-@ class members or middle @-@ class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class . 
 In 1980 , critic Greil Marcus reflected on McLaren 's contradictory posture : 
 It may be that in the mind of their self @-@ celebrated Svengali ... the Sex Pistols were never meant to be more than a nine @-@ month wonder , a cheap vehicle for some fast money , a few laughs , a touch of the old <unk> la bourgeoisie . It may also be that in the mind of their chief terrorist and propagandist , anarchist veteran ... and Situational artist McLaren , the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear ... and finally unite music and politics . The Sex Pistols were all of these things . 
 A couple of years before , Marcus had identified different roots underlying the band 's merger of music and politics , arguing that they " have absorbed from reggae and the <unk> the idea of a culture that will make demands on those in power which no government could ever satisfy ; a culture that will be exclusive , almost separatist , yet also messianic , apocalyptic and stoic , and that will ignore or smash any contradiction inherent in such a complexity of stances . " Critic Sean Campbell has discussed how Lydon 's Irish Catholic heritage both facilitated his entrée into London 's reggae scene and complicated his position vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ethnically English working class — the background his bandmates had in common . 
 Critic Bill Wyman acknowledges that Lydon 's " fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma " were important catalysts , but ultimately finds the band 's real meaning lies in McLaren 's provocative media manipulations . While some of the Sex Pistols ' public affronts were plotted by McLaren , Westwood , and company , others were evidently not — including what McLaren himself cites as the " pivotal moment that changed everything " , the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show . " Malcolm milked situations " , says Cook , " he didn 't instigate them ; that was always our own doing . " It is also hard to ascribe the effect of the Sex Pistols ' early Manchester shows on that city 's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves . Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band , it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren " was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets .... However , on the other hand , I 've since found out that even Malcolm wasn 't as aware of what he was up to as he has since made out . " By his absence , Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band 's creativity : in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols ' demise , they composed only two songs . 
 Music historian Simon Reynolds argues that McLaren came into his own as an auteur only after the group 's break @-@ up , with The Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist . Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren 's onscreen proclamations in the film , whether lending them credence or not . As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000 , " [ T ] <unk> , Swindle is viewed by many as the truth " ( despite the fact that the movie purveys , among other things , a completely illiterate Steve Jones , a talking dog , and Sid Vicious shooting audience members , including his mother , at the conclusion of " My Way " ) . Temple points out that McLaren 's characterisation was intended as " a big fucking joke — that he was the <unk> who created these pieces of clay from plasticine boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten , made Sid Vicious . It was a joke that they were completely manufactured . " ( In his final onscreen scene in the film , McLaren declares that he was planning the Sex Pistols affair , " Ever since I was ten years old ! Ever since Elvis Presley joined the army ! " [ 1956 and 1958 , respectively ] . ) Temple acknowledges that McLaren ultimately " perhaps took this too much to heart . " 
 According to Pistols tour manager Noel Monk and journalist Jimmy Guterman , Lydon was much more than " the band 's mouthpiece . He 's its raging brain . McLaren or his friend Jamie Reid might drop a word like ' anarchy ' or ' vacant ' that Rotten seizes upon and turns into a manifesto , but McLaren is not the Svengali to Rotten he 'd like to be perceived as . McLaren thought he was working with a tabula rasa , but he soon found out that Rotten has ideas of his own " . On the other hand , there is little disagreement about McLaren 's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a subcultural phenomenon soon after its debut . Temple adds that " he catalyzed so many people 's heads . He had so many just extraordinary ideas " . Though , as Jon Savage emphasises , " In fact , it was Steve Jones who first had the idea of putting the group , or any group , together with McLaren . He chose McLaren , not vice versa . "

 Cornelius H. Charlton ( July 24 , 1929 – June 2 , 1951 ) was a soldier in the United States Army during the Korean War . Sergeant Charlton posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his actions near Chipo @-@ ri , South Korea on June 2 , 1951 . 
 Born to a coal mining family in West Virginia in 1929 , Charlton moved to The Bronx in New York City during World War II . Enlisting out of high school in 1946 , Charlton served first in occupied Germany , then occupied Japan in administrative duties before requesting transfer to the front . An African American , Charlton was transferred to the segregated 24th Infantry Regiment , 25th Infantry Division fighting in the Korean War . During a battle for Hill 543 near the village of Chipo @-@ ri , Charlton took command of his platoon after its commanding officer was injured , leading it on three successive assaults of the hill . Charlton continued to lead the attack despite mortal wounds until Chinese troops occupying it were destroyed , saving his platoon . For these actions , Charlton was awarded the medal . 
 In the following years , Charlton was honored numerous times , but was controversially not given a spot in Arlington National Cemetery , which his family claimed was due to racial discrimination . The controversy attracted national attention before Charlton was finally reburied in Arlington in 2008 .

 Cornelius H. Charlton was born in East Gulf , West Virginia on July 24 , 1929 . He was the eighth of 17 children born to Van Charlton , a coal miner , and Clara ( née Thompson ) Charlton , a housewife . Cornelius briefly moved to <unk> , West Virginia in 1940 to live with his brother , Arthur . In 1944 , the family moved to The Bronx in New York City , New York as Van Charlton became the superintendent of an apartment building . Cornelius Charlton enrolled in James Monroe High School . Friends and family knew Charlton as " Connie . " 
 Charlton indicated a desire to join the United States Army from a young age ; in high school he begged his parents to allow him to drop out and enlist , wanting to fight in World War II , but his parents refused . When Charlton graduated from high school in 1946 , he remained committed to joining the Army , so his parents signed the papers allowing 17 @-@ year @-@ old Charlton to enlist . 
 = = = Military career = = = 
 Charlton left for Basic Combat Training in November 1946 . As an African American , he entered the Army at a time when it was still segregated . In 1948 , U.S. president Harry S. Truman ordered desegregation of the U.S. military with Executive Order 9981 . However , many units remained de facto segregated , with African Americans mostly being pooled into service units and non @-@ combat duties . It would be several years before troops were fully integrated . 
 Upon graduating from basic training , Charlton was assigned to Allied @-@ occupied Germany , where he served out his whole enlistment . Charlton opted to re @-@ enlist , and his next assignment was with a military engineering battalion at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen , Maryland . 
 In 1950 , Charlton was assigned to the Occupation of Japan , and was given an administrative job on Okinawa with an engineering group of the Eighth United States Army . However , Charlton indicated a desire to fight in the Korean War , and so he requested transfer to a front line unit in South Korea . He was subsequently assigned to C Company , 1st Battalion , 24th Infantry Regiment , part of the 25th Infantry Division . The regiment was one of the de facto segregated units , made up almost entirely of African American men led by white officers . From its arrival in September 1950 , the regiment had been plagued by poor performance and accusations of cowardice . Division commander Major General William B. Kean had requested the unit be disbanded , finding the regiment " untrustworthy . " 
 Charlton arrived at C Company of the regiment 's 1st Battalion in early 1951 , and at first was regarded with suspicion by officers and leaders in his unit . A Sergeant , he was made a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon , and quickly impressed his unit 's company commander with his natural leadership ability , and soon his squad was considered a model unit . In May 1951 , Charlton was made the platoon sergeant and his commander had recommended him for a battlefield commission . 
 = = = Medal of Honor action = = = 
 In late May and early June 1951 , the Eighth Army launched Operation Piledriver , a concentrated effort to push Chinese and North Korean troops further north and out of South Korea . The 25th Infantry Division advanced as part of this operation . The 24th Infantry saw a slow advance during this operation , attempting to advance on Kumwha but encountering strong resistance . On July 1 , the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw to reserve positions , and the 1st and 3rd Battalions moved up to continue the advance . 
 On June 2 , C Company moved to capture Hill 543 near the village of Chipo @-@ ri . The hill was protected by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars at the top of the hill . During their first attempt to advance up the hill , the company took heavy casualties , and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded . Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack . Heavy fire eventually forced the company back down the hill . 
 Three times , Charlton led the platoon up the hill , in the face of intense Chinese mortars and infantry fire . In spite of mounting casualties , the platoon made slow progress . Charlton single @-@ handedly destroyed two Chinese positions and killed six Chinese soldiers with rifle fire and grenades . During one advance , Charlton was wounded in the chest , but he refused medical treatment and pushed the company forward . Charlton continued to lead the attack from the front of the platoon , and several times was separated from the unit . Subsequent accounts noted Charlton continued the advance " holding his chest wound with one hand and an M1 carbine with the other . " 
 Under Charlton 's leadership , the platoon managed to overcome the Chinese infantry positions , but it spotted a Chinese bunker on the far side of the top of the hill , where the Chinese mortars were firing on them . As recounted by Private First Class Ronald Holmes , one of the men in the platoon , Charlton decided to destroy the bunker , and with his last known words , " Let 's go , " he urged the platoon forward , charging at the front of the formation ahead of the rest of the soldiers . In one final action , Charlton advanced alone to the top of the hill and the location of the Chinese mortars , firing repeatedly on the emplacement there . The Chinese troops wounded Charlton one final time with a grenade , but he continued firing until the position was destroyed . Charlton subsequently died from the wounds inflicted by the grenade . However , he is credited with saving much of his platoon , which had been under heavy fire from the mortars .

 Charlton 's parents were presented with his Medal of Honor on March 12 , 1952 by Secretary of the Army Frank Pace . 
 In 1952 , the US Army renamed its New York @-@ based Ferryboat 84 , a ferry boat that traveled to Governors Island in the Upper New York Bay , for Charlton . In September 1954 , West Virginia renamed a bridge on the West Virginia Turnpike in honor of Charlton , the Charlton Memorial Bridge on Interstate 77 . Charlton was also memorialized in the Bronx , with a park in the Morrisania area being named for Charlton in 1952 , and in 1958 several gardens in Van Cortlandt Park in South Bronx were planted in his honor . These gardens are the site of annual Memorial Day gatherings of the local neighborhood where Charlton and other Bronx residents killed in the Korean War are honored . In 1993 , a new barracks complex for US Forces Korea in South Korea was also named in Charlton 's honor . In 2000 , the United States Navy commissioned the USNS Charlton , a Watson @-@ class vehicle cargo ship . Charlton 's sister , Fairy M. Papadopoulos , served as the ship 's co @-@ sponsor . 
 There was some controversy over Charlton 's burial after his death . In 1951 , Charlton was not offered a burial plot in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington , Virginia , a custom which is routinely afforded to all Medal of Honor recipients . The US Army later claimed that this was due to an " administrative error , " but Charlton 's family believed the omission was due to racial discrimination . Instead , Charlton was buried in Bryant Cemetery , a segregated cemetery in Bramwell , West Virginia in 1951 . The military did not offer to rebury Charlton in Arlington until 1989 , and the family refused on the grounds that the oversight had been discrimination . Instead , American Legion Post 32 in Beckley offered to bury Charlton in their own cemetery . On March 10 , 1989 , Charlton was reburied there with full military honors at a ceremony attended by congressmen , several US Army generals , and an honor guard . Of 252 buried there , Charlton was the only African American . The controversy received national coverage when it was written about in the Los Angeles Times . On November 12 , 2008 , following efforts of other Medal of Honor winners , Charlton was finally reburied in Arlington National Cemetery , where his remains currently reside .

 Charlton was the second of two African Americans to be awarded the medal for the Korean War , the other being William Thompson who had been posthumously honored for actions with the 24th Infantry Regiment during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter . They were the first two African Americans to be nominated for the Medal of Honor since the Spanish – American War , though several World War II veterans were later nominated . The two nominations had seen delays because unit commanders refused to submit their nominations . 
 Sgt. Charlton , a member of Company C , distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy . His platoon was attacking heavily defended hostile positions on commanding ground when the leader was wounded and evacuated . Sgt. Charlton assumed command , rallied the men , and spearheaded the assault against the hill . Personally eliminating 2 hostile positions and killing 6 of the enemy with his rifle fire and grenades , he continued up the slope until the unit suffered heavy casualties and became pinned down . Regrouping the men he led them forward only to be again hurled back by a shower of grenades . Despite a severe chest wound , Sgt. Charlton refused medical attention and led a third daring charge which carried to the crest of the ridge . Observing that the remaining emplacement which had retarded the advance was situated on the reverse slope , he charged it alone , was again hit by a grenade but raked the position with a devastating fire which eliminated it and routed the defenders . The wounds received during his daring exploits resulted in his death but his indomitable courage , superb leadership , and gallant self @-@ sacrifice reflect the highest credit upon himself the infantry , and the military service . 
 = Valkyrie ( film ) = 
 Valkyrie is a 2008 American @-@ German historical thriller film set in Nazi Germany during World War II . The film depicts the 20 July plot in 1944 by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and to use the Operation Valkyrie national emergency plan to take control of the country . Valkyrie was directed by Bryan Singer for the American studio United Artists , and the film stars Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg , one of the key plotters . The cast included Kenneth Branagh , Bill Nighy , Eddie Izzard , Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson . 
 Cruise 's casting caused controversy among German politicians and members of the von Stauffenberg family due to the actor 's practice of Scientology , which is viewed with suspicion in Germany . Because of this , the filmmakers initially had difficulty setting up filming locations in Germany , but they were later given access to film in locations , including Berlin 's historic Bendlerblock . German newspapers and filmmakers supported the film and its attempt to spread global awareness of von Stauffenberg 's plot . 
 The film changed release dates several times , from as early as June 27 , 2008 to as late as February 14 , 2009 . The changing calendar and poor response to United Artists ' initial marketing campaign drew criticism about the studio 's viability . After a positive test screening , Valkyrie 's release in North America was ultimately changed to December 25 , 2008 . United Artists renewed its marketing campaign to reduce its focus on Cruise and to highlight Singer 's credentials . The film received mixed reviews in the United States and in Germany , where it opened commercially on January 22 , 2009 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During World War II , Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg ( Cruise ) is severely wounded during an RAF air raid in Tunisia , losing his right hand , the ring and little finger on his left hand , and his left eye , and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany . Meanwhile , Major General Henning von Tresckow ( Branagh ) attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the Führer 's personal airplane . The bomb , however , is a dud and fails to detonate , and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it . After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster , he orders General Olbricht ( Nighy ) to find a replacement . After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance , Olbricht presents Stauffenberg at a meeting of the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler 's life . The members include General Ludwig Beck ( Stamp ) , Dr. Carl Goerdeler ( McNally ) , and Erwin von Witzleben ( Schofield ) . Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of what is to be done after Hitler 's assassination . 
 During a bombing raid on Berlin , he gets the idea of using Operation Valkyrie , which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army to maintain order in the event of a national emergency . The plotters carefully redraft the plan 's orders so that they can dismantle the Nazi régime after assassinating Hitler . Realizing that only General Friedrich Fromm ( Wilkinson ) , the head of the Reserve Army , can initiate Valkyrie , they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht in a post @-@ Nazi Germany and request his support , but Fromm declines to be directly involved , stating he will not side with them so long as Hitler is alive . With the rewritten Operation Valkyrie orders needing to be signed by Hitler ( Bamber ) , Stauffenberg visits the Führer at his Berghof estate in Bavaria . Fromm 's influence allows Stauffenberg to bring the copy directly before Hitler , and in the presence of Joseph Goebbels , Heinrich Himmler , Hermann Göring , Wilhelm Keitel and Albert Speer , his inner circle , Hitler praises Stauffenberg 's heroism in North Africa and signs the orders without fully examining the modifications , believing Stauffenberg 's changes " are for the best " . 
 At Goerdeler 's insistence , Stauffenberg is ordered to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer 's command bunker , the Wolf 's Lair . At a final briefing , Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim ( Berkel ) instructs the committee members in the use of pencil detonators . Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel ( Izzard ) , who controls all communications at Wolf 's Lair , to cut off communications after the bomb blast . On July 15 , 1944 , Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf 's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase , but with Himmler not present at the meeting , Stauffenberg does not get the go @-@ ahead from the committee leaders , and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway , the meeting is over . Meanwhile , the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht , unbeknownst to Fromm , to stand by . With no action taken , Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker , and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down , believing that the mobilization was a drill . Back in Berlin , Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested ; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler , who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup . When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved , Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest , and that he must leave the country immediately . 
 On July 20 , 1944 , Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant Haeften ( Parker ) return to Wolf 's Lair . To Stauffenberg 's dismay , he discovers only after the timer has been activated that , due to the warm weather , the conference is being held in an open @-@ window summer barrack , whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage . While his <unk> waits with the car , Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible . Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack , returning to the car . However , one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg , which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast . When the bomb explodes , Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf 's Lair . Before shutting down communications , Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead . 
 As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin , Olbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead ( if Hitler isn 't dead , Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm 's permission ) . Behind Olbricht 's back , Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway . With Operation Valkyrie underway , Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers , convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup . As Army soldiers begin to take control of Berlin 's government ministries , including SS headquarters , mid @-@ level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for . Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast , but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda . Meanwhile , Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive . The General refuses to join the plotters , resulting in them detaining him . Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels , but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler . 
 Immediately recognizing the voice on the other end , Remer realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped — rather than containing a coup , they have unwittingly supported it . SS officers are released and the plotters in turn are besieged inside the Bendlerblock . The headquarters staff flees , but the resistance leaders are arrested . In an ultimately vain effort to save himself , General Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial and sentences the conspirators to death , contravening Hitler 's orders that they be kept alive . Given a pistol by Fromm , Beck commits suicide . That night , the ringleaders are then executed by firing squad one by one . When Stauffenberg is about to be shot , in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance , Haeften places himself in the path of the bullets meant for Stauffenberg . When his turn arrives , Colonel Stauffenberg 's last act is to cry " Long live sacred Germany ! " 
 A brief epilogue informs that the conspiracy of July 20 , 1944 was the last of fifteen known assassination attempts on Hitler by Germans . It also mentions Hitler 's suicide nine months later and that Countess Nina von Stauffenberg and her children survived the war . A shortened version of the dedication at the Memorial to the German Resistance is then shown onscreen : 
 You did not bear the shame 
 You resisted . 
 By sacrificing your impassioned lives , 
 For freedom , justice and honor . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg : The German army Colonel who was instrumental in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler . Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as " very much a humanist " , saying , " He understood his role as a colonel , but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible , terrible , terrible things . " Having directed Superman Returns , Singer compared von Stauffenberg 's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent . Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for Mission : Impossible , and the actor was enticed by the script 's background , the truth of which struck him as a surprise . The actor described von Stauffenberg 's heroism , " I thought of it in terms of what [ von ] Stauffenberg represents . He was someone who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life ... He recognized what was at stake . " Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not think of himself as a hero . The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher , studying history books , and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg 's family . Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye , right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia , Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing , moving items and writing . Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort . 
 Kenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow : Branagh differed physically from the real von Tresckow , who was balding , but Singer said , " [ I ] f you look at [ von ] Tresckow 's energy , he had an honesty that Branagh has . " 
 Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht : Nighy was cast to give a sympathetic quality , so Olbricht would not be the " fall guy " . Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as divided between complaining about Hitler 's regime and actually doing something about it . The actor described his portrayal , " One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform . It 's so associated with evil that it took me several days to get used to being in costume . " 
 Terence Stamp as Colonel General Ludwig Beck : Singer met Stamp to discuss playing a part in X @-@ Men , having admired him for portraying General Zod in Superman II . Stamp endured the Blitz as a child and aided Singer in staging a scene where the von <unk> hide from the Allied bombings . The actor described his approach to acting : he was not the sort of actor who puts on a mask ; rather , he tries to find the place within himself that resonates with the characters he portrays saying that " [ t ] here has to be a kind of non @-@ judgmental discernment , so when I 'm playing villains , they don 't think they 're particularly villains . " Singer said of his direction of Stamp as the heroic and selfless Beck that he sought to find " the part of Terence that would be prepared to fall on his sword for certain ideals " just as Beck had in fact done after being arrested with his co @-@ conspirators for treason . 
 Tom Wilkinson as Colonel General Friedrich Fromm : The head of Germany 's Reserve Army . Wilkinson was cast to make the treacherous Fromm sympathetic . 
 Carice van Houten as Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg : von Stauffenberg 's wife . The filmmakers were impressed by her performance in Black Book , and argued she could give a strong performance with minimal dialogue . Screenwriter Nathan Alexander spoke to von Stauffenberg 's relatives and noted that , although Nina and Claus never directly spoke about the plot , " in a sense it was all they talked about " . 
 Kevin McNally as Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler : A German politician who intends to become chancellor of Germany after a successful coup . 
 David Schofield as General Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben : A retired general and one of the plotters . Singer and Producer Christopher McQuarrie were impressed by Schofield 's professionalism and dedication to show up on set for scenes without his character , and the filmmakers expanded his role as a result . 
 Christian Berkel as Colonel Albrecht Ritter Mertz von Quirnheim : A plotter with knowledge of explosives . 
 Jamie Parker as Lieutenant Werner von Haeften : An adjutant to von Stauffenberg who helps the colonel carry out the plot . 
 Eddie Izzard as General of signal corps Erich Fellgiebel : A German signals officer and plotter , responsible for communications at Hitler 's bunker Wolf 's Lair . 
 David Bamber as Adolf Hitler : The Führer of Germany . During Bamber 's audition for the role , Singer was struck by Bamber 's eyes and stated that Bamber had a quality that resonated with Hitler . 
 Thomas Kretschmann as Major Otto Ernst Remer : Commanding officer of Großdeutschland guard battalion . Kretschmann was the original choice to play von Stauffenberg before Singer joined the production , when McQuarrie was intending to direct . 
 Harvey Friedman as Dr. Joseph Goebbels : Minister of Propaganda and a member of Hitler 's inner circle . 
 Kenneth Cranham as General Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel : The head of the OKW and a member of Hitler 's inner circle . 
 Matthias <unk> as Heinrich Himmler : The head of the SS and a member of Hitler 's inner circle . 
 Waldemar Kobus as Wolf @-@ Heinrich Graf von <unk> , chief of the Berlin police who pledges his and men 's assistance in carrying out the plot . 
 Halina <unk> as Margarethe von Oven , secretary in the Bendlerblock . <unk> co @-@ starred with fellow Dutchwoman Carice van Houten in Black Book . 
 Werner <unk> as Major Ernst John von <unk> 
 Tom Hollander as Colonel Heinz Brandt 
 Bernard Hill as a General working with Stauffenberg in Tunisia 
 Ian McNeice as the composite " <unk> General " who attempts to disrupt the coup headquarters . Though the general is not named in the film , McQuarrie and Alexander said the character was based on General Joachim von <unk> , who tried to disrupt the coup in the same fashion . 
 Gerhard Haase @-@ <unk> as Hermann Göring 
 Anton <unk> as Albert Speer 
 Helmut <unk> as judge Roland <unk> 
 Matthew Burton as Lieutenant General Adolf Heusinger 
 Philipp von Schulthess as Major General Henning von Tresckow 's aide : von Schulthess is the grandson of Claus von Stauffenberg . 
 Patrick Wilson was originally cast in Valkyrie , but he dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and other unspecified reasons . Stephen Fry was also offered a role in the film but was unable to participate . 
 Some of the non @-@ German actors initially experimented with German accents , but Singer discarded the idea , instead instructing them to adopt neutral accents that " [ wouldn 't ] distract from the story " . Singer added he was not making a docu @-@ drama and wanted to make the story engaging .

 In 2002 , Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching another project and visited the memorial to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock . Researching the 20 July plot , he was moved and fascinated by the fact that the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt , and he wanted to make their story more well @-@ known . He approached Nathan Alexander to co @-@ write the film , and Alexander began researching the project . McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy , which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution . He also sought to direct the film , until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing . 
 After Singer completed the three major productions X @-@ Men ( 2000 ) , X2 ( 2003 ) and Superman Returns ( 2006 ) , he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns . Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards while growing up in New Jersey , and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X @-@ Men . Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke , widow of Helmuth von Moltke , a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group . After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander 's screenplay and signing on to direct , Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany 's political landscape , and also met with one of Hitler 's bodyguards , Rochus Misch , who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide . The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg 's true motivation , but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did . Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy , Singer had bigger ambitions for the film , wanting it to be more than " old men in rooms , talking " . Singer looked back on his decision , saying , " The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller ... I knew if I could keep the audience with [ von ] Stauffenberg , with his mission , they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history . " 
 McQuarrie suggested they bring the project to United Artists partners Paula Wagner and Tom Cruise , who immediately agreed to finance the film in March 2007 . Singer invited Tom Cruise to take the lead role , which Cruise accepted . Cruise had been provided a picture of von Stauffenberg , in which the actor noticed a similarity in his profile with the German colonel , drawing him to the role . The director and the screenwriter initially anticipated Valkyrie as a " small " film with a budget of under US $ 20 million and to be completed within several months , but Cruise 's interest in playing von Stauffenberg made Singer realize his involvement could broaden the film 's publicity and therefore its budget . The film 's budget was then raised to $ 60 million . The director considered calling the film Operation Valkyrie , not wanting to use a generic action film title . The film 's English @-@ language title was ultimately titled Valkyrie because Singer felt that the film was about more than the operation and liked its connection to Wagner 's music . 
 Germany 's Finance Ministry had originally denied the producers the right to film at Bendlerblock , explaining that the site should be treated as a " place of remembrance and mourning " which would " lose dignity if we were to exploit it as a film set " . The producers were also denied a request to film at a Berlin police station by the department , citing adverse impact to the facility . The German government eventually had a change of heart concerning the Bendlerblock site and gave permission for filmmakers to film there . A United Artists spokesman said that they were " very grateful " for the decision , saying that the site " [ had ] always been important to us symbolically , creatively and for the sake of historical authenticity " and that the company had been in continuous talks with the German government in order to clear up any misconceptions about the nature of the film . The Memorial to the German Resistance also helped filmmakers by permitting them access to their materials and documents . German military pageantry was shaped by referring to the recorded material and input from military advisers . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 McQuarrie and Alexander researched first @-@ hand accounts , photos , newsreels and texts . They also examined Gestapo and SS records , as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing the events of the conspiracy in its aftermath . A timeline of events was created , from which McQuarrie and Alexander shaped the script . After production began in Berlin , the writers were able to visit locations and meet with relatives of the conspirators ; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming . 
 The initial scenes of von Stauffenberg in Tunisia were written to provide historical context to the rest of the film . The scenes were written with the intention of communicating the complexity of the situation — including references to the Holocaust — without being too obvious . The writers also wanted to evoke the spirit of the resistance and convey the ongoing disgust of the German officers . McQuarrie and Alexander found the most difficult task was in conveying the motives of the conspirators ; von Stauffenberg especially remained an enigma , though the writers believed he and the other resistance members to be propelled by their moral outrage . McQuarrie and Alexander attempted to include a scene of von Stauffenberg 's witnessing an atrocity , but because he was a supply officer he had little exposure to many of those that occurred . Though he witnessed some — such as the starvation of the Russians — they believed it difficult to dramatize von Stauffenberg 's being compelled to action by " field reports " . They also had difficulties with Hitler 's portrayal ; in researching his speeches , they struggled to find one in which he made overtly villainous statements . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began on July 18 , 2007 in Berlin . Production of Valkyrie was then estimated to have a budget of US $ 80 million , with two @-@ thirds to be spent in Germany . The German Federal Film Fund issued € 4 @.@ 8 million ( US $ 6 @.@ 64 million ) to United Artists to assist with production . The filmmakers received permission to film at Tempelhof International Airport 's Columbia Haus , a former Nazi jail for political prisoners . Production also involved World War II planes with swastikas painted on the sides , practicing in the airspace above Brandenburg . Around 70 sets were built for the film . The filmmakers also shot on location at the former Reich Air Ministry Building and the exterior of the house at which von Stauffenberg stayed with his brother . 
 A replica set of Hitler 's Eastern Front Headquarters Wolf 's Lair was constructed 60 kilometers south of Berlin , though the headquarters ' actual location was in modern @-@ day Poland . It took twelve weeks to build . Filming also took place in some of the houses that were used to hide the bombs in 1944 . The interior of Hitler 's Bavarian residence Berghof was also replicated using film shot by Hitler 's consort Eva Braun and designing models of furniture possessed by secretive collectors . The production also made use of surviving Nazi relics , including furniture used by the Reich Ministry and objects that once adorned Hitler 's desk . Nazi symbols , the display of which is heavily restricted in Germany , were also used at several locations , and while the filmmakers gave <unk> to local residents , a passerby witnessing the use of swastikas during filming in Berlin filed an official complaint with the city . Similar charges have also been filed against the owners of sites set up to show Nazi displays for the film 's production . Filming also took place at Babelsberg Studios . During filming on August 19 , 2007 , eleven people were hurt when the side panel of a truck they were riding broke , with one person requiring hospitalization . They demanded $ 11 million in compensation , rejecting a settlement offered by the studio . 
 Before filming the scene of von Stauffenberg 's execution at Bendlerblock , Tom Cruise led the cast and crew in holding a moment of silence , " out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there , " according to actor Christian Berkel . After filming of the scene was completed , the footage was sent to be developed for the post @-@ production process at a processing plant in Germany . The wrong chemical was accidentally used in development , damaging the film and requiring the crew to seek permission from the government to re @-@ shoot the scenes . Permission was granted and a spokesman for the film indicated the schedule and budget had not been affected . 
 Singer and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel chose different styles for the separate halves of the film . Elegant camerawork such as cranes were used as the plot builds to the attempt on Hitler 's life , and the second half is frantic with handheld cinematography as the plotters are hunted down . The colors in the film also become more intense as the story continues . Sigel focused on red , the color of the Nazi flag , which he felt represented the violence of their ideology . Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration . Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting historical accuracy of the era required blackouts . Sigel noted in real life , car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the plotters in the Bendlerblock . Singer chose to shoot in 1 : 85 aspect ratio , and since filming took place in Germany , the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses . 
 The Tunisia battle sequence that opened the film was the last major sequence filmed . The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle . They began a rough cut in October 2007 , and between then and June 2008 , there were several test screenings without the battle sequence . By June 2008 , the filmmakers felt that they knew how to adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence . Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations , but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria . The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia . Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg 's injuries realistic , not enough was left for solely computer @-@ generated fighter planes . Singer instead used two P @-@ 40 Warhawks in the battle sequence . The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany , the rebuilding of sets , and lost shooting days , but German tax rebates tempered the growth . The studio reported its final production budget to be $ 75 million , but competing studios believed it to be closer to $ 90 million . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 The film 's visual effects were created by Sony Pictures Imageworks , who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns . The VFX company 's two key goals were to accurately portray von Stauffenberg 's injuries and to create a 1943 period look to Berlin . With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically , the majority of the 800 computer @-@ generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg 's injuries . A digital version of Cruise 's hand was designed , and VFX employees rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could make so the missing fingers were erased in the process . With many close @-@ ups of von Stauffenberg 's hand with missing fingers , the injuries were textured to look like actual scars , particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943 . Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply , but some challenges , such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own , were inescapable . According to VFX supervisor Richard R. Hoover , " We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn 't stick his hands in his pockets to try and hide his injuries . " 
 For the battle sequence in North Africa , two actual Curtiss P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used , accompanied by cloned images of them or by computer @-@ generated planes . In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers , digital extras were not used ; instead , photography of real squadrons was cloned . Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations . The exterior of Hitler 's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created , since little was left of the original structure , and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria . In Berlin itself , city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week . 
 = = = Editing and scoring = = = 
 As with his previous collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects , Superman Returns and X2 , editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track , noting if the film was working well without music , it was becoming a strong product . Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape ( 1963 ) , Where Eagles Dare ( 1968 ) , Patton ( 1970 ) , and Midway ( 1976 ) , filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles . When the cut was test screened with an American audience , the title cards were removed due to complaints that there were too many characters to follow . 
 Ottman said the challenge on Valkyrie was to create tension from dialogue scenes , and he often reshaped scenes to do this : moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film . Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes , but he was able to choose what lines and close @-@ ups he could focus on . Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it . 
 Ottman originally planned to compose a minimal score to Valkyrie , but found that despite the film 's dialogue @-@ heavy nature , the film needed music to create a thriller atmosphere . Ottman described the new approach , " It 's very much like Usual Suspects — in order to keep the tension going in a scene where there 's really a lot of dialogue , we had to rely on a lot of score . But the score is done in a very sort of pulsating , subliminal way . It 's not an expository score , it 's more like a running pulse going through the movie . " Singer applied an imaginary metronome , " which only began clicking " when he watched scenes where the pace was becoming faster . He had a specific theme he wanted for the film , which was more modern than the " The Winds of War " -type score he expected Ottman to do . Another challenge in composing thriller music was that the score needed to " slowly lapse " into the tragedy of the film 's ending . The finished score has some percussion instruments and few brass , but no snare drums or trumpets , which were the conventions Singer and Ottman avoided . 
 Ottman had to compose music for the North African battle before the scene was shot , because booking space to record film music is difficult . Although he found that composing music based on the script results in overlong pieces , he felt the music worked out fine for the sequence . The film 's end credits piece , " They 'll Remember You " , is an original composition , but the lyrics were based on the poem " Wanderer 's <unk> " by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . An end piece entitled " Long Live Sacred Germany " was inspired by Adagio for Strings , in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene , but still fit with what was going on . Ottman described the original version of the track as a " three minute drone that I slowed down with these two <unk> throat singers , the whole thing was this horribly dark , morbid piece [ which ] left you cold . " Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler , which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster . 
 = = German response to production = = 
 In June 2007 , prior to production , a German Defence Ministry spokesperson said that filming of Valkyrie would not be allowed at the country 's military sites if protagonist Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was portrayed by Tom Cruise , due to the actor 's adherence to Scientology , which is regarded as a dangerous cult by the German authorities . The spokesperson further indicated that the ministry had not at that time received official filming requests from Valkyrie 's producers . Colonel Stauffenberg 's eldest child , retired Bundeswehr general Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg , also voiced concerns over Cruise 's portrayal of his father , saying that he would not oppose the film 's production , but hoped that Cruise would drop the role . " I fear that only terrible kitsch will come out of the project . It 's bound to be rubbish , " he said . " Cruise should keep his hands off my father . " Later in the month , the ministry reversed its stance and welcomed production of Valkyrie . 
 The initial controversy reportedly stemmed from German member of parliament Antje Blumenthal , an authority on cults for the Christian Democratic Union and well @-@ known opponent of Scientology , who had claimed that the German Defence Minister had assured her that the film would not be shot in the country . In addition , Cruise 's affiliation with Scientology was also criticized by junior politicians such as Rudolf <unk> , the state secretary for interior issues in the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg . Thomas <unk> , a spokesperson for the German Protestant Church , said Cruise 's involvement in the film would " have the same propaganda advantages for Scientology as the 1936 Olympics had for the Nazis " and compared the actor to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . 
 The film subsequently found local support in Germany . Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck saw that Cruise 's involvement would promote awareness of a neglected story , and veteran German actor Armin Mueller @-@ Stahl also gave his support to the production . A grandson of Colonel von Stauffenberg , who appeared in the film as an assistant , hailed Cruise 's professionalism and indicated that most of his family were curious to see the finished product . In September 2007 , when the Defence Ministry initially denied permission for filming at the Bendlerblock memorial , support for the film came in from German newspaper columnists and filmmakers , including director Wolfgang Petersen and Frank <unk> , journalist and co @-@ publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung . <unk> visited the set and agreed that the film would advance global awareness of the German Resistance . Ultimately granting access to the Bendlerblock after reviewing the script , the Defence Ministry said it showed that " barbarism didn 't triumph but led to the founding of a democratic Germany " . Ursula <unk> , who is in charge of a German government office which monitors Scientology , was disappointed in the ministry 's decision , saying , " Tom Cruise [ is ] a figurehead of an anti @-@ constitutional organization , and he should be treated that way . " 
 A spokesperson for Scientology in Berlin , Sabine Weber , said in August 2007 that she was " shocked " by German politicians ' criticisms , adding that it was a " call to discrimination " against someone based on their religious beliefs . In the same month , Cruise suggested to his critics that they see the film before denouncing it . In October 2007 , fellow Valkyrie actor Kenneth Branagh said that the issue had been " largely exaggerated " and that the German official who initially incited the complaints contacted the production one week into filming to apologise , after reading the script and realising he had misinterpreted the film 's plot . 
 In November 2007 , the head of the German Resistance Memorial Centre warned against any potential " myth formation " around von Stauffenberg as a result of the film , urging that any understanding of the Colonel must also be informed by the fact that he had been loyal to the Nazi cause for most of his military career . In the same month Cruise was given a Bambi courage award , presented by German media company Hubert Burda Media , " for tackling a story that had never been covered by Hollywood before " . 
 Klaus Berg of the Hamburg Chronicle noted that " ( ... ) It is a well @-@ known cliche that American film makers prefer to provide their audiences with a happy ending . Here , a viewer with even the most superficial and rudimentary knowledge of the history of the Second World War and of the National Socialist Regime would know from the very outset that a happy ending is out of the question , that all the protagonists ' efforts and plans are doomed to end in bitter failure . Knowing this , I was surprised to realize how deeply I was caught up in the tension of the plot , how desperately I was hoping against hope that Cruise and his fellows would after all succeed . ( ... ) No , not for one minute during the entire film did I think about Scientology " .

 Valkyrie was intended to be a high @-@ profile film that would jump @-@ start United Artists , the host studio partly owned by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner . Pressure was placed on Valkyrie to do well since an earlier United Artists film featuring Cruise , Lions for Lambs , performed poorly in the box office , and the studio 's planned production of Oliver Stone 's <unk> was canceled . The film changed release dates multiple times . It was originally slated to be released on August 8 , 2008 , then moved up earlier to June 27 , 2008 . The film was then held off to October 3 , 2008 to avoid competition from WALL @-@ E and Wanted , and to enable the late filming of the North African battle sequence . The October date was also originally chosen to increase the film 's chances of awards success . In April 2008 , the release date was pushed back to February 13 , 2009 , with the studio citing the early fall schedule as too crowded with Academy Award prospects . Valkyrie would have taken advantage of the lucrative President 's Day weekend , after The Wolfman and The Pink Panther 2 were moved from this date . 
 In July 2008 , United Artists president of worldwide marketing Dennis Rice was replaced by Michael <unk> , who was tasked to develop a marketing strategy for the " troubled " Valkyrie , which had been " battered by constant media sniping " . Under <unk> , by August 2008 , the release date was changed to December 26 , 2008 with reports citing commercial reasons for the move after a successful test screening . ( The film was ultimately released on Christmas Day , December 25 , 2008 . ) The release date was before the end of December , which " crucially " helped the film with a home distribution deal with the subscription channel Showtime . In the same month of August , Paula Wagner left her position with the studio during the film 's post @-@ production . The changing release date for Valkyrie drew criticism about the viability of United Artists , and the studio aimed to combat the criticism leading up to the film 's eventual release . In addition , the first theatrical trailer , released early in 2008 , received " mixed buzz " over Tom Cruise 's portraying von Stauffenberg with an American accent . The trade paper Variety described the trailer as " dour and ... like it was selling a talky stage play with a cast of old British actors " . Images of Tom Cruise as Colonel von Stauffenberg that surfaced during filming were widely ridiculed . Terry Press , a marketing consultant with the studio , said that Valkyrie had been wrongly labeled as " the Tom Cruise eye @-@ patch movie " . 
 As the December release date approached , United Artists launched a campaign to reform public perception of the film , downplaying the role of Tom Cruise as a German war hero and instead pitching Valkyrie as " a character @-@ driven suspense thriller " . The new campaign also played up the reputation of director Bryan Singer , who had directed the thrillers The Usual Suspects ( 1995 ) and Apt Pupil ( 1998 ) . Terry Press urged foregoing an awards campaign for the film ; Cruise agreed with the consultant , while Singer was disappointed about the decision . Instead , the studio focused on audience appeal in a competitive time frame in late December . A second theatrical trailer and a new poster were unveiled in October 2008 by United Artists to renew Valkyrie 's viability with audiences and accolades . The poster was designed to have flashy graphics and to emulate the posters from the war films The Great Escape ( 1963 ) and The Dirty Dozen ( 1967 ) in having a team as a central visual . The team element was based on market research from the studio 's focus groups who indicated that they liked Cruise as " a character leading a group of people toward solving a problem " . The new trailer accentuated action , and was widely considered an improvement over the first trailer . An internal MGM memo reported the reception of the trailer by online communities to be " significantly favorable " compared to the previous trailer . The studio sought two demographic quadrants : males over 35 years old as well as younger males . Since United Artists reported that the film cost $ 75 million to make and that $ 60 million was spent on marketing , the studio faced high financial stakes . The film also tested the determination of its distributor Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer and the mettle of Cruise as a superstar .

 Prior to Valkyrie 's December 2008 release , concern was raised about how the film would be received in the holiday season due to its Nazi subject matter , along with related films The Boy in the Striped Pajamas , The Reader , Defiance and Good . Advertising Age wrote during the economic crisis of 2008 , " The depressing state of the economy and an alarmingly low level of understanding of the Holocaust among American youth point to a tough road for such serious fare . " 
 Valkyrie opened on Christmas Day , December 25 , 2008 , in 2 @,@ 711 theaters in the United States and Canada . The film grossed an estimated $ 8 @.@ 5 million for the opening day . In the four @-@ day holiday weekend , Valkyrie grossed an estimated $ 30 million , ranking fourth at the box office with $ 7 @,@ 942 per theater . Pamela McClintock of Variety cited the weekend performance as " a victory for United Artists and MGM " ; <unk> Pandya of Rotten Tomatoes said the haul represented a " big hit " for the studio . Studio research revealed that audiences averaged 55 % male and 66 % over 25 . Paul Dergarabedian , president of box @-@ office tracker Media By Numbers , said that the weekend gross " totally robs the nay @-@ <unk> of their ability to deem it a flop " , believing that Cruise 's comic performance in the previous summer 's Tropic Thunder helped audiences embrace the star again . Dergarabedian also ascribed the better @-@ than @-@ expected performance to the studio 's marketing of Valkyrie as a thriller film . Since Cruise was collecting a salary of $ 20 million against 20 % of the backend ( revenue gathered after the completion of a film ) and MGM / UA investment was capped at $ 60 million , United Artists sold the film to several foreign territories to make money back . 
 The European premiere was held at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin on January 20 , 2009 . Valkyrie commercially opened in over a dozen territories outside the United States and Canada on the weekend of January 23 , 2009 , including a premiere in Germany on January 22 . The film ranked first in the international box office , grossing over $ 13 million . It placed first in Germany , Australia , and the Netherlands and placed second in the United Kingdom , Austria and South Korea . Valkyrie 's highest @-@ grossing territory was Germany , where it earned $ 3 @.@ 7 million from 689 locations , averaging $ 5 @,@ 311 per screen . The German opening was considered " a chart @-@ topping yet unspectacular start " , barely edging out Twilight , which opened three weeks before . BBC News reported that the premiere of the film has renewed the topic of the German Resistance among the German populace . 
 The film opened in 13 additional territories on the weekend of January 30 , including Russia and Spain .

 When Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15 , 2008 , it was shown in a private screening room at the Time Warner Center , rather than at a Lincoln Square theater . The venue was chosen in part to minimize the exposure to Scientology protesters gathered at the Time Warner Center . Protesters also appeared at the December 18 Los Angeles screening , where Cruise entered through a tunnel . While the US " red carpet " was held in private , Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe . There were small anti @-@ Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin , where Cruise signed one protester 's Guy Fawkes mask . Anti @-@ Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere , and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters . The NTV news report about the January 26 Moscow premiere noted that journalists had to sign a document promising not to ask questions about Scientology , and their questions would be censored ; to this , the reporter remarked , " You can 't help getting reminded of those historic times depicted in Operation Valkyrie . " 
 In Germany , authorities and politicians expressed concern that if the film was successful , it would boost Scientology in the country . German politician Michael Brand encouraged his deputies to boycott Valkyrie , saying that Scientology pursued " totalitarian goals " . Germany 's Agency for the Protection of the Constitution ( <unk> ) , which monitors the presence of Scientology in the country , expressed concern about the film 's impact . An anonymous <unk> official said , " These Scientologists have two goals in Germany ... to get their message to children , and make their organization respectable . The film does both : it has put a top Scientologist at the center of a national debate about German history . " 
 In January 2009 , Cruise appeared in the highly popular German @-@ Swiss @-@ Austrian TV show , Wetten , dass . Cruise had already left the show , when German comedian Michael Mittermeier said : " In an interview , Tom Cruise claimed that he would have killed Hitler , too . To me , it would be sufficient if he had killed the Führer of Scientology . " Prior to the show , members of the Christian Democratic Junge Union protested against the broadcaster for being uncritical about Scientology .

 The movie website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 62 % , based on 191 reviews , with an average rating of 6 @.@ 1 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , " Given the subject matter , Valkyrie could have been an outstanding historical thriller , but settles for being a mildly entertaining , but disposable yarn . " At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 56 out of 100 , based on 36 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . In the United States , the film received mixed reviews from critics , however in Germany , there were different reports about how Valkyrie was received . The New York Times wrote , " It has been greeted with a measured and hospitable reception in Germany , where it was once viewed with suspicion . " The trade paper Variety reported that despite the controversy over Cruise 's ties to Scientology , " [ I ] <unk> reviews have been positive , with many observers now hailing Cruise and predicting the pic will even improve the country ’ s image abroad . " Der Spiegel said that the film and its supporting actors were praised , but that Cruise was panned by German critics for " a surprisingly low @-@ key performance that fails to convey the charisma with which Stauffenberg inspired fellow plotters " . The AFP also said that the German critics " savaged Tom Cruise 's portrayal " of von Stauffenberg , yet " relished a homegrown hero getting the Hollywood treatment . " 
 = = = American critics = = = 
 Joe <unk> wrote in The Wall Street Journal , " Mr. Cruise 's performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible , though unexceptional , while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural , impressively staged in historical locations . " . Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought that Cruise gave " a fine , typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor " but that von Stauffenberg was too complex a character to adequately portray in a film designed as a thriller . Dargis also wrote of the director 's excess , " Though Mr. Singer ’ s old @-@ fashioned movie habits , his attention to the gloss , gleam and glamour of the image , can be agreeably pleasurable , he tends to gild every lily , " citing as an example the " spooky music " and " low camera angles " in the meeting between Hitler and von Stauffenberg . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times also found Cruise " perfectly satisfactory , if not electrifying , in the leading role " , believing that the portrayal fit the " veterans of officer rank " that would not panic under fire ; Ebert recognizes that " Singer ... works heroically to introduce us to the major figures in the plot , to tell them apart , to explain their roles and to suggest their differences . " 
 Writing in Time , Richard Schickel said , " I 'm not going to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie . But in its way it is a thoughtful and entertaining one , especially in comparison with the pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season . " . Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film : " It 's a smooth , compelling , almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece — a World War II action @-@ drama in which an intriguing ( but not electrifying ) star performance is buttressed by stellar support . " Burr analyzed Cruise 's performance : " ... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that 's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history . This story deserves to be told , but for reasons best known to himself , the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground . " Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as " unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted " von Stauffenberg . She felt that the film started slowly and that " even during scenes of intense action , the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing " . She concluded of the film 's overall pace , " The action becomes more engrossing during the film 's second half , but one expects more depth and nuance , given its pedigree . " Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote , " [ Cruise ] carries the movie , although , once you dig beneath the uniform , there isn ’ t much for him to get a handle on ; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did , not in who he was . " Lane thought that there was " too much " character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy , Stamp , and Wilkinson , " These men are meant to be battle @-@ toughened Nazi officers , but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis . " 
 Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that Valkyrie " has visual splendor galore , but is a cold work lacking in the requisite tension and suspense " . McCarthy considered Cruise as " a bit stiff but still adequate " as von Stauffenberg . The critic believed that McQuarrie 's script was well @-@ <unk> but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a " sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters " . McCarthy missed " many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men " that were not detailed . He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out , that Newton Thomas Sigel 's cinematography had a " restrained elegance " , and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer . A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in The San Francisco Chronicle , who wrote " There 's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand , strutting around in a German colonel 's uniform . But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg , leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d 'etat . Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler . Do that , and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie .

 Despite differences over the quality of the film , critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg 's cause . It was applauded " both as a history lesson and as a film " . Tobias <unk> of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as " maybe not the masterpiece we might have dreamed of ... but not much less " , a sentiment shared by many German critics . The public @-@ service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie " neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century ... Neither is it the action thriller we feared , but it is a well @-@ made and serious film . " The newspaper <unk> Stadt @-@ Anzeiger reported that any fear that the " myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter has turned out to be wrong and prejudicial . " 
 Other critics thought that Tom Cruise did not " make the grade " as a German war hero . The film critic for Der Tagesspiegel wrote , " [ Cruise 's ] image as an actor has been finally ruined by Valkyrie ... [ the film ] doesn 't dare to be popcorn cinema and at the same time lacks any conceptual brilliance . " Hanns @-@ Georg <unk> of Die Welt reported of Cruise 's performance , " He comes over best as an American hero , someone who battles for respect with aggression and energy . But Stauffenberg was a German hero , with aristocratic bearing , and Cruise cannot carry that off . " The Frankfurter Allgemeine <unk> said Cruise 's performance was " credible " , and reserved praise for the authenticity of the dubbed German @-@ language version of the film over the original .

 = = Historical accuracy = = 
 The Gestapo investigated the 20 July plot thoroughly , so filmmakers had access to much documentation as they integrated the historical account with " Hollywood factors " in producing Valkyrie . Peter Hoffmann , professor of history at McGill University and a leading authority on the German Resistance , was a consultant for the filmmakers . Hoffmann spoke of the film 's accuracy , " [ Valkyrie ] gives a fundamentally accurate portrait of Stauffenberg and the conspirators . There are details which must be counted as liberties . But , fundamentally , the film is decent , respectful and represents the spirit of the conspiracy . " The Scotsman reported of the film 's accuracy , " Valkyrie ... sticks pretty closely to the story of the failed conspiracy to topple the Nazi regime ... it implies that the plot came closer to success than it really did . But the basic facts are all present and correct . " 
 While von Stauffenberg listens to Richard Wagner 's " Ride of the Valkyries " in the film , in reality the colonel hated Wagner . In addition , von Stauffenberg 's elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film . Bryan Singer purposely left out some of von Stauffenberg 's " macho " moments in writing the character , such as the colonel 's refusal of morphine to avoid addiction . He explained the removals , " There were things I actually left out because I knew people would think we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying ' No morphine ! ' People would think it 's a contrivance . " In the film , von Haeften steps out in front of von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad , but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs , they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg , who was actually shot shortly after . Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler , played in the film by Kevin McNally . Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic , dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy , though filmmakers considered him a " much more moral character " in reality . 
 One significant historical alteration , made to avoid confusion with the audience and also to " set the stage " at the Wolf 's Lair , was changing the location of the first aborted assassination attempt to kill Hitler on July 11 . Historically , Stauffenberg first attempted to use his briefcase bomb at Berchtesgaden ; in the film , this attempt is set inside Hitler 's concrete bunker at the Wolf 's Lair while the Berchtesgaden affair is downgraded to a brief scene in which Hitler meets with Stauffenberg to approve a revised plan for Operation Valkyrie ( in reality , the Valkyrie updates occurred over a period of several weeks at meetings between Hitler and General Olbricht ) . Producer Christopher McQuarrie later stated that the shift of the first assassination attempt to the Wolf 's Lair was in order to show the audience the inside of the concrete command bunker , with the intent being to emphasize that Hitler most certainly would have been killed had the July 20th attempt not been moved to the outdoor conference hut . 
 British novelist Justin Cartwright , who wrote the book The Song Before It Is Sung about one of the plot 's conspirators , wrote , " The film is true to most of the facts of the plot , but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and political vortex into which Germans were being drawn . " Though not depicted , but briefly mentioned in the film , von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle , Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll @-@ <unk> , who was disenchanted with the Nazis . The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg 's philosophy and background , which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden ( " poets and heroes " ) . Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot : " He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near @-@ mystic German past , a warrior Germany , a noble Germany , a poetic Germany , a Germany of myth and longing . " The novelist felt that Cruise 's portrayal was more akin to one as a " troublesome cop " . Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded . 
 They did not mention or include Germany 's famous Field Marshal Erwin Rommel . He was implicated in the plot although he refused participation ( which resulted him in committing suicide ) . 
 = Russian battleship Knyaz Suvorov = 
 Knyaz Suvorov ( Russian : Князь <unk> ) was a Borodino @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . Named after the 18th @-@ century Russian general Prince ( Knyaz ) Alexander Suvorov , the ship was completed after the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in 1904 . She became the flagship of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky , commander of the Second Pacific Squadron that was sent to the Far East a few months after her completion to break the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur . The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to Vladivostok . Knyaz Suvorov was sunk during the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905 . During the battle , the ship fell out of the main battle line after a shell hit her bridge , killing her helmsman and wounding her captain and Rozhestvensky . She was eventually torpedoed and sunk by Japanese torpedo boats ; other than the 20 wounded officers evacuated by a destroyer there were no survivors . 
 = = Description = = 
 Knyaz Suvorov was 389 feet 5 inches ( 118 @.@ 69 m ) long at the waterline and 397 feet 3 inches ( 121 @.@ 1 m ) long overall , with a beam of 76 feet 1 inch ( 23 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of 29 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 m ) , 38 inches ( 965 mm ) more than designed . Her normal displacement was 14 @,@ 415 long tons ( 14 @,@ 646 t ) , almost 900 long tons ( 914 t ) more than her designed displacement of 13 @,@ 516 long tons ( 13 @,@ 733 t ) . Her intended crew consisted of 28 officers and 754 enlisted men , although she carried 928 crewmen during the Battle of Tsushima . 
 The ship was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 800 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Knyaz Suvorov , however , only reached a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) from 15 @,@ 575 ihp ( 11 @,@ 614 kW ) during her builder 's machinery trials on 9 August 1904 . At deep load she carried 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 372 t ) of coal that provided her a range of 2 @,@ 590 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 2 @,@ 980 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Knyaz Suvorov 's 40 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch guns were mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . They had a rate of fire of about one round per 90 seconds . Sixty rounds per gun were carried . The twelve 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns were mounted in six electrically powered twin @-@ gun turrets carried on the sides of the ship . They had a practical rate of fire of approximately three rounds per minute and were provided with 180 rounds per gun . Four of the twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns used against torpedo boats were mounted in casemates just below the forward main gun turret , two on each side . These guns were placed well above the waterline for use in any weather , unlike the remaining sixteen guns , which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and distributed over the length of the ship , close to the water . The unsuitability of the lower deck guns was graphically demonstrated when Knyaz Suvorov 's sister ship Imperator Aleksander III made a high @-@ speed turn during her trials , heeling 15 ° , and began taking water through the lower casemates . Each gun had 300 rounds available . The ship also mounted twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns for anti @-@ torpedo boat defense . Knyaz Suvorov carried four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one each above water in the bow and one in the stern with two torpedoes each , and a submerged tube on each side forward with three torpedoes each . 
 Knyaz Suvorov 's waterline armor belt consisted of Krupp armor and was 5 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 64 inches ( 145 – 194 mm ) thick . The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and her deck ranged from 1 to 2 inches ( 25 to 51 mm ) in thickness . The 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 38 mm ) armored lower deck curved downwards and formed an anti @-@ torpedo bulkhead . 
 = = Service = = 
 Construction began on Knyaz Suvorov , named after Prince Aleksander Suvorov , on 10 August 1901 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg . The ship was laid down on 8 September 1901 , when the ceremonial laying of one of the plates was performed by Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia , general @-@ admiral of the Imperial Russian navy . She was launched on 25 September 1902 , and completed in September 1904 at the cost of 13 @,@ 841 @,@ 000 rubles . 
 On 15 October 1904 , Knyaz Suvorov , flagship of the 2nd Pacific Squadron , set sail for Port Arthur from Libau along with the other vessels of the squadron . Rozhestvensky had received numerous reports of Japanese agents and torpedo boats disguised as fishing vessels before sailing and he ordered maximum alertness after coaling at Skagen , Denmark on 7 October . Early on the evening of the following day , when the squadron was near the Dogger Bank , the auxiliary repair ship Kamchatka reported that she was under attack by torpedo boats in the rain . About four hours later , the squadron encountered British fishing trawlers working the Dogger Bank in the fog and opened fire on them at very short range . One trawler was sunk and at least three others were damaged ; several fishermen were killed and others wounded . The battleships also fired upon and damaged the cruisers Aurora and Dmitrii Donskoi . The incident enraged the British population and caused a diplomatic incident with the British that nearly led to war until Russia apologized and agreed to pay reparations on 29 October . 
 Rozhestvensky led his ships down the Atlantic coast of Africa , rounding the Cape of Good Hope , and reached the island of Nosy Be off the north @-@ west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements . During this time , he learned of the capture of Port Arthur and changed his destination to Vladivostok , the only other port controlled by the Russians in the Far East . The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May . While exact figures are not available for Knyaz Suvorov , it is probable that the ship was approximately 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 1 @,@ 700 t ) overweight as she and her sisters were overloaded with coal and other supplies ; all of which was stored high in the ships and reduced their stability . The extra weight also submerged the waterline armor belt and left only about 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) of the upper armor belt above the waterline . 
 During the Battle of Tsushima , Knyaz Suvorov was the lead ship in the Russian battle line and she opened fire at the Japanese battleship Mikasa , flagship of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō at 14 : 05 . Mikasa began to return fire about five minutes later , joined by the battleship Asahi and the armored cruiser Azuma . The battleship Fuji joined the others firing at Knyaz Suvorov around 14 : 20 , which had been set on fire by hits from the other ships . At 14 : 35 , Rozhestvensky and the ship 's captain were wounded by splinters that entered the conning tower . Shortly afterwards , Rozhestvensky was knocked unconscious by a splinter in the skull and flames made the conning tower untenable so that the ship had to be steered from her auxiliary control position . Around 14 : 52 , another hit jammed the steering gear after a four point turn to starboard had been ordered and caused the ship make nearly a full circle before she could be steered by her engines . Splinters from numerous shell hits shredded water hoses and made it much more difficult to put the numerous fires out . By this time Knyaz Suvorov 's aft 12 @-@ inch gun turret had been destroyed by an explosion that blew its roof off onto the quarterdeck , her forward funnel had fallen down and her mainmast had been shot away . 
 Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and was engaged at short range by Mikasa and the battleship Shikishima as well as five cruisers of Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō 's 2nd Division between 15 : 20 and 15 : 35 . Mikasa and two of the cruisers fired one torpedo each at her during this time , but none of them hit the ship . At 15 : 39 , the unprotected cruiser Chihaya fired a pair of torpedoes and claimed one hit although no change was visible in Knyaz Suvorov 's condition . Chihaya was hit by one shell just above the waterline during her attack that forced her to make emergency repairs . Around 15 : 40 the British observer aboard Azuma reported that Knyaz Suvorov was down by the bow with a heavy list to port and was a mass of thick gray smoke from forecastle to mainmast . By this time , the ship 's forward 12 @-@ inch gun turret had been knocked out , but some smaller guns were still in action . The Japanese 5th Destroyer Division attacked five minutes later with torpedoes at ranges under 900 yards ( 820 m ) , but failed to score any hits with their five torpedoes . The destroyer leader was hit in the boiler room by a three @-@ inch shell that may have been fired by Knyaz Suvorov . 
 The ship found herself between the two fleets at 16 : 08 and was fired at by most of the Japanese ships at short range . Observers aboard those ships noted that she resembled " an island volcano in eruption " . Mikasa fired two torpedoes and Shikishima fired one torpedo at Knyaz Suvorov during this time without effect . Captain W. C. Pakenham , the Royal Navy 's official military observer aboard the Japanese battleship Asahi under the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , noted that she was hit by a 12 @-@ inch shell near the rear 6 @-@ inch turret around 16 : 30 that caused an explosion and caused flames to spout 50 feet ( 15 m ) in the air . At 17 : 05 the 4th Destroyer Division attacked with three destroyers ; only one of the six torpedoes hit Knyaz Suvorov . The ship which immediately took on a 10 ° list , but showed no signs of sinking . One shell from Knyaz Suvorov struck the destroyer Asagiri , but did not inflict much damage . 
 Around 17 : 30 , the Russian destroyer Buinyi , came and took off the wounded officers from Knyaz Suvorov , including Rozhestvensky , leaving an unwounded midshipman in command . The ship continued southwards at about 4 – 5 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 – 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 – 5 @.@ 8 mph ) and was engaged by many of the Japanese cruisers from about 18 : 30 until four torpedo boats of the 11th Torpedo Division attacked at 19 : 20 . They fired seven torpedoes of which two or three hit the ship . One was thought to have caused a magazine to explode as a cloud of yellow and black smoke poured out and Knyaz Suvorov listed further to port before capsizing at about 19 : 30 . Other than the 20 officers taken off by Buinyi , there were no survivors of the 928 crew aboard . 
 = Andrew Fisher = 
 Andrew Fisher ( 29 August 1862 – 22 October 1928 ) was an Australian politician who served as Prime Minister of Australia on three separate occasions between 1908 and 1915 . Fisher 's second government between 1910 and 1913 completed a vast legislative programme which made him , along with Protectionist Alfred Deakin , the founder of the statutory structure of the new nation . The Fisher government legacy of reforms and national development lasted beyond the divisions that would later occur with World War I and Billy Hughes ' conscription push . 
 Fisher 's second Prime Ministership resulting from the 1910 federal election represented a number of firsts : it was Australia 's first elected federal majority government , Australia 's first elected Senate majority and the world 's first Labour Party majority government at a national level . After the minority governments of 1904 Chris Watson and his own in 1908 @-@ 1909 it was the world 's third Labour Party government at a national level . It was the first time a Labour Party had controlled any house of a legislature , and the first time the party controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature . At the time , it represented the culmination of Labour 's involvement in politics . Passing 113 Acts , the 1910 – 13 government was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s under John Curtin and Ben Chifley . Serving a collective total of four years and ten months , Fisher is second to Bob Hawke as Australia 's longest serving Labor Prime Minister . 
 <unk> ' was changed to ' Labor ' during 1912 at the instigation of King O 'Malley . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Fisher was born in <unk> , a mining village near Kilmaurs , East Ayrshire , Scotland . He was the second of eight children of Robert Fisher and Jane Garvin . Fisher 's education consisted of some primary schooling , some night schooling , and the reading of books in the library of the cooperative his father had helped to establish . At the age of 10 he began work in a coal mine . He worked six days a week for 12 hours a day . He then had a 4 km trek to go to night school . At 17 he was elected secretary of the local branch of the Ayrshire Miners ' Union , the first step on a road to politics . The union called a strike in 1881 to demand a 10 per cent increase to wages , but this was to prove ultimately unsuccessful and Fisher lost his job as a result . After finding employment at another mine , he once again led miners to strike for higher wages in 1885 . This time , he was not only sacked but also blacklisted . 
 Unable to find work , Fisher and his brother migrated to Queensland in 1885 . Despite leaving his homeland , Fisher is said to have retained a distinctive Scottish accent for the rest of his life . Here , Fisher worked as a miner , first in <unk> and then in Gympie . He became an engine driver ( a role involving the operation of machinery to raise and lower cages in the mine shaft ) after attaining the necessary qualifications in 1891 . In the same year , he was also elected as the president of an engine drivers union . He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union , becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891 . 
 = = Member of Parliament = = 
 = = = Queensland Parliament = = = 
 In 1891 , Fisher was elected as the first president of the Gympie branch of the Labour Party . In 1893 , he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for Gympie and by the following year had become Labour 's deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly . In his maiden speech , he pushed for a 50 per cent cut in military spending and declared support for federation . Another policy area that captured his attention during this term was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations , a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed . He lost his seat in 1896 after a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob <unk> with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti @-@ Catholic , accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times . 
 The 1896 establishment of the Gympie Truth , a newspaper that he was to part @-@ own , was part of his response . Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour 's message , the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher 's return to parliament in 1899 . This time , he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign , in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it . In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven @-@ day government of Anderson Dawson , the first parliamentary Labour government in the world . 
 = = = Federal Parliament = = = 
 The state Labour parties and their MPs were mixed in their support for the Federation of Australia . However Fisher was a firm <unk> , supporting the union of the Australian colonies and campaigned for the ' Yes ' vote in Queensland 's 1899 referendum . Fisher stood for the electorate of Wide Bay at the inaugural 1901 federal election and won the seat , which he held continuously for the rest of his political career . At the end of 1901 Fisher married Margaret Irvine , his previous landlady 's daughter . 
 Labour improved their position at the 1903 election , gaining enough seats to be on par with the other two , a legislative time colloquially known as the " three elevens " . When the Deakin government resigned in 1904 , George Reid of the Free Trade Party declined to take office , resulting in Labour taking power and Chris Watson becoming Labour 's first Prime Minister for a four @-@ month period in 1904 . Fisher established and demonstrated his ministerial capabilities as Minister for Trade and Customs in the Watson Ministry . The fourth Labour member in the ministry after Watson , Hughes , and Lee Batchelor , Fisher was promoted to deputy leader of the party in 1905 . 
 George Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non @-@ Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election , he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti @-@ Socialist Party . Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti @-@ socialist , with the Protectionist Party in the middle . This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two @-@ party system as very much the norm . 
 At the 1906 election , Deakin remained Prime Minister even though Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists . When Watson resigned in 1907 , Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader , although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position . Fisher was considered to have a better understanding of economic matters , was better at handling caucus , had better relations with the party organisation and the unions , and was more in touch with party opinion . He did not share Hughes ' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence ( and later conscription ) . In political terms he was a radical , on the left of his party , with a strong sense of Labour 's part in British working @-@ class history . 
 At the 1908 Labour Federal Conference , Fisher argued for female representation in parliament : 
 With a majority of seats in the Labour @-@ Protectionist government , Labour caucus by early 1908 had become restive as to the future of the Deakin minority government . With the Deakin ministry in trouble , Deakin talked to Fisher and Watson about a possible coalition , and following a report agreed to it providing Labour had a majority in cabinet , that there was immediate legislation for old @-@ age pensions , that New Protection was carried and that at the following election the government would promise a progressive land tax . No coalition was formed , however the pressure from Labour brought about productive change by Deakin : he agreed to a royal commission into the post office , old @-@ age pensions were to be provided from the surplus revenue fund and £ 250 @,@ 000 set aside for ships for an Australian Navy . New Protection was declared invalid by the High Court in June , Fisher found the tariff proposals of Deakin unsatisfactory , while caucus was also dissatisfied with the old @-@ age pension proposals . Without Labour support the Deakin government fell in November 1908 . 
 = = Prime Ministership = = 
 = = = First government 1908 – 09 = = = 
 Fisher formed his only minority government and the First Fisher Ministry . The government amended the Seat of Government Act providing for the new federal capital to be in the Yass @-@ Canberra area , passed the Manufacturers ' Encouragement Act to provide bounties for iron and steel manufacturers who paid fair and reasonable wages , ordered three torpedo boat destroyers , and assumed local naval defence responsibility and placed the Australian Navy at the disposal of the Royal Navy in wartime . Fisher 's first government also saw the passage of the Seamen 's Compensation Act , which provided payment of compensation for seamen engaged upon Australian registered ships wherever trading , and ( in certain cases ) upon British and foreign ships engaged in the coasting trade who were killed or injured in the course of their occupation . 
 Fisher committed Labour to amending the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over labour , wages and prices , to expanding the navy and providing compulsory military training for youths , to extending pensions , to a land tax , to the construction of a transcontinental railway , to the replacement of pound sterling with Australian currency and to tariffs to protect the sugar industry . In May 1909 , the more conservative Protectionists and <unk> merged to form the Commonwealth Liberal Party , while the more liberal Protectionists joined Labour . With a majority of seats , the CLP led by Alfred Deakin ousted Labour from office , with Fisher failing to persuade the Governor @-@ General Lord Dudley to dissolve Parliament . 
 = = = Second government 1910 – 13 = = = 
 At the 1910 election , Labour gained sixteen additional seats to hold a total of forty @-@ two of the seventy @-@ five House of Representative seats , and all eighteen Senate seats up for election to hold a total of twenty @-@ two out of thirty @-@ six seats . This gave Labour control of both Houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry , Australia 's first elected federal majority government , Australia 's first elected Senate majority , and the world 's first Labour Party majority government . The 113 acts passed in the three years of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period . The 1910 – 13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour 's involvement in politics , it was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s under John Curtin and Ben Chifley . 
 Fisher carried out many reforms in defence , constitutional matters , finance , transport and communications , and social security , achieving the vast majority of his aims in his first government , such as establishing old @-@ age and disability pensions , a maternity allowance and workers compensation , issuing Australia 's first paper currency , forming the Royal Australian Navy , the commencement of construction for the Trans @-@ Australian Railway , expanding the bench of the High Court of Australia , founding Canberra and establishing the government @-@ owned Commonwealth Bank . Fisher 's second government also introduced uniform postal charges throughout Australia , carried out measures to break up land monopolies , put forward proposals for more regulation of working hours , wages and employment conditions , and amended the 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide greater authority for the court president and to allow for Commonwealth employees ' industrial unions , registered with the Arbitration Court . A land tax , aimed at breaking up big estates and to provide a wider scope for small @-@ scale farming , was also introduced , while coverage of the Arbitration system extended to agricultural workers , domestics , and federal public servants . In addition , the age at which women became entitled to the old @-@ age pension was lowered from 65 to 60 . The introduction of the maternity allowance was a particularly major reform , as it enabled more births to be attended by doctors , thus leading to reductions in infant mortality . Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced , while the Seaman 's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea , together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin . Eligibility for pensions was also widened . From December 1912 onwards , naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension . That same year , the value of a pensioner 's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property . 
 Fisher wanted additional Commonwealth power in certain areas , such as the nationalisation of monopolies . The 1911 referendum asked two questions , on Legislative Powers and Monopolies . Both were defeated with around 61 per cent voting ' No ' . An additional six questions were asked at the 1913 referendum , on Trade and Commerce , Corporations , Industrial Matters , Trusts , Monopolies , and Railway Disputes . All six were defeated with around 51 per cent voting ' No ' . At the 1913 election , the Commonwealth Liberal Party , led by Joseph Cook , defeated the Labor Party by a single seat . 
 = = = Third government 1914 – 15 = = = 
 Labor retained control of the Senate , however , and in 1914 Cook , frustrated by the Labor controlled Senate 's blocking of his legislation , recommended to the new Governor @-@ General Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson that both houses of the parliament be dissolved and elections called . This was Australia 's first double dissolution election , and the only one until the 1951 election . The First World War had broken out in the middle of the 1914 election campaign , with both sides committing Australia to the British Empire . Fisher campaigned on Labor 's record of support for an independent Australian defence force , and pledged that Australia would " stand beside the mother country to help and defend her to the last man and the last shilling " . Labor won the election with another absolute majority in both houses and Fisher formed his Third Fisher Ministry . 
 Fisher and his party were immediately underway in organising urgent defence measures for planning and implementing Australia 's war effort . Fisher visited New Zealand during this time which saw Billy Hughes as acting Prime Minister for two months . Fisher and Labor continued to implement promised peacetime legislation , including the River Murray Waters Act 1915 , the Freight Arrangements Act 1915 , the Sugar Purchase Act 1915 , the Estate Duty Assessment and the Estate Duty acts in 1914 . Wartime legislation in 1914 and 1915 included the War Precautions acts ( giving the Governor @-@ General power to make regulations for national security ) , a Trading with the Enemy Act , War Census acts , a Crimes Act , a Belgium Grant Act , and an Enemy Contracts Annulment Act . In December 1914 , a War Pensions Act was passed to provide for the grant of Pensions upon the death or incapacity of Members of the Defence Force of the Commonwealth and Members of the Imperial Reserve Forces residents in Australia whose death or incapacity resulted from their employment in connection with warlike operations . 
 In October 1915 , journalist Keith Murdoch reported on the situation in Gallipoli at Fisher 's request , and advised him , " Your fears have been justified " . He described the Dardanelles Expedition as being " a series of disastrous <unk> " and " one of the most terrible chapters in our history " concluding : 
 Fisher passed this report on to Hughes and to Defence Minister George Pearce , ultimately leading to the evacuation of the Australian troops in December 1915 . The report was also used by the Dardanelles Commission on which Fisher served , while High Commissioner in London . 
 Fisher resigned from the Prime Ministership and Parliament on 27 October 1915 after being absent from parliament without explanation for three sitting days . Three days later Labor Caucus unanimously elected Billy Hughes leader of the Federal Parliamentary Party . Fisher 's seat was narrowly won by the Commonwealth Liberal Party on a 0 @.@ 2 percent margin at the 1915 Wide Bay by @-@ election . 
 = = High Commissioner to the United Kingdom = = 
 Fisher served as Australia 's second High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1 January 1916 to 1 January 1921 . Fisher opposed conscription which made his dealings with Billy Hughes difficult . Hughes asked Fisher for support by cable three weeks before the first referendum , but Fisher cabled back " Am unable to sign appeal . Position forbids . " He subsequently refused to publicly comment on the issue . Hughes ' 1916 referendum on conscription had a No vote of around 52 per cent , while the 1917 referendum had a No vote of around 54 per cent . Fisher visited Australian troops serving in Belgium and France in 1919 , and later presented Pearce with an album of battlefield photos from 1917 and 1918 , showing the horrendous conditions experienced by the troops . 
 The Dardanelles Commission , including Fisher , interviewed witnesses in 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report issued in 1919 . It concluded that the expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated , problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels . Some 480 @,@ 000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign , with around half in casualties . The report 's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures ( political or military ) heavily censured . The report of the Commission and information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign .

 Fisher wanted to continue to serve as High Commissioner in London when his term expired in 1921 , but Hughes did not permit it . Upon his return to Australia , there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once more , but he was not interested in doing so . In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park , Hampstead , for the remainder of his life . In his final years , Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia , such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name . He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later . He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead . 
 = = Honours = = 
 At the end of the First World War , France awarded him the Légion d 'honneur , but he declined it ; he did not like decorations of any kind and adhered to this view throughout his life . The federal electorate of Fisher was named after him . A Canberra suburb , Fisher , was also created in his memory , with its streets reflecting a mining theme in honour of Fisher 's occupation before entering public life . Ramsay MacDonald , Britain 's first Labour Prime Minister , unveiled a memorial to Fisher in Hampstead Cemetery in 1930 . A memorial garden was also dedicated to Fisher at his birthplace in the late 1970s . 
 In 1972 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post . 
 In 1992 , his home in Gympie ( Andrew Fisher 's Cottage ) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register . 
 In 2008 Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd launched a biography titled Andrew Fisher , written by David Day . In turn , Rudd was presented with an item that once belonged to Fisher - a slightly battered gold pen engraved with Fisher 's signature , which had been held in safekeeping for 80 years . 
 = Wir danken dir , Gott , wir danken dir , BWV 29 = 
 Wir danken dir , Gott , wir danken dir ( We thank you , God , we thank you ) , BWV 29 , is a sacred cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Leipzig in 1731 for Ratswechsel , the annual inauguration of a new town council , and first performed it on 27 August of that year . The cantata was part of a festive service in the Nikolaikirche . The cantata text by an unknown author includes in movement 2 the beginning of Psalm 75 , and as the closing chorale the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann 's " Nun lob , mein Seel , den Herren " . Bach scored the work in eight movements for four vocal parts and a festive Baroque orchestra of three trumpets , timpani , two oboes , strings , an obbligato organ and basso continuo . The organ dominates the first movement Sinfonia which Bach derived from a Partita for violin . The full orchestra accompanies the first choral movement and plays with the voices in the closing chorale , while a sequence of three arias alternating with two recitatives is scored intimately . 
 Bach used the music from the choral movement for both the Gratias agimus tibi and Dona nobis pacem of his Mass in B minor . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata in 1731 for Ratswechsel , the inauguration of the new town council , which was celebrated annually in a festive service in the Nikolaikirche on the Monday following the feast day of St. Bartholomew ( 24 August ) . It was not a democratic election , but a " ceremonial transfer of office " of council members who were appointed . The service was not part of the liturgical year with cantata texts related to prescribed biblical epistle and gospel readings . For the same occasion , Bach had already written the cantata Preise , Jerusalem , den Herrn , BWV 119 , in his first year in Leipzig , 1723 . For the Ratswechsel service , he could count on the entire council ( his employer ) listening , probably also civil servants and representatives of the Elector 's administration for the region . The musicologist Klaus Hofmann notes : " It was an opportunity for Bach to show how sacred music was flourishing under his direction and to present himself as a composer . " 
 The cantata text of Wir danken dir , Gott by an unknown author includes in movement 2 the first verse of Psalm 75 ( Psalm 75 : 1 ) and as the closing chorale the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann 's hymn of praise " Nun lob , mein Seel , den Herren " ( 1540 ) . 
 Bach first performed the cantata on 27 August 1731 . In 1733 , he adapted the music of the first choral movement with only minor changes for the Gratias agimus tibi of his Missa ( Kyrie and Gloria ) for the Dresden court , on a text expressing the same idea in Latin . According to Hofmann , the movement is based on an earlier lost composition . 
 Bach performed the cantata for <unk> at least two more times , on 31 August 1739 and on 24 August 1749 . He expanded the Missa of 1733 to his Mass in B minor and concluded his work by repeating the music as the Dona nobis pacem . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 The cantata is structured in eight movements and takes about 28 minutes to perform . The instrumentation reflects the festive occasion for which it was written . Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists ( soprano ( S ) , alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ) ( B ) , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque orchestra of three trumpets ( Tr ) , timpani ( Ti ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , two violins ( Vl ) ( violin solo in movement 3 ) , violas ( Va ) , an obbligato organ ( Org ) and basso continuo ( Bc ) . The autograph score is titled : " Bey der <unk> @-@ Wahl / 1731 . / Wir <unk> dir , Gott , wir <unk> dir . / à / 4 Voci . / 3 Trombe / Tamburi / 2 Hautbois / 2 Violini / Viola / e / Continuo / con Organo <unk> / di / <unk> : Bach .

 The cantata is one of few sacred Bach cantatas opened by an orchestral sinfonia . Another is the early Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 . The music , marked Presto is an arrangement of the prelude from Bach 's Partita for violin , BWV 1006 , which Bach had already revised for organ and strings in 1729 for the wedding cantata Herr Gott , <unk> aller Dinge , BWV 120a . In the cantata for Ratswechsel , the solo organ plays the original violin part " in virtuoso motoric writing " , while the full orchestra adds an accompaniment . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The first vocal movement is a setting of verse 1 of Psalm 75 , " Wir danken dir , Gott , wir danken dir , und verkündigen deine Wunder " , translated in the King James version of the bible as " Unto thee , O God , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare " . In contrast to the virtuoso introduction , the chorus begins in motet style in grave stile antico . The bass begins in great simplicity a theme in even steps ; the tenor starts imitating almost immediately , the alto a little later , then the soprano . A countersubject illustrates the telling of God 's wonders , embellishing the words verkündigen ( " declare " ) and Wunder ( " wondrous works " ) . In the beginning only oboes and strings play colla parte with the voices , then a trumpet doubles the soprano . Developing further , two trumpets take part in the polyphony , and a climax is reached when the third trumpet and timpani enter . Hofmann comments that although the movement begins in old style , " Bach ’ s method of intensification ( by means of which he gradually introduces trumpets and ultimately allows the theme to be heard in <unk> ) is thoroughly baroque .

For long stretches in the vocal sections , Bach does without a continuo accompaniment ( thus without the instrumental bass register ) – a tactic that effectively contributes to creating a sonic impression of tenderness and charm " .

 A recitative for alto is a prayer for future protection , " <unk> es <unk> nicht , mit deiner Hand " ( Do not forget later , with Your hand ) ‘ ’ , concluded by a choral Amen in unison .

 The alto performs the last aria , " Halleluja , <unk> und Macht " ( Hallelujah , power and might ) ‘ ’ , repeating and reinforcing the thoughts of the first .

 = Hilda Rix Nicholas = 
 Hilda Rix Nicholas ( née Rix , later Hilda Rix Wright , 1 September 1884 – 3 August 1961 ) was an Australian artist . Hilda Rix was born in the Victorian city of Ballarat . Her father was an education administrator and poet , her mother a musician and artist . She studied under a leading member of the Heidelberg School , Frederick McCubbin , at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905 and was an early member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors . Following the death of her father in 1907 , Hilda Rix , her only sibling Elsie and her mother travelled to Europe where she undertook further study in London and then in Paris . Her teachers during the period included John Hassall , Richard Emil Miller and Théophile <unk> . 
 After travelling to Tangiers in 1912 , Rix held several successful exhibitions of her work , with one drawing , Grande marche , Tanger , purchased by the French government . She was one of the first Australians to paint post @-@ impressionist landscapes , was made a member of the Société des Peintres <unk> Français , and had works hung in the Paris Salon first in 1911 and again in 1913 . The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed , as Rix 's sister died in 1914 , then her mother in 1915 . In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas , only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front . 
 Returning to Australia in 1918 , Rix Nicholas once more took up professional painting , and held an exhibition of over a hundred works at Melbourne 's Guild Hall . Many sold , including In Picardy , purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria . Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s , Rix Nicholas returned to Europe . A 1925 exhibition in Paris led to the sale of her work In Australia to the Musée du Luxembourg , followed by an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries . There followed representation in other exhibitions , including at the International Society of Sculptors , Painters and <unk> , and the Royal Academy of Arts , both in London . Following the inclusion of several works in the 1926 Société Nationale des Beaux @-@ Arts Spring exhibition in Paris she was made an Associate of that organisation . 
 In 1926 , Rix Nicholas returned to Australia , and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright , whom she had met during her travels in the early 1920s . The couple settled at Delegate , New South Wales ; their only child , a son named Rix Wright , was born in 1930 . Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair <unk> , Rix Nicholas , a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful of the works of emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell , grew out of step with trends in Australian art . Her pictures remained didactic , portraying an Australian pastoral ideal , and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven . She held her last solo show in 1947 . Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961 . Her works are held in most major Australian collections , including the Art Gallery of South Australia , Australian War Memorial , National Gallery of Australia , National Gallery of Victoria , and the Queensland Art Gallery . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Henry Finch Rix and Elizabeth Sutton , each of whom had migrated to Australia as children with their families , met and married in Victoria in 1876 . They had two daughters , Elsie Bertha , born in 1877 , and Emily Hilda ( known ubiquitously just as Hilda ) , born in Ballarat on 1 September 1884 . The Rix children grew up in a gifted and energetic family . Henry , a mathematics teacher , was appointed a district Inspector of Schools in the 1880s ; he was also a poet who wrote in support of Australian Federation , and he played Australian rules football for the Carlton Football Club . Elizabeth had grown up assisting in her parents ' thriving music business in Ballarat , and was a singer who performed with the Ballarat Harmonic Society . In addition , she was an artist who had a studio in Melbourne 's Flinders Street , and a committee member of the Austral Salon , " a meeting place for intellectual women interested in the fine arts . " She painted in an academic style , generally choosing still lifes and flowers as subjects , though she also painted some large landscapes in the Beechworth region . 
 Hilda Rix and her sister Elsie both played musical instruments as children , and would perform songs or dances at regional shows . Elsie was a singer and actor who performed at the meetings of the Austral Salon , and the sisters collaborated in designing posters to advertise the Salon 's activities . As a child , Hilda was enthusiastic about drawing . Her artistic efforts drew praise while she was attending high school at Melbourne Girls Grammar ( known as Merton Hall ) , though in most other respects Rix was not an outstanding student . Both Elsie and Hilda took some art lessons with a Mr Mather , before Hilda went on to study at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905 , where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School , Frederick McCubbin . Her fellow students were mostly women and included Jessie Traill , Norah Gurdon , Ruth Sutherland , Dora Wilson , and Vida Lahey . Rix would subsequently be critical of McCubbin 's approach to teaching , referring to his methods as " vague persuasions " . Nevertheless , the author of the only comprehensive biography of Rix , John Pigot , considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways : he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting ; he modelled the importance of nationalistic ideas and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting ; and his work emphasised the painting 's subject over technical considerations . 
 Drawings undertaken by Rix while she was still a student were included in annual exhibitions at the Victorian Artists ' Society and the Austral Salon . At the same time , she was working as a professional illustrator for textbooks and a periodical , the School Paper , published by the Victorian Department of Education . In 1903 , all of the Rix family women had works included in the Austral Salon 's exhibition . 
 One of Rix 's early sketchbooks survives and pages from it were reproduced in the 2012 book , In Search of Beauty . Although she described the works as her " very earliest drawings when a child in Melbourne " , the dated pages indicate they were created up until at least the age of twenty . They mostly portray women , and the settings and dress of her subjects reflect the relatively affluent and educated milieu of which the Rix family were part . 
 In this period , it was common for aspiring Australian artists to seek further training in Europe , particularly London and Paris . Henry Rix arranged to take his family there in conjunction with a trip he was making to study British education reforms , purchasing first @-@ class tickets to travel in 1906 . But Henry , who had been overworked and ill , died suddenly , and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen . Denied a widow 's pension ( Henry had been 58 : too young for his wife to be eligible ) , the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe . Finally , by combining an inheritance , rental income from their home , and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter , they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths , and they set sail for England early in 1907 . 
 = = Europe 1907 – 12 = = 
 Just before her departure from Australia , Rix was advised by the painter Arthur Streeton to study with many different masters , as a means of preserving her own originality . Her subsequent career reflected that advice . One of her first teachers was John Hassall , although he had initially protested that she was already a better drawer than himself . Rix thought him " simply great " , and Pigot credits Hassall 's simple and direct style with influencing the artist 's later practice . 
 Late in 1907 , Rix moved to Paris . There she met with Australian artist Emanuel Phillips Fox , went on sketching expeditions to the Jardin du Luxembourg where Ethel Carrick Fox also worked , and became a student at the Académie <unk> , operated by academic painter Auguste <unk> . The following year she was taught by American impressionist Richard Emil Miller . From him she acquired the use of a relatively bright colour palette , not always naturalistic , as well as his dextrous technique ; she did not , however , follow his predilection for pretty compositions , favouring more direct and clear images . Continuing to acquire skills from a wide range of artists , she next studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière , including with Swiss @-@ born illustrator Théophile <unk> . In the summers , Rix , together with her sister and mother , would travel . In 1908 they journeyed through France and Italy , while in subsequent summers they spent time at the artists ' colony at the fishing village of Étaples , in northern coastal France . Among the artists painting there was Frenchman Jules Adler , who took an interest in Rix 's work , as well as many Australians , including Rupert Bunny , James Peter Quinn , Edward Officer and one of the colony 's longest @-@ term residents , Iso Rae . 
 Around 1909 , Hilda Rix met Wim Brat , an architecture student from a wealthy Dutch family . He asked Rix 's mother for approval to marry her daughter , and Mrs Rix agreed . A happy engagement turned sour , however , when Rix spent time at her fiancé 's home , where she found her prospective husband dominated by his mother , who strongly disapproved of the match . Rix reluctantly broke off the engagement . 
 Rix continued to work hard , and was rewarded with success in having her work hung in the Paris Salon in 1911 , alongside fellow Australians Arthur Streeton and George Bell . 
 = = Moroccan paintings 1912 – 14 = = 
 Rix twice visited north Africa . She first joined American painter Henry <unk> Tanner , his wife and a Miss Simpson on a trip to Morocco in January 1912 . They travelled via Spain , where Rix viewed the work of Velázquez , whose compositions and palette she greatly admired . The party 's destination was Tangier , a place where many other artists had sought inspiration . Jean @-@ Joseph Benjamin @-@ Constant lived and painted there in the 1870s , while Renoir and John Singer Sargent visited in the 1880s . Henri Matisse and Rix were in Tangier at the same time , during which both visited Tétouan , about 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) east of Tangier ; they also used the same model in their works . 
 For about three months , Rix sketched and painted in Tangier , spending time in the open @-@ air market place or soko . Her enthusiasm for the place was evident from her correspondence : 
 Picture me in this market @-@ place – I spend nearly every day there for it fascinates me completely – have done 16 drawings and two oil things so far – Am feeling thoroughly at home now so am going to take out my big oil box – wanted to get used to people and things first – Oh how I do love it all ! ... Oh the sun is shining I must out to work . 
 Morocco had a similar effect on Rix as it did on many artists who visited . Paintings were created in high @-@ keyed colours that captured the intense north African light , and most works focussed on the figures , dress and activity of the people , or the local architecture . One interpretation of the perspective of Rix is that she was an orientalist , in the sense used by academic Edward Said . However , Hoorn argues that she and her sister were to a significant extent counter @-@ orientalist : they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than cultural expressions of difference and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it , rather than presenting generalised views of the orient . Her works also reflected the modernist interest in the empirical : in using the bright light of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions . Stylistically , Rix 's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the " most abstract , flat and post @-@ impressionistic of her career " . Whether this reflected the influence of Matisse is not known – despite the coincidences of their Tangier visits , it is not certain that they actually met . Rix was one of the first Australians to paint post @-@ impressionist landscapes , represented by works such as Men in the Market Place , Tangier ( 1914 ) and View of Tangier ( 1914 ) , produced at the time of a second visit to the city . Such works demonstrated the development of Rix 's style at the time : loose brush strokes , a palette confined to a few low @-@ keyed colours , and an emphasis on shadow and light , affecting both the overall impression made by the picture and the treatment of individual figures . 
 The 1912 trip represented a landmark in her work , led to several exhibitions and her first significant international critical acclaim . The journeys are also the subject of one of the few books about the artist 's work , Jeanette Hoorn 's Hilda Rix Nicholas and Elsie Rix 's Moroccan Idyll : Art and Orientalism . Exhibition of her first works produced immediate results : the French government purchased one of her pictures of the market in Tangiers , and in 1913 she again had paintings displayed at the Paris Salon . The purchase by the French government was of a pastel drawing , Grande marche , Tanger , which she would later copy in oils . The drawing was favourably discussed in the French edition of the New York Herald , but not by one The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer , who complained that " the drawing and colour are eccentric , after the post @-@ impressionist manner " and described the central figure as " grotesque in its want of finish " . 
 The Herald 's reviewer was at odds with prevailing sentiment . Her success was widely reported in Australian papers such as Hobart 's Mercury , Melbourne 's Argus and Adelaide 's Register . In addition to displaying the results of her trip at the Salon , she was invited to exhibit in a 1913 collection at the Société des Peintres <unk> Français , also in Paris . Rix was made a member of the society . In November 1912 , there was a solo exhibition at a private gallery , Galerie J <unk> and Simonson . Her work was illustrated in the Notre Gazette , reflecting her emerging status as a significant artist , and the French press reported her exhibitions . 
 She returned to Tangiers again in early 1914 , this time with her sister Elsie , who also did some drawing and writing but whose main purpose was to provide her sister with company , assistance and protection from curious onlookers while she painted . Rix painted regularly at the soko , where she would both attract much attention and sometimes disrupt the flow of traffic as she sketched . The sisters returned to England and then to France , where Rix again spent the summer at Étaples , until the outbreak of World War I resulted in evacuation to London in August . 
 = = Disaster 1914 – 18 = = 
 The retreat to London marked the beginning of a tragic period . Rix 's mother Elizabeth had been unwell , and deteriorated during the crossing from France to England . Elizabeth was transferred to hospital when they landed ; though she partially recovered and was moved to a nursing home , at that same time her other daughter , Elsie , fell ill . 
 Rix shuttled back and forth between her two ailing family members until , on 2 September 1914 , Elsie died . For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother , fearing it would harm her already fragile condition . Elizabeth survived the news , but as the war continued , Rix 's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing . Then in March 1916 , Elizabeth died . Rix was just over thirty years old , and all her immediate relatives were now dead . Recalling the experience , she later wrote : " I could scarcely put one foot in front of the other and walked like an old thing " . 
 Further misfortune lay in store . In France , an Australian officer , Captain George Matson Nicholas , was posted to Étaples . There he heard about the Australian woman artist who had had to leave her paintings behind when she and her family left abruptly for England . Nicholas sought out the works and admired them , and decided to contact the artist when next he was on leave . He met Rix in September 1916 , and they were married on 7 October at St Saviour 's , Warwick Avenue in London . After three days together , he returned to duty ; she was widowed five weeks later on 14 November , when he was shot and killed during battle at Flers , on the Western Front . Initially writing in her diary that she had lost the will to live , Rix Nicholas 's grief eventually found its expression in three paintings , titled And Those Who Would Have Been Their Sons , They Gave Their Immortality ( a phrase from a poem by Rupert Brooke ) , Desolation and Pro <unk> . The second of these paintings ( which was destroyed in 1930 ) , portrayed a gaunt and tearful woman shrouded in a black cloak , crouched staring at the viewer amidst a <unk> landscape , featureless but for the crosses on distant graves . The National Gallery of Australia holds a charcoal drawing made as a study for the work . The first was " a portrait of a woman cradling a ghostly child " , while the third represented the tragedy of her short marriage to Nicholas . In visualising the ruin of war , her works were more personal than those of other artists of the last years of World War I , such as Paul Nash and Eric Kennington , and her representation of widowhood was both unusual for its time , and confronting for the viewer . 
 = = Return to Australia , 1918 – 1923 = = 
 In March 1918 , Rix Nicholas , along with her brother @-@ in @-@ law Athol Nicholas , left England and arrived in Melbourne on 10 May . There , with the encouragement of artist Henrietta Gulliver and the members of the city 's Women 's Art Club , Rix Nicholas began to reconstruct her career as a professional artist . It did not take long . In November , she was amongst the members of the Club whose works were displayed at the <unk> Hall , where a critic described her as the " dominating personality of the show " . At the same time , in Melbourne 's Guild Hall she held a large exhibition of her European and north African paintings , sketches and drawings , with over a hundred works on display . Several were sold , including In Picardy , purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria . Noting the artist 's success in Paris and London , the reviewer for The Argus admired her " appreciation of character and talents for observation and representation " , while The Age was struck by " the influence of modern French Impressionism in [ her paintings ' ] fearless handling of sunlight and open air effects . " When the exhibition travelled to Sydney in 1919 , reviews were likewise positive both from newspapers and from her peers such as Julian Ashton , Antonio <unk> <unk> and Grace Cossington Smith . 
 Rix Nicholas continued to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press , such as for her show in the Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920 . Nevertheless , Pigot has argued that her place in the Australian art world at the time was complex , and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism , which was being resisted by local critics . Her experience of this more conservative Australia , and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her , contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art , and returning to more academic and figurative subjects . This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long @-@ term trajectory of her career . Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection . 
 In 1922 , a competition was launched by the trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a mural to commemorate the Great War . Rix Nicholas learned of the competition and quickly prepared and submitted an entry . Three judges , all respected Melbourne academic artists , submitted a report to the trustees , who met to consider the entries received . The trustees voted six to five to grant the commission to Harold Septimus Power , despite the fact that he had not fulfilled the conditions of entry ; they then withheld the judges ' report from publication , decided not to exhibit any of the competition entries , and delayed awarding any prize . One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas 's entry had been one of the top three . Rix Nicholas was furious , as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident . Pigot suggests that gender was a factor : " While Rix Nicholas 's claim to be a war artist was legitimate , the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse " . Later that same year , the Australian War Memorial decided to purchase a work by Rix Nicholas portraying a French woman ( titled A Mother of France ( 1914 ) ) , but not to acquire the other work offered , showing an Australian soldier ( A Man ( 1921 ) ) ; according to Pigot , this reflected the gendered approach taken by institutions , which considered that subjects suitable for portrayal by artists were dependent upon their sex . 
 Her paintings of war subjects were just one aspect of Rix Nicholas 's developing commitment to nationalist ideals and the heroic representation of Australia . At the time of her 1919 exhibition , Rix Nicholas had commented that she wished " to show the people [ of Europe ] what is possessed in a land of beauty where the colour scheme is so different , and which sent so many gallant men to the struggle for liberty " . In this respect she was following in the tradition of the Heidelberg School and writers such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson , who extolled the virtues of the bush and pioneer life . Accompanied by her friend Dorothy Richmond , Rix Nicholas set out to paint in rural New South Wales , beginning in Delegate , a small town on the border of New South Wales and Victoria . Here she created numerous works , including In Australia , His Land , and The <unk> . Other works from this period include The Three Sisters , Blue Mountains ( 1921 – 22 ) , which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia . While Australian patriotic imagery and discourse of the period was very male @-@ dominated , Rix Nicholas 's portraits were frequently of women , such as in The Monaro Pioneer , The Magpie 's Song and Motherhood . 
 Back in Sydney , Rix Nicholas held another solo exhibition in August 1923 . Once again it was favourably reviewed , and there was again the description of her work in masculine terms : the reviewer at Sydney 's Sunday Times described her as " the most virile , and , in many respects , the strongest woman painter Australia has yet produced " . Rix Nicholas disliked being thought of as a " woman " artist , but she took such reviews as complimentary , given how dismissive were critics in general when considering paintings by women . 
 = = Second trip to Europe , 1924 – 26 = = 
 In 1924 , Rix Nicholas , again travelling with Dorothy Richmond , set sail for France , intending to exhibit her works in Europe . She voyaged on the Ormonde , which was also carrying the Australian Olympic team . She befriended several of the team members and painted a portrait of one for an Olympic artists ' competition . 
 Arriving in Paris in June , eventually Rix Nicholas rented a studio in Montparnasse , which had previously belonged to French artist Rosa Bonheur . An exhibition at the " prestigious " Georges Petit Galerie in Paris in January 1925 was a great success . It led to important sales , including to the Musée du Luxembourg , making her the only Australian woman to have more than one work in its collection and , according to one report , one of only three Australian artists represented at all at that time , the others being Rupert Bunny and Arthur Streeton . The exhibition led also to a tour of her works to London and British regional galleries , the first time any Australian artist had archived such prominence ; between 1926 and 1928 , her works were shown in Hull , Sunderland , Tyne and Wear , Bootle , Blackpool , Northampton , Warrington , Folkestone , Leicester , Derby , Gateshead and Leek in Staffordshire . 
 The work purchased by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia , a portrait of Ned Wright , manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s . He is portrayed on horseback , a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth , with a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape . His stance is casual , self @-@ assured and heroic , consistent with the up @-@ beat nationalism of Australia at the time . 
 In 1925 there were further exhibitions , including at the International Society of Sculptors , Painters and <unk> , and the Royal Academy of Art , both in London . Also in London , a solo exhibition was held at the Beaux Arts Gallery in December , which displayed her painting His Land . The work was described by one reviewer as having " the rare quality of conveying the spirit of life in the Commonwealth as well as portraying that life pictorially ... the whole picture seems to convey the sunny heat @-@ laden atmosphere of Australia " . Like In Australia , this work also suggested the elemental strength and vitality that Rix Nicholas advocated should pervade Australian painting . 
 In the same year , Rix Nicholas created one of her most extraordinary works , which would also be her largest canvas . Standing almost 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high , and 128 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 20 ft ) wide , Les fleurs <unk> ( ' The despised flowers ' ) is an " unnerving " and " arresting " portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth @-@ century clothing . Painted not with the artist 's typical technique , but in a mannerist style , the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away , her pose tense , expression unreadable , with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress . Although portraying a young lady , the person chosen to sit was " a Parisian professional model and a prostitute , apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous " . The pastiche created in this work is striking : a sixteenth @-@ century artistic style , a composition comprising a seventeenth @-@ century tapestry and an eighteenth @-@ century dress , created by a twentieth @-@ century artist . It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas 's abilities and ambitions , and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon . When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927 , it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic 's attention : 
 For combination of grace , dramatic strength , and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass . There is nothing finicky about it ; it tells its story with vivid directness . As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry , so that the trees on either side lean in arch @-@ wise over the head , the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky , and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees . The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth @-@ century costume , all <unk> with roses and heliotrope ; and the whole mass of detail harmonies [ sic ] perfectly with the type of the model 's face . It is a cold , selfish face . The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there ; and the hands , the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other , give a clear indication of nervous tension within . The treatment of flesh tones and the general arrangement , drawing attention gently but not too <unk> to the <unk> scattered on the polished floor — those are excellent . 
 While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France , she was also creating many new works , including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume , produced during a summer in Brittany . In 1926 , Rix Nicholas was again included in London 's Royal Academy of Art exhibition , where one of her Brittany paintings , Le <unk> , was hung . She also appeared at the Société Nationale des Beaux @-@ Arts Spring exhibition in Paris , in which she had eight works , a very large number for a single artist . The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings : she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year . 
 At the end of 1926 , Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond together returned to Australia . <unk> by her success , Rix Nicholas purchased a car , filled its rear compartment with painting equipment , and the pair set out to paint the landscape , ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south , up into central Queensland . This included a publicity @-@ attracting occasion where she painted figures on the beach at Bondi , reported by various publications including Australian magazine , The Home . 
 = = Wright and Knockalong , 1928 – 61 = = 
 Rix Nicholas had met the farming family , the Wrights , in the early 1920s , including Ned , the subject of In Australia . After returning to the district , she married Edgar Wright on 2 June 1928 in Melbourne , and the couple settled on a property called Knockalong , near Delegate . She continued to exhibit under the name Rix Nicholas , though she was also known as Rix Wright . Her friend Dorothy Richmond , with whom she had visited the region at the start of the decade , married Edgar Wright 's cousin , Walter , and settled in the same region . Then , in 1930 , Rix Nicholas and her husband had their only child , a son , whom they named Rix . 
 While Australian artists embraced modernism and addressed the city , Rix Nicholas focussed on representing a pastoral ideal . In France in the 1920s , Rix Nicholas had entertained Roy de Maistre , one of the first Australians to experiment with <unk> , and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his ' colour @-@ music theory ' ; however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s , Rix Nicholas sided against it . There was in any case , as art historian Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed , " no market for post @-@ impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s " . Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits , while her approach to her subject matter became " more and more didactic " . Women were frequently portrayed , both as rural workers ( as in The Fair <unk> ) and in domestic or family scenes ( as in On The Hilltop ) . Several images , such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon , Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting . Her most " stereotypically feminine " work was The Summer House , which shows two of Rix Nicholas 's friends with some freshly cut flowers , in a setting that , unlike most of her works of the period , screened out the surrounding landscape . It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed . Yet it has become one of her best known works , its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon @-@ holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles . 
 Rix Nicholas had a number of exhibitions with some further critical success . Nevertheless , she became out of step with both the public , who bought few works at her last solo exhibition in 1947 , and with some critics , who either rejected her work or criticised its lack of novelty . One critic , Adrian Lawler , observed : 
 Mrs Rix Nicholas is very gifted and she has her own individuality as an artist ; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling things to say ... as of a healthy fellow @-@ Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility . 
 Another , considering a 1936 exhibition at the David Jones Gallery in Sydney , found the quality of her work uneven , and while he considered some to be strong , others were criticised as " nothing more than pretty and sentimental " . Rix Nicholas 's works remained didactic and insistent in their idealism about rural Australia , but following World War II , the country – and its art critics – had moved on . In 1945 , The Sydney Morning Herald critic , lambasting Rix Nicholas 's works as " crude in colour and poster @-@ ish in presentation " , concluded : " There is insufficient spiritual material to fill the canvases of Hilda Rix Nicholas ... The bravura , the boldness of these pictures is hardly in keeping with the actual knowledge displayed . A certain humility , a close attention to the organisation of detail , and less white mixed into the colours would help tremendously . " 
 The antipathy between Rix Nicholas and prevailing trends in Australian art was mutual . She was appalled by the works of Russell Drysdale and William Dobell , describing the figures in their paintings as " more like victims of the German prison camps " than representations of Australian people . It seemed that the critics did not share her opinion : Dobell and Drysdale had each just won the Wynne Prize in successive years , and both would soon represent their country at the Venice Biennale . 
 A final trip to Europe took place in 1950 . She set out to show her husband the sights of a Europe she knew well , and to find a teacher of sculpture for their son Rix . She was distressed by the standards of artistic practice she found , and instead discouraged Rix from any career in the arts at all . 
 Following her last solo exhibition , a letter from Rix Nicholas to her son expressed despair in her artistic career and summarised the professional fate of her final years : 
 Not doing anything creative is nearly killing me . The trouble is that there is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not ... I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony ... only one 's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied . 
 By this time , her health was deteriorating , and her passion for art fading . Rix Nicholas did exhibit alongside her son in a group exhibition in Sydney , in 1954 ; she presented two oil paintings , while her son had the largest sculpture in the show , titled The Shearer . She died in Delegate on 3 August 1961 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Gender was a recurring theme in Rix Nicholas 's career , for better and for worse . Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying " [ <unk> ] Rix paints like a man ! " . An Australian critic was unsure what to say , admiring her composition but declaring her technique " strangely unfeminine " . Pigot considered that , when Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman 's place in nationalist art in mid @-@ twentieth century Australia , her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness to play by the male establishment 's rules . Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas 's post @-@ World War I work , suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output , because her first husband 's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality . In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting , Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas , alongside Clarice Beckett , to be " the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War " . 
 Many of Rix Nicholas 's works went into private collections for which records are limited . Many more were burned in a fire at the family property after her death in the 1960s . Though her fortunes declined in the latter part of her career , the twenty @-@ first century saw a renewed appreciation of her output . Her oeuvre is represented in most major Australia public galleries , including the Art Gallery of South Australia , the National Gallery of Australia , and the Queensland Art Gallery , as well as in other collections including that of the Australian War Memorial . Internationally , Rix Nicholas is represented in the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume and Leicester Gallery , as well as by her works in the Luxembourg . 
 There have been several posthumous solo exhibitions of Rix Nicholas 's works : in 1971 at the Joseph Brown Gallery in Melbourne ( established by artist Joseph Brown , donor of the Joseph Brown Collection ) , followed by a travelling exhibition in 1978 , displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Ballarat and Macquarie Galleries . In the 1990s there were exhibitions at Ian Potter Museum of Art in Melbourne and the Caspian Gallery in Sydney . In 2013 an exhibition of her work was held at Canberra 's National Portrait Gallery . The National Gallery of Australia in 2014 chose The Three Sisters , Blue Mountains as the painting it would seek to acquire through its Members Acquisition Fund appeal . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Isabel in Virginia = 
 The effects of Hurricane Isabel in Virginia proved to be the costliest disaster in the history of Virginia . Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6 , 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . It moved northwestward , and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 265 km / h ( 165 mph ) on September 11 . After fluctuating in intensity for four days , Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) on September 18 . It quickly weakened over land as it passed through central Virginia , and Isabel became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on September 19 . 
 Strong winds from the hurricane affected 99 counties and cities in the state , which downed thousands of trees and left about 1 @.@ 8 million without power . The storm surge impacted much of the southeastern portion of the state , peaking at around 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) in Richmond along the James River ; the surge caused significant damage to homes along riverways . The nationwide maximum rainfall total from the hurricane was 20 @.@ 2 inches ( 513 mm ) in Sherando , Virginia . In the state 's mountainous region , heavy rainfall caused severe and damaging flash flooding . The hurricane caused about $ 1 @.@ 85 billion ( 2003 USD , $ 2 @.@ 17 billion 2008 USD ) in damage and 36 deaths in the state — 10 directly from the storm 's effects and 26 indirectly related . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 By four days before Isabel made landfall , most weather models predicted Isabel to make landfall between North Carolina and New Jersey . Initially , forecasters predicted it to move along the coastline of the Chesapeake Bay , though as the hurricane neared land the predicted track was much closer to where it ultimately was . The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from the North Carolina / Virginia border to Chincoteague near its border with Maryland about 50 hours before Isabel struck land , including the southern portion of the Chesapeake Bay . 18 hours before the hurricane made landfall , the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the entire coastline . Additionally , inland hurricane and tropical storm warnings were issued for south @-@ central Virginia . The Wakefield National Weather Service office issued three tornado warnings for four counties , though none became tornadoes . The office also issued two county @-@ wide flood warnings and 43 flood warnings and flood statements for various river basins . 
 The Virginia Emergency Management Agency was activated on September 15 , about three days prior to Isabel making landfall and entering the state . Officials in Hampton issued the first mandatory evacuation in the state on September 17 , about 35 hours prior to landfall . Eleven hours later , a mandatory evacuation was issued for some residents in Chesapeake , Norfolk , and Virginia Beach , with a recommended evacuation for some residents in the city of Suffolk and Isle of Wight , Northumberland , Richmond , and York counties . Later on September 17 Governor Mark Warner provided authorization for all recommended evacuations to become mandatory . By the time Isabel entered Virginia late on September 18 , evacuations were also issued for Accomack County , Chincoteague , Gloucester County , Lancaster County , Mathews County , Newport News , Poquoson , Portsmouth , and Westmoreland County . The zones ordered to evacuate included residents along waterfronts , in areas prone to flooding , potentially affected by storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane , low @-@ lying areas , health care facilities , or islands . The tools officials used to determine the evacuation zones included shelter locations , the SLOSH storm surge model , evacuation maps , and clearance times . 
 Despite the orders , a relatively small number of people evacuated for the hurricane . According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce , the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane , of which 41 % in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location . In Surry , only 9 % of those in a Category 2 hurricane storm surge zone left . 30 % who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left . The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel , its strength , or influence from the media . Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location , however . Of those who evacuated , about 64 % left for the house of a friend or a relative , with about 24 % evacuating to a hotel or a motel . Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state , while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community . The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied , with 23 % leaving for Maryland and 46 % staying in their own neighborhood or community . The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days , with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads . The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations . In all , more than 160 @,@ 000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate , including 11 @,@ 000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News . A total of about 16 @,@ 325 people evacuated to 67 shelters . Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies , unanticipated medical issues , overcrowding , and lack of security . 
 United States Navy officials in Norfolk ordered more than 40 destroyers , frigates , and amphibious ships out to sea to avoid any potential damage from the hurricane . Officials at the Langley Air Force Base in Hampton ordered about 6 @,@ 000 workers to evacuate elsewhere , due to its vulnerability to flooding . About 350 National Guard workers assisted boat owners in the southeastern portion of the state . In Mathews County , two boat owners experienced fatal heart attacks as they worked to protect their boats . Officials distributed sandbags throughout the state for residents in flood @-@ prone areas , including about 10 @,@ 000 in the city of Alexandria . Prior to the arrival of the hurricane , the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel was closed , as were all campgrounds along the Blue Ridge Parkway and the primary parkway in Roanoke . In Chincoteague , the famous Chincoteague Ponies were moved by volunteer firefighters to grounds of about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) higher . Officials closed schools , government offices , and businesses across the eastern portion of the state , leaving usually heavily congested roads as empty streets . Additionally , officials canceled trains along the Washington Metro , the Virginia Railway Express , and Amtrak lines , and several flights in and out of the Richmond International Airport . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Throughout the state , Hurricane Isabel resulted in a damage total of $ 1 @.@ 85 billion ( 2003 USD , $ 2 @.@ 17 billion 2008 USD ) . The hurricane destroyed more than 1 @,@ 186 homes and 77 businesses , severely damaged 9 @,@ 110 homes and 333 businesses , and left 107 @,@ 908 homes and over 1 @,@ 000 businesses with minor damage .

A total of 1 @.@ 8 million electrical customers were left without power , with electrical damage totaling $ 128 million ( 2003 USD , $ 150 million 2008 USD ) . Dominion Virginia Power reported 2 @,@ 311 broken utility poles , 3 @,@ 899 snapped <unk> , and 7 @,@ 363 spans of downed power lines , with 72 % of its primary distribution circuits damaged . The passage of the hurricane resulted in an agricultural damage total of about $ 117 million ( 2003 USD , $ 137 million 2008 USD ) .

 Along the Eastern Shore of Virginia , Isabel produced sustained winds reaching 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) with gusts to 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) at Wallops Island . Higher unofficial gusts were recorded , including a peak reading of 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) in Chincoteague . Rainfall was fairly light , with 2 inches ( 51 mm ) recorded in <unk> . On Fisherman Island , the hurricane produced a 4 @.@ 26 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 3 @-@ m ) storm surge , flooding much of the island . The combination of the surge and waves resulted in minor beach erosion and overwash . Northampton County reported $ 10 million in crop damage ( 2003 USD , $ 12 million 2008 USD ) . One person died in Accomack County when a tree fell on his mobile home . 
 In the Hampton Roads region , Isabel produced a high storm surge , including reports of 7 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge @-@ Tunnel and a peak of 8 @.@ 3 feet ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) at Gloucester Point . Unofficially higher amounts included an estimate of 10 @.@ 75 feet ( 3 @.@ 28 m ) at Smithfield . In some locations , the surge surpassed the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake @-@ Potomac Hurricane . Despite being classified as a hurricane while crossing the state , sustained winds only peaked at 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) at Gloucester Point , 4 mph ( 6 @.@ 4 km / h ) less than minimum hurricane intensity . Hurricane @-@ force wind gusts were recorded at multiple locations , with a 91 mph ( 146 km / h ) reading at Gloucester Point and unofficial reports peaking at 107 mph ( 172 km / h ) on Gwynns Island . Additionally , <unk> Light , located 12 miles ( 19 km ) east of Virginia Beach , reported a peak wind gust of 107 mph ( 172 km / h ) . The hurricane produced heavy rainfall in the Hampton Roads area , reaching 10 @.@ 6 inches ( 270 mm ) at James City . The outer rainbands of Isabel spawned a 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) wide F0 tornado in Nottoway County near Crewe , the only confirmed tornado during the passage of the hurricane . However , many people in the city of Norfolk reported that there was a tornado in that city as well . The tornado lasted a short amount of time and caused no known damage . Strong waves , which reached 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in height offshore , caused severe beach erosion in Hampton , Newport News , and other locations along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay . 
 In Virginia Beach , the 15th Street fishing pier was significantly damaged due to intense wave action . Likewise the historic Harrison 's Pier in the Ocean View area of Norfolk was completely destroyed . Many private piers and some public ones along the coastline were destroyed or damaged from the waves and storm surge , including a destroyed pier each in <unk> Beach and Lynnhaven . Moderate winds caused light damage to roofs and siding of oceanfront homes and hotels . In Virginia Beach , beach erosion and coastal flooding was minimal , credited due to a $ 125 million beach expansion project . Several bridges in the Hampton Roads area were closed due to the hurricane . The strong storm surge surpassed the floodgate to the Midtown Tunnel while workers attempted to close the gate . About 44 million US gallons ( 170 @,@ 000 m3 ) of water from the Elizabeth River flooded the tunnel entirely in just 40 minutes , with the workers barely able to escape . The flooding left the tunnel damaged and closed for nearly a month . 
 Heavy rainfall led to moderate to severe inland flooding , with high waters reported along U.S. Route 460 in Prince George County , U.S. Route 17 , and several other roads . The rainfall led to river flooding , including minor to moderate flooding along the Rivanna and James Rivers , moderate flooding along the Appomattox River , and moderate to major flooding along the Meherrin , Nottoway , and Blackwater Rivers . In Isle of Wight County , a driver attempted to cross high water on the James River Bridge and was killed when the water washed the car off of the road . 
 The unusually large wind field uprooted many thousands of trees , downed many power lines , damaged hundreds of houses , and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms . Hundreds of roads , including major highways , were blocked by fallen trees . An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage . Two people in the region died due to falling trees — one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell . Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads , resulting in multiple minor car accidents . Additionally , most gas stations were closed , due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable . Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues , the longest it has ever been closed during a school term . Likewise , Norfolk State University , Regent University , Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity . 
 = = = Northern = = = 
 Funnel clouds were reported along the Northern Neck . The hurricane produced a strong storm surge across northern Virginia , reaching 9 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) in Alexandria . Rainfall was light across the region , with amounts varying between 1 – 3 inches ( 25 – 75 mm ) . 
 The storm surge washed out 160 homes and 60 condominiums in Fairfax County , with an additional 2 @,@ 000 units reporting minor to severe damage from the flooding . In Stafford County , the surge destroyed five marinas and broke many boats free from their docks , while in Alexandria it flooded numerous businesses and severely impacting marinas . One section of CSX Transportation railway tracks in Prince William County collapsed into the Potomac River from the surge . 
 Gusty winds downed several trees across Alexandria , causing about $ 2 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 2 @.@ 3 million 2008 USD ) . In Arlington County , flooding and downed trees destroyed two houses and damaged 192 homes , 46 severely . The storm surge flooded a parking lot at the Reagan National Airport . Damage in the county totaled $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 2003 USD , $ 2 @.@ 9 million 2008 USD ) . Falling trees caused major damage to 15 homes in the city of Fairfax , and damage throughout Fairfax County totaled $ 18 million ( 2003 USD , $ 21 million 2008 USD ) . Four homes and 20 businesses in King George County were severely damaged , with an additional 150 – 200 reporting lesser damage from winds and falling trees . Gusty winds forced the closure of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge . In Prince William County , seven homes were destroyed , with 24 homes and three businesses experiencing major damage . Several roads were closed due to downed trees . The Marine Corps Base Quantico reported severe damage amounting to $ 9 @.@ 5 million ( 2003 USD , $ 11 million 2008 USD ) . Damage included a destroyed marina from flooding , with falling trees damaging buildings and vehicles . Additionally , fallen trees severely damaged 31 homes and caused minor damage to 68 more in Stafford County . The roof of a shelter in Mathews County was partially blown off . A power outage in Northumberland County caused the NOAA Weather Radio Station in <unk> to go off the air during the height of the storm , leaving the transmitter out of service for several days . 
 = = = Central and southwest = = = 
 A tornado was reported near Emporia , though this was not later confirmed . The storm surge tracked into the central portion of the state , with a site on the James River in Richmond reporting an estimated surge of about 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) , about 103 river miles ( 166 km ) from its confluence with the lower Chesapeake Bay . Additionally , widespread areas of heavy rainfall of over 5 inches ( 130 mm ) led to flooding of rivers . Richmond set a new daily rainfall record from the precipitation from Isabel . Strong winds were reported throughout the region , and wind gusts reached 73 mph ( 117 km / h ) at Richmond International Airport . 
 The storm surge significantly damaged or destroyed many homes along the James River , particularly in the towns of Claremont and <unk> Bay , Virginia . The surges in several tidal rivers caught some residents by surprise , both in height and severity . A man in Henrico County drowned after crashing into a flooded creek . 
 The winds downed trees throughout the area , some of which hit homes and vehicles . In Amelia County , strong winds removed a mobile home from its foundation and destroyed it . Falling trees killed two in the area — one in Chesterfield County and one in the city of Richmond . The downed trees snapped many power lines , leaving about 365 @,@ 000 Dominion Virginia Power customers in the Richmond area without power . A portion of the roof of The Diamond , home of the Richmond Braves , was damaged by the winds . 
 Wet conditions caused many accidents along roadways in central Virginia . A motorist on Interstate 95 in Richmond died when he hydroplaned and crashed his car . In Albemarle County , a popular forest boardwalk that was part of the Monticello property was destroyed by a falling oak tree . Also in Albemarle , two people were killed when their car drove off a road and crashed into a tree during heavy rainfall . A man in Chesterfield County died when struck by a tree . Three people died when a car in southern Fluvanna County crashed into a tree . The deaths were considered indirectly related to the storm . In south @-@ central Virginia , strong winds produced widespread wind damage , with numerous trees and power lines reported down . In Campbell County , two homes were destroyed and ten others suffered minor damage . One residence in Amherst County suffered minor damage , and in Appomattox County one home reported major damage . In Buckingham County , one home was destroyed , three reported major damage , and one business suffered minor damage , while in Charlotte County , two homes were destroyed , 30 homes suffered major damage , and five businesses suffered minor damage . The storm destroyed one home and damaged 20 , severely damaged three businesses , and caused some crop damage in Pittsylvania County . Monetary damage in the region totaled about $ 3 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 4 million 2008 USD ) . 
 = = = Shenandoah Valley = = = 
 Intense rainbands from Isabel produced heavy rainfall across the Shenandoah Valley , peaking at 20 @.@ 2 inches ( 513 mm ) in Upper Sherando in Augusta County . Sustained winds in the area ranged from 25 – 50 mph ( 40 – 80 km / h ) , while wind gusts reached about 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . Strong winds downed numerous trees and power lines , causing some power outages . 
 The rainfall led to extensive flash flooding and river flooding , including along several tributaries of the South River . The rainfall also caused extensive surface runoff in higher terrains , which led to flow over emergency spillways . Four spillways to dams flooded , causing damage , though none of them failed . At the Mills Creek Dam , the water reached about 2 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) above the emergency spill way , causing $ 125 @,@ 000 in damage to the dam ( 2003 USD ) . Water flowed down the Black Creek at 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , washing out the bridge and several hundred feet of asphalt along several locations of State Route 608 . The South River at Waynesboro rapidly flooded and crested at nearly 13 @.@ 9 feet ( 4 @.@ 2 m ) , destroying four bridges and flooding downtown businesses in 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) – 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) of water . There , emergency management personnel evacuated about 300 people due to the ensuing flooding , which caused about $ 250 @,@ 000 in property damage ( 2003 USD ; $ 293 @,@ 000 2008 USD ) . In all , about 350 were evacuated in Augusta County , 21 of whom by boat . Damages to public roads and equipment in the area were estimated at $ 1 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 1 @.@ 2 million 2008 USD ) . 13 homes were destroyed , with three businesses and 64 other residencies reporting major damage — some reported over 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of mud in their homes . Damage in the Shenandoah Valley totaled about $ 29 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 34 million 2008 USD ) . A man canoeing in high flood waters drowned in Harrisonburg , while two others drowned in a horse and buggy after crossing a low water bridge in Rockingham County . The flooding also killed 25 – 30 head of livestock .

 On the day of Isabel moving through the state , President George W. Bush declared 18 counties and 14 independent cities as disaster areas , making residents and business @-@ owners there eligible for federal funding . Additionally , funds were allocated for state and local governments in the 31 designated jurisdictions to pay 75 % of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane , including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government . Many other jurisdictions were added , based on subsequent damage reports , and by September 22 , 99 jurisdictions were eligible for disaster assistance . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) provided hurricane @-@ related bulletins , including safety tips and the method for removing hazardous materials . By 12 days after the passage of the hurricane , FEMA distributed more than 6 @.@ 3 million lbs . ( 2 @.@ 9 million kg ) of ice and 1 @.@ 4 million US gallons ( 5 @,@ 300 m3 ) of water to areas affected by Isabel . Disaster Recovery Centers , which contain information on the aftermath process , were opened in eight locations and received more than 1 @,@ 850 inquiries . More than 350 FEMA inspectors visited homes to verify damages caused by Isabel , and by the end of September 2003 about 12 @,@ 000 inspections were completed . In response to the power outages , FEMA installed 28 generators at disaster @-@ affected critical public facilities to support life @-@ sustaining community needs . By about four months after the hurricane , 93 @,@ 139 individuals in the designated areas applied for disaster assistance , while 20 @,@ 417 people visited Disaster Recovery Centers throughout the state . The Small Business Administration approved more than 3 @,@ 000 low @-@ interest disaster loans from homes and businesses , with the value of the loans totaling $ 74 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 87 million 2008 USD ) . The government provided $ 105 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 123 million 2008 USD ) for debris removal , emergency protective services , and permanent work , and approved about $ 25 @.@ 9 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 30 @.@ 3 million 2008 USD ) for life @-@ sustaining needs such as water , ice , and generators at critical public facilities . Monetary assistance for temporary rental assistance and minimal home repairs totaled $ 32 million ( 2003 USD ; $ 37 million 2008 USD ) , as well . 
 Volunteer agencies arrived in the state to assist in the aftermath of the hurricane , and by about ten days after Isabel volunteers served more than 550 @,@ 000 meals to affected residents ; over 933 @,@ 000 meals were served during the four @-@ month cleanup operation Over 10 volunteer organizations , under the coordination of Virginia 's Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster , worked to help individuals with debris removal across the state . 
 Dominion Virginia Power quickly began to restore the widespread power outages with a workforce of about 11 @,@ 000 , working between 14 and 16 hours per day . By two days after the storm , about 900 @,@ 000 remained without power . By five days after the storm , about 584 @,@ 000 throughout the state were still without power , and by ten days after Isabel the total dropped to about 160 @,@ 000 , most of whom were in the Hampton Roads area . Improper use of generators caused three indirect storm deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from improper ventilation of homes . 
 As a result of polluted runoff from storm surge and heavy rains , the Virginia Department of Health forbade gathering shellfish in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay , as well as all rivers flowing into the bay . 
 = American Airlines Flight 1 = 
 American Airlines Flight 1 was a domestic , scheduled passenger flight from New York International ( Idlewild ) Airport ( now John F. Kennedy International Airport ) , to Los Angeles International Airport . On March 1 , 1962 , the plane – having just taken off two minutes earlier – rolled over and crashed into a swamp , killing all 87 passengers and eight crew members aboard . A Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) investigation determined that a manufacturing defect in the automatic pilot system led to an uncommanded rudder control system input , causing the accident . 
 A number of notable people lost their lives in the crash . It was the sixth fatal Boeing 707 crash and , at the time , the deadliest . Today , American 1 operates the same daily route from JFK to Los Angeles , but as an Airbus A321 .

 The aircraft was a Boeing 707 @-@ <unk> , U.S. Registry <unk> . It was delivered to American Airlines on February 12 , 1959 . At the time of the crash , it had accumulated 8 @,@ 147 flight hours . Its last periodic inspection had occurred on January 18 , 1962 at 7 @,@ 922 hours of air time . The flight crew consisted of Captain James Heist , First Officer Michael Barna , Jr . , Second Officer Robert <unk> , and Flight Engineer Robert Cain . Also aboard were four stewardesses : Shirley Grabow , Lois Kelly , Betty Moore , and Rosalind Stewart . 
 The aircraft received instructions to taxi to Runway <unk> at 9 : 54 AM EST , and clearance to proceed to Los Angeles non @-@ stop under instrument flight rules ( IFR ) at 10 : 02 AM EST . Flight 1 became airborne at 10 : 07 AM EST . Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions , the aircraft initiated a left turn to a heading of 290 . In the course of the turn , at 1 @,@ 600 feet , the Boeing banked too far , flipped past 90 degrees , and began an upside @-@ down , nose @-@ first descent in a nearly vertical dive . 
 Flight 1 crashed into Pumpkin Patch Channel , Jamaica Bay , at 10 : 08 : 49 , while angled at 78 degrees and on a magnetic heading of 300 degrees . Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay . The jet exploded upon impact , a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site , and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire . Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses , though no one on the ground is known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp . However , a few men at Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars , and one guard — at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over — saw the plane roll over . 
 The aircraft crashed into a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay used as a wildlife sanctuary . Upwards of 300 policemen and fire fighters , including 125 detectives attending a narcotics seminar at the Police Academy , as well as Coast Guard helicopters were mobilized to the crash site within half an hour of the crash for rescue operations , only to find there were no survivors . The three @-@ alarm fire was under control by 10 : 50 AM EST , by which point only wreckage remained . Low tides aided search personnel in their attempts to recover bodies from the downed aircraft . Only a few bodies remained intact . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board received notification of the accident at 10 : 10 AM EST and immediately sent investigators to Jamaica Bay to conduct an investigation . The flight recorder was found on March 9 and sent to Washington for analysis . Public hearings were held at the International Hotel in New York on March 20 – 23 , 1962 . 
 Investigators were unable to recover sufficient body tissue to determine whether the crew had been physically incapacitated at the time of the crash . Toxicology reports conclusively ruled out toxic gases , alcohol , and drugs as possible cause for the crash . Milton <unk> , Chief Medical Examiner , decided that having relatives attempt visual identification of the crash victims was inhumane and ordered dental and fingerprint comparisons . In early July , the CAB announced their investigators believed that a cotter pin and a bolt missing from the rudder mechanism might have caused Flight 1 's crash . Though considered to be a " mechanic 's oversight " , the CAB nevertheless wired all 707 operators to inform them of the potential danger of the assembly . 
 In January 1963 , the CAB released a Civil Aeronautics Board Aircraft Accident Report stating that the " most likely abnormality " to have caused the crash was a short circuit caused by wires in the automatic piloting system that had been damaged in the manufacturing process . 
 From the CAB 's AAR , Pg 2 , probable cause : " ... rudder control system malfunction producing yaw , sideslip , and roll leading to a loss of control from which recovery was not effective . " 
 From AAR pg 54 : " The Board therefore concludes that a rudder servo malfunction due to shorted wires is the most likely abnormality to have produced the accident . " 
 CAB inspectors had inspected units at a Teterboro , New Jersey , Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires , thereby damaging them . The Bendix Corporation issued denials , stating that the units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing , in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work , and insisted that had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point , it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced .

 = History of poison = 
 The history of poison stretches from before 4500 BC to the present day . Poisons have been used for many purposes across the span of human existence , most commonly as weapons , anti @-@ venoms , and medicines . Poison has allowed much progress in branches , toxicology , and technology , among other sciences . 
 Poison was discovered in ancient times , and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure the death of their prey or enemies . This use of poison grew more advanced , and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement . Later in history , particularly at the time of the Roman Empire , one of the more prevalent uses was assassination . As early as 331 BC , poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported , and the practice became a common occurrence . The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class ; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents . 
 In Medieval Europe , poison became a more popular form of killing , though cures surfaced for many of the more widely known poisons . This was stimulated by the increased availability of poisons ; shops known as apothecaries , selling various medicinal wares , were open to the public , and from there , substances that were traditionally used for curative purposes were employed for more sinister ends . At approximately the same time , in the Middle East , Arabs developed a form of arsenic that is odorless and transparent , making the poison difficult to detect . This " poison epidemic " was also prevalent in parts of Asia at this time , as well . 
 Over the centuries , the variety of harmful uses of poisons continued to increase . The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel . In the modern world , intentional poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages . Rather , the more common concern is the risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products . 
 Constructive uses for poisons have increased considerably in the modern world . Poisons are now used as pesticides , disinfectants , cleaning solutions , and preservatives . Nonetheless , poison continues to be used as a hunting tool in remote parts of developing countries , including Africa , South America , and Asia . 
 = = Origins of poison = = 
 Archaeological findings prove that while ancient mankind used conventional weapons such as axes and clubs , and later swords , they sought more subtle , destructive means of causing death — something that could be achieved through poison . Grooves for storing or holding poisons such as <unk> have been plainly found in their hunting weapons and tools , showing that early humans had discovered poisons of varying potency and applied them to their weapons . Some speculate that this use and existence of these strange and noxious substances was kept secret within the more important and higher @-@ ranked members of a tribe or clan , and were seen as emblems of a greater power . This may have also given birth to the concept of the stereotypical " medicine man " or " witch doctor " . 
 Once the use and danger of poison was realized , it became apparent that something had to be done . Mithridates VI , King of Pontus ( an ancient Hellenistic state of northern Anatolia ) , from around 114 – 63 BC , lived in constant fear of being assassinated through poison . He became a hard @-@ working pioneer in the search for a cure for poisons . In his position of power , he was able to test poisons on criminals facing execution , and then if there was a possible antidote . He was paranoid to the point that he administered daily amounts of poisons in an attempt to make himself immune to as many poisons as he could . Eventually , he discovered a formula that combined small portions of dozens of the best @-@ known herbal remedies of the time , which he named <unk> . This was kept secret until his kingdom was invaded by Pompey the Great , who took it back to Rome . After being defeated by Pompey , Mithridates ' antidote prescriptions and notes of medicinal plants were taken by the Romans and translated into Latin . 
 Pliny the Elder describes over 7000 different poisons . One he describes as " The blood of a duck found in a certain district of Pontus , which was supposed to live on poisonous food , and the blood of this duck was afterwards used in the preparation of the <unk> , because it fed on poisonous plants and suffered no harm . " 
 = = = India = = = 
 Indian surgeon Sushruta defined the stages of slow poisoning and the remedies of slow poisoning . He also mentions antidotes and the use of traditional substances to counter the effects of poisoning . 
 Poisoned weapons were used in ancient India , and war tactics in ancient India have references to poison . A verse in Sanskrit reads " Jalam <unk> <unk> ca <unk> , " which translates to " Waters of wells were to be mixed with poison and thus polluted . " 
 <unk> ( c . 350 – 283 BC ) , also known as Kautilya , was adviser and prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta ( c . 340 – 293 BC ) . Kautilya suggested employing means such as seduction , secret use of weapons , and poison for political gain . He also urged detailed precautions against assassination — tasters for food and elaborate ways to detect poison . In addition , the death penalty for violations of royal decrees was frequently administered through the use of poison . 
 = = = Egypt = = = 
 Unlike many civilizations , records of Egyptian knowledge and use of poisons can only be dated back to approximately 300 BC . However , it is believed that the earliest known Egyptian pharaoh , Menes , studied the properties of poisonous plants and venoms , according to early records . 
 The Egyptians are also thought to have come into knowledge about elements such as antimony , copper , crude arsenic , lead , opium , and mandrake ( among others ) which are mentioned in papyri . Egyptians are now thought to be the first to master distillation , and to manipulate the poison that can be retrieved from apricot kernels . 
 Cleopatra is said to have poisoned herself with an asp after hearing of Marc Antony 's demise . Prior to her death , she was said to have sent many of her maidservants to act as guinea pigs to test different poisons , including belladonna , <unk> , and the strychnine tree 's seed . 
 After this , the alchemist <unk> ( around AD 300 ) spoke of a mineral that when mixed with natron produced a ' fiery poison ' . He described this poison as ' disappearing in water ' , giving a clear solution . Emsley speculates that the ' fiery poison ' was arsenic trioxide , the unidentified mineral having to have been either realgar or orpiment , due to the relation between the unidentified mineral and his other writings . 
 = = = Rome = = = 
 In Roman times , poisoning carried out at the dinner table or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of , or even uncommon , and was happening as early as 331 BC . These poisonings would have been used for self @-@ advantageous reasons in every class of the social order . The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome , and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives , even hiring a personal poisoner . His preferred poison was said to be cyanide . 
 Nero 's predecessor , Claudius , was allegedly poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs . However , accounts of the way Claudius died vary greatly . Halotus , his taster , Xenophon , his doctor , and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance , but Agrippina , his final wife , is considered to be the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself . Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal , while some say that he recovered somewhat , only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit , or by poisoned gruel or an enema . Agrippina is considered to be the murderer , because she was ambitious for her son , Nero , and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues .

 Despite the negative effects of poison , which were so evident in these times , cures were being found in poison , even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public . An example can be found in the works of Iranian born Persian physician , philosopher , and scholar Rhazes , writer of Secret of Secrets , which was a long list of chemical compounds , minerals and <unk> , the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti @-@ septic , and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative . He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate . An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as ' the itch ' , which is now referred to as scabies . This proved an effective treatment because of mercury 's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin , allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch . 
 In India , the troubled 14th and 15th centuries in Rajasthan saw invasions in the Rajput heartlands . Rajput women practiced a custom of <unk> ( literally the taking of life ) when their sons , brothers , or husbands faced certain death in battle . <unk> was practiced within the Kshatriya warrior class to avoid the fate of subservience , slavery , rape , or slaughter at the hands of the invading forces .

 Nazi war leader Hermann Göring used cyanide to kill himself the night before he was supposed to be hanged during the Nuremberg Trials . Adolf Hitler had also taken a pill of cyanide but he bit down on the capsule and shot himself in the right temple shortly before the fall of Berlin along with his wife , Eva Braun .

 In the late 20th century , an increasing number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous . The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor , where poison be induced or taken by accident . Poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people . Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old . 
 However , hospital and emergency facilities are much enhanced compared to the first half of the 20th century and before , and antidotes are more available . Antidotes have been found for many poisons , and the antidotes for some of the most commonly known poisons are shown in the table above : 
 However , poison still exists as a murderous entity today , but it is not as popular form of conducting murder as it used to be in past times , probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration . One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium @-@ 210 radiation poisoning .
