 A coronation ceremony took place , in which Hart was proclaimed King of the Ring . Jerry Lawler interrupted the ceremony , however , and claimed to be the only king in the WWF . He had been using the nickname " The King " since defeating Jackie Fargo for the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship in 1974 and did not want to share the title . Lawler attacked Hart and hit him with the scepter and throne that were being used for the ceremony . As the PPV went off the air , Hart was lying on the floor , unable to fight back . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 For the remainder of the summer , Hulk Hogan resumed his feud with Yokozuna on the international house show circuit . He then left the WWF and focused on his acting career . He starred in Thunder in Paradise , a weekly syndicated television show that ran from 1993 to 1994 . While filming the show , he was offered a contract with World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) , the WWF 's main competitor . He joined WCW in summer 1994 and wrestled his first match at Bash at the Beach 1994 , where he defeated Ric Flair to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship . He continued to wrestle for WCW until the summer of 2000 and did not return to the WWF until early 2002 . 
 Yokozuna held the WWF World Heavyweight Championship for over nine months before dropping the belt to Bret Hart . Shawn Michaels was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship in September 1993 , which set up a battle royal in which Razor Ramon became the next champion . The Steiner Brothers continued to feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship . They defeated DiBiase and Schyster the day after King of the Ring to win the belts . They held them for two days before losing them to Money Inc . Three days later , the Steiners regained the belts , which they held for the remainder of the feud . 
 Jerry Lawler feuded with Bret Hart for more than two years after King of the Ring . They faced each other at SummerSlam 1993 to determine the true king of the WWF . Lawler won the match and the title after Hart was disqualified . They were supposed to wrestle against each other at Survivor Series 1993 in an elimination match , but Lawler was unable to appear because he had been charged with rape and sodomy in real life . The accuser later admitted that she had falsified the charges . Hart feuded with his brother Owen throughout 1994 , so the feud with Lawler lay dormant . Lawler accused Bret Hart of being a racist in 1995 in order to create problems between Hart and Japanese wrestler Hakushi . This re @-@ ignited the feud between Hart and Lawler , and they faced each other at In Your House 1 . Hakushi interfered in the match , which enabled Lawler to pin Hart . This set up a " Kiss my Foot " match between Hart and Lawler at King of the Ring 1995 . According to the stipulation , the loser would be forced to kiss the winner 's feet . Lawler lost and brought in his dentist , Isaac Yankem , who soon debuted in the WWF . Yankem wrestled Hart at SummerSlam 1995 ; Hart won the match by disqualification after Yankem and Lawler choked Hart with the ring ropes .

 Reviews for the event have been mainly positive . Writing for Online Onslaught , columnist Adam Gutschmidt stated that the event is the best King of the Ring show to watch . He called all three of Bret Hart 's matches " outstanding " but was not as impressed with any of the other matches on the card . He thought that the eight @-@ man match served no real purpose , the match between Luger and Tatanka was poorly planned and executed , and that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the worst on the card . Also writing for Online Onslaught , Rick <unk> also enjoyed Bret Hart 's matches . He thought that the match between Tatanka and Luger was a " good booking decision " and that the wrestlers performed well in the match . He also enjoyed the endings to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match and the Intercontinental Championship match . The review from The Other Arena also praised Bret Hart 's matches , as well as the Intercontinental Championship match . The other matches were not rated as highly , although only the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was said to be a bad match . 
 The attendance for the event was 6 @,@ 500 fans , who paid a total of $ 80 @,@ 000 in admission . This is the lowest attendance figure for a King of the Ring event . The attendance the following year was almost twice as large , as 12 @,@ 000 fans attended King of the Ring 1994 . The PPV buyrate was 1 @.@ 1 , which was the highest buyrate in King of the Ring history until the 1999 event . 
 The event was released on VHS in North America by Coliseum Video on August 11 , 1993 . It has also been released on VHS in PAL format in the United Kingdom . Packaged together with King of the Ring 1994 , it was released on DVD in the United Kingdom as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line on July 5 , 2004 .

 = 1896 Summer Olympics = 
 The 1896 Summer Olympics ( Modern Greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> 1896 , <unk> <unk> <unk> ̱ nes 1896 ) , officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad , was a multi @-@ sport event held in Athens , Greece , from 6 to 15 April 1896 . It was the first international Olympic Games held in the modern era . Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games , Athens was considered to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games . It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by Pierre de Coubertin , a French pedagogue and historian , in Paris , on 23 June 1894 . The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) was also instituted during this congress . 
 Despite many obstacles and setbacks , the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success . The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date . The Panathenaic Stadium , the only Olympic stadium used in the 1800s , overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event . The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis . The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann , who won four events . 
 After the Games , Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures , including Greece 's King George and some of the American competitors in Athens , to hold all the following Games in Athens . However , the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and , except for the Intercalated Games of 1906 , the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics , 108 years later . 
 = = Reviving the Games = = 
 During the 19th century , several small @-@ scale sports festivals across Europe were named after the Ancient Olympic Games . The 1870 Olympics at the Panathenaic stadium , which had been refurbished for the occasion , had an audience of 30 @,@ 000 people . Coubertin adopted Dr William Penny Brookes ' idea to establish a multi @-@ national and multi @-@ sport event — the ancient games only allowed free male athletes of Greek origin to participate . In 1890 , Coubertin wrote an article in La Revue <unk> , which espoused the importance of Much Wenlock — a rural market town in the English county of Shropshire . It was here that , in October 1850 , the local physician William Penny Brookes had founded the Wenlock Olympian Games , a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports , such as cricket , football and quoits . Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organised under the name of Olympics by businessman and philanthropist Evangelis Zappas in 1859 , 1870 and 1875 . The 1896 Athens Games was funded by the legacies of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas and by George Averoff who had been specifically requested by the Greek government , through crown prince Constantine , to sponsor the second refurbishment of the Panathenaic Stadium . This the Greek government did despite the fact that the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble had already been funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier . 
 With deep feeling towards Baron de Coubertin 's courteous petition , I send him and the members of the Congress , with my sincere thanks , my best wishes for the revival of the Olympic Games . 
 On 18 June 1894 , Coubertin organised a congress at the Sorbonne , Paris , to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries . Following his proposal 's acceptance by the congress , a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen . Coubertin suggested that the Games be held concurrently with the 1900 Universal Exposition of Paris . Concerned that a six @-@ year waiting period might lessen public interest , congress members opted instead to hold the inaugural Games in 1896 . With a date established , members of the congress turned their attention to the selection of a host city . It remains a mystery how Athens was finally chosen to host the inaugural Games . In the following years both Coubertin and Demetrius Vikelas would offer recollections of the selection process that contradicted the official minutes of the congress . Most accounts hold that several congressmen first proposed London as the location , but Coubertin dissented . After a brief discussion with Vikelas , who represented Greece , Coubertin suggested Athens . Vikelas made the Athens proposal official on 23 June , and since Greece had been the original home of the Olympics , the congress unanimously approved the decision . Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . 
 = = Organization = = 
 News that the Olympic Games would return to Greece was well received by the Greek public , media , and royal family . According to Coubertin , " the Crown Prince Constantine learned with great pleasure that the Games will be inaugurated in Athens . " Coubertin went on to confirm that , " the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these games . " Constantine later conferred more than that ; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organising committee . 
 However , the country had financial troubles and was in political turmoil . The job of prime minister alternated between Charilaos Trikoupis and Theodoros Deligiannis frequently during the last years of the 19th century . Because of this financial and political instability , both prime minister Trikoupis and Stephanos <unk> , the president of the Zappas Olympic Committee , which had attempted to organise a series of national Olympiads , believed that Greece could not host the event . In late 1894 , the organising committee under Stephanos <unk> presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by Coubertin . They concluded the Games could not be held , and offered their resignation . The total cost of the Games was 3 @,@ 740 @,@ 000 gold drachmas . 
 With the prospect of reviving the Olympic games very much in doubt , Coubertin and Vikelas commenced a campaign to keep the Olympic movement alive . Their efforts culminated on 7 January 1895 when Vikelas announced that crown prince Constantine would assume the presidency of the organising committee . His first responsibility was to raise the funds necessary to host the Games . He relied on the patriotism of the Greek people to motivate them to provide the required finances . Constantine 's enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public . This grassroots effort raised 330 @,@ 000 drachmas . A special set of postage stamps were commissioned ; the sale of which raised 400 @,@ 000 drachmas . Ticket sales added 200 @,@ 000 drachmas . At the request of Constantine , businessman George Averoff agreed to pay for the restoration of the Panathenaic Stadium . Averoff would donate 920 @,@ 000 drachmas to this project . As a tribute to his generosity , a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium . It stands there to this day . 
 Some of the athletes would take part in the Games because they happened to be in Athens at the time the Games were held , either on holiday or for work ( e.g. , some of the British competitors worked for the British embassy ) . A designated Olympic Village for the athletes did not appear until the 1932 Summer Olympics . Consequently , the athletes had to provide their own lodging . 
 The first regulation voted on by the new IOC in 1894 was to allow only amateur athletes to participate in the Olympic Games . The various contests were thus held under amateur regulations with the exception of fencing matches . The rules and regulations were not uniform , so the Organising Committee had to choose among the codes of the various national athletic associations . The jury , the referees and the game director bore the same names as in antiquity ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . Prince George acted as final referee ; according to Coubertin , " his presence gave weight and authority to the decisions of the ephors . "

 = = Opening ceremony = = 
 On 6 April ( 25 March according to the Julian calendar then in use in Greece ) , the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened ; it was Easter Monday for both the Western and Eastern Christian Churches and the anniversary of Greece 's independence . The Panathenaic Stadium was filled with an estimated 80 @,@ 000 spectators , including King George I of Greece , his wife Olga , and their sons . Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield , grouped by nation . After a speech by the president of the organising committee , Crown Prince Constantine , his father officially opened the Games : 
 " I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens . Long live the Nation . Long live the Greek people . " 
 Afterwards , nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn , composed by Spyridon Samaras , with words by poet Kostis Palamas . Thereafter , a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until 1960 , since which time the Samaras / Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem ( decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958 ) . Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were initiated later : the Olympic flame was first lit in 1928 , the first athletes ' oath was sworn at the 1920 Summer Olympics , and the first officials ' oath was taken at the 1972 Olympic Games . 
 = = Events = = 
 At the 1894 Sorbonne congress , a large roster of sports were suggested for the program in Athens . The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket , but these plans were never finalised , and these sports did not make the final list for the Games . Rowing and yachting were scheduled , but had to be cancelled due to poor weather on the planned day of competition . As a result , the 1896 Summer Olympics programme featured 9 sports encompassing 10 disciplines and 43 events . The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses . 
 = = = Athletics = = = 
 The athletics events had the most international field of any of the sports . The major highlight was the marathon , held for the first time in international competition . Spyridon Louis , a previously unrecognised water carrier , won the event to become the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero . Although Greece had been favoured to win the discus and the shot put , the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American Robert Garrett in both events . 
 No world records were set , as few top international competitors had elected to compete . In addition , the curves of the track were very tight , making fast times in the running events virtually impossible . Despite this , Thomas Burke , of the United States , won the 100 @-@ meter race in 12 @.@ 0 seconds and the 400 @-@ meter race in 54 @.@ 2 seconds . Burke was the only one who used the " crouch start " ( putting his knee on soil ) , confusing the jury . Eventually , he was allowed to start from this " uncomfortable position " . 
 Australian competitor Edwin Flack came to Athens to watch the games , but decided to compete in the athletics events . He won two races — the 800 @-@ meter and the 1500 @-@ meter . 
 Chile claims one athlete , Luis Subercaseaux , competed for the nation at the 1896 Summer Olympics . This makes Chile one of the 14 nations to appear at the inaugural Summer Olympic Games . Subercaseaux 's results are not listed in the Official Report , though that Report typically includes only winners and Subercaseaux won no medals . Recently , a study commissioned to Chilean forensic police ( PDI ) decided ( by studies of facial recognition ) , that Subercaseaux would be the participant in a famous photo of 100 meter 's second series . 
 = = = Cycling = = = 
 The rules of the International Cycling Association were used for the cycling competitions . The track cycling events were held at the newly built Neo <unk> Velodrome . Only one road event was held , a race from Athens to Marathon and back ( 87 kilometres ) . 
 In the track events , the best cyclist was Frenchman Paul Masson , who won the one lap time trial , the sprint event , and the 10 @,@ 000 meters . In the 100 kilometres event , Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot Léon <unk> . <unk> won the event , after a fall , and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent Georgios <unk> to fix a mechanical problem . The Austrian fencer Adolf <unk> won the 12 @-@ hour race , which was completed by only two cyclists , while the road race event was won by <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Fencing = = = 
 The fencing events were held in the <unk> , which , built with money Evangelis Zappas had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games , had never seen any athletic contests before . Unlike other sports ( in which only amateurs were allowed to take part at the Olympics ) , professionals were allowed to compete in fencing , though in a separate event . These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes , just as the amateurs . 
 Four events were scheduled , but the épée event was cancelled for unknown reasons . The foil event was won by a Frenchman , Eugène @-@ Henri <unk> , who beat his countryman , Henri Callot , in the final . The other two events , the sabre and the masters foil , were won by Greek fencers . Leonidas Pyrgos , who won the latter event , became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era . 
 = = = Gymnastics = = = 
 The gymnastics competition was carried out on the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium . Germany had sent an 11 @-@ man team , which won five of the eight events , including both team events . In the team event on the horizontal bar , the German team was unopposed . Three Germans added individual titles : Hermann <unk> won the horizontal bar event , Alfred Flatow won the parallel bars ; and Carl Schuhmann , who also competed successfully in wrestling , won the vault . Louis Zutter , a Swiss gymnast , won the pommel horse , while Greeks Ioannis Mitropoulos and Nikolaos <unk> were victorious in the rings and rope climbing events , respectively . 
 = = = Sailing = = = 
 A regatta of sailing boats was on the program of the Games of the First Olympiad for 31 March 1896 . However this event had to be given up . 
 The Official English report states : 
 The Regatta could not take place because some special boats embarkation had not been provided for . 
 The German version gives a bit more clues : 
 Die <unk> im <unk> <unk> <unk> , da man <unk> bei uns die <unk> Boote <unk> <unk> , noch <unk> <unk> sich <unk> <unk> . 
 So no boats available from Greece and no foreign entries . Thus that ends the first edition of Sailing at the Summer Olympics ! 
 = = = Shooting = = = 
 Held at a range at <unk> , the shooting competition consisted of five events — two using a rifle and three with the pistol . The first event , the military rifle , was won by Pantelis <unk> , the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots . The second event , for military pistols , was dominated by two American brothers : John and Sumner Paine became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event . To avoid embarrassing their hosts , the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event , the free pistol . Sumner Paine won that event , thereby becoming the first relative of an Olympic champion to become Olympic champion himself . 
 The Paine brothers did not compete in the 25 @-@ meter pistol event , as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required calibre . In their absence , Ioannis <unk> won . The final event , the free rifle , began on the same day . However , the event could not be completed due to darkness and was finalised the next morning , when Georgios <unk> was crowned the champion . 
 = = = Swimming = = = 
 The swimming competition was held in the open sea because the organizers had refused to spend the money necessary for a specially constructed stadium . Nearly 20 @,@ 000 spectators lined the Bay of Zea off the Piraeus coast to watch the events . The water in the bay was cold , and the competitors suffered during their races . There were three open events ( men 's 100 @-@ metre freestyle , men 's 500 @-@ metre freestyle , and men 's 1200 metre freestyle ) , in addition to a special event open only to Greek sailors , all of which were held on the same day ( 11 April ) . 
 For Alfréd Hajós of Hungary , this meant he could only compete in two of the events , as they were held too close together , which made it impossible for him to adequately recuperate . Nevertheless , he won the two events in which he swam , the 100 and 1200 meter freestyle . Hajós later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and artistic competitions , when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924 . The 500 @-@ meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer Paul Neumann , who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half . 
 = = = Tennis = = = 
 Although tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century , none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens . The competition was held at the courts of the Athens Lawn Tennis Club , and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events . John Pius Boland , who won the event , had been entered in the competition by a fellow @-@ student of his at Oxford ; the Greek , Konstantinos Manos . As a member of the Athens Lawn Tennis sub @-@ committee , Manos had been trying , with the assistance of Boland , to recruit competitors for the Athens Games from among the sporting circles of Oxford University . In the first round , Boland defeated Friedrich Traun , a promising tennis player from Hamburg , who had been eliminated in the 100 @-@ meter sprint competition . Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event , in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set . 
 = = = Weightlifting = = = 
 The sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896 , and the rules differed from those in use today . Competitions were held outdoors , in the infield of the main stadium , and there were no weight limits . The first event was held in a style now known as the " clean and jerk " . Two competitors stood out : Scotsman Launceston Elliot and Viggo Jensen of Denmark . Both of them lifted the same weight ; but the jury , with Prince George as the chairman , ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style . The British delegation , unfamiliar with this tie @-@ breaking rule , lodged a protest . The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts , but neither lifter improved , and Jensen was declared the champion . 
 Elliot got his revenge in the one hand lift event , which was held immediately after the two @-@ handed one . Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two @-@ handed attempt , and was no match for Elliot , who won the competition easily . The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor , whom they considered very attractive . A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event : a servant was ordered to remove the weights , which appeared to be a difficult task for him . Prince George came to his assistance ; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease , to the delight of the crowd . 
 = = = Wrestling = = = 
 No weight classes existed for the wrestling competition , held in the Panathenaic Stadium , which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes . The rules used were similar to modern Greco @-@ Roman wrestling , although there was no time limit , and not all leg holds were forbidden ( in contrast to current rules ) . 
 Apart from the two Greek contestants , all the competitors had previously been active in other sports . Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion Carl Schuhmann . The latter won and advanced into the final , where he met Georgios <unk> , who had previously defeated Stephanos <unk> . Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes ; it was continued the following day , when Schuhmann needed only fifteen minutes to finish the bout . 
 = = Closing ceremony = = 
 On the morning of Sunday 12 April ( 3 April , according to Julian calendar then used in Greece ) King George the great organised a banquet for officials and athletes ( even though some competitions had not yet been held ) . During his speech , he made clear that , as far as he was concerned , the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently . The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday , after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain . Again the royal family attended the ceremony , which was opened by the national anthem of Greece and an ode composed in ancient Greek by George S. Robertson , a British athlete and scholar . 
 Afterwards , the king awarded prizes to the winners . Unlike today , the first @-@ place winners received silver medals , an olive branch and a diploma . Athletes who placed second received copper medals , a branch of laurel and a diploma . Third place winners did not receive a medal . Some winners also received additional prizes , such as Spyridon Louis , who received a cup from Michel Bréal , a friend of Coubertin , who had conceived the marathon event . Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honour around the stadium , while the Olympic Hymn was played again . The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end , and left the Stadium , while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered . 
 Like the Greek king , many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens ; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish . Coubertin , however , was heavily opposed to this idea , as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics . According to his wish , the next Games were held in Paris , although they would be somewhat overshadowed by the concurrently held Universal Exposition . 
 = = Participating nations = = 
 The concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until the Intercalated Games 10 years later , though many sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts . There are significant conflicts with regard to which nations competed . The International Olympic Committee gives a figure of 14 , but does not list them . The following 14 are most likely the ones recognised by the IOC . Some sources list 12 , excluding Chile and Bulgaria ; others list 13 , including those two but excluding Italy . Egypt is also sometimes included because of Dionysios <unk> ' participation . Belgium and Russia had entered the names of competitors , but withdrew . 
 = = Medal count = = 
 Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals , in addition to three medals won by mixed teams , i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations . The United States won the most gold medals * ( 11 ) , while host nation Greece won the most medals overall ( 46 ) as well as the most silver * ( 17 ) and bronze * ( 19 ) medals , finishing with one fewer gold medal than the United States . 
 During these inaugural Olympics , winners were given a silver medal , an olive branch , and a diploma , while runners @-@ up received a copper medal , laurel branch , and diploma . The IOC has retroactively assigned gold , silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions . 
 * As stated in the previous paragraph , it should be noted that the use of ' Gold medals ' did not occur until the 1904 St. Louis , Missouri Olympic Games to represent a First place finish . The ' Silver medal ' did not represent Second place until the 1904 Games . In 1896 , Silver was given to the winner . ' Bronze medals ' were not given for Third place initially . In 1896 , they were given to the Second place ( " runner @-@ up " ) finisher . In 1904 , they were first given as Third place medals ( " second runner @-@ up " ) .

 Women were not allowed to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics , because de Coubertin felt that their inclusion would be " impractical , uninteresting , <unk> and incorrect " . However , one woman , Stamata Revithi , ran the marathon course on 11 April , the day after the men had run the official race . Although she was not allowed to enter the stadium at the end of her race , Revithi finished the marathon in about five hours and 30 minutes , and found witnesses to sign their names and verify the starting and finishing times . Revithi intended to present this documentation to the Hellenic Olympic Committee , hoping that they would recognise her achievement . Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration . 
 = White Tulip = 
 " White Tulip " is the 18th episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . It follows a scientist ( Peter Weller ) in his quest to time travel back and save his fiancée , while the Fringe team investigates the consequences of his actions , and Walter ( John Noble ) struggles to tell his son Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) he was stolen from the parallel universe as a boy . 
 The episode was co @-@ written by J.H. Wyman and Jeff Vlaming , and was directed by Thomas Yatsko . Wyman later stressed the importance of " White Tulip " in the show 's evolution , calling it a " mythalone " because its elements were designed to create the ideal episode to satisfy both new and hardcore viewers . Elements from this episode , in particular the idea of the white tulip as a sign of forgiveness , would be reused in later episodes . 
 It first aired in the United States on April 15 , 2010 on Fox to an estimated 6 @.@ 624 million viewers . It received positive reviews , and earned a nomination for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards . It was ranked the best episode of the entire series by Entertainment Weekly , while IGN and Den of Geek ranked it as the second best . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Walter ( John Noble ) struggles with writing a letter to Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) to explain the events from 1985 that led Walter to bring Peter to his universe from the parallel one . As he contemplates the final letter , he and the rest of the Fringe team are called to investigate several dead bodies in a passenger car of a train . Walter , after being told the victims ' personal electronics were drained of power , suspects someone drew energy from both the people and their devices ' batteries . They trace the man responsible to MIT astrophysics professor Alistair Peck ( Peter Weller ) , and enter his residence to search for clues , finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel . Alistair arrives while the Fringe team is there , and activates a mechanism on his body , causing him to travel back in time . 
 Alistair reappears on the train at the same point in time as his previous travel , again having drained the people aboard it , and alters his behavior to avoid another encounter with the Fringe team . However , when they are brought to investigate this time , they have a feeling of déjà vu and find other evidence that points to Alistair , and determine that he is trying to go back in his personal time line several months ago to prevent the death of his fiancée in a car collision . Alistair is found at his MIT office . Walter , having read through Alistair 's writings on time travel , offers to go in and talk to Alistair first before the armed officers attempt to seize him . 
 Walter approaches Alistair as a fellow man of science , who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body . Walter professes that Alistair 's attempt to jump back several months would require a great deal more power than Alistair has predicted , possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears . Alistair , aware of this , recalls an empty field where he was at , a few blocks from where his fiancée died , and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival . Walter continues to try to discourage Alistair from making the attempt by explaining his own case of coming to believe in a higher power , hoping for a sign of forgiveness in the form of a white tulip for his actions in stealing Peter from the parallel universe . With God 's forgiveness , Walter believes it will be possible for Peter to forgive him once he learns the truth of who he is . 
 Alistair considers this , but with Walter 's time up , a SWAT team starts to move in . Alistair jumps back in time again by only a few hours to complete the modified power calculations based on Walter 's comments , and to prepare a pre @-@ addressed letter he brings with him . As the SWAT team barges in , Alistair re @-@ engages his time machine . Alistair 's modifications have worked , as he finds himself in the field , minutes before his fiancée 's death . Alistair is able to make it to his fiancée in time , reuniting just long enough to say " I love you " before they are both killed by the collision . 
 In the present , the events of the episode never occurred , and Walter , having time to contemplate the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case , tosses it into the fireplace . Later , he receives an envelope in the mail — the one Alistair had prepared and instructed to be delivered to Walter on this specific date . Inside , Walter finds a drawing of a white tulip .

 IGN announced in January 2010 that actor Peter Weller had been cast in a guest starring role for an upcoming episode . Though he had normally kept his distance from episodic television because it " burns [ him ] out " and he was pursuing a Ph.D at UCLA , his wife , a big Fringe fan , read the script and convinced him to accept the part of Alistair Peck , telling him " You 've got to do this , it 's beautiful , it 's about a guy who wants to save his wife " . During a conference call with journalists , Weller also cited the character 's " tremendously romantic and very moving " storyline as another reason he accepted the part . He thought the four @-@ page scripted scene between him and John Noble was " rare for television [ and ] wonderfully written . I was thrilled to do [ Fringe ] " . Weller has since become a fan of Fringe because of his work in the episode , and would love to return and direct for the show . In a later Twitter post , Wyman dismissed speculation and confirmed that Weller 's character Alistair Peck did indeed die at the end of the episode . 
 For the episode 's time travel elements , sound effects editor Bruce Tanis explained his choices of sound during an interview with Designing Sound : " I used vocals from the dialog to create high @-@ pitched jittery tones that played against the visual of his time @-@ jumping . He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping so I wanted to play up the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create the idea that he was somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time . It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device " . 
 Executive producer J. H. Wyman later indicated how " White Tulip " helped with the evolution of the show in an interview : " It 's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating ... Our solution came in the form of ‘ White Tulip ' and episodes like that , because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a ' mythalone . ' It sounds really simple when you say it now , like , ‘ Yes , sure , you have a great standalone case , plus you thread in some great mythology . ' But I 've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it . Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties " . He and Pinkner later listed " White Tulip " as one of their favorite episodes . 
 As with other Fringe episodes , Fox and Science Olympiad released a lesson plan for grade school children based upon the science depicted in " White Tulip " ; the lesson 's intention was for " students [ to ] learn about scientific concepts related to time such as astronomy and physics , with a focus on timekeeping .

 Reviews of " White Tulip " were overwhelmingly positive . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the episode , writing " Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases " . He also praised guest star Peter Weller 's performance . After initially expecting a " filler " episode , Ramsey Isler of IGN said he was " pleasantly proven wrong " , as the " story turned out to be one of the best of the series " . Isler continued that " the writers really did a good job of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually damn good ... It 's brilliant storytelling " . Andrew Hanson of Los Angeles Times enjoyed the episode , but wished Astrid got more screen time . 
 Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A , explaining " Horror . Confusion . It 's a moment that finds Fringe at its finest " . New York Magazine 's Tim Grierson loved all the interactions between Noble and Weller , and thought they were so " compelling together that they helped justify an episode that could have very easily been terribly hokey — instead , it was one of the season ’ s best standalone stories " . Josh Wigler from MTV also thought the scenes between Noble and Weller were the best thing about the episode . Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wrote it was " another great episode that served to propel the story forward , and another great performance by John Noble " . Television Without Pity gave the episode a B + . 
 The A.V. Club ranked Fringe the 15th best show of 2010 , in particular highlighting " White Tulip " , while Den of Geek listed it as the second best of the series . Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named " White Tulip " the best episode of the entire series , calling it " a near @-@ perfect blend of mythology and stand @-@ alone episode . ' White Tulip ' is Fringe 's purest , finest example of fulsome emotions tempered by stringent ideas . The tulip of the title represents forgiveness — faith in love — and became within the series a semi @-@ recurring symbol of fragile hope , and , to the show 's audience , a cynosure of the devotion of Fringe fandom . " IGN ranked it as the second best , explaining that " despite a few technical flaws with special effects and a little under @-@ utilization of Weller in the first half , the veteran cast delivers an excellent script with skill . " 
 " White Tulip " was referenced multiple times in the season three episode " Subject 13 " . Executive producer J. H. Wyman later commented in an interview that " the ' White Tulip ' stuff is all connected thematically because that was the episode where Walter believes in God , " and further explained that these themes would return again in the season three finale . The final reference to the white tulip is in season five , the series finale , which aired January 18 , 2013 .

 = U.S. Route 16 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 16 ( US 16 ) , also called Grand River Avenue for much of its length in the state , was one of the principal pre @-@ Interstate roads in the state of Michigan . Before the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926 , the highway had been designated M @-@ 16 . The modern route of Grand River Avenue cuts across the Lower Peninsula in a northwest – southeast fashion from near Grand Rapids to Detroit . Before the late 1950s and early 1960s , US 16 followed other roads between Muskegon and Grand Rapids , and then Grand River Avenue through Lansing to Detroit . In the years immediately preceding the creation of the Interstate Highway System , US 16 was shifted from older roads to newer freeways . Later , it was co @-@ designated as an Interstate . When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing , the US 16 designation was decommissioned in the state . The freeway was then solely designated Interstate 96 ( I @-@ 96 ) east of Grand Rapids and I @-@ 196 west of that city . 
 The original pathway along the Grand River Avenue corridor was an Indian trail , a footpath used by the native population . This trail was later used by the first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan . In Detroit , Grand River is one of five major avenues ( along with Woodward , Michigan , Gratiot , and Jefferson ) planned by Judge Augustus Woodward in 1805 that extended from Downtown Detroit in differing directions ; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city 's downtown . In the middle of the 19th century , the trail was expanded into a plank road that formed the basis for one of the first state trunkline highways as M @-@ 16 in the early 20th century . Later , the highway was rerouted to replace M @-@ 126 and create M @-@ 104 . Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of M @-@ 5 , M @-@ 11 , M @-@ 43 or business loops off I @-@ 96 . The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I @-@ 96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline , sometimes referred to as Old Business Spur I @-@ 96 ( Old BS I @-@ 96 ) .

 At the time of its decommissioning , US 16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon . The SS Milwaukee Clipper operated as a car ferry across Lake Michigan , connecting Muskegon to Milwaukee , Wisconsin , where US 16 continued to the west . From the docks , US 16 and M @-@ 46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon . At Peck Street , US 16 turned south along Business US 31 ( Bus . US 31 ) . These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores . There , the business loop ended at US 31 , and US 16 joined the I @-@ 196 freeway headed east . ( Later , the I @-@ 96 and I @-@ 196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped , but at the time leading up to US 16 's decommissioning in the state of Michigan , this had not yet been approved . ) The I @-@ 196 / US 16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US 16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County . The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M @-@ 104 , and continued through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne . 
 As the freeway approached Kent County , it met the western terminus of M @-@ 11 which was the former routing of US 16 through the Grand Rapids metropolitan area . I @-@ 196 / US 16 continued eastward around the north side of the metropolitan area through the suburbs of Walker and Comstock Park . The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of US 131 along the East Beltline and curved south through the eastern edge of Grand Rapids to meet the end of I @-@ 96 east of downtown . There I @-@ 196 ended and US 16 was transferred to the I @-@ 96 freeway . I @-@ 96 / US 16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road , which was previously US 16 . Cascade Road east of this interchange meets the westernmost part of Grand River Avenue , which carried US 16 east continuously to Downtown Detroit . 
 M @-@ 50 also joined the freeway at Cascade Road headed east , and together I @-@ 96 / US 16 / M @-@ 50 continued through eastern Kent County . M @-@ 50 departed to the south near Lowell , and the freeway crossed into southern Ionia County . Passing south of Portland , the freeway crossed east into Clinton County . North of Grand Ledge , I @-@ 96 ended and US 16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue . From there east , US 16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing . Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the Capital City Airport and east to Larch Street , where US 16 turned south along US 27 north of downtown Lansing . At Saginaw Street , eastbound US 16 turned east on the one @-@ way street , while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue . The two directions of travel merge at the east end of Saginaw Street in East Lansing . Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree @-@ lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of Michigan State University to the south and the rest of the city to the north . US 16 continued east in Ingham County through Okemos and rural parts of the county through Williamston and Webberville . 
 Grand River Avenue crosses to the east into Livingston County through Fowlerville to Howell . In Howell , Grand River Avenue meets Hartland Road which carries M @-@ 59 ; the highway also met M @-@ 155 in downtown , which at the time provided access to the Howell State Hospital . In the approach to Brighton , Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country . In Brighton , Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I @-@ 96 freeway . US 16 merged onto the freeway , and I @-@ 96 / US 16 met the northern end of the US 23 freeway . I @-@ 96 / US 16 continued east into Oakland County through Wixom and Novi . 
 Near Farmington , I @-@ 96 / US 16 continued to the southeast of the present @-@ day I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 / I @-@ 696 / M @-@ 5 interchange along the current M @-@ 5 freeway . Grand River Avenue through there was Business Loop I @-@ 96 ( BL I @-@ 96 ) . The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also marked the end of the business loop and the eastern end of I @-@ 96 at the time . From there , US 16 continued along Grand River Avenue the rest of way into Downtown Detroit . Along that routing , it intersected US 24 at Telegraph Road and M @-@ 39 at Southfield Road . US 12 joined US 16 along Grand River Avenue at Plymouth Road . The two ran the rest of the way concurrently to Cadillac Square . There they terminated at a common point with US 10 ( Woodward Avenue ) and US 112 ( Michigan Avenue ) . US 25 ran through the square on Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue .

 The history of Grand River Avenue , and US 16 in Michigan , dates back to before the earliest settlement of Michigan by Europeans . The route has been the basis for an Indian trail , a pathway for European settlers , a state highway , a part of the US Highway System , and a section of the Interstate Highway System . 
 = = = Indian trail to state highway = = = 
 The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian footpaths that crossed the future state of Michigan ; the Grand River Trail was one of these thirteen trails at the time . In 1805 , Detroit created 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) rights @-@ of @-@ way for the principal streets of the city , Grand River Avenue included . This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit . A ten @-@ year project to construct a plank road between Detroit and Howell was authorized in 1820 along the Grand River Trail . Grand River Avenue was included as one of Five Great Military Roads by Governor Lewis Cass in 1825 , along with the River Road , Michigan Avenue , Woodward Avenue and Gratiot Avenue . The Grand River Road , precursor to the modern Grand River Avenue was named by Benjamin Williams , cofounder of Owosso . The original Native American name for the river was Wash @-@ ten @-@ <unk> sibi meaning " the river that extends far off " , or " far into the interior " , which was translated as La Grande Riviere , the French name for the river ; this name was then applied to the name of the trail that paralleled at least half of the river 's length . 
 The opening of the Erie Canal in New York in 1826 brought new settlers to the Great Lakes region , and to the future state of Michigan . Many of these settlers began their inland journeys in Detroit . At first the Grand River Road was a " deep rutted , ditch bordered road " . The road branched into two at Rouge ( now Redford ) ; the southern branch roughly followed the modern route of Grand River Avenue and the northern route ran by way of Pontiac along Woodward Avenue and the modern M @-@ 21 to the north of the Lansing area . From Bancroft , several trails branched off , including the northern branch of the Grand River Road and the Saginaw Trail . The two branches merged back together near Dewitt and continued west toward Ionia and on to Grand Rapids and Newton ( now Grand Haven ) . The early travelers plied the road in wagons pulled by oxen or horses , and drivers charged between four and seven cents a mile ( equivalent to $ 0 @.@ 84 – 1 @.@ 46 / mi in 2015 ) . The horses were exchanged every 12 – 15 miles ( 19 – 24 km ) with the speed averaging around 8 – 10 miles per hour ( 13 – 16 km / h ) with few obstacles . 
 Congress further aided the road in 1835 with an appropriation of $ 25 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 15 @.@ 5 million in 2015 ) for a 20 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 6 m ) road on 100 feet ( 30 m ) of right @-@ of @-@ way . These improvements included removing brush and debris and the construction of bridges across the Rouge , Shiawassee , Red Cedar and Grand rivers . The Grand River Road was a major route for settlers headed inland to Grand Rapids in 1836 , as the shortest route for travelers coming from Detroit . An economic panic in 1837 drove settlers from New York to Michigan ; these were the travelers who followed the Grand River Road . New settlements were created along the route , every six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) or so , that distance being a good day 's travel by horse . Approximately 120 wagons left Detroit each day between August and November 1843 . 
 After statehood in 1837 , Michigan assumed the costs for construction work to the Grand River Trail . At that time , about 60 miles ( 97 km ) had been surveyed from Detroit westward . The new state lacked the money to continue improvements to the road , and Michigan petitioned Congress for the better part of the next decade for money to complete the work . When the state capital was moved to Lansing in 1847 , an improved road was needed to the capital city . The first segments of roadway were privatized starting in 1844 . In 1850 , the Michigan State Legislature established the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company , which set about converting various Indian trails into the Lansing – Howell Plank Road , a task the company completed by 1853 . At Howell the road connected with the Detroit – Howell Plank Road , establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to Michigan 's largest metropolis . The Lansing – Detroit Plank Road was a toll road until the 1880s , and it eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern Grand River Avenue . 
 By 1900 , only a short stretch of the Detroit – Howell Plank Road was still made of planks ; most of the other plank roads had been converted to gravel by this time . On May 13 , 1913 , the Michigan Legislature passed the State Reward Trunk Line Highway Act ( Public Act 334 of 1913 ) that created the original state highway system . In that act , Grand River Avenue between Detroit and Grand Rapids was included as Division 9 of the system . The state highways were signposted starting in 1919 , and on the first maps published on July 1 of that year , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) had applied the M @-@ 16 number to Grand River Avenue across the state between Grand Haven and Detroit . M @-@ 16 was rerouted in the Lansing area in 1925 , running along Grand River Avenue from Grand Ledge to East Lansing . The former routing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue became part of M @-@ 39 and the section north of Grand Ledge was eventually redesignated M @-@ 100 . A second realignment moved M @-@ 16 to follow Grand River Avenue from Ionia through Ada . The former alignment became a part of M @-@ 21 . On August 7 , 1926 , the state completed paving on M @-@ 16 , opening it to traffic as " the first paved highway across the state " . 
 The M @-@ 16 designation lasted for seven years . As the states were meeting with the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO , now AASHTO ) to plan the United States Numbered Highway System , the route of M @-@ 16 was originally planned for inclusion in US 18 . When the system was created on November 11 , 1926 , Grand River Avenue and M @-@ 16 became part of US 16 .

 In 1929 , Allan Williams placed a picnic table on the side of the road along US 16 south of Saranac . Williams was the Ionia County engineer in charge of the various roads in the county , and that location is " what many consider to be the nation 's first roadside table " . The first change to the US 16 routing was made in 1933 when the highway was moved to bypass Farmington , with the old routing retained as a state highway . The next year , in 1934 , M @-@ 126 was created between Nunica and Muskegon . In 1940 , US 16 was rerouted to replace M @-@ 126 , and the former route of US 16 between Nunica and Grand Haven was redesignated M @-@ 104 . Two further changes during 1941 – 42 rerouted the western end in Muskegon to end at the car ferry docks . Previously , motorists had to navigate from the western end along other roads to the ferry connection to the rest of US 16 in Wisconsin . The second change routed Bypass US 16 ( Byp . US 16 ) along 28th Street and Wilson ( previously the South Beltline and West Beltline sections of M @-@ 114 ) in the Grand Rapids area . The US 16 designation was moved in 1953 to replace Byp . US 16 while the former routing through downtown Grand Rapids was redesignated Business US 16 ( Bus . US 16 ) . 
 MSHD had plans to upgrade the US 16 corridor to freeway standards in the middle of the 20th century . The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor . The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955 , showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955 . This also included a highway in the US 16 corridor . The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced the Grand Rapids – Detroit section of US 16 with a portion of Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) , with the remainder to be I @-@ 94N . MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I @-@ 96 following the US 16 corridor . When initially approved , the Muskegon – Grand Rapids segment of US 16 was to be numbered as I @-@ 196 while the remainder was part of I @-@ 96 . 
 Segments of the road were upgraded in 1956 between Coopersville and Marne , Portland and Eagle , and Brighton and Farmington . By 1962 , freeway construction allowed motorists to travel between Muskegon and the Lansing area on a freeway , bypassing the old Grand River Avenue route . The final connection between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962 . At that time , the US 16 designation , which had been applied alongside the I @-@ 96 and I @-@ 196 designations , was decommissioned . Segments of the old highway were retained in the state highway system under different numbers . Sections through Portland , Lansing , Howell , Farmington and Detroit were given Business Loop ( BL ) or Business Spur ( BS ) I @-@ 96 designations . The section between Lansing and Webberville became part of an extended M @-@ 43 . Other sections in the Detroit area became parts of M @-@ 102 , M @-@ 5 , or unsigned state highway .

 After US 16 was transferred to the new freeway , Grand River Avenue lost its state highway status along most of its length . Today the roadway remains the " Main Street " of over a dozen Michigan cities and a scenic route through one of the state 's most populated corridors . In 1995 , major reconstruction work along Grand River Avenue in East Lansing uncovered rotting logs , buried about 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) below the present grade , that had been used as <unk> for the plank road surface in a low , swampy area . The logs had been in place for nearly 150 years . In 2004 , the state transferred several blocks at the eastern end of Grand River Avenue to the City of Detroit . State trunkline control now ends at the corner of Grand River Avenue , Middle Street , and Cass Avenue . 
 Community leaders in Lansing have proposed renaming a section of Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing for César Chávez , the Mexican @-@ American civil rights activist . The group " Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez " was raising funds to rename the section between Oakland and Pine streets in Old Town . Previously , a section of Grand Avenue was renamed for Chávez in 1994 , but the voters overturned the decision . The renaming proposal was even mentioned as a way to untangle a maze of different branches of Grand River Avenue running through Old Town . Currently , East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue bridge between sections of Grand River Avenue , in addition to Grand Avenue which runs along the Grand River near downtown . While Lansing 's Latino community supported the proposal , the business community opposed it . One shop owner said she would have $ 10 @,@ 000 in costs associated with a name change , adding , " I think there 's many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man . Changing five blocks of a street doesn 't seem to do justice . " Another business owner cited the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to market the area using the Grand River Avenue name , marketing that would be useless after a name change . The compromise solution reached in August 2010 was to rename lot 56 , where Old Town holds festivals , to Cesar Chavez Plaza . Street signs would be installed marking parts of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue , but only in a memorial capacity ; the street would still be officially named Grand River Avenue .

 Born in Grand Rapids in 1884 , Arthur H. Vandenberg was appointed to the United States Senate upon the death in office of Woodbridge N. Ferris in 1928 . Vandenberg , a Republican , served as a member of the " isolationist bloc " , and was an active opponent of the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The senator declined a nomination for Vice President in 1936 . In the aftermath of World War II , Vandenberg 's world view changed significantly . He helped to draft the United Nations Charter and worked to secure is unanimous ratification in the Senate . He also worked to secure passage of the Marshall Plan and helped to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . After his death in 1951 , Michigan residents wanted to memorialize Vandenberg . The following year , the Michigan Legislature dedicated the length of US 16 from Muskegon to Detroit as the Arthur Vandenberg Memorial Highway by enacting Public Act 70 of 1952 . 
 Vandenberg was not the only national figure honored with a memorial designation along the route of US 16 in Michigan . For a period from the 1930s through the 1950s , the highway used a few blocks of Washington Boulevard to connect between Grand River and Michigan avenues on its route through Detroit to its terminus at Cadillac Square . This street was named in honor of George Washington for his service as the " father of his country " . The street was named by Judge Woodward as a part of his general street plan for the city of Detroit in 1807 .

 Bypass US Highway 16 ( Byp . US 16 ) was a bypass route of US 16 in the Grand Rapids area . The highway became a part of the state highway system c . 1930 as a part of M @-@ 114 , which was a beltline around the Grand Rapids area . By 1942 , the trunkline was completed and reassigned a Byp . US 16 designation along the southern and western legs . The designation connected to US 16 in Walker Township ( now the city of Walker ) and ran south along what is now Wilson Avenue over the Grand River into Grandville . From there it turned easterly along what is now 28th Street through Wyoming and Paris townships ( now the cities of Wyoming and Kentwood ) before terminating at US 16 in Cascade Township . The designation was used until the mainline US 16 was rerouted over the bypass in 1953 .

That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township . From there , the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown . In downtown Grand Rapids , Bus . US 16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East Grand Rapids . There the loop followed Cascade Road into Cascade Township where it reconnected to US 16 at the intersection with 28th Street . Bus .

 Business US Highway 16 ( Bus . US 16 ) was a business loop through downtown Farmington along Grand River Avenue . Its western terminus was at the junction of US 16 and Grand River Avenue west of the city , and the eastern terminus was at the intersection between US 16 and Grand River Avenue southeast of Farmington . This highway was the original route of US 16 though downtown Farmington . In 1933 , US 16 was routed onto a bypass route which had been constructed south of the city ( the present @-@ day Freedom Road ) and the route through Farmington was retained as state trunkline . In 1956 , a new bypass freeway was built just to the south of the old bypass as part of the " Brighton – Farmington Expressway " and the route through downtown was designated Bus . US 16 . The original plans for I @-@ 96 called for it to replace US 16 and to run parallel to Grand River Avenue all the way from Farmington into downtown Detroit . In 1959 , the Farmington bypass freeway was given the I @-@ 96 designation in addition to the US 16 moniker , and the business route was redesignated as Business Loop I @-@ 96 two years later .

 Wigan / <unk> / is a town in Greater Manchester , England . It stands on the River Douglas , 7 @.@ 9 miles ( 13 km ) south @-@ west of Bolton , 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Warrington and 16 miles ( 25 @.@ 7 km ) west @-@ northwest of Manchester . Wigan is the largest settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan and is its administrative centre . The town of Wigan had a total population of 97 @,@ 000 in 2011 , whilst the wider borough has a population of 318 @,@ 100 . Historically in Lancashire , Wigan during classical antiquity was in the territory of the Brigantes , an ancient Celtic tribe that ruled much of what is now northern England . The Brigantes were subjugated in the Roman conquest of Britain during the 1st century , and it is asserted that the Roman settlement of Coccium was established where Wigan lies . Wigan is believed to have been incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III of England . At the end of the Middle Ages it was one of four boroughs in Lancashire possessing Royal charters ; the others were Lancaster , Liverpool , and Preston . 
 During the Industrial Revolution Wigan experienced dramatic economic expansion and a rapid rise in the population . Although porcelain manufacture and clock making had been major industries in the town , Wigan subsequently became known as a major mill town and coal mining district . The first coal mine was established at Wigan in 1450 and at its peak there were 1 @,@ 000 pit shafts within 5 miles ( 8 km ) of the town centre . Mining was so extensive that one town councillor remarked that " a coal mine in the backyard was not uncommon in Wigan " . Coal mining ceased during the latter part of the 20th century . 
 Wigan Pier , a wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal , was made famous by the writer George Orwell . In his book , The Road to Wigan Pier , Orwell highlighted the poor working and living conditions of the local inhabitants during the 1930s . Following the decline of industrial activities in the region , Wigan Pier 's collection of warehouses and wharfs became a local heritage centre and cultural quarter . The DW Stadium is home to both Wigan Athletic Football Club and Wigan Warriors Rugby League Football Club , both teams being highly successful in their sports with the former being the 2013 FA Cup winners and the latter being the most successful Rugby League side of all time . Wigan had a population of 99 @,@ 391 in 2011 but its Urban Subdivision had a population of 103 @,@ 608 . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Wigan has been dated to at least the 7th century and probably originally meant a " village " or " settlement " . It has also been suggested that the name is Celtic , named after a person called Wigan . This may have been linked with <unk> , meaning homestead ) to give an original name of <unk> . The name of the town has been recorded variously as Wigan in 1199 , <unk> in 1240 , and <unk> in numerous historical documents . 
 There is very little evidence of prehistoric activity in the area , especially pre @-@ Iron Age ; however , Celtic names in the area around Wigan – such as Bryn , Makerfield , and Ince – indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age . The first people believed to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes , a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain . 
 In the 1st century , the area was conquered by the Romans . The late 2nd @-@ century Antonine Itinerary mentions a Roman settlement called Coccium 17 miles ( 27 km ) from the Roman fort at Manchester ( Mamucium ) and 20 miles ( 32 km ) from the fort at Ribchester ( Bremetennacum ) . Although the distances are slightly out , it has been assumed that Coccium is Roman Wigan . Possible derivations of Coccium include from the Latin <unk> , meaning " scarlet in colour , scarlet cloth " , or from <unk> , meaning " cook " . Over the years chance finds ( coins and pottery ) provided clear indications that a Roman settlement existed at Wigan , although its size and status remained unknown . In 2005 investigations ahead of the Grand Arcade development , and in 2008 at the Joint Service Centre development , have proved that , without doubt , Wigan was a significant Roman site in the late first and second centuries AD . The excavated remains of ditches at Ship Yard off Millgate were consistent with use by the Roman military and possibly formed part of the defences for a fort or a temporary camp . More remarkable remains were excavated to the south , in the area of McEwen ’ s Yard ( opposite the baths ) , where the foundations of a large and very important building were discovered , together with many other Roman features . It was demonstrated to be 36 metres long by 18 metres wide and had been constructed in stone with a tiled roof . It contained nine or ten rooms , including three with <unk> . It had a colonnaded portico on the northern side , which presumably formed the main entrance . The structure 's ground @-@ plan and the presence of the hypocaust , leaves little doubt that this was a bath @-@ house . A timber building excavated at the Joint Service Centre ( top of the <unk> ) has been interpreted as a barrack block . This suggests a Roman fort occupied the crest of the hill , taking advantage of the strategic position overlooking the River Douglas . It is clear from the evidence gained from these excavations that Wigan was an important Roman settlement , and was almost certainly the place referred to as Coccium in the Antonine Itinerary . 
 In the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , the area was probably under the control of the Northumbrians and later the Mercians . In the early 10th century there was an influx of Scandinavians expelled from Ireland . This can be seen in place names such as Scholes – now a part of Wigan – which derives from the Scandinavian <unk> meaning " hut " . Further evidence comes from some street names in Wigan which have Scandinavian origins . 
 Although Wigan is not mentioned in the Domesday Book , possibly because it was included in the Neweton barony ( now Newton @-@ le @-@ Willows ) , it is thought that the mention of a church in the manor of Neweton is Wigan Parish Church . The rectors of the parish church were lords of the manor of Wigan , a sub @-@ manor of Neweton , until the 19th century . Wigan was incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III to John Maunsell , the local church rector and lord of the manor . The borough was later granted another charter in 1257 – 1258 , allowing the lord of the manor to hold a market on every Monday and two annual fairs . The town is recorded on the earliest surviving map of Britain , the Gough Map made around 1360 which highlights its position on the main western north @-@ south highway with distance markers to Preston and Warrington . 
 Edward II visited Wigan in 1323 in an effort to stabilise the region which had been the source of the Banastre Rebellion in 1315 . Edward stayed in nearby <unk> Priory and held court in the town over a period of several days . During the medieval period Wigan expanded and prospered and in 1536 , antiquarian John Leland described the town , saying " Wigan paved ; as big as Warrington and better builded . There is one parish church amid the town . Some merchants , some artificers , some farmers " . 
 In the English Civil War , most people in the town were Royalists and James Stanley , 7th Earl of Derby , a prominent and influential Royalist in the civil war , made Wigan his headquarters . His forces successfully captured Preston but failed in assaults on Manchester and Lancaster and two attempts to capture Bolton . Abandoning attempts to secure Lancashire , he took his forces to the Isle of Man to secure his holdings there . The Earl of Derby was absent when Wigan fell , despite fortifications built around the town , Wigan was captured by Parliamentarian forces on 1 April 1643 , the takeover was complete in two hours and the town was pillaged before the defences were broken down and the Parliamentarians retreated . In 1648 , Royalist forces under James Hamilton , 1st Duke of Hamilton , occupied Wigan after they had been defeated by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Preston . The soldiers looted the town as they retreated to Warrington , and afterwards it experienced pestilence . Cromwell himself described Wigan as " a great and poor town , and very malignant " . 
 The Battle of Wigan Lane was fought on 25 August 1651 during the Third English Civil War , between 1 @,@ 500 Royalists under the command of the James Stanley , Earl of Derby marching to join the King at Worcester and 3 @,@ 000 of the New Model Army under the command of Colonel Robert Lilburne hunting them . Lilburne arrived at Wigan to find the Royalists leaving to march towards Manchester but with his force consisting mostly of cavalry recognised it would be dangerous to engage in the narrow lanes around the town and decided to wait for his foot soldiers to arrive and flank the town . The Royalists seeing an opportunity to engage the divided force turned around to engage but Lilburne decided to hold his ground deploying cavalry on Wigan Lane and infantry in the hedgerows to the sides , The Royalists made several charges but after two hours were unable to break the Parliamentarian line and were forced to flee after being overwhelmed by superior numbers . Although Stanley was injured he managed to find refuge in the town . David <unk> states , " those who did not fall in the fighting [ were ] hunted to their death through the countryside " . A monument on Wigan Lane marks the place where Sir Thomas Tyldesley a Major General commanding the Royalist troops fell , it was erected 28 years after the battle in 1679 by Alexander Rigby , Tyldesley 's standard bearer . 
 Wigan was described by Celia Fiennes , a traveller , in 1698 as " a pretty market town built of stone and brick " . In 1720 , the moot hall was rebuilt , funded by the members of the borough . It was used as the town hall and the earliest reference to it dates from the 15th century . Prior to its final destruction in 1869 , the hall was rebuilt in 1829 . Wigan 's status as a centre for coal production , engineering and textiles in the 18th century led to the Douglas Navigation in the 1740s , the canalisation of part of the River Douglas and later the Leeds and Liverpool Canal . The canal from Liverpool to Leeds was originally to serve Wigan on a spur , transporting cloth and food grown on the West Lancashire Plain to the Port of Liverpool . When construction restarted in the 1790s after a decades pause with coal rising in importance during the intervening years due to the progress of the Industrial Revolution the route was altered at the request of mill owners with the spur becoming the primary route and Wigan a hub for transport of coal from the Lancashire coal pits to Liverpool and Leeds . As a mill town , Wigan was an important centre of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , but it was not until the 1800s that cotton factories began to spread into the town . This was due to a dearth of fast @-@ flowing streams and rivers in the area , but by 1818 there were eight cotton mills in the Wallgate part of Wigan . In 1818 William Woods introduced the first power looms to the Wigan cotton mills . These mills swiftly became infamous for their dangerous and unbearable conditions , low pay and use of child labour . As well as being a mill town , Wigan was also an important centre for coal production . It was recorded that in 1854 there were 54 collieries in and around the town , about a sixth of all collieries in Lancashire . 
 In the 1830s Wigan became one of the first towns in Britain to be served by a railway ; the line had connections to Preston and the Manchester and Liverpool Railway . Wigan began to dominate as a cotton town in the late 19th century , and this lasted until the mid @-@ 20th century . In 1911 the town was described as an " industrial town ... occupying the greater part of the township , whilst its collieries , factories ... fill the atmosphere with smoke " . After the Second World War there was a boom followed by a slump from which Wigan 's textile industry did not recover . While the town 's cotton and coal industries declined in the 20th century , the engineering industry did not go into recession . The last working cotton mill , May Mill , closed in 1980 . 
 In 1937 , Wigan was prominently featured in George Orwell 's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt , in large part , with the living conditions of England 's working poor . Some have embraced the Orwellian link , as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years . Others regard this connection as disappointing , considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better now than it was at the time of Orwell 's writing . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Since 2004 , the town of Wigan has been divided between five of the twenty @-@ five wards of the metropolitan borough , each returning 3 councillors to the 75 @-@ member borough council . The five wards are : Douglas , Pemberton , Wigan Central , Wigan West and Worsley Mesnes . The metropolitan council provides the local services . 
 At the Norman Conquest , the settlement of Wigan was part of the larger parish of Wigan which , the majority of which was within the hundred of Newton . On 26 August 1246 , Wigan was granted a Royal Charter , making the town a free borough . This happened after Salford was granted its Charter in 1230 and before Manchester in 1301 . As a borough , Wigan was represented in the Model Parliament from 1295 – 1306 by two burgesses – freemen of the borough . The Charter allowed taxes to be made on transactions made in the borough by tradesmen and permitted the local burgesses to establish a guild that would regulate trade in the borough . Non @-@ members of the guild were not allowed to do business in the borough without permission from the burgesses . It is thought that when the Charter was reconfirmation in 1350 it was changed , allowing the election of a mayor of Wigan for the first time . Three burgesses were elected to be presented to the lord of the manor who would choose one man to be mayor for a year . 
 There was rivalry between the lords of the manor and borough . The lord of the manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets , from which he gained no revenue . The rivalry continued in the 16th century , with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging the right of the burgesses to hold markets , believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor . In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship . They did so because they felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord : to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land , running courts , and mining coal . A compromise was reached , dividing some power between the two parties . 
 Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , the town was reformed and was given a commission of the peace . The borough was divided into five wards with a town council of forty members : two aldermen and six councillors representing each ward . Rectors from the local parish church were the lords of the manor since records began until 2 September 1861 . On this date , the borough corporation bought the rights associated with the lordship . The Local Government Act 1888 constituted all municipal boroughs with a population of 50 @,@ 000 or more as " county boroughs " , exercising both borough and county powers . Wigan accordingly became a county borough on 1 April 1889 , giving it independence from Lancashire County Council . Ward boundaries were altered , and the county borough was divided into ten wards , each electing one alderman and three councillors . The former area of Pemberton Urban District was annexed to the County Borough of Wigan in 1904 , adding four extra wards to the borough . In 1974 the County Borough of Wigan was abolished and its former area transferred to form part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan . In April 2011 , the borough along with the entirety of the county of Greater Manchester , became one of 10 constituent councils of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority . 
 Wigan is in the Wigan Parliamentary constituency , which was recreated in 1547 after having covered the borough in the late 13th century . From 1640 until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 , the constituency returned two Members of Parliament ( MPs ) ; from then on it had only one . Since 1918 , the constituency has been represented by the Labour Party . Lisa Nandy is the incumbent Member of Parliament for Wigan , having been elected in the 2010 general election . 
 Wigan Council take part in the town twining scheme , and in 1988 twinned with Angers in France .

 Wigan 's long history is reflected in its 216 listed buildings , of which are 20 Grade II * . As well as being a Grade II * listed structure , Mab 's Cross is the only Scheduled Monument in the town out of 12 in the borough . It is a medieval stone cross that probably dates from the 13th century . There is a legend surrounding the cross that Lady Mabel Bradshaw , wife of Sir William Bradshaw , did penance by walking from her home , Haigh Hall , to the cross once a week barefoot for committing bigamy . There is no evidence the legend is true , as there is no record that Lady Mabel was married to anyone other than Sir William Bradshaw , and several facets of the story are incorrect . Haigh Hall was built in 1827 – 1840 on the site of a medieval manor house of the same name , which was demolished in 1820 . The hall is surrounded by a 250 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 0 km2 ) country park , featuring areas of woodland and parkland . The former town hall is a Grade II listed building . 
 Designed by John McClean , Mesnes Park was opened in 1878 ; McClean was chosen to design the park through a competition . There is a pavilion in the centre and a lake .

 Wigan has been well known for its popular music since the days of George Formby Sr and George Formby Jr . It was the birthplace of The Eight Lancashire Lads a dancing troupe who gave the young Charlie Chaplin his professional debut . One member of the troupe was a John Willie Jackson , The " John Willie " to whom George Formby would often refer in his songs . Local bands that gained wider repute include The Verve , The Railway Children , Witness , The <unk> , Limahl of Kajagoogoo and Starsailor . The Verve were one of the most important British rock groups of the 1990s , finding success in the UK and abroad ( even touring on the USA 's famous Lollapalooza alternative rock festival ) . The band was formed when the members met at Winstanley College in 1989 . 
 From 1973 – 1981 Wigan Casino was the location for Wigan 's weekly Northern Soul all @-@ nighters . The venue began as a dance hall called Empress Ballroom . Wigan Casino rose to prominence in the 1970s , and in 1978 was named " best disco in the world " by Billboard , an American music magazine .

 Wigan lies on the meeting point of two primary A roads , the A49 and A577 which link to the M6 , M61 motorway and <unk> motorway . Increased traffic in recent years , encouraged by retail development , has resulted in very congested main roads for most of the day . This situation is linked to the town 's geography , with river valleys and railway lines impeding road improvement . 
 There are two railway stations in Wigan town centre . Wigan North Western is on the electrified north – south West Coast Main Line . Virgin Trains provides express trains to London Euston , Birmingham , Lancaster , Carlisle , Edinburgh and Glasgow . Northern Rail has trains to Preston and Blackpool and a regular local service along the line to St Helens and Liverpool Lime Street . Wigan Wallgate serves lines running east and west from Wigan . Northern Rail provides trains to Southport and Kirkby ( with connections to Liverpool Central and the Merseyrail system ) . Frequent local services also operate ( in co @-@ operation with TfGM ) to Bolton and Manchester ( Victoria and Piccadilly ) , with most trains from Wigan continuing through to other destinations such as Manchester Airport , Stockport , Rochdale , Huddersfield , Todmorden and ( until a line closure in October 2009 ) Oldham . Pemberton railway station serves the Pemberton area of the town . 
 A horse tramway was built in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a succession of private companies to operate services to Pemberton , <unk> and towards Standish . Steam tram operation was introduced quickly , but the network always struggled to pay its way and just after the start of the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation . However , the network was saddled with a mix of ' standard ' gauge and ' narrow ' gauge lines , reducing efficiency and increasing costs , and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as ' feeder ' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible . <unk> were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931 . 
 The town 's tram , trolleybus and bus fleet was always painted in crimson and off @-@ white colours , with ornate gold lining out until the outbreak of World War 2 . The buses were notable in that they never carried exterior advertisements , with the town 's crest occupying the space between decks where other bus operators placed adverts ; and they carried two green lights on the front , to enable the town 's ratepayers to see at night which was one of the town 's own buses and not one of those of a competitor . At local government reorganisation in April 1974 , the Wigan Corporation Transport Department became part of Greater Manchester Transport . The former Corporation tram / bus garage in <unk> Street is still in use by First Manchester . 
 The current network of local buses , coordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester ( TfGM ) and departing from the bus station in the town centre , serves Wigan and district . Wigan bus station is also served by National Express long distance coach services . Bus companies operating in the area include Stagecoach Manchester , Arriva North West , Diamond Bus North West , Maytree Travel , Wigan Buses and Stagecoach Merseyside and South Lancashire . 
 Wigan is on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and is epitomised by Wigan Pier . There is also a branch of the canal from Wigan to Leigh , with a connection to the Bridgewater Canal linking Wigan to Manchester . 
 = Tornado myths = 
 Tornado myths are incorrect beliefs about tornadoes , some of which are no longer held . These beliefs can be attributed to many factors , including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes , sensationalism by news media , and the presentation of incorrect information in popular entertainment . Common myths cover various aspects of the tornado , and include ideas about tornado safety , the minimization of tornado damage , and false assumptions about the size , shape , power , and path of the tornado itself . 
 It is thought by some people that taking shelter under highway overpasses or in the southwest corner of the building provides extra protection from a tornado , but both of these probably increase the danger of injury or death . Some still believe that opening windows ahead of a tornado will reduce the damage from the storm , but this is not true . Some people also believe that escaping in a vehicle is the safest method of avoiding a tornado , but this could increase the danger in some situations . Other myths are that tornadoes can skip houses , always travel in a predictable direction , always extend visibly from the ground to the cloud , and increase in intensity with increasing width . Finally , some people believe that tornadoes only occur in North America , do not occur in winter , are attracted to trailer park homes , or that some areas are protected from tornadoes by rivers , mountains , valleys , tall buildings or other geographical or man @-@ made features ; the truth is that tornadoes can occur almost anywhere at any time if the conditions are right . Some geographic areas are simply more prone to these conditions than others . 
 = = Safety = = 
 = = = <unk> location in a building = = = 
 In 1887 , the first book on tornadoes was written by John Park Finley , a pioneer in the field of tornado research . While it was a revolutionary book containing many breakthrough ideas , it contained a few ideas which have since been proven false . One of these was the idea that the northeast or east part of a structure was the least safe , and should be avoided when seeking shelter from a tornado . This advice was <unk> and heeded by many until the 1960s . 
 This myth was derived from two misconceptions : First , that tornadoes always travel in a northeasterly direction , and second , that debris from a structure will be carried away in the direction of the tornado 's propagation , leaving anyone taking shelter on the side of the structure facing the tornado 's approach unharmed . The seriousness of these misconceptions began to be revealed in the 1960s and 1970s , when surveys of major tornado damage in residential areas showed that the section of a house in the direction of the tornado 's approach is actually the least safe . Additionally , many tornadoes have traveled in directions other than northeasterly , including the Jarrell Tornado ( F5 on the Fujita scale ) , which moved south @-@ southwesterly . Because determining a tornado 's direction of approach can take time away from seeking shelter , official advice is to seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a building , under a staircase , I @-@ beam , or sturdy piece of furniture if possible . 
 = = = Opening windows to reduce tornado damage = = = 
 One of the oldest pieces of tornado folklore is the idea that tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower atmospheric pressure at the center of a tornado , which causes the house to explode outward . As the theory goes , opening windows helps to equalize the pressure . 
 The source of this myth is from the appearance of some destroyed structures after violent tornadoes . When one wall receives the extreme pressure of tornado winds , it will likely collapse inward . This then leads to a considerable outward pressure on the three remaining walls , which fall outwards as the roof falls down , creating the impression of a house which has exploded . Indeed , damage surveys of " exploded " houses usually show at least one wall which has blown inward . Additionally , if the roof is lifted before any walls fail , the walls can fall in any direction . If they fall outward , this structure can also appear to have exploded . 
 In even the most violent tornadoes , there is only a pressure drop of about 10 % , which is about 1 @.@ 4 pounds per square inch ( 9 @.@ 7 kPa ) . Not only can this difference be equalized in most structures in approximately three seconds , but if a significant pressure differential manages to form , the windows will break first , equalizing the pressure . Additionally , as the windows are the most fragile parts of a house , in a significant tornado flying debris will likely break enough windows to equalize any pressure difference fairly quickly . Regardless of any pressure drop , the direct effects of a tornado 's winds are enough to cause damage to a house in all but the weakest tornadoes . 
 Current advice is that opening windows in advance of a tornado wastes time that could be spent seeking shelter . Also , being near windows is very dangerous during a severe weather event , possibly exposing people to flying glass . 
 = = = Using highway overpasses as shelter = = = 
 The first documented instance of a person using a highway overpass for shelter from a tornado occurred in Wichita Falls , Texas on April 10 , 1979 . A man stuck in a traffic jam as the tornado approached left his vehicle and lay flat on an embankment beneath an overpass , surviving a violent tornado with only minor injuries . In 1991 , a highly publicized event occurred in which a television crew and several others survived the passage of a tornado near El Dorado , Kansas by huddling underneath an overpass , bracing themselves against steel girders . The sensational footage taken by the television crew was broadcast across the United States . This and other media coverage helped to fuel the myth that the underside of bridges or overpasses are good shelters when a tornado strikes . 
 However , in the El Dorado tornado , several unique factors came together to protect the film crew and others seeking shelter under the bridge . The tornado did not pass directly over the filmed bridge , but instead tracked slightly south of the area , exposing the people to winds less damaging than those in the tornado core . The overpass had an unusual design which included a hollow crawlspace at the top of the embankment , which was large enough to allow people to crawl inside and hold the exposed girders against the wind . This design also allowed for added protection against high @-@ speed debris . 
 These cases led to a false belief among many that highway overpasses were good shelter from a tornado . The belief was so strong among some that , in at least one case during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak , an individual left her well @-@ built home and drove several miles to seek shelter under an overpass , in the mistaken belief that she was safer there than inside her house . During the outbreak , a violent tornado directly struck three highway overpasses , and at each one there was a fatality . All of the individuals received significant injuries from tornadic debris , and several were swept into the tornado itself . By contrast , the same tornado struck approximately 2 @,@ 000 homes in Moore , Oklahoma , completely destroying many , yet resulting in only 3 fatalities . 
 From scientific lessons learned , especially in the wake of the 1999 Oklahoma outbreak , meteorologists insist that overpasses are insufficient shelter from tornado winds and debris , and may be the worst place to be during a violent tornado . The embankment under an overpass is higher than the surrounding terrain , and the wind speed increases with height . Additionally , the overpass design may create a " wind @-@ tunnel " effect under the span , further increasing the wind speed . Many overpasses are completely exposed underneath and most lack hanging girders or a crawlspace @-@ like area to provide sufficient protection from debris , which can travel at high speeds even in weak tornadoes . People stopping underneath overpasses block the flow of traffic , putting others in danger . 
 = = = Escaping a tornado in a vehicle = = = 
 Often people try to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle . In theory , cars can travel faster than the average tornado , and so it is better to avoid the tornado altogether than take shelter in its path . The official directive from the National Weather Service is for house @-@ dwellers in the path of a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle . This is a result of several factors and statistics . An interior room inside a well @-@ built frame house ( especially one with a basement ) provides a reasonable degree of protection from all but the most violent tornadoes . Underground or above @-@ ground tornado shelters , as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults , offer almost complete protection . Cars , on the other hand , can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes , and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances , even into buildings . High @-@ profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds . 
 There are many reasons to avoid cars when a tornado is imminent . Severe thunderstorms which produce tornadoes can produce flooding rains , hail , and strong winds far from the tornado @-@ producing area , all of which can make driving difficult or even impossible . Some tornadoes move faster than some cars ( record speed for a tornado moving across land is 72 @.@ 6 mph ( 116 @.@ 8 km / h ) ) , even when the road is clear and flat . Any of these situations can leave drivers stranded in the path of the tornado far from substantial shelter . When coupled with driver panic , they may also result in dangerous but preventable accidents . This situation would be magnified greatly if all the residents of a warned area left in their vehicles , which would cause traffic jams and accidents as the tornado approached . Numerous victims of the deadly Wichita Falls , Texas tornado on April 10 , 1979 died in their vehicles in such a situation . 
 If a person spots a nearby tornado while driving , the official National Weather Service directive has been for the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert , or substantial shelter if nearby . Far @-@ away , highly visible tornadoes , however , can be successfully fled from at right angles ( 90 @-@ degrees ) from its direction of apparent movement . Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado , given sufficient advance warning , mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning . 
 = = Tornado behavior = = 
 = = = Tornadoes skipping houses = = = 
 Several different phenomena have lent credence to the idea that tornadoes " skip " houses , jumping over them like a girl with a skipping rope . Tornadoes vary in intensity along their path , sometimes drastically over a short period and distance . If a tornado was causing damage , then weakened to the point where it could cause no damage , followed by a re @-@ intensification , it would appear as if it skipped a section . Occasionally with violent tornadoes , a smaller <unk> within a tornado will completely destroy a structure next to another building which appears almost unscathed and thus apparently skipped over . 
 It is true that a house that is between two destroyed homes can be undamaged , but this is not the result of a tornado skipping , as some previously thought . After the 1974 Super Outbreak , Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day . Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes . Fujita concluded that multiple vortices , highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds , are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses . The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes , where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado , can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes . 
 Weaker tornadoes , and at times even stronger tornadoes , can occasionally lift , meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground . The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path , leading to the term skipping tornado . These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house @-@ skipping effect is observed , except possibly at the time of the birth and organization of the tornado . This situation is not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied . Typically , when one tornado weakens and another forms , the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis , thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell . This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family . 
 = = = Association of size with intensity = = = 
 Some people have been led to assume that small , skinny tornadoes are always weaker than large , wedge @-@ shaped tornadoes . There is an observed trend of wider tornadoes causing worse damage . It is unknown whether this is due to an actual tendency of tornado dynamics or an ability for the tornado to affect a larger area . However , this is not a reliable indicator of an individual tornado 's intensity . Some small , rope @-@ like tornadoes , traditionally thought of as weak , have been among the strongest in history . Since 1950 , more than 100 violent tornadoes ( F4 / EF4 or higher ) had a maximum width of 300 feet ( 91 m ) . Also , tornadoes typically change shape during the course of their lifespan , further complicating any attempt to classify how dangerous a tornado is as it is occurring . 
 = = = Appearing to reach the ground = = = 
 It is commonly and mistakenly thought that if the condensation funnel of a tornado does not reach the ground , then the tornado cannot cause substantial damage . This is another deadly myth . A tornado appears to be on the ground only when its condensation funnel descends to the surface , but this is misleading . The circular , violent surface winds , not the condensation funnel , are what both define the tornado and cause the tornado 's damage . Spotters should keep sight of swirling debris directly under any visible funnel or rotating wall cloud , even if such structures appear to not descend entirely to the ground . Additionally , tornadoes can be wrapped in rain and thus may not be visible at all . 
 = = = Direction of travel = = = 
 It has been thought in the past that tornadoes moved almost exclusively in a northeasterly direction . This is false , and a potentially deadly myth which can lead to a false sense of security , especially for unaware spotters or chasers . Although the majority of tornadoes move northeast , this is normally due to the motion of the storm , and tornadoes can arrive from any direction . The expectation of northeasterly travel may be accurate in many cases , but is no more than a statistical observation about tornadoes in general that any particular tornado may defy at any time . A deadly F5 tornado that hit the city of Jarrell , Texas in 1997 moved to the southwest - directly opposite of commonly expected storm motion . Additionally , tornadoes can shift without notice due to storm motion changes or effects on the tornado itself from factors such as its rear flank downdraft . This change of direction proved deadly in the 2013 El Reno , OK tornado in which a 2 @.@ 6 mile wide tornado shifted from an east direction to a northeast direction killing at least 4 storm chasers . 
 = = Geographical and temporal influences = = 
 = = = Geographical scope = = = 
 It is often thought that tornadoes only occur in North America . The majority of tornadoes do occur in the United States ; however , tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica . 
 Besides North America , Europe , Australia , the United Kingdom , western Russia , Bangladesh and the Philippines also experience tornadoes on a regular basis . 
 = = = Near rivers , valleys , mountains , or other terrain features = = = 
 There are many misconceptions involving the effect of terrain features — bodies of water , mountains , valleys , and others — on tornado formation and behavior . Most of these beliefs stem from the idea that tornadoes cannot cross or form near these terrain features . While most modes of tornadogenesis are poorly understood , no terrain feature can prevent the occurrence of a tornado . 
 Small bodies of water such as lakes and rivers are insignificant obstacles to tornadoes . Violent tornadoes have formed over rivers and lakes — including the 1878 Wallingford tornado and the 1899 New Richmond tornado — as well as crossing over them after forming elsewhere . More than a dozen tornadoes have crossed the Mississippi River in recorded history . Regarding mountains , tornadoes have been observed on terrain as high as 12 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) above sea level , and have been known to pass up a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 910 m ) ridge unaffected . 
 These myths have been debunked in the past . The devastating Tri @-@ State Tornado crossed two major rivers along a record 219 @-@ mile ( 352 km ) or longer path . In 1944 , a violent tornado cut a continuous path at least 60 miles ( 97 km ) through heavily forested and mountainous territory in West Virginia , killing at least 100 people . A hill known as Burnett 's Mound on the southwest end of Topeka , Kansas was purported to protect the city from tornadoes , according to an old legend . However , in 1966 , an F5 tornado passed directly over the hill through downtown , killing 18 people and causing $ 100 million ( 1966 USD ) in damage . Downtown Memphis , Tennessee was believed by residents to be protected from tornadoes and other severe weather by the Chickasaw Bluff along the Mississippi River . During the 1974 Super Outbreak , violent tornadoes crossed dozens of rivers , including the Ohio , Detroit River as well as crossing over mountains and ridges hundreds of feet high . Another example of tornadoes hitting mountainous regions of the United States is the April , 2011 " Super " outbreak , which hit mountainous parts of East Tennessee , Northeast Alabama , Southwest Virginia and North Georgia , killing many people , including an entire family of 4 in Ringgold , Georgia . 
 = = = Attraction to mobile homes and / or trailer parks = = = 
 The idea that manufactured housing units , or mobile homes , attract tornadoes has been around for decades . This may appear to be true at first from looking at tornado fatality statistics : from 2000 to 2008 , 539 people were killed by tornadoes in the US , with more than half ( 282 ) of those deaths in mobile homes . Only around 6 @.@ 8 % of homes in the US are " manufactured / mobile homes " . 
 However , it is highly unlikely that single @-@ story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution . More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures . Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two @-@ family permanent residence . Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias : whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs , media outlets report on it more extensively , ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties . 
 = = = Downtown areas = = = 
 Some people believe that , for various reasons , large cities cannot be struck by tornadoes . More than 100 tornadoes have struck downtown areas of large cities in recorded history . Many cities have been struck twice or more , and a few — including Lubbock , Texas ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Topeka , Kansas ; and London , England — have been struck by violent tornadoes ( F4 or stronger ) . 
 Tornadoes may seem rare in downtown areas because downtown areas cover such a small geographical area . Considering the size of a central business district is very small compared to the city limits , tornadoes will strike outside of the downtown area more often . 
 The misconception , like most , has a small basis in truth . Research has been done in a few metropolitan areas suggesting that the urban heat island effect may discourage the formation of weak tornadoes in city centers , due to turbulent warm air disrupting their formation . This does not apply to significant tornadoes , however , and it is possible that the presence of tall buildings may actually intensify storms which move into downtown areas . 
 = = = During winter = = = 
 Because they generally require warm weather to form , tornadoes are uncommon in winter in the mid @-@ latitudes . However , they can form , and tornadoes have even been known to travel over snow @-@ covered surfaces . Deadly tornadoes are no exception : from 2000 to 2008 , 135 of the 539 US tornado deaths occurred during meteorological winter ( December through February ) . Tornadoes in winter may be more dangerous , since they tend to move faster than tornadoes at other times of the year . 
 = Homer the Moe = 
 " Homer the Moe " is the third episode of The Simpsons ’ thirteenth season . The episode first aired on the Fox Network on November 18 , 2001 . In the episode , Moe , following advice of his former bartending professor , decides to modernize his bar . The bar 's new image attracts several customers , but leaves Moe 's four regular customers , Homer , Lenny , Carl , and Barney , feeling alienated , which in turn prompts Homer to open his own private bar , disguising it as a hunting club to avoid liquor license restrictions . 
 The episode was directed by Jen Kamerman and was the first episode Dana Gould wrote for The Simpsons . Gould based the part about Homer 's bar on his own father , who opened a hunting club in order to sell alcohol without having to acquire a liquor license . The episode featured the musical group R.E.M. , who appeared as themselves . It received mixed reviews from critics following the thirteenth season 's release on DVD and Blu @-@ Ray . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After Homer tells a story about Bart digging a hole in the backyard for no apparent reason other than to make it deeper and bigger , Moe complains about the monotony at his tavern . Recalling his days at Swigmore University , he decides to return there for some inspiration , and leaves Homer in temporary charge of the bar . At the university , Moe finds his old professor , who is dying . After advising Moe to modernize his bar , the professor drowns himself in the campus lake . Soon , the tavern is renovated by <unk> , the self proclaimed " Dean of Design " , into a swanky nightclub renamed " M " and with a post @-@ modern decor . 
 Homer and his bar @-@ buddies Lenny , Carl and Barney find that they do not fit in with the new , affluent crowd , and miss their old tavern experience . Homer decides to convert his garage into a new tavern for himself and his friends . Meanwhile , Moe realizes that he does not fit in with his new clientele either , and leaves to find Homer . Arriving at the Simpsons ’ home , he finds that the new garage bar has quickly become quite popular , and even has the alternative rock band R.E.M. playing . When confronted by Moe with the fact that it is illegal to operate a bar in a private residence , Homer claims that it is in fact a hunting club , citing a law book that states that a hunting club may provide refreshing beverages . Moe consults the book and determines that the club must engage in the sport of hunting . Homer decides that he will hunt for a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner , and Lisa exclaims , " Hunting ? Dad , no ! " 
 Homer sets out the next day to find a turkey ( though he exclaims " What the hell is that ? " upon seeing one ) but Lisa and Moe scare off his quarry , using a whistle that sounds like a cougar . However , Homer mistakes the whistle for an actual cougar , and shoots Moe in the leg ( and faints into a bear trap upon being informed of this by Lisa ) . After Homer apologizes , he , along with Moe , R.E.M. and the rest of the Simpson family return to Moe ’ s tavern , reverted to its original decor , for a Thanksgiving meal of a turkey , made " entirely of tofu and gluten " and provided by Michael Stipe , who is an environmentalist . 
 = = Production = = 
 Jen Kamerman directed " Homer the Moe " , which was the first episode Dana Gould wrote for the show . It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on November 18 , 2001 , four days before Thanksgiving . 
 In the DVD commentary for the episode , Gould says that , when the team were thinking of a way to start the show , George Meyer said , " I like how kids will just dig a hole " . Homer 's story ends with a Chinese satellite spying on Bart. This was an attempt by Gould to write a bizarre joke in the style of fellow Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder . Moe 's plot in the second act was also created by Meyer , who suggested that the bartending school that Moe attended would resemble the law school on the 1970s television series The Paper Chase , and that the school 's professor would be based on the professor from the earlier series . 
 Gould remembered how his father opened a hunting club and could sell alcohol without having to obtain a liquor @-@ license . This inspired the idea of Homer 's club . Also , the " crossed @-@ fishing @-@ pole @-@ and @-@ rifle " insignia that can be seen in Homer 's garage is the same insignia that Gould 's father uses for his hunting club . Homer 's bar was originally the center of the episode , but became the third act when the writers came up with the renovation of Moe 's bar and made it the main storyline . 
 Alternative rock band R.E.M. guest @-@ starred as themselves in the episode . " We had been told that R.E.M. were big fans of the show " , says executive producer and showrunner for the episode , Mike Scully , adding that their appearance in the episode was a " fairly last @-@ minute addition " . Unlike The Who , who made an appearance in the episode " A Tale of Two Springfields " , R.E.M. did not want their former drummer Bill Berry to be animated in the episode . The drummer seen in the episode was instead drawn to resemble one of their session drummers at the time . Moe 's professor at Swigmore University was voiced by the series ' regular voice actor Dan Castellaneta , the voice of Homer among many others . <unk> , who renovated Moe 's tavern , was portrayed by Hank Azaria , who also voices Moe as well as several other characters in the show . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Swigmore University , which Moe attends in the episode , is a parody of Skidmore College . The professor working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. <unk> , Jr. from the television series The Paper Chase . Moe 's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York that Gould had visited once . The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin 's Lane hotel , where the Simpsons ' staff hosted a Simpsons festival . The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero . The dance that Homer , Carl and Lenny perform in Moe 's bar is a takeoff on the dancing in the comedy / drama film Coyote Ugly , in which the dancers performed on the bar counter , much like Homer , Carl and Lenny do in the episode . 
 = = Release = = 
 In its original American broadcast on November 18 , 2001 , " Homer the Moe " was watched by 14 @.@ 5 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research , making it the most watched television show of its timeslot that night . The episode received a 7 @.@ 1 rating / 17 share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49 , meaning it was seen by 7 @.@ 1 % of the population between ages 18 and 49 , and 17 % of people in this demographic watching television at the time of its broadcast . On September 14 , 2004 , " Homer the Moe " was released , along with the episodes " Homer 's Night Out " , " The Mansion Family " and " Sunday , Cruddy Sunday " on a DVD set entitled The Simpsons – Gone Wild . The episode was later included in The Simpsons : The Thirteenth Season DVD and Blu @-@ Ray set , released August 24 , 2010 . 
 Giving the episode a rating of C − , Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict described the episode as a " tepid remix of previous Simpsons plots " . Ron Martin of 411Mania called the plot " unimaginative " and wrote " I suppose there ’ s only enough episodes you can go through before Moe ’ s has to modernize in the most hideous way " . IGN reviewer R.L. Shaffer wrote that " Homer the Moe " , " The Frying Game " , " The Old Man and the Key " , and " Sweets and Sour Marge " were some of the worst episodes of the whole series . However , Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that , even though the episode was too similar to the third season episode " Flaming Moe 's " , the episode " works reasonably well " . He gave the episode a favorable review overall , calling it " one of the year 's best episodes " . Adam Rayner of Obsessed With Film wrote that the story was " told very well and continued to show the strength of the character of ‘ Moe ’ , who would go on to be one of the only genuinely funny characters in the following barren years for the show " . Casey Broadwater of Blu @-@ ray.com described the episode as one of the best of the season , and Aaron Peck of High @-@ Def Digest stated that the episode was one of his personal favorites . 
 In 2007 , Simon Crerar of The Times listed R.E.M 's performance as one of the thirty @-@ three funniest cameos in the history of the show . Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named R.E.M. his tenth favorite musical guests on The Simpsons out of a list of ten in 2011 . 
 = Thunderstorm = 
 A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or <unk> , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction . 
 Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm , moist air , sometimes along a front . As the warm , moist air moves upward , it cools , condenses , and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature , water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice , reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell . Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth 's surface . As the droplets fall , they collide with other droplets and become larger . The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it , and this cold air spreads out at the Earth 's surface , occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms . 
 Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid @-@ latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts . 
 There are four types of thunderstorms : single @-@ cell , multi @-@ cell cluster , multi @-@ cell lines , and supercells . Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and the most associated with severe weather phenomena . Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes . Dry thunderstorms , with no precipitation , can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud @-@ to @-@ ground lightning that accompanies them . Several means are used to study thunderstorms : weather radar , weather stations , and video photography . Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century . Beyond the Earth 's atmosphere , thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , and Venus . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Warm air has a lower density than cool air , so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom ( this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon ) . Clouds form as relatively warmer air , carrying moisture , rises within cooler air . The moist air rises , and , as it does so , it cools and some of the water vapor in that rising air condenses . When the moisture condenses , it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization , which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud 's ascension . If enough instability is present in the atmosphere , this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder . Meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy ( CAPE ) and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds . Generally , thunderstorms require three conditions to form : 
 Moisture 
 An unstable airmass 
 A lifting force ( heat ) 
 All thunderstorms , regardless of type , go through three stages : the developing stage , the mature stage , and the dissipation stage . The average thunderstorm has a 24 km ( 15 mi ) diameter . Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere , each of these three stages take an average of 30 minutes . 
 = = = Cumulus stage = = = 
 The first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage . During this stage , masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere . The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination , where the heating of the ground produces thermals , or where two winds converge forcing air upwards , or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation . The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude , which appear as cumulus clouds . As the water vapor condenses into liquid , latent heat is released , which warms the air , causing it to become less dense than the surrounding , drier air . The air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection ( hence the term convective precipitation ) . This process creates a low @-@ pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm . In a typical thunderstorm , approximately 5 × 108 kg of water vapor are lifted into the Earth 's atmosphere . 
 = = = Mature stage = = = 
 In the mature stage of a thunderstorm , the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther . Often this ' cap ' is the tropopause . The air is instead forced to spread out , giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape . The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus . The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles . As these fall , they melt to become rain . If the updraft is strong enough , the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail . While updrafts are still present , the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it , creating downdrafts as well . The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds . During this stage , considerable internal turbulence can occur within , which manifests as strong winds , severe lightning , and even tornadoes . 
 Typically , if there is little wind shear , the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and ' rain itself out ' , but , if there is sufficient change in wind speed and / or direction , the downdraft will be separated from the updraft , and the storm may become a supercell , where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours . 
 = = = <unk> stage = = = 
 In the dissipation stage , the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft . If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development , this stage occurs rather quickly , approximately 20 – 30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm . The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm , hit the ground and spread out . This phenomenon is known as a downburst . The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm , the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate . Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions , which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm , moist air , and kills the thunderstorm 's further growth . The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary . This can cause downbursts , a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through , as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs , resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft . The stronger the outflow boundary is , the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes . 
 = = Classification = = 
 There are four main types of thunderstorms : single @-@ cell , multi @-@ cell , squall line ( also called multi @-@ cell line ) and supercell . Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere ( " wind shear " ) . Single @-@ cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20 – 30 minutes . Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters / lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear , which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather . The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms , most commonly associated with large hail , high winds , and tornado formation . 
 = = = Single @-@ cell = = = 
 This term technically applies to a single thunderstorm with one main updraft . Also known as air @-@ mass thunderstorms , these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales . They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter . Within a cluster of thunderstorms , the term " cell " refers to each separate principal updraft . Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation , as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development . Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability ; hence the term " air mass thunderstorm " . When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them , it is known as a pulse severe storm . Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space , making them difficult to forecast . Single @-@ cell thunderstorms normally last 20 – 30 minutes . 
 = = = Multi @-@ cell clusters = = = 
 This is the most common type of thunderstorm development . Mature thunderstorms are found near the center of the cluster , while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side . <unk> storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines . While each cell of the cluster may only last 20 minutes , the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time . They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries , such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure . These type of storms are stronger than the single @-@ cell storm , yet much weaker than the supercell storm . Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate @-@ sized hail , flash flooding , and weak tornadoes . 
 = = = <unk> lines = = = 
 A squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and / or ahead of a cold front . In the early 20th century , the term was used as a synonym for cold front . The squall line contains heavy precipitation , hail , frequent lightning , strong straight line winds , and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts . Severe weather in the form of strong straight @-@ line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo , within the portion of the line that bows out the most . Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern , or LEWP , where mesoscale low pressure areas are present . Some bow echoes in the summer are called derechos , and move quite fast through large sections of territory . On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines , a wake low can form , which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy , which are sometimes associated with a heat burst . This kind of storm is also known as " Wind of the Stony Lake " ( Traditional Chinese : <unk> – <unk> <unk> <unk> , Simplified Chinese : <unk> ) in southern China . 
 = = = Supercells = = = 
 Supercell storms are large , usually severe , quasi @-@ steady @-@ state storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height ( " wind shear " ) , and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts ( i.e. , where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft ) with a strong , rotating updraft ( a " mesocyclone " ) . These storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud ( or anvil ) can break through the troposphere and reach into the lower levels of the stratosphere , and supercell storms can be 15 miles ( 24 km ) wide . Research has shown that at least 90 percent of supercells cause severe weather . These storms can produce destructive tornadoes , sometimes F3 or higher , extremely large hailstones ( 4 inches or 10 centimetres diameter ) , straight @-@ line winds in excess of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , and flash floods . In fact , research has also shown that most tornadoes occur from this type of thunderstorm . Supercells are the strongest type of thunderstorm , even stronger than the most severe thunderstorms . 
 = = = Severe thunderstorms = = = 
 A thunderstorm is classed as severe if winds reach at least 93 kilometres per hour ( 58 mph ) , hail is 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in diameter or larger , or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are reported . Although a funnel cloud or tornado indicates a severe thunderstorm , a tornado warning is issued in place of a severe thunderstorm warning . A severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe , or will soon turn severe . In Canada , a rainfall rate greater than 50 millimetres ( 2 in ) in one hour , or 75 millimetres ( 3 in ) in three hours , is also used to indicate severe thunderstorms . Severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell . However , multicell , supercell , and squall lines represent the most common forms of thunderstorms that produce severe weather . 
 = = = Mesoscale convective systems = = = 
 A mesoscale convective system ( MCS ) is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones , and normally persists for several hours or more . A mesoscale convective system 's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape , and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones , squall lines , lake @-@ effect snow events , polar lows , and Mesoscale Convective Complexes ( MCCs ) , and they generally form near weather fronts . Most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day . The type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across North America , Europe , and Asia , with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours . 
 Forms of MCS that develop in the tropics are found in use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon troughs , generally within the warm season between spring and fall . More intense systems form over land than over water . One exception is that of lake @-@ effect snow bands , which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water , and occurs from fall through spring . Polar lows are a second special class of MCS . They form at high latitudes during the cold season . Once the parent MCS dies , later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex ( MCV ) . Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall . 
 = = Motion = = 
 The two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture . Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth 's troposphere , the lowest 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) of the Earth 's atmosphere . Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth 's surface than stronger thunderstorms , as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall . Organized , long @-@ lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector . If the gust front , or leading edge of the outflow boundary , races ahead of the thunderstorm , its motion will accelerate in tandem . This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation ( HP ) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation ( LP ) . When thunderstorms merge , which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other , the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell . The stronger the mean wind , the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion . On weather radar , storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan . 
 = = = Back @-@ building thunderstorm = = = 
 A back @-@ building thunderstorm , commonly referred to as a training thunderstorm , is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side ( usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere ) , such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction . Though the storm often appears stationary on radar , or even moving upwind , this is an illusion . The storm is really a multi @-@ cell storm with new , more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side , replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind . When this happens , catastrophic flooding is possible . In Rapid City , South Dakota , in 1972 , an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area , resulting in devastating flash flooding . A similar event occurred in Boscastle , England , on 16 August 2004 . 
 = = Hazards = = 
 Each year , many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning . While severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer , they can occur at just about any time of the year . 
 = = = Cloud @-@ to @-@ ground lightning = = = 
 Cloud @-@ to @-@ ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations . One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting . Under a regime of low precipitation ( LP ) thunderstorms , where little precipitation is present , rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat . Direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion . In areas with a high frequency for cloud @-@ to @-@ ground lightning , like Florida , lightning causes several fatalities per year , most commonly to people working outside . 
 Precipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels ( pH ) , otherwise known as acid rain , is also a frequent risk produced by lightning . Distilled water , which contains no carbon dioxide , has a neutral pH of 7 . Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic , and those with a pH greater than 7 are basic . “ Clean ” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5 @.@ 2 , because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid , a weak acid ( pH 5 @.@ 6 in distilled water ) , but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals . Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena , caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules , can result in the production of acid rain , if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation , thus creating acid rain . Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon . In ecosystems , acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil , resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms . 
 = = = Hail = = = 
 Any thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm . <unk> that are capable of producing hailstones are often seen obtaining green coloration . Hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards ( known as orographic lifting ) , thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely . One of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern India , which reported one of the highest hail @-@ related death tolls on record in 1888 . China also experiences significant hailstorms . Across Europe , Croatia experiences frequent occurrences of hail . 
 In North America , hail is most common in the area where Colorado , Nebraska , and Wyoming meet , known as " Hail Alley . " Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours , with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September . Cheyenne , Wyoming is North America 's most hail @-@ prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season . In South America , areas prone to hail are cities like Bogotá , Colombia . 
 Hail can cause serious damage , notably to automobiles , aircraft , skylights , glass @-@ roofed structures , livestock , and most commonly , farmers ' crops . Hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft . When hail stones exceed 0 @.@ 5 inch ( 13 mm ) in diameter , planes can be seriously damaged within seconds . The hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft . Wheat , corn , soybeans , and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage . Hail is one of Canada 's most costly hazards . Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history . One of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund , Uttarakhand , India . The largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the United States fell in 2003 in Aurora , Nebraska , United States . 
 = = = Tornadoes and waterspouts = = = 
 A tornado is a violent , rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud ( otherwise known as a thundercloud ) or , in rare cases , the base of a cumulus cloud . Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel , whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust . Most tornadoes have wind speeds between 40 and 110 mph ( 64 and 177 km / h ) , are approximately 250 feet ( 76 m ) across , and travel a few miles ( several kilometers ) before dissipating . Some attain wind speeds of more than 300 mph ( 480 km / h ) , stretch more than one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) across , and stay on the ground for dozens of miles ( more than 100 km ) . 
 The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused . An EF0 tornado , the weakest category , damages trees but not substantial structures . An EF5 tornado , the strongest category , rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers . The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes . Doppler radar data , photogrammetry , and ground swirl patterns ( cycloidal marks ) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating . 
 Waterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes , characterized by a spiraling funnel @-@ shaped wind current that form over bodies of water , connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds . Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes , or more specifically , non @-@ <unk> tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water . These spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator , but are less common within areas of high latitude . 
 = = = Flash flood = = = 
 Flash flooding is the process where a landscape , most notably an urban environment , is subjected to rapid floods . These rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding and are frequently ( though not always ) associated with intense rainfall . Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow @-@ moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it . Flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments , where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water . Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure , such as bridges , and weakly constructed buildings . Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water . Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced . Soil erosion can occur as well , exposing risks of landslide phenomena . 
 = = = Downburst = = = 
 Downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms . Downburst winds are generally very powerful , and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes , due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight @-@ horizontal characteristic . Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable , incomplete , or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings . Agricultural crops , and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged . Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash . Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds . Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it , due to their higher density . When these downdrafts reach the surface , they spread out and turn into the destructive straight @-@ horizontal winds . 
 = = Safety precautions = = 
 Most thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully ; however , any thunderstorm can become severe , and all thunderstorms , by definition , present the danger of lightning . Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before , during , and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage . 
 = = = Preparedness = = = 
 Preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm . Some preparedness takes the form of general readiness ( as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year ) . Preparing a family emergency plan , for example , can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly . Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees , which can be blown over in high winds , can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury . 
 The National Weather Service ( NWS ) in the United States recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur : 
 Know the names of local counties , cities , and towns , as these are how warnings are described . 
 Monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area . 
 Be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm . 
 Cancel or reschedule outdoor events ( to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits ) . 
 Take action early so you have time to get to a safe place . 
 Get inside a substantial building or hard @-@ topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives . 
 If you hear thunder , get to the safe place immediately . 
 Avoid open areas like hilltops , fields , and beaches , and don 't be or be near the tallest objects in an area when thunderstorms are occurring . 
 Don 't shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms . 
 If in the woods , put as much distance between you and any trees during thunderstorms . 
 If in a group , spread out so that you increase the chances for survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a lightning strike . 
 = = = Safety = = = 
 While safety and preparedness often overlap , “ thunderstorm safety ” generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm . The American Red Cross recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in progress : 
 Take action immediately upon hearing thunder . Anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning . 
 Avoid electrical appliances , including corded telephones . <unk> and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm . 
 Close and stay away from windows and doors , as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind . 
 Do not bathe or shower , as plumbing conducts electricity . 
 If driving , safely exit the roadway , turn on hazard lights , and park . Remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal . 
 The NWS stopped recommending the " lightning crouch " in 2008 as it doesn 't provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike . 
 = = Frequent occurrences = = 
 Thunderstorms occur throughout the world , even in the polar regions , with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas , where they may occur nearly daily . At any given time approximately 2 @,@ 000 thunderstorms are occurring on Earth . Kampala and <unk> in Uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on Earth , a claim also made for Bogor on Java , Indonesia and Singapore . Other cities known for frequent storm activity include Darwin , Caracas , Manila and Mumbai . Thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe , and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones . In temperate regions , they are most frequent in spring and summer , although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year . They may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water . Thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures . 
 Some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states . These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes . Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States , but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas , particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California . In spring and summer , they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the Rocky Mountains as part of the North American Monsoon regime . In the Northeast , storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest , but with less frequency and severity . During the summer , air @-@ mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of Florida . 
 = = Types of lightning = = 
 Lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm . It can be seen in the form of a bright streak ( or bolt ) from the sky . Lightning occurs when an electrical charge is built up within a cloud , due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level . When a large enough charge is built up , a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning . 
 The temperature of a lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the surface of the sun . Although the lightning is extremely hot , the duration is short and 90 % of strike victims survive . Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot , some people have been struck by lightning over three times , and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm . 
 The loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the speed of sound . Because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang , although both occur at the same moment . 
 There are several types of lightning : 
 In @-@ cloud lightning is the most common . It is lightning within a cloud and is sometimes called intra @-@ cloud or sheet lightning . 
 Cloud to ground lightning is when a bolt of lightning from a cloud strikes the ground . This form poses the greatest threat to life and property . 
 Ground to cloud lightning is when a lightning bolt is induced from the ground to the cloud . 
 Cloud to cloud lightning is rarely seen and is when a bolt of lightning arcs from one cloud to another . 
 Ball lightning is extremely rare and has several hypothesized explanations . It is seen in the form of a 15 to 50 centimeter radius ball . 
 Cloud to air lightning is when lightning from a cloud hits air of a different charge . 
 Dry lightning is a misnomer that refers to a thunderstorm whose precipitation does not reach the ground . 
 Heat Lightning refers to a lightning flash that is seen from the horizon that does not have accompanying thunder . 
 Upper @-@ atmospheric lightning occurs above the <unk> . 
 Clear @-@ air lightning is used widely to describe lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it . In the U.S. and Canadian Rockies , a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not be observable , ( either visually or audibly ) , from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes . European and Asian mountainous areas experience similar events . Also in clear areas where the storm cell is on the near horizon ( within 26 km ( 16 mi ) a strike can occur , and as the storm is so far away , the strike is referred to as clear @-@ air . 
 = = Energy = = 
 If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known , then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated . In a typical thunderstorm , approximately 5 × 108 kg of water vapor are lifted , and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules . This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone , and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima , Japan in 1945 . 
 The Fermi Gamma @-@ ray Burst Monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles ( positrons ) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms . It is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma @-@ ray flashes ( TGF ) . <unk> are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning . The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays . About 500 <unk> may occur every day worldwide , but mostly go undetected . 
 = = Studies = = 
 In more contemporary times , thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity . Every spring , storm chasers head to the Great Plains of the United States and the Canadian Prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping . Radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms . More organized meteorological projects such as <unk> use an array of sensors , such as the Doppler on Wheels , vehicles with mounted automated weather stations , weather balloons , and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather . Lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud @-@ to @-@ ground lightning strokes with 95 percent accuracy in detection and within 250 metres ( 820 ft ) of their point of origin . 
 = = Mythology and religion = = 
 Thunderstorms strongly influenced many early civilizations . Greeks believed that they were battles waged by Zeus , who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus . Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird , who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit . The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight <unk> , with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir . Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms . Christian doctrine accepted the ideas of Aristotle 's original work , called Meteorologica , that winds were caused by exhalations from the Earth and that fierce storms were the work of God . These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century . 
 Martin Luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began , causing him to pray to God for being saved and promising to become a monk . 
 = = Outside of Earth = = 
 The clouds of Venus are capable of producing lightning much like the clouds on Earth . The lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth . A thin layer of water clouds appears to underlie the ammonia layer within Jupiter 's atmosphere , where thunderstorms evidenced by flashes of lightning have been detected . ( Water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge , so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning . ) These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the Earth . The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior . 
 = Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series = 
 Final Fantasy XIII - a role @-@ playing game released by Square Enix in 2009 - revolves around the struggles of a group of humans over a predestined fate . The game 's two sequels , Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 and Lightning Returns : Final Fantasy XIII , build on the first game 's story and mythos . In video game publications and among the staff at Square Enix , the three games have come to be referred to as the " Lightning Saga " , and the core concepts they contain are drawn from the mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries . The visuals of the original characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura and Nao Ikeda , while many later characters were created by other designers , including Hideo Minaba , Yusuke Naora and Toshiyuki Itahana . Their original stories were created by Motomu Toriyama and written up by Daisuke Watanabe . 
 The series ' central characters are Lightning , a former soldier and the core character in all three games ; Serah Farron , Lightning 's sister and the second game 's main protagonist ; Snow Villiers , an optimistic young man engaged to Serah ; Hope Estheim , a young man who develops a strong bond with Lightning ; Sazh Katzroy , a former airship pilot ; Oerba Dia Vanille and Oerba Yun Fang , two women who inadvertently set the first game 's events in motion . Three further characters appear in XIII @-@ 2 : Noel Kreiss , a hunter who sets out to change his bleak future ; Caius Ballad , a man from Noel 's past who wishes to bring about a predestined apocalypse ; and Paddra Nsu @-@ Yeul , a seeress reincarnated through history . In Lightning Returns , two more are added : Lumina , a doppelganger of Serah ; and Bhunivelze , the main deity of the Final Fantasy XIII universe . 
 The characters in the games have been the basis of several pieces of merchandise produced by Square Enix , such as statues , action figures , apparel , and jewelry . They have been subject to mostly positive reviews ; most observers favorably compared the characters to those in the previous games and praised the voice acting , however some critics have stated that the plot line of the characters have been confusing when introduced . In XIII @-@ 2 , the shift to new or secondary characters and the change in importance and story role of the previous game 's main cast grated with some reviewers , while others applauded the new characters ' development and interactions . In Lightning Returns , the characters ' stories were often criticized for being underdeveloped , or simply included for the sake of ending their stories . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 The overarching theme of the games was the effects the deities of the core mythos on the human population , especially the fate that was forced upon the main characters . Yuji Abe , a designer on Lightning Returns , defined it as " A battle with destiny " , with the burden of destiny growing progressively heavier for the main characters over the course of the games . The setting and story was written around and drawn from the official mythology for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series , which also includes Final Fantasy XV and Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 . For Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels , Toriyama created a story focusing on the existing deities within the mythos and their influence on the world . Different deities from the mythos were focused on in each installment , such as the goddess Etro in XIII @-@ 2 . One of the defining features of the cast is the game 's central protagonist : Lightning . Toriyama wanted Lightning to be an exceptional female protagonist for the Final Fantasy series , with her having great strength and combat ability , as opposed to the gentler figures of Aerith from Final Fantasy VII or Yuna from Final Fantasy X. Unlike those characters , Lightning 's personality was conceived well before her outfit was designed or her voice actresses were cast . How the character was portrayed and how her story and personality was evolved became one of the driving forces of the series . 
 Most of Final Fantasy XIII 's characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura , who also served as the character designer for Final Fantasy VII , VIII and X. The stories of the characters were created by Motomu Toriyama and Daisuke Watanabe . The main story concept was " characters at the mercy of a predetermined , unjust fate " . Nao Ikeda designed Snow , Jihl Nabaat and Gadot , Lebreau , and Maqui . The cast , along with the world 's characters , were intended to mimic the multi @-@ ethnic feel of the United States rather than Asia or Europe . During production of the first game , Toriyama wanted the cast to be a group that was originally combative with one @-@ another , and designed the game 's narrative with several key points which would bring them together : these included the scene between Sazh and Vanille in the city of Nautilus , and the reconciliation between Snow and Hope in the town of Palumpolum . The characters went through several changes in the early stages of development , the two noted examples being Sazh 's ethnic origin and Fang 's gender . 
 For XIII @-@ 2 , Toriyama wanted a dark and serious tone to the world and story , in contrast to the jovial atmosphere of Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , and the story was scripted to play out as " pieces of drama " like a television series . Its story and characters were focused around the concepts of mortality and , in Toriyama 's words , the " wish for rebirth " : the latter theme was directly inspired by the Great East Japan earthquake . Watanabe stayed as one of the game 's writers , with writer and novelist Emi Nagashima , better known under her pen name of Jun Eishima , coming on as a story consultant . Lightning 's outfit for the game was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo , who worked from a rough outline done by Nomura , who also designed the characters ' facial features . Two new character designers were brought in : Hideo Minaba , who contributed to new character outfits such as Hope and Alyssa 's , and Yusuke Naora , who designed outfits for Serah , Noel and Caius . Lightning and Serah 's designs were created to directly reflect the environments they start out from . The character of Noel was added at a later stage in the original planning , since the original plan for Serah to travel alone with the moogle Mog seemed to clash too much with the game 's serious nature . For Lightning Returns , the developers decided to have Lightning as the sole protagonist so that players could get to know her better . The story was created to bring closure for the characters of the series . The core themes of the game were the " salvation of souls " , and the " rebirth of Lightning " , the latter being the main reason the game was not called XIII @-@ 3 . <unk> returned to design Lightning and Snow 's new looks and Kamikokuryo returned to design new outfits for Lightning and help with the world design . Two new designers brought in were Toshitaka Matsuda , an artist for Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings , and Toshiyuki Itahana , who had worked on Final Fantasy IX and the Crystal Chronicles series . Both designed multiple battle costumes for Lightning , many of them inspired by the artwork of Yoshitaka Amano . Itahana and Matsuda also respectively designed Lumina and Bhunivelze . Watanabe returned as the main scenario writer , while also receiving ideas for scenes from Toriyama and other members of staff . His work on the script was slow , causing problems from the rest of the development team : in response to this , he worked hard to create an appropriate finale . During his work , he had a strong nostalgic feeling while writing the characters ' lines . 
 In order to reduce the delay between the local and international releases , the English voice acting for XIII was done while the game was in development . Unfortunately , it lacked the infrastructure needed to support simultaneous development and localization . The lack of deadlines , poor communication and synchronization between the various departments , and continuing changes to the script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development . One of the most notable knock @-@ on effects was that the game 's script needed to be re @-@ translated as the various cutscenes changed , and large parts of the dialogue had to be rerecorded , party because they lacked proper emotional drive at the right moments . For XIII @-@ 2 , a tool called Moomle , developed by English translator Tom Slattery and his Japanese counterpart Teruaki Sugawara from their experience with the first game , was used to make sure all parts of the localization process were synchronized . For Lightning Returns the Japanese voice actors recorded their dialogue well after their characters ' scenes had been created , as opposed to the normal procedure of recording lines before cutscene creation . For the English version , the amount of dialogue translation and recording was so large that there was over two months ' delay between the game 's local and international releases . 
 Eidolons ( <unk> , <unk> , Summon Beasts ) , beings who aid the protagonists after being tamed in battle , are the game 's versions of summons . The ones featured in the games are series staples Odin , Shiva , Alexander , and Bahamut , and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr . Their summon sequences were designed to be flashy , but also mixed with gameplay : this approach was inspired by comments from players of previous titles who had not wanted to wait as long for the summons to take effect as in previous titles . The Eidolons , which could transform into vehicle @-@ like forms for their masters to ride , were built around the game 's theme of " transformation " . They were to have been featured in XIII @-@ 2 as part of a DLC episode , but the idea was scrapped and the gameplay was folded into one of the title 's minigames . For Lightning Returns , although the Eidolons still exist , they were not available in gameplay and merely served as an element of the story . Carried over from the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos are the fal 'Cie , demigods who work to find a way of bringing their respective deities back into the world . The fal 'Cie can choose people to become l 'Cie , servants given magical powers and a task to complete within a given time , called a Focus . Those who succeed go into crystal stasis , while those that fail become monsters called Cie 'th .

 = = = Lightning = = = 
 Lightning ( ライトニング , Raitoningu ) is the key protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels , serving as a primary protagonist in XIII , a supporting character of XIII @-@ 2 and the sole playable character of Lightning Returns . Born as Claire Farron , or Éclair Farron ( エクレール ・ ファロン , Ekurēru Faron ) in the original Japanese @-@ language version , she lost her parents when she was 15 years old . She takes a new name to become a stronger person to help her younger sister Serah , only to cause tensions between them as a result . In the first game , she is a former Sanctum soldier who sets out to save her sister from the fal 'Cie , then strives to save Cocoon from destruction . At the beginning of XIII @-@ 2 , she is whisked away to Valhalla , capital of the Unseen World , to act as the Goddess Etro 's protector , sending messages to her allies and guiding Serah through time to put things right . She fails , causing the death of Etro and the release of Chaos , a dark energy kept trapped by the goddess . In Lightning Returns , Lightning ends up serving the god Bhunivelze as the savior for the inhabitants of Nova Chrysalia during its final days , fighting old friends and enemies alike to save their souls . She is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and by Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese . 
 = = = Serah Farron = = = 
 Serah Farron ( <unk> ・ ファロン , Sera Faron ) is an 18 @-@ year @-@ old human from Cocoon . After their parents die years prior to the start of the game , Lightning , then still called Claire , raises Serah and sets out to become a protector for her , but her devotion to that goal causes tensions between them . Eventually , Serah becomes engaged to Snow days prior to the start of the game , and Lightning strongly objects to their relationship . Serah eventually reveals to Snow and Lightning that , while exploring the Pulse <unk> where the fal 'Cie Anima was kept , she has been made a Pulse l 'Cie . However , Lightning discovers too late that Serah is captured by Anima after disbelieving her sister . Although given the Focus to become Ragnarok , she changes her Focus through her own will , then imparts her new mission , to save Cocoon , to Lightning and Snow before turning to crystal after being found . The change of her Focus eventually inspires the other l 'Cie to do the same . After the party defeats Orphan at the end of the game , Serah , along with Dajh , resumes her life as a human . Serah reconciles with Lightning , who accepts her relationship with Snow afterwards . 
 In Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , Serah is the only one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla , with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon . She eventually becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum , the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse , before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon . Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss , who tells her of Lightning 's fate and his own mission . After Serah accepts Noel 's offer to be brought to Lightning , the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister . In the process , Serah encounters Caius Ballad , while learning from Paddra Nsu @-@ Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future . Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future , Serah resolves to change the future for everyone 's sake . However , after Caius 's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future , Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla 's chaos . Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit , telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless . Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her . In Lightning Returns , Serah 's soul , which has been kept safe within Lightning , is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze . Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah 's soul , resulting in the two being similar in appearance . Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line . This false Serah , who develops feelings for her ' sister ' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid . The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies , and travels with them to the new world . 
 Early in the development of XIII , Serah was meant to be a playable character , but was eventually delegated to a supporting character because of technical issues . Tetsuya Nomura , in an interview , said that he designed Serah 's hair so that her silhouette would mirror Lightning 's . For XIII @-@ 2 , the developers decided to change Serah and Lightning 's roles , with Serah becoming the game 's main protagonist , while Lightning was the object of her quest . Yusuke Naora was told to design Serah 's new costume like the " plug suit " outfits from Neon Genesis Evangelion and was asked to give her a necklace for plot reasons . Part of the challenge for the game was making Serah more active , but maintaining her femininity , which is the reason she was given a bow as her weapon . Another reason behind the design of her weapon was the fact that the developers wanted to give the characters means to attack both up close and at long range . Aside from Naora 's design , Yuko Oshima of AKB48 was asked to design two potential DLC outfits for Serah : a black combat outfit titled " Exposure and Defense " ( later retitled " Style and Steel " ) , and a second red @-@ and @-@ white outfit titled " Little Red Riding Hood " , meant to be indicative of Serah 's change into an adult . After a popular vote , the former costume was chosen and released in April 2012 . Serah is voiced by Laura Bailey in English and by Minako Kotobuki in Japanese . 
 = = = Snow Villiers = = = 
 Snow Villiers ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Sunō <unk> ) is a 21 @-@ year @-@ old human from Cocoon . Snow proposes to Serah Farron two days prior to the start of Final Fantasy XIII . During the Purge ( a mass exodus of Cocoon citizens after the activation of the Pulse fal 'Cie Anima ) , Snow and his group NORA engages in a battle with PSICOM , the security force of Cocoon . After becoming a l 'Cie and finding Serah in crystal stasis , he despairs and is forced to tame his Eidolon , the Shiva Sisters . After meeting up with Cid Raines and Oerba Yun Fang , Snow pairs up with Hope while oblivious to the boy 's grudge against him . Once Hope gets Snow alone , he unsuccessfully tries to murder him for his part in his mother 's death and reconciles with him soon after . Snow then reconciles with Lightning and receives forgiveness from Hope 's father . He and the others then rescue Sazh and Vanille before eventually escaping to Gran Pulse , where Lightning and Snow resolve to see Serah together after destroying Orphan . After Orphan 's death , Snow and Lightning reunite with Serah , then start planning to set up a new town on Gran Pulse . 
 In Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , Snow left a year prior to its events promising Serah to find Lightning for her . His search would eventually result with him traveling through time while seeing Lightning in a dream telling him to protect the crystal pillar holding Cocoon , seeing a vision of the world 's fate , and becoming a l 'Cie once more with the Focus of fighting beside Serah at the final battle . Appearing on Cocoon three hundred years in his future , Snow attempts to destroy a monster threatening Cocoon 's supporting pillar . Serah and Noel come to Snow 's aid and help him defeat it by negating the anomaly causing its growth . With the threat gone , Snow entrusts Noel with Serah 's care and dissolves from the moment in time while promising Serah that they will meet again . Snow then travels to the Coliseum , a fighting arena separated from the flow of time , and after Serah and Noel challenge him to combat and win , he is forced to remain due to being bound to the Coliseum by the Chaos . 
 In Lightning Returns , after being released from his imprisonment , Snow meets up with Noel and Hope before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron . Over the next five hundred years , he becomes jaded and depressed , brooding on Serah 's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying . When Lightning meets up with him , his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane . When they next meet , Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos at the center of Yusnaan 's palace , transform into a Cie 'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure . He performs this act and Lightning does battle him , but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world . 
 Snow was designed by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura . He was designed around a motif of ice , with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo . For XIII @-@ 2 , the bandanna was removed and he was given a new hairstyle . Originally to have been called " Storm " , the development team nicknamed the character " Mr. 33 cm " in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret . Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns . Snow 's personality in XIII , which carried over to XIII @-@ 2 , was created to be passionate , optimistic and impulsive , opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning 's cold mannerisms . He has also been described in interviews as the " tough guy " type , and not having a jealous side to him . He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type , but this was changed to his " big brother " persona . Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns , Kitase described Snow as " struggling with all his might to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah . " His design was intended to reflect the state of the world , as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world 's fate . His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic . Watanabe enjoyed writing the character 's story , as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared " cool " , rather than taking on a " thankless " roles . VideoGamer.com 's Wesley Yin @-@ Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope , and the way he coped with Serah 's fate , one of the most interesting aspects of the original game . Aside from his appearance in the XIII games , the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII , and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in Final Fantasy XIV : A Realm Reborn along with Lightning 's Guardian Corps uniform . Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese . 
 = = = Hope Estheim = = = 
 Hope Estheim ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a 14 @-@ year @-@ old boy who is an exile at the start of Final Fantasy XIII . At the beginning of the game , Hope and his mother Nora , on vacation in the town of Bodhum , are selected for the Purge . Under Snow 's leadership , Nora joins the resistance in the Hanging Edge , but falls to her death during the battle while trying to protect Hope and after saving Snow 's life : this event angers Hope greatly . After he becomes a l 'Cie , and being separated from the main party , Hope follows Lightning while plotting his assassination attempt on Snow . Despite Lightning 's objections , Hope tries to kill Snow once he gets him alone , but after coming to the realization that he had just been blaming Snow to cope with his mother 's death , they settle their differences . When Hope returns home to his father , Bartholomew , he tells him what happened to Nora and repairs their relationship . When on Gran Pulse , he tells the others to leave him , afraid they will get hurt because of him , but inadvertently summons his Eidolon Alexander . After the defeat of Orphan , Hope tells Lightning that Fang and Vanille had changed their fate by fulfilling their Focus of transforming into Ragnarok to save Cocoon rather than destroying it . 
 In Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Hope is leader of the scientific expedition group known as the Academy a decade after the events of Final Fantasy XIII . He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time . Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past , Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source . Originally planning to create an artificial fal 'Cie , he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation . He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go three hundred and eighty seven years into the future to oversee Hope 's New Cocoon Project , a plan to build a man @-@ made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon 's destined fall in the next century . When the old Cocoon does fall , Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles . 
 In Lightning Returns , Hope resides in a special base constructed within the new Cocoon called the Ark , communicating with Lightning via a wireless com @-@ link . Hope is returned to his 14 @-@ year @-@ old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze , but retains his memories from the past two games . He is instrumental in keeping the world going , for as Lightning completes quests and fulfills missions , he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world 's life . On the final day , Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze 's eyes and ears , and will now be disposed of . Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar , speaking with Lightning and capturing her allies . During the final battle Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze 's control , then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good . 
 At the 2009 TGS event , it was revealed that Hope 's silver hair was meant for Lightning , but when her hair color was decided as pink , Hope received the silver hair coloring instead . Hope 's Academy uniform for XIII @-@ 2 was designed by Hideo Minaba . While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII , for XIII @-@ 2 , the game 's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature , authoritative person . According to Toriyama , how Hope matured , as seen through Lightning 's eyes , formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns . He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game , but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance . In a later interview , he said that while the character was much liked by the team , he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character . Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning 's character and enable her to grow as a person . Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese . 
 = = = Sazh Katzroy = = = 
 Sazh Katzroy ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a 40 @-@ year @-@ old human former airship pilot . His son , Dajh , is taken by the Sanctum in the aftermath of him becoming a Cocoon l 'Cie three days earlier when Sazh bought him a chocobo chick . Along with Lightning , he derails the train carrying the Cocoon exiles at the start of Final Fantasy XIII . After the party splits up following Anima 's defeat , Sazh goes with Vanille as he tells her about his son . However , Jihl Nabaat reveals Vanille 's part in his son becoming a l 'Cie , causing him to summon the Eidolon Brynhildr . Unable to kill Vanille , Sazh unsuccessfully attempts suicide . Sazh and Vanille are then captured by Nabaat . Before Lightning 's party rescues Sazh and Vanille , he reconciles with her for her role in Dajh 's fate . After traveling to Pulse , Sazh eventually forgives Fang for what happened to Dajh . After Vanille and Fang transform to Ragnarok and prevent Cocoon from colliding with Pulse , Sazh is reunited with Dajh . 
 After these events , Sazh leaves to help the civilians of Cocoon , then decides to move onto Gran Pulse . At some point during the events of XIII @-@ 2 , Sazh is sucked through a rip in time , is separated from Dajh and ends up in Serendipity , a palace in the Void Beyond . While there , he meets Chocolina and learns of the fate facing the world from Serendipity 's owner . Reuniting with Dajh and deciding to fight no matter what the future holds , they go through a time gate and help Serah and Noel in their battle against Caius . Sazh then helps Hope save Fang and Vanille from the crystal pillar before Cocoon falls . In Lightning Returns , Sazh has set up his home in the Wildlands . After Dajh 's soul is lost and his body falls into a coma , Sazh becomes tormented by his seeming failure to protect his son . Lightning helps retrieve the fragments of Dajh 's soul , lifting Sazh 's burden . 
 In the May 2009 edition of Official PlayStation Magazine , Yoshinori Kitase said that Sazh was intended to be an Eddie Murphy @-@ style comic @-@ relief character as well as a sympathetic character . Toriyama was initially worried about the unconventional afro hairstyle . Due to the character having the largest amount of dialogue in the game , an experienced voice actor was chosen for him . His early look was , as revealed in the a special Ultimania guide released during 25th anniversary celebrations for the series , very different from his final design , with him being white with long brown hair , and wielding a shoulder @-@ cannon rather than machine pistols . He was also named " Baz " . He is voiced by Reno Wilson in English and by Masashi <unk> in Japanese . 
 = = = Oerba Dia Vanille = = = 
 Oerba Dia Vanille ( <unk> ＝ <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> @-@ Daia <unk> ) is a 19 @-@ year @-@ old l 'Cie from the village of Oerba on Gran Pulse and the narrator of Final Fantasy XIII . Thirteen days before the start of the game , she and Oerba Yun Fang wake from crystal stasis in the Pulse <unk> holding the fal 'Cie Anima , initiating events that would lead to the Sanctum 's Purge . When she is with the <unk> of Cocoon along with Nora and Hope Estheim during their exile , she is rescued by Snow Villiers ' group , NORA . However , after Nora dies , she encourages Hope to follow Snow to confront him , and she sees them become l 'Cie . After the party splits up , Vanille , along with Sazh , resolve to run away from their fate . However , both she and Sazh are captured by Jihl Nabaat . After Lightning and the party rescue the two , Vanille reunites with Fang . On Gran Pulse , Fang regains her memory and remembers it was she who became Ragnarok , a monster designed to bring down Cocoon during a conflict between the two worlds called the War of Transgression . When Vanille enters a state of emotional distress , she summons and defeats the Eidolon Hecatoncheir . After the defeat of Orphan , she and Fang transform into Ragnarok and form a crystal pillar to prevent Cocoon colliding with Pulse . 
 After this event , Vanille remains with Fang in crystal stasis within the pillar : from there , the two end up seeing everything that is going on , remaining unaffected by the changes in the timeline . In Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , though still held in the pillar , Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in . At the end of the game , they are rescued from the collapsing pillar . In Lightning Returns , Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang , gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead . She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order , a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze . Because of her ability , Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process : not knowing the truth about the ritual , she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions . On the final day , Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn . 
 In Final Fantasy XIII , Vanille was originally going to be the main character , but after the game was shown off with Lightning in the central role , the decision was scrapped . In an interview with Siliconera , Vanille 's English voice actor stated that she found it relatively easy connecting with the character because of the similarities in their basic personalities . Vanille is voiced by Georgia van <unk> in English , and by Yukari Fukui in Japanese . 
 = = = Oerba Yun Fang = = = 
 Oerba Yun Fang ( <unk> ＝ <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> @-@ Yun <unk> ) is a 21 @-@ year old l 'Cie from Oerba on Gran Pulse who wakes from crystal stasis thirteen days prior to the start of Final Fantasy XIII along with Oerba Dia Vanille : this event perpetuates the branding of Serah Farron by the fal 'Cie Anima , which in turn starts off the events of Final Fantasy XIII . After she escapes from Anima 's <unk> with Vanille , Fang begins serving as Cid Raines 's subordinate in the Cavalry . She eventually meets Snow and becomes his partner as part of Cid 's plan to overthrow the Sanctum . She later befriends Lightning . After rescuing Sazh and Vanille on board the Palamecia , she and Vanille reunite . Later , after being told about their focus and resolving to fulfill it even if she has to fight her friends , Fang has to fight and tame the Eidolon Bahamut . On Gran Pulse , despite Vanille 's protests , Fang reveals that she was responsible for scarring Cocoon 's shell centuries earlier and bringing deadly recriminations on the population of Gran Pulse . 
 When they face Orphan , despite the party 's pleas for Fang to not transform into Ragnarok , Fang eventually transforms into an incomplete version and fights the fal 'Cie alone , but gets tortured as a result of her failure , only to be saved by Lightning 's group . After Orphan 's destruction , Fang and Vanille complete their Focus by becoming Ragnarok to save Cocoon from crashing into Gran Pulse . In Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , Fang and Vanille appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in , and at the end they are rescued from Cocoon 's pillar when it finally collapse . By the events of Lightning Returns , after awakening and seeing Vanille being used by the Order , Fang has taken up residence in the Dead Dunes and becomes the leader of a bandit group bent on thwarting the Order from obtaining a relic within the desert . She attempts to destroy the relic so Vanille can be saved from being killed by the ritual . Fang appears on the final day , helping Lightning dissuade Vanille from going through with the ritual and helps her guide the souls of the dead to the new world . 
 Fang was originally scripted to be a male character during the early stages of Final Fantasy XIII 's development , but early in the writing stage , was rewritten as a female character . Along with this , the sex appeal that was originally going to be part of Lightning 's look was transferred to Fang to give Lightning a more hard @-@ edged persona . Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English , and <unk> <unk> in Japanese . 
 = = = Noel Kreiss = = = 
 Noel Kreiss ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is the 18 @-@ year @-@ old male protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 . One of the last remaining humans in a devastated future , Noel is a friend and student of Caius Ballad before the two grew apart due to the latter 's wish to destroy time . After the incarnation of Yeul in his time dies , Noel sets out to find Valhalla , intending to change Yeul 's fate . On the point of death , he is brought to Valhalla , where he sees Lightning and Caius in battle . Lightning gives Noel the task of finding Serah and bringing to her to Valhalla . Traveling to Serah 's time , Noel sets out with her to find Lightning , repair the timeline and change his future at any cost , even erasing himself from existence . Upon meeting Snow , Noel develops a hatred of him because of the former 's impulsive attitude . Eventually , Noel gains respect for Snow . As they travel , his memories are restored , and he tries to dissuade Serah from continuing , as her visions of the future would soon kill her . When she decides to go on , he comes too after seeing an image of him and the Yeul of his time meeting again . Though he and Serah finally defeat Caius in Valhalla , Noel is forced into a situation that ends with Caius 's death . Soon after returning , to 500 AF , forced to watch Serah die , Noel realizes too late that his actions have triggered the apocalypse Caius wished for . 
 By the events of Lightning Returns , forced to protect the people as the " Shadow Hunter " after the Order of Salvation take over Luxerion , Noel becomes obsessed with a fabricated prophecy that if he kills Bhunivelze 's savior , he will bring about a new world where he can live in peace with Yeul . Ultimately , he has become burdened by guilt because of his actions in causing the world to fall into its current state . Noel 's belief in the prophecy is reinforced when Lightning appears as the savior . They briefly ally to rout an extremist sect of the Children of Etro , who have been killing women who resemble Lightning . They later fight at Noel 's hideout . Lightning provokes Noel into fully expressing his rage and engaging him in battle . After the battle , Noel destroys the oracle drive playing the fabricated prophecy , finally freeing himself from his guilt . After Bhunivelze 's defeat , Noel offers his life to give Yeul a chance to live in the new world , and Caius allows the final incarnation of Yeul to go with him . 
 Noel was designed by Tetsuya Nomura , who did the face , and Yusuke Naora , who designed the rest of the body and clothes . When designing his clothes , Naora took into account he was a hunter , while his swords were based on a Final Fantasy III illustration by Yoshitaka Amano . Noel 's weapon , which changes from two swords into a javelin , was designed so that the character could have both short and long @-@ range attacks . In an interview , Toriyama said that Noel was intended to be a grave young man burdened by a heavy responsibility , but also , because of his upbringing on Gran Pulse , with a naivety about the world Serah and Lightning are used to , and certainly about Cocoon . Yoshinori Kitase , in an interview with Impress Watch , described Noel as one of the Final Fantasy series ' few " orthodox " protagonists . Noel is voiced by Jason Marsden in English and by Daisuke <unk> in Japanese .

Eventually , they meet up with the party before they enter Orphan 's cradle . The group reappears in Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , living in the town of New Bodhum and acting as its neighborhood watch . Due to not traveling through time , the members of NORA are dead by the events of Lightning Returns . In the supplementary novel Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence : tracer of memories , it is revealed that all the members were reincarnated in the new world . 
 Gadot , Lebreau , and Maqui were designed by Nao Ikeda , who based their clothing on the athletic clothing styles of basketball , beach volleyball , and snowboarding , respectively . Gadot , Lebreau , Maqui and <unk> are respectively voiced by Zack Hanks , <unk> McAfee , Daniel Samonas and Jeff Fischer in English , and by <unk> Satō , Yū <unk> , Makoto <unk> and Wataru Hatano in Japanese .

 Galenth Dysley ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is the Primarch ( ruler ) of the Sanctum government in Cocoon and serves as the main antagonist of Final Fantasy XIII . His true form is Barthandelus ( known as <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) in the Japanese version ) , lord of the Cocoon fal 'Cie created by the fal 'Cie deity Lindzei . Dysley 's ultimate goal is summon back the Maker , a term for a creator god associated with Bhunivelze who created Lindzei , back into their world . This plan involved using the l 'Cie @-@ forged beast Ragnarok to destroy Cocoon with the countless deaths from the crash to cause Etro 's Gate to manifest in the physical world . He even goes so far as to use anti @-@ Pulse propaganda to instil fear in the citizens of Cocoon . The first attempt , the War of Transgression , fails through the intervention of Etro . In the battle of Cocoon at the end of the game , Dysley manipulates Cid to cause a coup d 'état in Cocoon . When confronted by the team in Orphan 's Cradle , Dysley plays on their emotions with illusions of Serah and Dajh before being mortally wounded by the party as Barthandelus . His body is then assimilated into Orphan and he ceases to be an independent entity . Dysley is voiced by S. Scott Bullock in English and Masaru Shinozuka in Japanese .

 Orphan ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a wheel @-@ like , sun @-@ elemental fal 'Cie who serves as the chief power source of Cocoon , kept within Eden . Both Orphan and the Cocoon fal 'Cie had been planning its demise in order to reunite with their creator in the aftermath of the resulting mass genocide of every human in Cocoon . After Orphan assimilates the dying Barthandelus , it fights the party , and seemingly transforms the Cocoon @-@ based members into Cie 'th .

However , this gift soon turns into a curse , as seeing <unk> die repeatedly makes him hateful towards Etro , attempting to condition Noel to be his killer before deciding to enter Valhalla and kill the goddess personally .

 The characters of Final Fantasy XIII have received mixed and positive opinions from reviewers . Ben <unk> of PSX Extreme said that the voice acting for the characters are " interesting " and that the cast was " a competent one , even if some characters can begin to chafe after a while . " He also said that the player " might grow tired of Lightning ’ s gruffness and Vanille ’ s bounciness in the early goings but they begin to show new emotions as [ the player ] progress [ es ] . " 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish applauded the characters as " the best @-@ defined group of protagonists the series has ever seen " and also praised them for their development in the story . Parish also commented that the characters " worked through their differences and demons and feel like comrades " during the story 's development . IGN editor Ryan Clements drew a favorable comparison to the characters of Final Fantasy VI and enjoyed the characters ' multi @-@ story approach and the flashbacks in the storyline . Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer said the characters were " fantastic " and also praised the voice acting . However , den Ouden said that in the introduction to the game , the characters " lacked any kind of development for the first few hours [ of the game ] , and the result is a confusing plotline with uninteresting characters that leaves a terrible first impression " . 
 The characters introduced in XIII @-@ 2 received a mixed reception , with some praising their inclusion and others saying they were too weak . Ryan Clements felt that the characters seemed to have no clear focus , with the only driving force being the quest for Lightning . VanOrd thought the characters were good , but said that the game focused too much on Serah and Noel , rather than the more engaging characters of Lightning and Caius . Dale North of Destructoid was the most positive , finding the characters very well fleshed out , understandable and well @-@ voiced by the <unk> den Ouden thought that the characters alright and well voiced , but " [ fell ] flat when the actors [ had ] awkward dialogue to work with " . Juba was extremely critical of the characters and their story , seeing the company taking the " weakest " characters and placing them center stage , while the " best " characters , such as Lighting and Fang , were relegated to the background . Parish was disappointed in the character 's development , saying that Serah was never given any true power within the game 's narrative , and that Noel was under @-@ developed beyond his original premise , with the " stronger " characters from the original game being a noticeable loss . On top of this , he disliked how the two " least liked " characters from XIII ( Serah and Hope ) were given such large roles . Parkin was especially critical , saying the characters were " irritating or forgettable , full of fuzzy or weak motivations and stuffed with tortuous , posturing dialogue " . Despite this , he said that Serah 's warmth endowed the game with a comforting atmosphere . 
 The characters ' resolutions in Lightning Returns received much criticism . Marty Silva of IGN found the writing for the characters uninteresting , and that the game had " forgotten why we ever liked these characters in the first place . " VanOrd stated that every character was " defined by the most basic of traits , all of which serve the needs of the plot , rather than the plot flowing from the needs of the characters . " He also felt that their dialogue was overly frequent and poorly written . GamesRadar 's Ryan Taljonick found Lightning off @-@ putting , and saw the inclusion of the other characters as " more like a ham @-@ fisted attempt at fan @-@ service than a critical plot element . " Kotaku 's Mike Fahey was also unimpressed both with Lightning and how the other characters had stayed very much the same between XIII @-@ 2 and Lightning Returns , with them needing Lightning to move on . Dave Riley of Anime News Network found that the characters had improved slightly over their previous appearances , saying " Dropping the pretense of stoic seriousness transmutes some of the sub @-@ series 's most insufferable elements into something marginally more tolerable , especially as it regards its main character .

 = = Biography = = 
 Santiago was born in Caracas , Venezuela , and was raised in Richmond , Virginia . She played video games from a young age , cooperatively playing them with her younger brother ; one of her earliest games was Sleuth , which she describes as " simple , but so effective and so evocative " in instilling emotion in the player . Her father , a software engineer , had a computer in the house from when she was young , and encouraged Santiago to experiment with it . She moved to New York City at the age of 18 to attend the Tisch School of the Arts of New York University , where she was involved in amateur theater . She focused in theater on developing new works , rather than adapting older ones , and was especially drawn towards incorporating interactive digital media into her works . She ascribes this to her father 's work in software engineering and her experiments with computers , which drove her into using them in her performances as she had more experience than the others in her group . 
 She moved to Los Angeles in 2003 when she was 24 , and studied towards a master 's degree in the Interactive Media Program of the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California . Her intention was to remain in theater , but in her second semester took a class taught by Tracy Fullerton on the history of game design , which inspired her to focus her studies on video game design instead . The class caused her to realize " how much hadn 't been done " in the realm of communication and expression in video games and the lack of established structure and rules as to how it was best to make games , which appealed to the part of her that was interested in experimental theater . While at school she produced the award @-@ winning game Cloud , developed by Jenova Chen and a student team , and also worked on other video games such as Darfur is Dying . 
 Cloud was intended as an experiment by the group to see if they could create a game that " expressed something different than video games had in the past " , as well as determine the level of interest in the gaming community for video games of that nature . The game received over 400 @,@ 000 downloads in the first four months after release , " more than every single person in every single theater [ she ] had ever worked in , " which convinced Santiago to remain in the video game industry indefinitely . The strong response to the game , released in 2005 , inspired her and Chen to consider founding their own company to continue making games like it after they left school — where the design was based on the emotions they wanted to inspire rather than gameplay mechanics . 
 = = = thatgamecompany = = = 
 Upon graduating , Santiago and Chen founded thatgamecompany in May 2006 , with a contract with Sony Computer Entertainment to develop three games for the PlayStation Network . In addition to her role as president of the company , she also initially served as the producer for the studio . Despite her job title title , she was still involved in the design of the games as well . The first game by the studio was Flow , an adaptation of a game that Chen had made for his thesis at USC , which was released in 2007 . The game caused the studio to be noted as a key figure of independent video game development ; in 2008 , Gamasutra recognized the studio as one of the " 20 Breakthrough Developers " of the year , emphasizing Santiago 's key role . The second game for the studio , and the first to be completely original to the company , was Flower , released in 2009 . Both titles were heavily praised by critics and received several awards , as well as garnering high sales . For the studio 's third game , Journey , thatgamecompany hired Robin Hunicke as the producer , allowing Santiago to focus more on directing the company as a whole . Journey was released on March 13 , 2012 ; two weeks later on March 29 , 2012 , Santiago announced her departure from thatgamecompany , not specifying what her plans were for the future . 
 During the development of Journey , in 2009 , Santiago became a TED fellow , giving a talk at a USC conference where she discussed whether video games were art , which was responded to a year later by Roger Ebert . Santiago was one of the backers of the Indie Fund , started in March 2010 , a group which invests in the development of independent video games . In October 2010 , Santiago married Mike Stein , whom she met while they were both at the University of Southern California . In 2011 she was named as one of the top 100 most influential women in technology by Fast Company . 
 In March 2013 , Santiago joined Ouya to lead developer relations . She also joined the Women in Games International advisory board in May 2014 . In 2014 she also became an official adviser for Night Light Interactive . In October 2015 , following the sale and dissolution of the company , Santiago left Ouya for Google Play Games . 
 = = Influences and philosophy = = 
 Santiago described her work at thatgamecompany as creating emotional responses , in order to demonstrate that video games can create a wider range of experiences than are typically shown . She felt that thatgamecompany 's goal during her tenure there was " to create games that push the boundaries of videogames as a communicative medium , and to create games that appeal to a wide variety of people . " Through this she hopes to change the rest of the industry to also approach making videogames as a " creative medium " rather than a product . She , both independently with the Indie Fund and through thatgamecompany has tried to support the independent video game development industry by funding and connecting independent game developers .

 Gordon Stoltski , a third grader who reads the South Park Elementary morning announcements , is shot to death by a jealous husband mistaking him for a 40 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver with a similar name ( Gordon <unk> ) who had an affair with his wife , which the entire school hears due to it being heard over the intercom . During a memorial service at the gymnasium , guidance counselor Mr. Mackey announces the school will seek a replacement . Cartman gets the job after sabotaging the efforts of a talented student named Casey Miller . However , during his first announcement , Cartman is very critical of the school and makes politically charged accusations against student body president Wendy Testaburger . Principal Victoria asks Cartman to stick to the script during announcements , but he accuses her of trying to silence him , and brings in the American Civil Liberties Union to ensure his freedom of speech . Cartman 's announcements are soon broadcast as the politically themed " EC " show on televisions placed in each classroom . On his set 's chalkboard he uses the first letters of keywords that he writes to spell out Wendy 's intent to " kill Smurfs " which concerns Butters and some other students . When they confront Wendy , she simply refuses to acknowledge Cartman . 
 Cartman starts selling copies of his book , What Happened to My School ? , outside the cafeteria where Stan confronts him . Angry because of Cartman 's outrageous sexual lies about Wendy in his book , Stan tries to convince Cartman to stop selling his books to no avail . Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey again confront Cartman , and force him to stop selling his books on school grounds . This upsets Cartman , who accuses them of turning the school into a " socialist <unk> " , and insists he is leaving the school . The next day , however , he appears on his show and spins a portrayal of himself in blue face @-@ paint and suspenders , having somehow found Smurfland , becoming part of Smurf culture and eventually falling in love with Smurfette . Cartman then claims that Wendy bulldozed Smurfland and slaughtered the Smurfs to get their valuable <unk> , the complete story of which he has chronicled in his DVD , " Dances with Smurfs " . Despite the fact that it is extremely obvious that the footage of " Wendy " was Cartman in disguise , Butters and a furious mob of students go to Wendy 's house to confront her . Butters pees on her front door and demands that she go on Cartman 's morning announcements show to answer his questions . 
 On the " EC " set the next morning a reluctant Wendy joins a gray side @-@ burned Cartman who promises he will stick to school @-@ related questions and go easy on her . However , as soon as filming begins , he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide . To Cartman 's surprise , Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable <unk> , but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot , and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them . She steps down as student body president , turning the title over to Cartman , and announces her own new book Going Rogue on the Smurfs . Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea , particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron , who turned the book into his new film , Avatar . With being the student body president , Cartman can 't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can 't hold both positions at the same time . Cartman , much to his anger , also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power . The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements , which include a student 's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman 's performance as president , causing him to run out the room crying , " I 'm doing the best I can ! "

 " Dances with Smurfs " was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . It first aired on November 11 , 2009 , in the United States on Comedy Central . The episode marked the final appearance of Gordon Stoltski , the third grade student who read the morning announcements for South Park Elementary . The day after " Dances with Smurfs " was originally broadcast , four T @-@ shirts based on the episode were made available at South Park Studios , the official South Park website . All four featured Cartman wearing a suit and tie , saying a quote from the episode . These included " I 'm not some dog on a leash " , " We 're in the poop box , my friends " , " I 'm a normal kid ... I just ask questions " , and " I ask questions " .

 " Dances with Smurfs " served as a parody and social commentary of the political commentary style of Glenn Beck , a nationally syndicated radio show host and former Fox News Channel political pundit . Cartman makes outrageous claims with no basis for fact under the guise that he is simply asking rhetorical questions and seeking further discussion . Beck has been criticized for utilizing a similar style of commentary in his radio and television shows . 
 Cartman 's televised morning announcements are patterned after the Glenn Beck television program , using the same types of music and imagery , as well as a logo with the initials " EC " that closely resemble the logo of Beck 's show , which use the initials " GB " . Cartman also writes comments about Wendy on a blackboard , which is a prop often used by Beck on his television program . The day after " Dances with Smurfs " originally aired , Beck himself discussed the episode on his radio program . Beck said he had not watched the episode himself but took the parody as a compliment , and that he particularly enjoyed Cartman 's hair , which was combed in a style similar to Beck . Steve " Stu " <unk> , the executive producer of Beck 's radio show , also complimented the episode , and said of Parker and Stone , " These guys skewer everybody and they are always very good at it . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Dances with Smurfs " satirized Avatar , the 2009 science @-@ fiction epic film directed by James Cameron , which tells the story of humans in the distant future mining for minerals on an alien planet inhabited by blue natives . Although Avatar had not yet been released in theaters by the time the episode aired , the script of " Dances with Smurfs " compares the plot of Avatar to that of Dances with Wolves , a 1990 drama epic film in which a United States soldier becomes integrated with a tribe of Native Americans . At the end of " Dances with Smurfs " , Cartman watches Avatar at a movie theater and grows angry that his idea was stolen , expressing the idea that Avatar borrows from other previous films . Avatar had already been compared to Dances with Wolves prior to the broadcast of " Dances with Smurfs " , and James Cameron said he welcomed the comparison . Cartman 's movie prominently features the Smurfs , a fictional group of small blue cartoon creatures , which draws a further parallel to the blue alien creatures in Avatar . The use of the cartoon Smurfs has also been interpreted as a joke that although Avatar had a famously large budget of hundreds of millions of dollars , the film amounted to little more than a Smurfs @-@ like cartoon . On the commentary Trey Parker and Matt Stone described the Na 'vi who are natives of Pandora in Avatar as " ten foot tall sexy Smurfs " . 
 When Wendy resigns as student body president , she announces the publication of her book , Going Rogue on the Smurfs . This is a reference to Going Rogue : An American Life , the 2009 autobiography of former United States Vice President candidate Sarah Palin , who had recently announced her resignation as Governor of Alaska . 
 Casey Miller , the student who competes against Cartman for the morning announcements , heavily resembles and speaks in a manner similar to radio personality Casey Kasem . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast on November 11 , 2009 , " Dances with Smurfs " was watched by 1 @.@ 47 million overall households among viewers aged between 18 and 34 , according to Nielsen ratings . It ranked behind a special 90 @-@ minute episode of Sons of Anarchy , the FX series about an outlaw motorcycle club , which was the most watched cable program of the week with 2 @.@ 5 million households among 18 – 49 viewers . 
 The episode received generally positive reviews . Ramsey Isler of IGN said Cartman worked well for a Beck satire , and said , " The real accomplishment of this episode is how it totally roasted a semi @-@ political figure , without being political at all . " However , Isler said the script loses focus with the appearance of the Smurfs , and that Gordon 's death was disturbing and inappropriate in the light of recent school shootings in the United States . The A.V. Club writer Sean O 'Neal , a vocal critic of Beck , said mocking Beck is an easy task , but the episode " handled it with just enough of the show 's usual surrealist bent that it was never wholly predictable " . He praised some of the episode 's unexpected elements , like Cartman 's Smurf film and Wendy 's surprise resignation . Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said " Dances with Smurfs " became " a little strange " starting with Cartman 's Smurf story , but he called the episode " smart , sharp , and poignant " . Delgado said the episode had less " laugh out loud " humor than traditional South Park episodes , in favor of intelligent satire . AOL Television writer Donald Deane called it one of the funniest episodes of the season .

 = Talitha Cumi ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Talitha Cumi " is the twenty @-@ fourth episode and the season finale of the third season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on May 17 , 1996 in the United States . The teleplay was written by series creator Chris Carter , based on a story he developed with lead actor David Duchovny and was directed by R. W. Goodwin . The episode is one of several that explored the series ' overarching mythology . " Talitha Cumi " achieved a Nielsen household rating of 11 @.@ 2 , being watched by 17 @.@ 86 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully search for a man who seems to possess strange powers , who may have information about Mulder 's family and the Syndicate . " Talitha Cumi " is the first part of a two @-@ part episode , initiating the plot that will be finalised in the fourth season premiere , " Herrenvolk " . 
 The basic premise of " Talitha Cumi " , most notably the scene featuring Jeremiah Smith 's interrogation by The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) , was heavily influenced by " The Grand Inquisitor " — a chapter in Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's novel The Brothers Karamazov — on the suggestion of Duchovny . The title of the episode is Aramaic for " arise maiden , " a reference to the healing power of Jeremiah Smith . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At a cafe in Arlington , Virginia , a man draws a gun and shoots three people before he is shot by police snipers outside . An older man revives the gunman and his victims by touching them with the palms of his hands . 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) arrive to investigate . They interview the victims and gunman , finding that the mysterious healer , Jeremiah Smith ( Roy Thinnes ) , disappeared while being interviewed by a detective . Meanwhile , The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) meets with Mulder 's mother Teena ( Rebecca Toolan ) , and the two argue as someone photographs them from a distance . Later , Assistant Director Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) notifies Mulder that Teena has suffered a stroke . At the hospital , Teena writes the word " <unk> " on a notepad , which Mulder takes to mean her stroke is connected to Jeremiah Smith . 
 Mulder finds footage of Smith being interviewed , and sees that someone else appears in Smith 's place when the detective looks away . Meanwhile , Smith is at his place of work at the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) when he is captured by the Smoking Man , and taken to a high @-@ security prison . Mulder heads to his mother 's home and encounters X ( Steven Williams ) , who shows him his photos of Teena and the Smoking Man . Mulder searches the house and realizes that " <unk> " was Teena 's attempt to write " LAMP " . He then finds an alien stiletto weapon inside one of the lamps — the same kind used by the alien bounty hunter in previous episodes . 
 At FBI headquarters , Scully meets a man who appears to be Smith , who has come to turn himself in . During an interview with Scully and Skinner , he claims to have no memory of the shooting or of healing anyone . Meanwhile , the Smoking Man interrogates the real Smith , who has lost faith in the Syndicate 's project . He <unk> into Deep Throat ( Jerry Hardin ) and Bill Mulder ( Peter Donat ) to unnerve his captor . Finally Smith reveals that the Smoking Man is dying of lung cancer . 
 Mulder blames the Smoking Man for his mother 's condition . When he learns about the statement given by " Smith " , Mulder goes to the SSA to bring him in for questioning . " Smith " initially complies but flees into a crowd , shapeshifting into someone else . The impostor — a bounty hunter — arrives at Smith 's cell to kill him , finding it empty . Mulder visits Teena at the hospital , but encounters the Smoking Man . Mulder threatens the Smoking Man with a gun , but he says that Teena met with him about the whereabouts of his sister , Samantha . In the parking garage , Mulder is confronted by X , who demands the alien stiletto . When Mulder refuses to hand it over , the two grapple to a stalemate . 
 Scully finds other identical " Jeremiah Smiths " working at SSA offices across the country . She is later met by Smith , who reveals she had met an imposter . Smith promises more information , and he and Scully meet Mulder at an abandoned site . Mulder wants to take Smith to see his mother , but the bounty hunter arrives seconds later .

 This episode , per David Duchovny 's suggestions , was heavily influenced by " The Grand Inquisitor " , a chapter in Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's novel The Brothers Karamazov . This was particularly evident in the scenes in the prison between The Smoking Man and Jeremiah Smith . In addition , this reference is woven into the story , in Smith healing the shooter and the shooting victims in the episode 's teaser , in the title of the restaurant — " The Brothers K " — and the episode 's title , originally from Mark 5 : 41 , in which Jesus heals the daughter of Jairus and quotes the Aramaic phrase meaning , " Little girl , get up ! " but which also figures in The Brothers Karamazov . These references were originally suggested by David Duchovny for the episodes " Colony " and " End Game " but never made their way into those episodes and were used here . 
 As Carter was writing " Talitha Cumi , " he decided that the episode 's main theme would be loyalty . It was decided that the commitment Mulder felt towards the X @-@ Files would be tested by seeing if he would be willing to sacrifice those he cared about , most notably his mother , Scully , and the quest to find his sister , Samantha . In addition , the Smoking Man 's allegiances are in that he must decide whether or not to heal himself of cancer using the power of Jeremiah Smith . Ultimately , Mulder 's loyalties prove altruistic , whereas the Smoking Man chooses self @-@ interest over The Syndicate 's cause . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Hrothgar Mathews was chosen as the suicidal gunman out of several actors , one of whom had even brought a fake gun to his audition . During his audition , he tried out the test reading several ways , including a style that had a " messianic quality " . Mathews was chosen for the role and told by Chris Carter that , despite his character 's life @-@ changing event , he was " still a lunatic " . 
 Roy Thinnes , who portrayed the alien healer Jeremiah Smith , was suggested to Chris Carter by David Duchovny , after the latter had met and spoken to the Thinnes on an airplane flight . Carter had seen Thinnes ' television work before , and had been a fan of his appearance on the 1967 – 68 television series The Invaders . Early on in pre @-@ production , the writers decided to have Smith morph into various characters that the Smoking Man had , either personally or involuntarily , killed , including Deep Throat , Bill Mulder , and Melissa Scully . Melinda McGraw , who portrayed Melissa Scully during the second season , was unavailable for filming , so her scene was cut . In addition , a photo @-@ double was brought in for Jerry Hardin , who played Deep Throat , because he was unavailable on one of the filming days . Frank Spotnitz later called the prison sequence the scene with " the biggest cast ever . " 
 Gillian Anderson 's stand @-@ in , Bonnie Hay , was cast as the main hospital nurse , marking her fifth appearance as a character in the show . She had previously portrayed a nurse in the earlier third season episode " D.P.O. " and the two @-@ part second season episodes " Colony " and " End Game . " 
 = = = Filming and post @-@ production = = = 
 The fight between Mulder and X was heavily edited by Fox 's broadcast standards department . Despite the fact that most of the action was done by stunt doubles , Steven Williams was injured during the filming of the fight scene . The opening scene with the restaurant shooting was filmed mostly on two handheld cameras , with director R. W. Goodwin using a variety of short shots and rapid cuts to different perspectives . This was done to create a chaotic scene which would contrast with how the character of Thinnes ' character Jeremiah Smith was presented — shots focused on him were filmed using a Steadicam to allow the character to seem " rock steady " . The film used was also <unk> , where the frame rate of the recording is much higher than that which will be played back , slowing down the footage when it is played at a normal frame rate . This gave a slow motion effect to Thinnes ' movements , in order to aid the " Godlike " impression Goodwin wanted . 
 The " Grand Inquisitor " scene between Jeremiah Smith and The Smoking Man involved several instances of morphing from one character to another . The morph involving Smith assuming the guise of Peter Donat 's character Bill Mulder was simply achieved by using static cameras , allowing Thinnes to leave the set and Donat to take his place , with the morphing effect bridging the change in actors . However , Jerry Hardin , who was involved in another morph to his character Deep Throat , was unavailable on the day this was shot , as he was filming for a movie elsewhere . The sections of the morph involving Thinnes were recorded , and the set was reconstructed later when Hardin was available , with the actors matched up based on footage and photography to recreate the same positions , which producer Paul Rabwin has described as " backwards " and " very difficult " .

 " Talitha Cumi " premiered on the Fox network on May 17 , 1996 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on September 3 , 1997 .

 In an overview of the third season in Entertainment Weekly , " Talitha Cumi " was rated an " A – " . The review called the episode a " frustratingly provocative cliff @-@ hanger " , calling the interrogation scene of Jeremiah Smith " a tour de force " . Chris Carter has also noted that the interrogation ' is really a summation of my feelings about science ... that it has definitely usurped religion and can explain everything now " . Writing for The A.V. Club , Zack Handlen rated the episode an " A " , praising its cliffhanger ending and " good storytelling " . Handlen felt that the episode dealt with themes familiar to the series , but in a manner which did not appear repetitive ; and again noted Jeremiah Smith 's confrontation with The Smoking Man as a highlight .

" Since 2009 , Matar had been working with the Project on Middle East Democracy ( POMED ) . 
 In October 2010 , Matar was successfully nominated by Al Wefaq to the parliamentary election , becoming the youngest Member of Parliament .

 Beginning in February 2011 , Bahrain saw sustained pro @-@ democracy protests , centered at the Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama , as part of the wider Arab Spring . Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February ( later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday ) , which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured . In March , martial law was declared and Saudi troops were called in . Despite the hard crackdown and official ban , the protests continued .

 Matar was among protesters in the Pearl Roundabout ; he also took part in a number of other protests and encouraged youth to do so . In February , He and 17 other Al Wefaq MPs ( the largest bloc ) submitted their resignations in protest against the government crackdown on anti @-@ government demonstrations . He was involved in organizing talks with the government . Matar was outspoken against the government 's human rights violations , giving interviews to human rights organisations and foreign media including one on 26 April with AJE on the arrest of several health workers and another on 1 May with BBC in which he called for " establishment of a secular democracy in Bahrain " . He also gave interviews to Reuters and France 24 . 
 On 28 April , a TV programme with footage of a defendant charged with " murdering two security officers " was aired on the state @-@ controlled Bahrain TV . The programme was one of a series of confessions from prisoners aired by the channel . The defendant , called Ali Saqer said Matar had instructed him to kill policemen . Saqer had died from torture earlier in April while in detention ( the footage was aired more than two weeks after Saqer 's death ) . Following the airing of the programme , Matar said he was worried that " they [ the government ] are preparing something for me " . Due to his actions during the uprising , Matar became a " government target " .

 On 2 May , following a car chase , Matar was arrested by plain @-@ clothed and masked security forces while he was accompanied by his wife , his family said . AJE reported that Matar was forced at gunpoint to enter an unmarked car . His wife Amal said in an interview with AJE : " We were chased in the street by masked men in plain clothes with machine guns . They cornered us in the street and take [ sic ] him out of the car in front of my eyes with the guns pointed at his head . " 
 Subsequently , Matar was taken to an unknown location . According to " media sources and human rights organizations " , he was kept in solitary confinement until 12 June , with a family visit allowed ten days later . During the visit , Matar said he had not been mistreated , but a human rights activist , Nabeel Rajab said he was beaten afterwards . A witness said he had overheard the screams and beatings of Matar on 10 May while he was being held for interrogation at a military barrack in Riffa . The witness added that he had heard guards call Matar 's name and saw him " handcuffed and with blood on his clothes " . Following his release , Matar said he had been subjected to torture and filed a complaint regarding it . In a testimony to Amnesty International , he said : 
 I was ill @-@ treated by the security forces in Bahrain and held in solitary confinement for 45 days . I was interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department while blindfolded and handcuffed and threatened to be treated like an animal if I did not co @-@ operate . For several days I was deprived of sleep and forced to stand up for prolonged hours . I was brought before the military prosecutor without the presence of a lawyer and only allowed to contact the outside world for the first time three weeks after my arrest , but I wasn 't allowed to tell them where I was being held . 
 The government of Bahrain denied that Matar had been kept in solitary confinement . They said the " information concerning the disappearance of Mr. Matar following his arrest is not correct " and that they had followed international human rights standards . They added that Matar was allowed to contact his family and lawyer , and that his " legal safeguards were ensured " according to local law . They also noted that Matar had lost his parliamentary immunity following the acceptance of his resignation on 29 March . They however did not address the allegations of mistreatment nor did they provide other information requested by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights such as the results of investigation and medical examinations . Also , <unk> <unk> , the president of the Committee on human rights of parliamentarians of the Inter @-@ Parliamentary Union insisted that Matar had been a parliamentarian " at the time of the demonstrations and of [ his ] arrest .

 On 12 June , Matar was put before a military court called the National Safety Court . He and Jawad Fairooz , another resigned MP of Al Wefaq who was also detained on 2 May were charged with " public incitement for regime change and deliberately spreading biased rumors , in addition to taking part in public gatherings , " the state @-@ run Bahrain News Agency reported . Matar denied charges against him . His second session before court was on 21 June , but he was not brought to court . Against the wishes of his lawyer , the judge refused to adjourn Matar 's trial saying it was a minor case that did not warrant his attendance . The third session was due on 5 July . Matar and Fairooz were released on 7 August , however their cases remained open . On 20 February 2012 , Matar was acquitted of all charges by the minor criminal court . Later in the month , his travel ban was lifted and he was allowed to travel to Washington , D.C. for POMED annual awards reception .

 Matar said he though the purpose of the arrest was to pressure Al Wefaq . Analysts speculated that the release was " an attempt at defusing tensions in the country " . The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over the alleged mistreatment of Matar , alleged absence of access to lawyer and guarantees for a fair trial . The Inter @-@ Parliamentary Union expressed concern that by October 2012 , authorities had not started prosecuting those behind the alleged mistreatment of Matar and Fairooz . 
 Amnesty International expressed its concern on the arrest of Matar and Fairooz and asked authorities to protect them from ill @-@ treatment . The UK @-@ based NGO welcomed their release saying it was overdue . Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) expressed its concern on the two former MPs .

 Practical nurse Sharona Fleming ( Bitty Schram ) leaves to fly to New Jersey to visit her aunt . Her client and detective Adrian Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) is forced to go with her , as he fears not being able to live without Sharona . While at San Francisco International Airport , a woman named Barbara Chabrol ( Jennifer Dale ) stands on her toes to kiss her husband Stefan ( Carl <unk> ) . 
 Aboard the plane , an annoying extension cord salesman named Warren Beach ( Garry Marshall ) does little to assuage Monk 's fears . Monk quickly becomes suspicious of Stefan Chabrol after he notices that Barbara no longer needs to stand on her toes to kiss him , has " forgotten " that she ordered the vegetarian meal , knows nothing about air travel despite a frequent @-@ flyer lapel , and claims to have " forgotten how to " speak French when an old family friend , Bernard , meets them on board . More digging convinces Monk he is on to something . Monk quickly annoys everyone and a fellow passenger informs Stefan of Monk 's suspicions . 
 Meanwhile , Bernard appears dead , probably because of a heart attack but Monk cannot guarantee it . He steals Bernard 's cup and , with a lighter borrowed from Beach , proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom . However , the flight attendant , Leigh Harrison ( Brooke Adams ) , is alerted to Monk 's use of a lighter on board , and confiscates both the lighter and the glass , dumping the liquid down the sink . 
 Monk calls Lieutenant Disher and explains what he thinks happened . Stefan and his mistress murdered Barbara and the mistress disguised herself as Barbara . Stefan , being a pilot , then used his valid identification card and its virtually unlimited access to hide the body at a construction site at the airport . The construction workers poured concrete over the corpse , unwittingly destroying the evidence . 
 When Monk and Sharona 's flight lands at Newark Liberty International Airport , Monk stalls Stefan 's connecting flight to Paris by wittingly saying that the captain of the Paris flight is drunk . This allows Disher and the construction crew to excavate and find the body . The Newark Police Department shows up , and Stefan and his mistress are led away in handcuffs .

 " Mr. Monk and the Airplane " was written by David M. Stern and directed by Rob Thompson . Both were credited for the second time in the series , as Stern previously worked on " Mr. Monk and the Other Woman " and Thompson on " Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale " . There were various discussions between series creator Andy Breckman and writer Tom Scharpling with USA Network 's producers over the setting for the episode . The network required to have only half of the scenes on the plane , but the writing staff wanted it to be completely set on the plane . There was also discussion over the repetition of a " Pete and Repeat " joke ; ultimately , USA 's executives " were crying from laughing so hard " and agreed to include the scene . 
 Tim Daly guest stars as himself ; he and Tony Shalhoub were in the NBC TV show Wings . To further explore the in @-@ joke of his casting , Monk 's comment about Wings — " Never saw it . Was it good ? " — was added . Another guest star , Garry Marshall himself created Warren Beach 's trademark line — " If it doesn 't reach , call Warren Beach " — as he was allowed to improvise ; Breckman further stated , " He was improvising all the way " . Marshall appeared in the episode after talking to Monk 's producer David Hoberman that it was his wife favorite show . Brooke Adams , the real @-@ life wife of Shalhoub , also stars in this episode as the flight attendant Leigh . Breckman appears as the passenger who enters the plane just ahead of Monk and Sharona , just as his credit as executive producer appears on screen .

 Lawrence Berry Washington was born on November 26 , 1811 , at " Cedar Lawn " plantation near Charles Town in Jefferson County , Virginia ( present @-@ day West Virginia ) and was the eldest son of John Thornton Augustine Washington and his wife Elizabeth Conrad Bedinger Washington .

Washington was raised in a large family at Cedar Lawn , where he had four brothers and eight sisters : 
 Because of his large number of siblings , Washington 's inheritance from his father in 1841 was not sizable , and he and his brothers pursued a number of business opportunities to build their personal wealth . Washington studied jurisprudence , and was operating a law practice in Charles Town by November 1844 . He advertised himself in the Spirit of Jefferson newspaper as an agent for landowners in the Virginia Military District in Ohio and offered his services for the legal defense and tax payments for those lands . By August 1845 , he and his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington were engaged in a real estate venture , selling lots of 640 acres ( 2 @.@ 6 km2 ) along the Kanawha River in Mason County .

 In July 1847 , the Charlestown Free Press in Charles Town published a letter from Washington in which he praised then General Zachary Taylor as a potential Whig candidate for President . Washington remarked that Taylor was " a firm and true Whig " and that when he looked at Taylor , he remarked to himself " there is the President of the United States that is to be . "
