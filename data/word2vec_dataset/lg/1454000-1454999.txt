 = Mr. Tambourine Man = 
 " Mr. Tambourine Man " is a song written , composed , and performed by Bob Dylan , who released his original version of it on his 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home . The Byrds also recorded a version of the song that they released in the same year as their first single on Columbia Records , reaching number 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart , as well as being the title track of their first album , Mr. Tambourine Man . The Byrds ' recording of the song was influential in initiating the musical subgenre of folk rock , leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single 's success . 
 This song has been performed and recorded by many artists , including Judy Collins , Odetta , Melanie , and William Shatner . The song 's popularity led to Dylan recording it live many times , and it has been included in multiple Dylan and Byrds compilation albums . It has been translated into other languages , and has been used or referenced in television shows , films and books . 
 The song has a bright , expansive melody and has become famous in particular for its surrealistic imagery , influenced by artists as diverse as French poet Arthur Rimbaud and Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini . The lyrics call on the title character to play a song and the narrator will follow . Interpretations of the lyrics have included a paean to drugs such as LSD , a call to the singer 's muse , a reflection of the audience 's demands on the singer , and religious interpretations . Dylan 's song has four verses , of which The Byrds only used the second for their recording . Dylan 's and The Byrds ' versions have appeared on various lists ranking the greatest songs of all time , including an appearance by both on Rolling Stone 's list of the 500 best songs ever . Both versions also received Grammy Hall of Fame Awards . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Mr. Tambourine Man " was written and composed in early 1964 , at the same approximate time as " Chimes of Freedom , " which Dylan recorded later that spring for his album Another Side of Bob Dylan . Dylan began writing and composing " Mr. Tambourine Man " in February 1964 , after attending Mardi Gras in New Orleans during a cross @-@ country road trip with several friends , and completed it sometime between the middle of March and late April of that year after he had returned to New York . Nigel Williamson has suggested in The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan that the influence of Mardi Gras can be heard in the swirling and fanciful imagery of the song 's lyrics . Journalist Al Aronowitz has claimed that Dylan completed the song at his home , but folk singer Judy Collins , who later recorded the song , has stated that Dylan completed the song at her home . Dylan premiered the song the following month at a May 17 concert at London 's Royal Festival Hall . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Dylan first recorded " Mr. Tambourine Man " a few weeks later , on June 9 , with Tom Wilson producing , during the Another Side of Bob Dylan session . The take , recorded with Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , was cut from the album because Dylan felt the song was special and their performance did not do it justice . Sometime that month he also recorded a publisher demo of the song at Witmark Music . More than six months passed before Dylan re @-@ recorded the song , again with Wilson in the producer 's chair , during the final Bringing It All Back Home session on January 15 , 1965 , the same day that " Gates of Eden , " " It 's Alright , Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) , " and " It 's All Over Now , Baby Blue " were recorded . It was long thought that the four songs were each recorded in one long take . However , in the biography Bob Dylan : Behind the Shades , Clinton Heylin relates that the song required six attempts , possibly because of difficulties in working out the playoffs between Dylan 's acoustic guitar and Bruce Langhorne 's electric lead . The final take was selected for the album , which was released on March 22 , 1965 . 
 In his book Keys to the Rain : The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia , Oliver Trager describes " Mr. Tambourine Man " as having a bright , expansive melody , with Langhorne 's electric guitar accompaniment , which provides a <unk> to the vocals , being the only instrumentation besides Dylan 's acoustic guitar and harmonica . Author Wilfred Mellers has noted that although the song is in the key of D major , it is harmonized as if it were in a Lydian G major , giving the song a tonal ambiguity that enhances the dreamy quality of the melody . Unusually , rather than beginning with the first verse , the song begins with an iteration of the chorus : 
 Hey ! Mr. Tambourine Man , play a song for me , 
 I 'm not sleepy and there is no place I 'm going to . 
 Hey ! Mr. Tambourine Man , play a song for me , 
 In the jingle @-@ jangle morning I 'll come following you . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 William Ruhlmann , writing for the Allmusic website , has suggested the following interpretation of the song 's lyrics : " The time seems to be early morning following a night when the narrator has not slept . Still unable to sleep , though amazed by his weariness , he is available and open to Mr. Tambourine Man 's song , and says he will follow him . In the course of four verses studded with internal rhymes , he expounds on this situation , his meaning often heavily embroidered with imagery , though the desire to be freed by the tambourine man 's song remains clear . " 
 While there has been speculation that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana , particularly with lines such as " take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship " and " the smoke rings of my mind " , Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs . Though he was using marijuana at the time the song was written , Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later . Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer 's spirit or muse , or the singer 's search for transcendence . In particular , biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book Like a Complete Unknown that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration ; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought @-@ after inspiration . Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin . The song may also reference gospel music , with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation . 
 Dylan has cited the influence of Federico Fellini 's movie La <unk> on the song , while other commentators have found echoes of the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud . Author Howard Sounes has identified the lyrics " in the jingle jangle morning I 'll come following you " as having been taken from a Lord Buckley recording . Bruce Langhorne , who performs guitar on the track , has been cited by Dylan as the inspiration for the tambourine man image in the song . Langhorne used to play a giant , four @-@ inch @-@ deep " tambourine " ( actually a Turkish frame drum ) , and had brought the instrument to a previous Dylan recording session .

 The Bringing it All Back Home version of " Mr. Tambourine Man " was included on Bob Dylan 's Greatest Hits in 1967 and several later Dylan compilation albums , including Biograph , Masterpieces , and The Essential Bob Dylan . The two June 1964 recordings , one with Ramblin ' Jack Elliott and the other at Witmark Music , have been released on The Bootleg Series Vol . 7 : No Direction Home and The Bootleg Series Vol . 9 : The Witmark Demos 1962 – 1964 , respectively . Outtakes from the January 15 , 1965 recording session were released on The Bootleg Series Vol . 12 : The Cutting Edge 1965 – 1966 in 2015 . 
 The song has been in Dylan 's live concert repertoire ever since it was written , usually as a solo acoustic song , and live performances have appeared on various concert albums and DVDs . An early performance , recorded during a songs workshop at the Newport Folk Festival on July 24 , 1964 is included in both Murray Lerner 's film The Other Side of the Mirror and the DVD release of Martin Scorsese 's documentary No Direction Home . A live performance at New York 's Philharmonic Hall dating from October 31 , 1964 , appeared on The Bootleg Series Vol . 6 : Bob Dylan Live 1964 , Concert at Philharmonic Hall . During his appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25 , 1965 , after he was heckled by acoustic folk music fans during his electric set , Dylan returned to play acoustic versions of " Mr. Tambourine Man " and " It 's All Over Now , Baby Blue " ; this performance of " Mr. Tambourine Man " is also included in The Other Side of the Mirror . 
 A live version from Dylan 's famous May 17 , 1966 , concert in Manchester , England ( popularly but mistakenly known as the Royal Albert Hall Concert ) is included on The Bootleg Series Vol . 4 : Bob Dylan Live 1966 , The " Royal Albert Hall " Concert . Dylan 's August 31 , 1969 performance of the song at the Isle of Wight Festival appears on Isle of Wight Live , part of the 4 @-@ CD deluxe edition of The Bootleg Series Vol . 10 : Another Self Portrait ( 1969 – 1971 ) . Dylan also played the song as part of his evening set at the August 1 , 1971 , Concert for Bangladesh , a benefit concert organized by George Harrison and Ravi Shankar . That performance is included on The Concert For Bangladesh album , although it was excluded from the film of the concert . Another live version , from the Rolling Thunder Revue tour of 1975 , is on The Bootleg Series Vol . 5 : Bob Dylan Live 1975 , The Rolling Thunder Revue , while an electric band version from 1978 is on Bob Dylan at Budokan .

 " Mr. Tambourine Man " was the debut single by the American band The Byrds and was released on April 12 , 1965 by Columbia Records . The song was also the title track of the band 's debut album , Mr. Tambourine Man , which was released on June 21 , 1965 . The Byrds ' version is abridged and in a different key from Dylan 's original . 
 The single 's success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966 , many acts imitating the band 's hybrid of rock beat , jangly guitar and poetic or socially conscious lyrics . The single , the " first folk rock smash hit " , gave rise to the very term " folk rock " in the U.S music press to describe the band 's sound . 
 This hybrid had its antecedents in the American folk revival of the early 1960s , The Animals 's rock @-@ oriented recording of the folk song " The House of the Rising Sun , " the folk @-@ influences present in the songwriting of The Beatles , and the twelve @-@ string guitar jangle of The Searchers and The Beatles 's George Harrison . However the success of The Byrds ' debut created a template for folk rock that proved successful for many acts during the mid @-@ 1960s . 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 Most of the members of The Byrds had a background in folk music , since Jim McGuinn , Gene Clark , and David Crosby had all worked as folk singers during the early 1960s . They had also spent time , independently of each other , in various folk groups , including The New Christy Minstrels , The Limeliters , The Chad Mitchell Trio , and Les Baxter 's Balladeers . In early 1964 , McGuinn , Clark and Crosby formed The Jet Set and started developing a fusion of folk @-@ based lyrics and melodies , with arrangements in the style of The Beatles . In August 1964 , the band 's manager Jim Dickson acquired an acetate disc of " Mr. Tambourine Man " from Dylan 's publisher , featuring a performance by Dylan and Ramblin ' Jack Elliott . Although the band members were initially unimpressed with the song , they eventually agreed to begin rehearsing and demoing it . In an attempt to make it sound more like The Beatles , the band and Dickson elected to give the song a full , electric rock band treatment , effectively creating the musical subgenre of folk rock . To further bolster the group 's confidence in the song , Dickson invited Dylan to hear the band 's rendition . Dylan was impressed , enthusiastically commenting , " Wow , you can dance to that ! " His endorsement erased any lingering doubts the band had about the song . During this period , drummer Michael Clarke and bass player Chris Hillman joined , and the band changed their name to The Byrds over Thanksgiving 1964 . The two surviving demos of " Mr. Tambourine Man " dating from this period feature an incongruous marching band drum part from Clarke but overall the arrangement , which utilized a 4 / 4 time signature instead of Dylan 's 2 / 4 configuration , is very close to the later single version . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 The master take of " Mr. Tambourine Man " was recorded on January 20 , 1965 , at Columbia Studios in Hollywood , prior to the release of Dylan 's own version . The song 's jangling , melodic guitar playing ( performed by McGuinn on a 12 @-@ string Rickenbacker guitar ) was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day . The group 's complex harmony work , as featured on " Mr. Tambourine Man , " became another major characteristic of their sound . Due to producer Terry Melcher 's initial lack of confidence in The Byrds ' musicianship , McGuinn was the only Byrd to play on both " Mr. Tambourine Man " and its B @-@ side , " I Knew I 'd Want You . " Rather than using band members , Melcher hired The Wrecking Crew , a collection of top L.A. session musicians , who ( with McGuinn on guitar ) provided the backing track over which McGuinn , Crosby , and Clark sang . By the time the sessions for their debut album began in March 1965 , however , Melcher was satisfied that the band was competent enough to record its own musical backing . Much of the track 's arrangement and final mixdown was modeled after Brian Wilson 's production work for the Beach Boys ' " Don 't Worry Baby " . 
 The Byrds ' recording of the song opens with a distinctive , Bach @-@ inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then , like Dylan 's version , goes into the song 's chorus . Although Dylan 's version contains four verses , The Byrds only perform the song 's second verse and two repeats of the chorus , followed by a variation on the song 's introduction , which then fades out . The Byrds ' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band 's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964 , at the suggestion of Jim Dickson , in order to accommodate commercial radio stations , which were reluctant to play songs that were over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes long . Thus , while Dylan 's version is five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes long , The Byrds ' runs just short of two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes . The lead vocal on The Byrds ' version of " Mr. Tambourine Man " was sung by McGuinn , who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day , somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan . The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions , as he told The Byrds ' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997 : " I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him , ' Hey , God , take me for a trip and I 'll follow you . ' It was a prayer of submission . " 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 The single reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and number 1 on the UK Singles Chart , making it the first recording of a Dylan song to reach number 1 on any pop music chart . Critic William Ruhlmann has argued that in the wake of " Mr. Tambourine Man " , the influence of The Byrds could be heard in recordings by a number of other Los Angeles @-@ based acts , including The Turtles , The Leaves , Barry McGuire , and Sonny & Cher . In addition , author and music historian Richie Unterberger sees the influence of The Byrds in recordings by The Lovin ' Spoonful , The Mamas & the Papas , Simon & Garfunkel , and Love , while author John Einarson has noted that both The Grass Roots and We Five enjoyed commercial success by emulating The Byrds ' folk rock sound . In addition , a number of commentators , including Richie Unterberger , Scott <unk> , and Ian MacDonald have noted that by late 1965 , The Beatles themselves were assimilating the sound of folk rock , and in particular The Byrds , into the material found on their Rubber Soul album , most notably on the songs " Nowhere Man " and " If I Needed Someone " . 
 As the 1960s came to a close , folk rock changed and evolved away from the jangly template pioneered by The Byrds , but , Unterberger argues , the band 's influence could still be heard in the music of Fairport Convention . Since the 1960s , The Byrds ' jangly , folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music up to the present day , with authors Chris Smith , Johnny Rogan , Mark Deming and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band 's influence on such acts as Big Star , Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers , R.E.M. , The Long Ryders , The Smiths , The Bangles , The Stone Roses , Teenage Fanclub , and The La 's . 
 In addition to appearing on The Byrds ' debut album , " Mr. Tambourine Man " is included on several Byrds ' compilation and live albums , including The Byrds Greatest Hits , Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971 , The Very Best of The Byrds , The Essential Byrds , The Byrds Play Dylan , and the live disc of The Byrds ' ( Untitled ) album . The Byrds ' version of the song also appears on compilation albums that include hit songs by multiple artists . Two earlier demo recordings of " Mr. Tambourine Man " , dating from the World Pacific rehearsal sessions , can be heard on The Byrds ' archival albums Preflyte , In the Beginning , and The Preflyte Sessions .

 = Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides = 
 Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides is a 2011 American fantasy swashbuckler film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series . It is the first film in the series not to be directed by Gore Verbinski , being replaced by Rob Marshall . Jerry Bruckheimer again served as producer . The film serves as a stand @-@ alone sequel to the previous installments . In the film , which draws its plot from the novel On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers , Captain Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) is joined by Angelica ( Penélope Cruz ) in his search for the Fountain of Youth , confronting the infamous pirate Blackbeard ( Ian McShane ) . The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released in the United States on May 20 , 2011 . It was the first film in the series to be released in the Disney Digital 3 @-@ D and IMAX 3D formats . 
 Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio first learned of Powers ' novel during the back @-@ to @-@ back production of Dead Man 's Chest and At World 's End , and considered it a good starting point for a new movie in the series . Pre @-@ production started after the end of the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design . Principal photography rolled for 106 days between June and November 2010 , with locations in Hawaii , the United Kingdom , Puerto Rico , and California . Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film Avatar , and ten companies were involved with the film 's visual effects . Following inflated production costs it is currently noted as the most expensive film ever made . 
 On Stranger Tides broke many box office records upon release , and it stands as the 19th highest @-@ grossing film of all time worldwide when not adjusting for inflation . Critical reviews were mixed , with the film receiving criticism over the script @-@ writing , <unk> , and lack of originality ; positive mentions were given on the acting , directing , action , music , and visuals . A sequel , titled Dead Men Tell No Tales , is scheduled to be released on May 26 , 2017 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate , Joshamee Gibbs in London , Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II . The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy can locate it . Jack 's old nemesis , Captain Hector Barbossa , now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing his leg and ship , the Black Pearl , which he says was sunk , is heading the expedition . 
 Jack refuses the offer and escapes . He meets up with his father , Captain Teague , who warns Jack about the Fountain 's rituals . Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain . The impostor is Angelica , Jack 's former lover , and the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard , who practices voodoo magic and wields the mythical " Sword of Triton " that controls his ship , the Queen Anne 's Revenge . While Jack is shanghaied aboard Blackbeard 's ship , Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack 's map showing the Fountain 's location , forcing Barbossa to take him along . 
 Meanwhile , after a failed mutiny aboard the Queen Anne 's Revenge , Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain . Blackbeard seeks the Fountain 's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a " one @-@ legged man " , who happened to be Barbossa . Jack must find two silver chalices aboard Juan Ponce de León 's missing flagship , the Santiago . The Fountain 's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices . Drinking from one chalice containing a mermaid 's tear will extend life ; the second person dies , their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker . Jack also discovers that the Black Pearl was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard 's collection of other shrunken ships in bottles . 
 The Queen Anne 's Revenge heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears . A mermaid named Syrena is caught , but Philip Swift , a captive missionary , falls in love with her . Reaching Ponce de León 's ship on an uncharted island , Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices . Jack locates the grounded , decaying vessel , only to find Barbossa there . Both claim that the Spanish have taken the chalices , after it was nowhere to be found on the vessel . 
 Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices . Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the Black Pearl , and his leg being amputated . Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices . Meanwhile , Syrena , reciprocating Philip 's love , is tricked into shedding a tear . Blackbeard collects it , leaving her to die while Philip is forced to go with them . Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica 's safety , Jack 's confiscated magical compass , and Gibbs ' release . In return , Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain ; Blackbeard agrees , and Gibbs is set free with the compass . 
 At the Fountain , Blackbeard 's crew are confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight . The Spanish suddenly arrive , intending to destroy the Fountain , believing its power an abomination against God . When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword , Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned . Barbossa obtains Blackbeard 's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne 's Revenge and her crew . Philip is mortally wounded , but he returns to free Syrena . She retrieves the missing chalices and gives them to Jack , telling him not to waste her tear . Syrena goes back to the dying Philip . She says she can save him if he asks her to . When he asks for her forgiveness , she kisses him and takes him underwater . 
 With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death , Jack wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear . Instead , Blackbeard drinks it , asking his daughter to sacrifice herself . Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice . Anticipating that the self @-@ serving Blackbeard would sacrifice his daughter , Jack lied about which chalice contained the tear to save Angelica 's life and Blackbeard 's soul . Angelica 's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard 's body . Although Angelica claimed she loves Jack , he distrusts her intentions and strands her on a cay . Now wielding Blackbeard 's magical sword , Barbossa captains the Queen Anne 's Revenge and returns to piracy . 
 Jack finds Gibbs , who had used the compass to locate the Revenge . He reclaimed the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles , carrying them in a gunny sack . The two leave , hoping to revert the Black Pearl to its original size . 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , a voodoo doll of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by grinning Angelica .

 Shortly before the premiere of At World 's End , Jerry Bruckheimer stated it was the end of the trilogy , but the idea of a spin @-@ off was still possible . After the film 's successful opening weekend , Dick Cook , then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios , said he was interested in a fourth installment . The Los Angeles Times also reported that rights to a book were bought . Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007 , but they were interrupted by the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , and only resumed in mid @-@ 2008 . 
 In June 2009 , Bruckheimer indicated Disney would prefer the fourth installment of Pirates to be released before The Lone Ranger film , which he , Johnny Depp , Ted Elliott , and Terry Rossio had been working on for release on May 20 , 2011 . He hoped Gore Verbinski would return to direct the fourth film , as his BioShock film adaptation had been put on hold . As Verbinski was unavailable due to his commitment with Rango the same year , Bruckheimer suggested Rob Marshall , who he considered a " premiere filmmaker " , stating that " Every film [ Marshall ] made I thought was unique and different . " On July 21 , 2009 , Marshall accepted the job , because of the " whole new story line and set of characters . It felt new , and that was important to me . " Marshall said the film provided him a long @-@ awaited opportunity to work with Depp , and that his directing was helped by past experience as a choreographer — " the action sequences felt like big production numbers . " On September 11 , 2009 , at Disney 's D23 convention during a Disney event , Cook and Johnny Depp , in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume , announced that a fourth Pirates film was in development . The title was announced as Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides . Marshall visited the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland for inspiration , eventually paying homage with a skeleton holding a magnifying glass in Ponce de León 's ship . An appearance of " Old Bill " , the pirate who tries to share his rum with a cat , was also filmed but cut . Pintel and Ragetti were originally supposed to make an appearance , but director Rob Marshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut . 
 Cook resigned in September 2009 after working for Disney for over 38 years . Depp 's faith in Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides was somewhat shaken after the resignation , with Depp explaining that " There 's a fissure , a crack in my enthusiasm at the moment . It was all born in that office " . Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow : " When things went a little sideways on the first Pirates movie and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character , Dick was there from the first moment . He trusted me " .

 During production of Dead Man 's Chest and At World 's End , writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers ' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides , which they considered a good foundation on which to base " a new chapter " in the Pirates series . Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007 . Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book , " but whenever you say those words , Powers ' novel comes to mind . There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored . " However , they denied that it would be a straight version of the novel : " Blackbeard came from the book , and in the book there is a daughter character , too . But Jack Sparrow is not in the book , nor is Barbossa . So I wouldn 't call this an adaptation . " Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film , " kind of a James Bond sort of thing " , instead of the " designed to be a trilogy " structure of the previous installments . They hoped to " design a story that would support new characters , " as characters such as Will Turner would not return . Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to " streamline the story a little bit , make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow " , as the number of characters and subplots in At World 's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length . The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes : mermaids , which are briefly referenced in the book . The mermaids ' role expanded in the script , which included a vast attack sequence . 
 Depp was deeply involved with the story design , frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing , and in the words of Rossio , being " involved in coming up with story lines , connecting characters , creating moments that we would then fashion , shape and then go back . " Among Depp 's suggestions were turning Phillip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists . Afterwards , Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot , and did alterations of their own , including building the female lead .

 Depp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008 , saying that he would come back if the script was good . Almost a year later , Disney announced that Depp would be paid $ 55 @.@ 5 million for his role , realizing that without him the franchise would be " dead and buried . " Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa , and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence . Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg , as he considered the disability made him " angrier , more forceful and resilient as a character " , and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch , particularly during sword fighting scenes . While the production team considered a prop <unk> to be put over Rush 's leg , the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally , with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk . Three other actors from the previous films returned , Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs , Greg Ellis as Lt. Theodore Groves , and Damian O 'Hare as Lt. <unk> . Keith Richards also had a cameo , reprising his role as Captain Teague from At World 's End ; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder . Previous cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley stated that they would not reprise their roles , as they wanted to be involved in different films . They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could . On February 5 , 2010 , Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti , stating , " They haven 't asked me . But actually I don 't mind that at all . I 'm a fan of the first one especially and I think the trilogy we 've made is great . I 'd almost like them to leave it there . " 
 New cast members include Ian McShane , who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film , Blackbeard , and Penélope Cruz , who plays Angelica , Jack Sparrow 's love interest . According to Marshall , McShane was chosen because " he can play something evil but there 's always humor behind it as well " and the actor accepted the job due to both the " very funny and charming " script and the opportunity to work with Marshall . The beard took one hour and a half to get applied , and McShane likened the character 's costume to " a real biker pirate — it 's all black leather . ” Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role , as she fit the description as " an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him , but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way . She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful " , and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine . The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role . During filming , Cruz discovered she was pregnant , leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic , and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes . Depp recommended Stephen Graham , who worked with him in Public Enemies , to play Scrum , a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow , and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II , as Depp was a fan of Griffiths ' work on Withnail and I. Sam Claflin , a recent drama school graduate with television experience , was chosen to play the missionary Philip , and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast . Spanish news website El Pais reported that the film had four Spanish actors : Cruz , Bergès @-@ Frisbey , Óscar <unk> , and Juan Carlos <unk> . <unk> was picked for both his work in The Losers and a recommendation by Cruz . 
 Casting for mermaids required the actresses to have natural breasts — no implants . As Bruckheimer explained to EW , " I don 't think they had breast augmentation in the 1700s , [ ... ] So it 's natural for casting people to say , ' We want real people . ' " Marshall invited Spanish @-@ French actress <unk> Bergès @-@ Frisbey to play Syrena after seeing her in a French magazine article on up @-@ and @-@ coming actresses . Bergès @-@ Frisbey had to take lessons of English , swimming and breath control for the role . The rest of the mermaid portrayers , such as Australian supermodel Gemma Ward , were chosen for having " exotic sense , an otherworldly sensibility , but also under those layers a deadly quality " , according to Marshall , and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began on June 14 , 2010 , in Hawaii . Filming was moved to California in August 2010 , primarily at the Long Beach shore and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot , as the original Hawaiian location on <unk> Cove was plagued with strong tides . After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico , with locations in both Palomino Island and the Fort of San Cristóbal in San Juan , production moved to the United Kingdom in September , where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting . Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London , Knole House in Kent , and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich . Interiors were shot at London 's Pinewood Studios , and a replica of an 18th @-@ century London street was built on the backlot alongside the soundstages . The producers also considered using New Orleans as a location . In October , security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack . 
 After the joint production of Dead Man 's Chest and At World 's End cost over $ 300 million , Disney decided to give a lower budget to the fourth installment . Many costs had to be cut , including moving primary production to Hawaii and London , where tax credits are more favorable , and having a shorter shooting schedule and fewer scenes featuring special effects compared to At World 's End . The tighter schedule — according to Bruckheimer , " We had a 22 @-@ week post , and for a picture like this , with almost 1 @,@ 200 visual effects shots , it 's usually 40 weeks " — meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming . The British financial statements of the film revealed total expenditures of £ 240 @.@ 7 million ( $ 410 @.@ 6 million ) by 2013 , with Disney receiving a rebate of $ 32 @.@ 1 million from the British government , making Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides the most expensive film ever made to date . 
 Bruckheimer said the decision to film in 3D was made due to its being " immersive filmmaking ; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you 're part of the screen . " Bruckheimer described it as the first major " exterior movie " to be shot in 3D , as Avatar was mostly done in sound stages . At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D , but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format . " You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure . " While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post @-@ production , the decision was made to shoot digitally with 3D cameras . Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion . The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar , which were made more compact for extra mobility . This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle . 
 The Queen Anne 's Revenge was built atop the Sunset , the same ship used to depict the Black Pearl in previous installments . On February 2010 , the Sunset was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms , where a big concern was to make it imposing , with three stories , without sacrificing actual seakeeping . Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series , the look for the Queen Anne 's Revenge was ominous , with sails dyed blood red , various elements on fire , and a decoration based on skulls and bones ( drawing inspiration from the <unk> Ossuary in Czech Republic ) . Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that " not only Blackbeard was a dying man , but his ship is also a dying ship " . The ship 's figurehead also drew inspiration from Blackbeard 's pirate flag . The replica ship HMS Surprise was used for Barbossa 's ship , the HMS Providence , and all the scenes aboard the Providence were shot on the Long Beach shore as the Surprise could not be sailed to Hawaii . Over 50 designs were considered for the Fountain of Youth , with the final one representing a temple built by an ancient civilization around the Fountain , which itself was located in a round rocky structure to represent " the circle of life " . The locations leading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of Kauai and Oahu , but the Fountain itself was built at the 007 Stage on Pinewood . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 On Stranger Tides employed 1 @,@ 112 shots of computer @-@ generated imagery , which were done by ten visual effects companies . Cinesite visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley @-@ Clamp claimed that the most difficult part was doing the effects in 3D : " Rotoscoping is tricky . Cleaning up plates is double the work , and tracking has to be spot on . " The lead companies , with over 300 effects each , were Industrial Light & Magic — responsible for , among others , the mermaids and most water effects — and Moving Picture Company , who created digital ships and environment extensions , such as changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls . Filming the mermaids involved eight model @-@ actresses , who portrayed them outside the water , as well as 22 synchronized swimming athletes and a group of stuntwomen , both of whom wore motion capture suits to be later replaced by digital mermaids . Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster models . The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of mermaids in paintings and literature , instead going for a scaly body with a translucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in ballet tutus . To make the mermaids more menacing underwater , the faces of the actresses had some digital touch @-@ ups on the underwater scenes , adding sharper teeth and a shimmery fish scale quality on the skin . ILM also handled Blackbeard 's death , where Ian McShane 's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a " boiling mass of blood and clothing " , and a hurricane @-@ like formation that represented " the waters of the Fountain taking his life " . Cinesite handled the recreation of London and Barbossa 's peg leg , CIS Hollywood did 3D corrections and minor shots , and Method Studios created matte paintings .

 The film 's score was written by Hans Zimmer , who had worked in all of the previous entries in the franchise ; being the main composer for the second and third installments . Zimmer said that he tried to incorporate a rock n ' roll sound , as he felt " pirates were the rock ' n ' rollers of many , many years ago " , and Spanish elements , which led to a collaboration with Mexican guitarists Rodrigo y Gabriela and a tango song written by Penélope Cruz 's brother Eduardo . American composer Eric Whitacre contributed several choir @-@ based cues , as well as regular assistant Geoff <unk> .

 On Stranger Tides has received mixed to negative reviews . Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 33 % based on 255 reviews , with a rating average of 5 @.@ 1 out of 10 . The site 's consensus was " It 's shorter and leaner than the previous sequel , but this Pirates runs aground on a disjointed plot and a non @-@ stop barrage of noisy action sequences . " Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , gives the film a rating score of 45 based on 39 reviews . CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a B + on an A + to F scale . 
 Roger Ebert gave On Stranger Tides two out of four stars , saying that although the removal of Knightley and Bloom as well as the addition of Cruz were positive aspects , the film in general was " too much of a <unk> " for him . Tom Long of The Detroit News gave a D + , saying that Jack Sparrow had " worn out his welcome " . Despite the more linear plot , " the movie is still ridiculous " . He found On Stranger Tides to be " precisely what you 'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride : a whole lot of noise , plenty of stunts and complete silliness . " British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his 5 Live show , saying " it 's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part , because it is just nothing , it is just a big empty nothing , whereas part three I think was an active atrocity , it 's just nothing at all " . 
 As with the previous films , the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing . The Arizona Republic critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five , stating that " the movie is a series of distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story . That never really happens . " Online reviewer James Berardinelli considered the script " little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces " , and USA Today 's Claudia Puig found On Stranger Tides " familiar and predictable , ... often incoherent and crammed with pointless details . " 
 Mike Scott from The Times @-@ Picayune mentions that " while this latest chapter isn 't quite sharp enough to restore the sense of discovery that made that first outing so darn exciting , it 's enough to make up for most of the missteps that made the third one so darn <unk> @-@ inducing . " Writing for The A.V. Club , Tasha Robinson described On Stranger Tides as " a smaller film than past installments , by design and necessity " , and felt that " the series has needed this streamlining " as the film " feels lightweight , but that 's still better than bloated . " 
 On Stranger Tides also had positive reviews ; some critics found the film to be entertaining and well @-@ made . Richard Roeper gave the film a B + , describing it as " the most fun installment since the first " , calling the story " pure cartoon , but a lot easier to follow than the other sequels " , and summing as " the franchise is getting tired , but Penelope energizes it . " Along the same lines , Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars , writing that it " feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first <unk> his buckle , infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of <unk> its sails " . She said that Marshall " swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye @-@ popping escapism " and praised Depp , Cruz , and McShane 's performances . Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall " shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights , and he handles the 3D well " , and welcomed Penélope Cruz 's character , saying she " brings her Oscar @-@ winning vivacity " and had " lively sexual tension " with Depp . Writing for The Globe and Mail , Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from " merely competent to <unk> cluttered " , but he was pleased with the overall result , calling McShane a " fresh villain " whose " stentorian tones are welcome anywhere " . Variety 's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative , but accessible . " It has nary an original idea and still doesn 't make much sense , but it 's lost all pretensions that it should " . He praised Geoffrey Rush , stating that he " not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots , but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp 's stock and trade .

The name of the segment was met with controversy from Christian groups , who called it a " mockery " of Jesus ' crucifixion . According to the American Family Association ( AFA ) , pressure from themselves and NBC 's affiliates , caused NBC to cancel the segment and move the episode 's air date . NBC , however , stated that the " Cruci @-@ fixins " segment was " erroneous information " mistakenly included in the press release and that it was an idea for another episode that had yet to be written . An NBC spokesperson stated : " The reference to ' Cruci @-@ fixins ' will not be in the show and the storyline will not contain a Christian characterization at all . We value our viewers and sincerely regret if this misinformation has offended them . " AFA responded by claiming that the network was " lying " in its claim that the segment had never been a part of the episode . A statement on AFA 's website read : 
 In an attempt to confuse the public , the network issued an intentionally misleading statement that left the impression that AFA had lied to our supporters . When NBC said that the script ' has yet to be written , ' what they didn 't tell you is that the ' story board ' had been completed and the offensive material was scheduled to be a part of the episode . The story board contains the outline of the program . That is the reason for the detailed description of the episode issued by NBC in their initial press release . The bottom line is that the actions taken by AFA online supporters like you caused them to rewrite the episode and remove the offensive segment .

 In its original American broadcast , " Buy , Buy Baby " was watched by approximately 3 @.@ 7 million households , according to Nielsen ratings . The episode achieved an 11 % in the key 18 – 49 demographics among adults . It was the eighth highest @-@ rated show on the NBC network that week . Since airing , the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics . R.D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal said Spears ' appearance on the show was " uninspired " . Lenny Ann Low of The Sydney Morning Herald commented that Spears as a right @-@ wing co @-@ host was a miss . " It proves she can talk and avoid the furniture but her flitting , one @-@ dimensional character feels like a stunt . " In Low 's opinion , the only thing that saved the episode from a " thumbs down " , was " its message about finding the courage to be yourself in a sea of conservatism , saccharine though that sounds . " Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune thought Spears " bombed " in the episode , and Jeff <unk> of Star @-@ News disliked the Southern accent she used in her performance . The Plain Dealer 's Mark Dawidziak commented : " Granted , the episode wasn 't very well written , but Spears seemed more out of place on the show than Megan Mullally 's Karen at a sensitivity seminar . " 
 A Herald Sun reviewer , however , thought she gave the final season of Will & Grace the " send @-@ off it deserved . " Rachel Browne of The Sun Herald said the problem with Spears ' performance is that " it 's impossible to accept her in any role other than her own headline @-@ hugging self . " Browne , however , thought her appearance was " fun to watch " . The Sunday Mail was also positive about Spears ' performance , commenting that she " does well , especially when you remember the dismal Crossroads . " Trent <unk> of Pink is the New Blog said that doing the show was a " great move " for Spears . Television researcher Tim Brooks , the co @-@ author of the 1979 book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows , commented that Spears ' role was a " very good way to get her chops into comedy " , in part because it is " very out of type .

 = Ivo Andrić = 
 Ivo Andrić ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born Ivan Andrić ; 9 October 1892 – 13 March 1975 ) was a Yugoslav novelist , poet and short story writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961 . His writings dealt mainly with life in his native Bosnia under Ottoman rule . 
 Born in Travnik in Austrian @-@ occupied Bosnia , Andrić attended high school in Sarajevo , where he became an active member of several South Slav national youth organizations . Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 , Andrić was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro @-@ Hungarian police , who suspected his involvement in the plot . As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him , he spent much of the war under house arrest , only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917 . After the war , he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz , eventually attaining his Ph.D in Graz in 1924 . He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920 – 23 and again from 1924 – 41 . In 1939 , he became Yugoslavia 's ambassador to Germany , but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German @-@ led invasion of his country . Shortly after the invasion , Andrić returned to German @-@ occupied Belgrade . He lived quietly in a friend 's apartment for the duration of World War II , in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest , and wrote some of his most important works , including Na Drini ćuprija ( The Bridge on the Drina ) . 
 Following the war , Andrić was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia , which had come under communist rule at the war 's end . In 1961 , the Nobel Committee awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature , selecting him over writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien , Robert Frost , John Steinbeck and E.M. Forster . The Committee cited " the epic force with which he ... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country 's history " . Afterwards , Andrić 's works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages . In subsequent years , he received a number of awards in his native country . Andrić 's health declined substantially in late 1974 , and he died in Belgrade the following March . 
 In the years following Andrić 's death , the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour . A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name . In 2012 , filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno @-@ town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andrić . As Yugoslavia 's only Nobel Prize @-@ winning writer , Andrić was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime . In Bosnia and Herzegovina , beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia , his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti @-@ Muslim bias . In Croatia , his works were long shunned for nationalist reasons , and even briefly blacklisted following Yugoslavia 's dissolution , but were rehabilitated by the literary community at the start of the 21st century . He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Ivan Andrić was born in the village of <unk> , near Travnik , on 9 October 1892 while his mother , Katarina ( née Pejić ) , was in the town visiting relatives . Andrić 's parents were both Catholic Croats , and he was their only child . His father , Antun , was a struggling silversmith who resorted to working as a school janitor in Sarajevo , where he lived with his wife and infant son . Antun died of tuberculosis , like most of his siblings , at the age of thirty @-@ two . Andrić was only two years old at the time . 
 Widowed and penniless , Andrić 's mother took him to Višegrad and placed him in the care of her sister @-@ in @-@ law Ana and brother @-@ in @-@ law Ivan <unk> , an Austro @-@ Hungarian police officer . The couple were financially stable but childless , so they agreed to look after the infant and brought him up as their own . In the meantime , Andrić 's mother returned to Sarajevo seeking employment . 
 Andrić was raised in a country that had changed little since the Ottoman period despite being mandated to Austria @-@ Hungary at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 . Eastern and Western culture intermingled in Bosnia to a far greater extent than anywhere else in the Balkan peninsula . Having lived there from an early age , he came to cherish Višegrad , calling it " my real home " . Though it was a small provincial town ( or <unk> ) , it proved to be an enduring source of inspiration . Višegrad was multi @-@ ethnic and multi @-@ confessional , the predominant groups being Serbs and Bosnian Muslims ( Bosniaks ) . From an early age , Andrić closely observed the customs of the local people . These customs , and the particularities of life in eastern Bosnia , would later be detailed in his works . Andrić made his first friends in Višegrad , playing with them along the Drina River and the town 's famous Mehmed <unk> Sokolović Bridge . 
 = = = Primary and secondary education = = = 
 At age six , Andrić began primary school . He later recounted that these were the happiest days of his life . At the age of ten , he received a three @-@ year scholarship from a Croat cultural group called <unk> ( Progress ) to study in Sarajevo . In the autumn of 1902 , he was registered at the Great Sarajevo Gymnasium ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Velika Sarajevska gimnazija ) , the oldest secondary school in Bosnia . While in Sarajevo , Andrić lived with his mother , who worked in a rug factory . At the time , the city was overflowing with civil servants from all parts of Austria @-@ Hungary , and thus many languages could be heard in its restaurants , cafés and on its streets . Culturally , the city boasted a strong Germanic element , and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect this . From a total of 83 teachers that worked at Andrić 's school over a twenty @-@ year period , only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina . " The teaching program , " biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes , " was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [ Habsburg ] Monarchy . " Andrić disapproved . " All that came ... at secondary school and university , " he wrote , " was rough , crude , automatic , without concern , faith , humanity , warmth or love . " 
 Andrić experienced difficulty in his studies , finding mathematics particularly challenging , and had to repeat the sixth grade . For a time , he lost his scholarship due to poor grades . Hawkesworth attributes Andrić 's initial lack of academic success at least partly to his alienation from most of his teachers . Nonetheless , Andrić excelled in languages , particularly Latin , Greek and German . Although he initially showed substantial interest in natural sciences , he later began focusing on literature , likely under the influence of his two Croat instructors , writer and politician Đuro <unk> and poet <unk> Alaupović . Of all his teachers in Sarajevo , Andrić liked Alaupović best , and the two became lifelong friends . 
 Andrić felt he was destined to become a writer . He began writing in secondary school , but received little encouragement from his mother . He recalled that when he showed her one of his first works , she replied : " Did you write this ? What did you do that for ? " Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila ( Bosnian Fairy ) , which promoted Serbo @-@ Croat unity . At the time , he was still a secondary school student . Prior to World War I his poems , essays , reviews , and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor ( Whirlwind ) , <unk> ( The Contemporary ) , Hrvatski pokret ( The Croatian Movement ) , and <unk> <unk> ( Literary News ) . One of Andrić ’ s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose , and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems . The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić ’ s poetry from this period as " subjective and mostly melancholic " . Andrić ’ s translations of August Strindberg , Walt Whitman , and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time . 
 = = = Student activism = = = 
 In 1908 , Austria @-@ Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina , to the chagrin of South Slav nationalists like Andrić . In late 1911 , Andrić was elected the first president of the Serbo @-@ Croat Progressive Movement ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> @-@ Hrvatska <unk> <unk> ; SHNO ) , a Sarajevo @-@ based secret society that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro @-@ Hungarian occupation . Its members were vehemently criticized by both Serb and Croat nationalists , who dismissed them as " traitors to their nations " . Unfazed , Andrić continued agitating against the Austro @-@ Hungarians . On 28 February 1912 , he spoke before a crowd of 100 student protesters at Sarajevo 's railway station , urging them to continue their demonstrations . The Austro @-@ Hungarian police later began harassing and prosecuting SHNO members . Ten were expelled from their schools or penalized in some other way , though Andrić himself escaped punishment . Andrić also joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia , and became one of its most prominent members . 
 In 1912 , Andrić registered at the University of Zagreb in Croatia @-@ Slavonia , having received a scholarship from an educational foundation in Sarajevo . He enrolled in the department of mathematics and natural sciences because these were the only fields for which scholarships were offered , but was able to take some courses in Croatian literature . Andrić was well received by South Slav nationalists there , and regularly participated in on @-@ campus demonstrations . This led to his being reprimanded by the university . In 1913 , after completing two semesters in Zagreb , Andrić transferred to the University of Vienna , where he resumed his studies . While in Vienna , he joined South Slav students in promoting the cause of Yugoslav unity and worked closely with two Yugoslav student societies , the Serbian cultural society Zora ( Dawn ) and the Croatian student club Zvonimir , which shared his views on " integral <unk> " ( the eventual assimilation of all South Slav cultures into one ) . 
 Despite finding like @-@ minded students in Vienna , the city 's climate took a toll on Andrić 's health . He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill , then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere , though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been taking part in a protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German @-@ speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones . For a time , Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków . He transferred in early 1914 , and continued to publish translations , poems and reviews . 
 = = World War I = = 
 On 28 June 1914 , Andrić learned of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo . The assassin was Gavrilo Princip , a Young Bosnian and close friend of Andrić who had been one of the first to join the SHNO in 1911 . Upon hearing the news , Andrić decided to leave Kraków and return to Bosnia . He travelled by train to Zagreb , and in mid @-@ July , departed for the coastal city of Split with his friend , the poet and fellow South Slav nationalist Vladimir Čerina . Andrić and Čerina spent the rest of July at the latter 's summer home . As the month progressed , the two began feeling increasingly uneasy about the escalating political crisis that followed the Archduke 's assassination and eventually led to the outbreak of World War I. They then went to Rijeka , where Čerina left Andrić without explanation , only saying he urgently needed to go to Italy . Several days later , Andrić learned that Čerina was being sought by the police . 
 By the time war was declared , Andrić had returned to Split feeling exhausted and ill . Given that most of his friends had already been arrested for nationalist activities , he was certain the same fate would befall him . Despite not being involved in the assassination plot , on 4 August , Andrić was arrested for " anti @-@ state activities " and imprisoned in Split . From there , he was transferred to a prison in Šibenik , then to Rijeka and finally to Maribor , where he arrived on 19 August . Plagued by tuberculosis , Andrić passed the time reading , talking to his cellmates and learning languages . 
 By the following year , the case against Andrić was dropped due to lack of evidence , and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915 . The authorities exiled him to the village of <unk> , near Travnik . He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks . Andrić soon befriended the friar <unk> <unk> and began researching the history of Bosnia 's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule . Andrić lived in the parish headquarters , and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles . In return , he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school . Andrić 's mother soon came to see her son , and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest . " Mother is very happy , " Andrić wrote . " It has been three whole years since she saw me . And she can 't grasp all that has happened to me in that time , nor the whole of my crazy , cursed existence . She cries , kisses me and laughs in turn . Like a mother . " 
 Andrić was later transferred to a prison in Zenica , where <unk> regularly visited him . In March 1917 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army declared Andrić a political threat and exempted him from armed military service . He was thus registered with a non @-@ combat unit until February of the following year . On 2 July 1917 , Emperor Charles I declared a general amnesty for all political prisoners on the territory of Austria @-@ Hungary . His freedom of movement restored , Andrić visited Višegrad , where he was reunited with several school friends . He remained in the town until July , when he was mobilized . Due to his poor health , Andrić was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service . He was then transferred to the <unk> in Zenica , where he was treated for several months before moving on to Zagreb . There , Andrić again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital , which had become a gathering ground for many former political prisoners . 
 In January 1918 , Andrić joined several other South Slav nationalist writers in editing a short @-@ lived pan @-@ Yugoslav periodical called <unk> jug ( Literary South ) . Here and in other periodicals , Andrić published book reviews , plays , verse , and translations . Over the course of several months in early 1918 , Andrić 's health began to deteriorate , and his friends believed he was nearing death . However , he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in Krapina writing Ex <unk> , a book of prose poetry which was published that July . It was his first book . 
 = = Interwar period = = 
 The end of World War I saw the disintegration of Austria @-@ Hungary , which was replaced by a newly established South Slav state , the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( renamed Yugoslavia in 1929 ) . In late 1918 , Andrić re @-@ enrolled at the University of Zagreb and resumed his studies . By January 1919 , he fell ill again and was back in the hospital . Fellow writer Ivo Vojnović became worried for his friend 's life and appealed to Andrić 's old schoolteacher <unk> Alaupović ( who had just been appointed the new kingdom 's Minister of Religious Affairs ) to use his connections and help Andrić pay for treatment abroad . In February , Andrić wrote Alaupović and asked for help finding a government job in Belgrade . Eventually , Andrić chose to seek treatment in Split , where he stayed for the following six months . During his time on the Mediterranean coast , Andrić completed a second volume of prose poetry , titled <unk> ( Unrest ) , which was published the following year . By the time Andrić left , he had almost fully recovered , and quipped that he was cured by the " air , sun and figs . " Troubled by news that his uncle was seriously ill , Andrić left Split in August and went to him in Višegrad . He returned to Zagreb two weeks later . 
 = = = Early diplomatic career = = = 
 By 1919 , Andrić had acquired his undergraduate degree in South Slavic history and literature at the University of Zagreb . Yet he was perennially impoverished , and earned a meagre sum through his writing and editorial work . By mid @-@ 1919 , he realized that he would be unable to financially support himself and his aging mother , aunt and uncle for much longer , and his appeals to Alaupović for help securing a government job became more frequent . In September 1919 , Alaupović offered him a secretarial position at the Ministry of Religion , which Andrić accepted . 
 In late October , Andrić left for Belgrade . He became involved in the city 's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade 's most popular young writers . Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him , Andrić disliked being a public figure , and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers . At the same time , he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . On 20 February , Andrić 's request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry 's mission at the Vatican . 
 Andrić left Belgrade soon after , and reported for duty in late February . At this time , he published his first short story , Put <unk> <unk> ( The Journey of Alija <unk> ) . He complained that the consulate was understaffed and that he did not have enough time to write . All evidence suggests he had a strong distaste for the ceremony and pomp that accompanied his work in the diplomatic service , but according to Hawkesworth , he endured it with " dignified good grace " . Around this time , he began writing in the <unk> dialect used in Serbia , and ceased writing in the <unk> dialect used in his native Bosnia . Andrić soon requested another assignment , and in November , he was transferred to Bucharest . Once again , his health deteriorated . Nevertheless , Andrić found his consular duties there did not require much effort , so he focused on writing , contributed articles to a Romanian journal and even had time to visit his family in Bosnia . In 1922 , Andrić requested another reassignment . He was transferred to the consulate in Trieste , where he arrived on 9 December . The city 's damp climate only caused Andrić 's health to deteriorate further , and on his doctor 's advice , he transferred to Graz in January 1923 . He arrived in the city on 23 January , and was appointed vice @-@ consul . Andrić soon enrolled at the University of Graz , resumed his schooling and began working on his doctoral dissertation in Slavic studies . 
 = = = Advancement = = = 
 In August 1923 , Andrić experienced an unexpected setback in his career . A law had been passed stipulating that all civil servants had to have a doctoral degree . As Andrić had not completed his dissertation , he was informed that his employment would be terminated . Andrić 's well @-@ connected friends also intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister Momčilo Ninčić , citing Andrić 's diplomatic and linguistic abilities . In February 1924 , the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andrić as a day worker with the salary of a vice @-@ consul . This gave him the opportunity to complete his Ph.D. On 24 May 1924 , Andrić submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz , who gave it their approval . This allowed Andrić to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D to be confirmed . He passed both his exams , and on 13 July , received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended Andrić 's dissertation be published . Andrić chose the title Die Entwicklung des <unk> Lebens in <unk> unter der <unk> der <unk> <unk> ( The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule ) . In it , he characterized the Ottoman occupation as a yoke that still loomed over Bosnia . " The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative , " he wrote . " The Turks could bring no cultural content or sense of higher mission , even to those South Slavs who accepted Islam . " 
 Several days after receiving his Ph.D , Andrić wrote the Foreign Minister asking to be reinstated and submitted a copy of his dissertation , university documents and a medical certification that deemed him to be in good health . In September , the Foreign Ministry granted his request . Andrić stayed in Graz until 31 October , when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry 's Belgrade headquarters . During the two years he was in Belgrade , Andrić spent much of his time writing . His first collection of short stories was published in 1924 , and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy ( of which he became a full @-@ fledged member in February 1926 ) . In October 1926 , he was assigned to the consulate in Marseille and again appointed vice @-@ consul . On 9 December 1926 , he was transferred to the Yugoslav embassy in Paris . Andrić 's time in France was marked by increasing loneliness and isolation . His uncle had died in 1924 , his mother the following year , and upon arriving in France , he was informed that his aunt had died as well . " Apart from official contacts , " he wrote Alaupović , " I have no company whatever . " Andrić spent much of his time in the Paris archives poring over the reports of the French consulate in Travnik from 1809 – 14 , material he would use in Travnička hronika ( Travnik Chronicle ) , one of his future novels . 
 In April 1928 , Andrić was posted to Madrid as vice @-@ consul . While there , he wrote essays on Simón Bolívar and Francisco Goya , and began work on the novel Prokleta <unk> ( The Damned Yard ) . In June 1929 , he was named secretary of the Yugoslav legation to Belgium and Luxembourg in Brussels . On 1 January 1930 , he was sent to Switzerland as part of Yugoslavia 's permanent delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva , and was named deputy delegate the following year . In 1933 , Andrić returned to Belgrade , and shortly thereafter France decorated him with the Legion of Honour . Two years later , he was named head of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . On 5 November 1937 , Andrić became assistant to Milan Stojadinović , Yugoslavia 's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister . 
 = = World War II = = 
 On 28 March 1939 , Andrić was appointed Yugoslavia 's ambassador to Germany . This appointment , Hawkesworth writes , demonstrates that he was highly regarded by the Yugoslav leadership . In 1934 , Yugoslavia 's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille . He was succeeded by his ten @-@ year @-@ old son Peter , and a regency council led by Peter 's uncle Paul was established to rule in his place until he turned eighteen . Paul 's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany . In March 1941 , Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact , pledging support for Germany and Italy . Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić 's back , in his capacity as ambassador he was obliged to attend the document 's signing in Berlin . Andrić was highly critical of the move , and on 17 March , he wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties . Ten days later , pro @-@ Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age . This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia 's invasion . Given these circumstances , Andrić 's position as ambassador to Germany was an extremely difficult one . Yet , he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to help Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland . 
 Prior to their invasion of his country , the Germans offered Andrić the opportunity to evacuate to neutral Switzerland . He declined on the basis that his staff would not be allowed to go with him . On 6 April 1941 , the Germans and their allies invaded Yugoslavia . The country capitulated on 17 April and was subsequently partitioned between the Axis powers . In early June , Andrić and his staff were taken back to German @-@ occupied Belgrade , where some were jailed . Andrić was retired from the diplomatic service , but refused to receive his pension or cooperate in any way with the puppet government the Germans had installed in Serbia . He was spared jail , but the Germans kept him under close surveillance throughout the occupation . Because of his Croat heritage , they had offered him the chance to settle in Zagreb , then the capital of the fascist puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia , but he declined . Andrić spent the following three years in a friend 's Belgrade apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest . He directed most of his energies towards writing , and during this time completed two of his best known novels , Na Drini ćuprija ( The Bridge on the Drina ) and Travnička hronika . 
 In late spring 1942 , Andrić sent a message of sympathy to Draža Mihailović , the leader of the royalist Chetniks , one of two resistance movements vying for power in Axis @-@ occupied Yugoslavia , the other being Josip Broz Tito 's communist Partisans . In 1944 , Andrić was forced to leave his friend 's apartment during the Allied bombing of Belgrade and evacuate the city . As he joined a column of refugees , he became ashamed that he was fleeing by himself , in contrast to the masses of people accompanied by their children , spouses and infirm parents . " I looked myself up and down , " he wrote , " and saw I was saving only myself and my overcoat . " In the ensuing months , Andrić refused to leave the apartment , even during the heaviest bombing . That October , the Red Army and the Partisans drove the Germans out of Belgrade , and Tito proclaimed himself Yugoslavia 's ruler . 
 = = Later life = = 
 = = = Political career and marriage = = = 
 Andrić 's relationship with the communists was initially precarious given he had previously been an official in the royalist government . He returned to public life only once the Germans had been forced out of Belgrade . Na Drini ćuprija was published in March 1945 . It was followed by Travnička hronika that September and <unk> ( The Young Lady ) that November . Na Drini ćuprija came to be regarded as Andrić 's magnum opus and was proclaimed a classic of Yugoslav literature by the communists . It chronicles the history of the Mehmed <unk> Sokolović Bridge and the town of Višegrad from the bridge 's construction in the 16th century until the outbreak of World War I. The second novel , Travnička hronika , follows a French diplomat in Bosnia during the Napoleonic Wars . The third , <unk> , revolves around the life of a <unk> woman . In the post @-@ war period , Andrić also published several short story collections , some travel memoirs , and a number of essays on writers such as Vuk Karadžić , Petar II Petrović @-@ Njegoš , and Petar Kočić . 
 In November 1946 , Andrić was elected vice @-@ president of the Society for the Cultural Cooperation of Yugoslavia with the Soviet Union . The same month , he was named president of the Yugoslav Writers ' Union . The following year , he became a member of the People 's Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina . In 1948 , Andrić published a collection of short stories he had written during the war . His work came to influence writers such as Branko Ćopić , Vladan <unk> , Mihailo Lalić and <unk> <unk> . In April 1950 , Andrić became a deputy in the National Assembly of Yugoslavia . He was decorated by the Presidium of the National Assembly for his services to the Yugoslav people in 1952 . In 1953 , his career as a parliamentary deputy came to an end . The following year , Andrić published the novella Prokleta <unk> ( The Damned Yard ) , which tells of life in an Ottoman prison in Istanbul . That December , he was admitted into the League of Communists of Yugoslavia , the country 's ruling party . According to Hawkesworth , it is unlikely he joined the party out of ideological conviction , but rather to " serve his country as fully as possible " . 
 On 27 September 1958 , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old Andrić married Milica Babić , a costume designer at the National Theatre of Serbia who was almost twenty years his junior . Earlier , he had announced it was " probably better " that a writer never marry . " He was perpetually persecuted by a kind of fear , " a close friend recalled . " It seemed as though he had been born afraid , and that is why he married so late . He simply did not dare enter that area of life . " 
 = = = Nobel Prize , international recognition and death = = = 
 By the late 1950s , Andrić 's works had been translated into a number of languages . On 26 October 1961 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy . Documents released 50 years later revealed that the Nobel Committee had selected Andrić over writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien , Robert Frost , John Steinbeck and E.M. Forster . The Committee cited " the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country 's history " . Once the news was announced , Andrić 's Belgrade apartment was swarmed by reporters , and he publicly thanked the Nobel Committee for selecting him as the winner of that year 's prize . 
 The Nobel Prize ensured Andrić received global recognition . The following March , he fell ill while on a trip to Cairo and had to return to Belgrade for an operation . He was thus obliged to cancel all promotional events in Europe and North America , but his works continued to be reprinted and translated into numerous languages . Judging by letters he had written at the time , Andrić felt burdened by the attention but did his best not to show it publicly . Upon receiving the Noble Prize , the number of awards and honours bestowed upon him multiplied . He received the Order of the Republic in 1962 , as well as the 27 July Award of Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , the AVNOJ Award in 1967 , and the Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour in 1972 . Apart from being a member of the Yugoslav and Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts , he was also a correspondent of their Bosnian and Slovenian counterparts . He was bestowed honorary doctorates by the universities of Belgrade , Sarajevo and Kraków . 
 Andrić 's wife died on 16 March 1968 . Nearing seventy @-@ six at the time of her death , his health deteriorated steadily and he travelled little in his final years . He continued to write until 1974 , when his health took another turn for the worse . In December 1974 , he was admitted to a Belgrade hospital . He soon fell into a coma , and died in the Military Medical Academy at 1 : 15 a.m. on 13 March 1975 , aged 82 . Andrić was cremated , and on 24 April , the urn containing his ashes was buried at the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade 's New Cemetery . The ceremony was attended by about 10 @,@ 000 residents of Belgrade .

 Andrić was an avid reader in his youth . The young Andrić 's literary interests varied greatly , ranging from the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures , including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Heinrich Heine , Friedrich Nietzsche , Franz Kafka , Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann , French writers Michel de Montaigne , Blaise Pascal , Gustave Flaubert , Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant , and British writers Thomas Carlyle , Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad . Andrić also read the works of Miguel de Cervantes , Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi , Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky , Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen , the American writers Walt Whitman and Henry James , and Czechoslovak philosopher Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk . Andrić was especially fond of Polish literature , and later stated that it had greatly influenced him . He held several Serb writers in high esteem , particularly Karadžić , Njegoš , Kočić and Aleksa Šantić . Andrić also admired the Slovene poets Fran <unk> , Josip <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and translated some of their works . Kafka appears to have had a significant influence on Andrić 's prose , and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard . At one point in his youth , Andrić even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature , which he read as French- and German @-@ language translations . 
 Much of Andrić 's work was inspired by the traditions and peculiarities of life in Bosnia , and examines the complexity and cultural contrasts of the region 's Muslim , Serb and Croat inhabitants . His two best known novels , Na Drini ćuprija and Travnička hronika , subtly contrast Ottoman Bosnia 's " oriental " propensities to the " Western atmosphere " first introduced by the French and later the Austro @-@ Hungarians . His works contain many so @-@ called <unk> ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> ) , words of Turkish , Arabic or Persian origin that found their way into the languages of the South Slavs during Ottoman rule . According to Vucinich , Andrić uses these words to " express oriental nuances and subtleties that cannot be rendered as well in his own Serbo @-@ Croatian " . 
 In the opinion of literary historian Nicholas <unk> , Andrić 's work " frequently betrays his profound sadness over the misery and waste inherent in the passing of time " . Na Drini ćuprija remains his most famous novel and has received the most scholarly analysis of all his works . Most scholars have interpreted the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia , which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War . In his Nobel acceptance speech , Andrić described the country as one " which , at break @-@ neck speed and at the cost of great sacrifices and prodigious efforts , is trying in all fields , including the field of culture , to make up for those things of which it has been deprived by a singularly turbulent and hostile past . " In Andrić 's view , the seemingly conflicting positions of Yugoslavia 's disparate ethnic groups could be overcome by knowing one 's history . This , he surmised , would help future generations avoid the mistakes of the past , and was in line with his cyclical view of time . Andrić expressed hope that these differences could be bridged and " histories <unk> " .

 Shortly before his death , Andrić stated that he wished for all of his possessions to be preserved as an endowment to be used for " general cultural and humanitarian purposes " . In March 1976 , an administrative committee decided that the purpose of the endowment would be to promote the study of Andrić 's work , as well as art and literature in general . The Ivo Andrić Endowment has since organized a number of international conferences , made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer 's works and offered financial aid to cover the publication costs of books covering Andrić 's life and art . An annual yearbook , titled <unk> <unk> Ive <unk> ( The Journals of the Ivo Andrić Endowment ) , is published by the organization . Andrić 's will also stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each year 's best collection of short stories . 
 The street that runs beside Novi <unk> , now the seat of the President of Serbia , was posthumously named <unk> <unk> ( Andrić 's Crescent ) in his honour . It also includes a life @-@ size statue of the writer ; the flat where he spent his final years ( now <unk> <unk> 8 . ) has been turned into a museum . The museum was opened more than a year after Andrić 's death and houses books , manuscripts , documents , photographs and some of his other belongings . Several of Serbia 's other major cities , such as Novi Sad and Kragujevac , have streets named after him . Streets in a number of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina , such as Sarajevo , Banja Luka , Tuzla , and Višegrad , also carry his name . 
 According to the scholar Guido <unk> , Serbs consider Andrić " one of the greatest non @-@ Serb @-@ born Serbs " . The historian Bojan <unk> deems Andrić one of the two central pillars of Serbian literature , the other being Njegoš . " The plasticity of his narrative , " <unk> writes , " the depth of his psychological insight , and the universality of his symbolism remain unsurpassed in all of Serbian literature . " Indeed , Andrić was the first and only Yugoslav writer ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize . Due to his Serb orientation , Andrić 's works were blacklisted under Croatian President Franjo Tuđman following Yugoslavia 's disintegration in the early 1990s . Though Andrić 's biography remains a controversial topic in Croatia , the Croatian literary establishment by and large rehabilitated his works following Tuđman 's death in 1999 . Andrić 's writings were also criticized by Bosniak nationalists , who objected to his ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters . Andrić 's most vocal Bosniak detractors were <unk> <unk> , Adil <unk> , Muhamed Filipović and Muhsin <unk> , who accused him of everything from plagiarism to being a Serb nationalist , and made remarks insinuating that he was a homosexual . Some went so far as to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away . A few of these scholars censured Andrić in the late 1950s , but most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately before the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War . In early 1992 , a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with a sledgehammer . Twenty years later , in 2012 , filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad <unk> unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad , this time as part of the construction of an ethno @-@ town called <unk> , sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska . In June 2014 , <unk> was officially opened on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand .

 = Joseph Dudley = 
 Joseph Dudley ( 23 September 1647 – 2 April 1720 ) was an English colonial administrator . A native of Roxbury , Massachusetts , and the son of one of its founders , Dudley had a leading role in the administration of the Dominion of New England ( 1686 – 1689 ) , overthrown in the 1689 Boston revolt , and served briefly on the council of the Province of New York . In New York , he oversaw the trial that convicted Jacob Leisler , the ringleader of Leisler 's Rebellion . He then spent eight years in England in the 1690s as Lieutenant @-@ Governor of the Isle of Wight , including one year as a Member of Parliament for Newtown , ( Isle of Wight ) . In 1702 he returned to New England after being appointed governor of the provinces of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire , posts he held until 1715 . 
 His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension , with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary , and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions . Most of his tenure was dominated by Queen Anne 's War , in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids . He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707 , raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710 , and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711 . 
 Dudley 's governorship institutionalized a pattern of hostility toward royal governance in Massachusetts , most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials . The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor . While this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule , his rule of New Hampshire was comparatively uncontroversial . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Joseph Dudley was born in Roxbury , Massachusetts Bay Colony , on 23 September 1647 . His mother was Katherine Dudley ( née Dighton or Deighton ; formerly <unk> ) , and his father was Thomas Dudley , one of the founders and leading magistrates of the colony . His father was elderly ( seventy ) when he was born , and he was raised by his mother and Reverend John Allin , whom she married after his father 's death in 1653 . 
 He graduated from Harvard College in 1665 , and was admitted as a freeman in 1672 . He became a member of the general court representing Roxbury in 1673 , and was elected to the colony 's council of assistants in 1676 . In 1675 , when King Philip 's War broke out , Dudley was a commissioner who accompanied the colonial troops into the field against the Indians . He was present at the Great Swamp Fight , in which the Narragansett tribe was decisively defeated . He served for several years as a commissioner to the New England Confederation , and was sent by the administration on diplomatic missions to neighboring Indian communities . He served on a committee that negotiated the boundary between Massachusetts and the neighboring Plymouth Colony . 
 = = Revocation of the colonial charter = = 
 The colony 's governance , which had first come under increased scrutiny by King Charles II beginning in the 1660s , came under substantial threat in the late 1670s . Crown agent Edward Randolph , sent to New England in 1676 to collect customs duties and enforce the Navigation Acts , documented a list of issues and took his complaints to the Lords of Trade in London . The colonial leadership was divided on how to answer this threat . Dudley was part of a moderate faction , along with his brother @-@ in @-@ law Simon Bradstreet and William Stoughton , that supported accommodating the king 's demands . The moderates were opposed by hardliners who opposed attempts by the crown to interfere in the colony 's business . These factions were separated in part along class lines , with the wealthier land owners and merchants who dominated the legislature 's upper house ( called the " court of assistants " ) favoring accommodation , while the more representative lower house favored the hardliners . 
 In 1677 Dudley was elected as a member of the Artillery Company of Massachusetts . 
 In 1682 Massachusetts sent Dudley and John Richards to London as agents to represent its case to the Lords of Trade . Dudley brought with him a letter of introduction from Plymouth Governor Thomas Hinckley to William Blathwayt , the colonial secretary . The favorable relationship he established with Blathwayt contributed much to Dudley 's future success as a colonial administrator , although it also raised suspicions in the colony about his motives and ability to represent its interests . The authority of the agents was limited , and the Lords of Trade insisted to the colonial administration that their agents be authorized to negotiate modifications to the colonial charter . The legislature , dominated by hardliners , refused this demand . This led directly to this issuance of a quo warranto writ demanding the surrender of the colonial charter . When Dudley brought this news to Boston at the end of 1683 , a heated debate began in the legislature , with the hardline party again prevailing . The hardliners , whose leadership included the influential Reverend Increase Mather , in particular castigated moderates like Dudley and Bradstreet as enemies of the colony . Richards , despite the hostile reception the agents had received in London , sided with the hardliners , and the hatred focused against Dudley resulted in his ouster from the council of assistants in the 1684 election . 
 The episode also led to accusations that Dudley had secretly schemed in London to have the charter vacated as a means of personal advancement . Although he is claimed to have discussed the form of a replacement government with Edward Randolph , this discussion did not take place until after the quo warranto writ was issued . This was treated as evidence that he was hostile to the present order of the colony , and working against his commission as colonial agent . His discussions with Randolph were perceived favorably by the latter , who also came to believe that Dudley 's election loss meant he would make a good crown servant . As a result , rumors began circulating in Boston in late 1684 that Dudley might be appointed governor , with Randolph as his deputy . 
 The charter was annulled in 1684 , and the Lords of Trade began planning to combine the New England colonies into a single province called the Dominion of New England . This work was still in progress when King James II took the throne in 1685 ; however , difficulties in drafting a commission for the intended governor , Sir Edmund Andros , prompted Randolph to propose an interim appointment . Dudley was chosen for this post based on Randolph 's recommendation , and on 8 October 1685 a commission was issued to him as President of the Council of New England . The territories covered by his commission included those of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Maine , and the " Narragansett Country " , a disputed territory in present @-@ day southern Rhode Island . Randolph was appointed to a long list of subsidiary posts , including secretary of the colony , that would give him considerable power in the colony . 
 = = President of the Council of New England = = 
 Randolph arrived in Boston with Dudley 's charter on 14 May 1686 , and Dudley formally took charge of Massachusetts on 25 May . His rule did not begin auspiciously , since a number of Massachusetts magistrates who had been named to his council refused to serve , and he was unable to reconcile with Increase Mather , who refused to see him . According to Randolph , the Puritan magistrates " were of opinion that God would never suffer me to land again in this country , and thereupon began in a most arbitrary manner to assert their power higher than at any time before . " Elections of colonial military officers were also compromised when many of them also refused to serve . Dudley made a number of judicial appointments , generally favoring the political moderates who had supported accommodation of the king 's wishes in the battle over the old charter . He renewed treaties with the Indians of northern New England , and traveled to the Narragansett Country in June to formally establish his authority there . 
 Dudley was significantly hampered by the inability to raise revenues in the dominion . His commission did not allow for the introduction of new revenue laws , and the Massachusetts government , anticipating the loss of the charter , had repealed all such laws in 1683 . Furthermore , many people refused to pay the few remaining methods of income on the grounds that they had been enacted by the old government and were thus invalid . Attempts by Dudley and Randolph to introduce the Church of England were largely unsuccessful due to a lack of funding , but were also hampered by the perceived political danger of imposing on the existing churches for their use . 
 The enforcement of the Navigation Acts was conducted by Dudley and Randolph , although they did not adhere to the letter of the laws . Understanding that some provisions of the acts were unfair ( for example , resulting in the payments of multiple duties ) , some violations were overlooked , and they suggested to the Lords of Trade that the laws be modified to ameliorate these conditions . However , the Massachusetts economy was harmed by their vigorous enforcement of the acts . Dudley and Randolph eventually had a falling out over matters related to trade , administration , and religion . " I am treated by Mr. Dudley worse than by Mr. Danforth " , Randolph wrote , unfavorably comparing Dudley to one of the hardline magistrates . 
 While Dudley governed , the Lords of Trade , based on a petition from Dudley 's council , decided to include the colonies of Rhode Island and Connecticut in the dominion . Andros , whose commission had been issued in June , was given an annex to his commission with instructions to incorporate them under his authority . 
 = = Service under Governor Andros = = 
 When Governor Andros arrived in December 1686 he immediately assumed the reins of power . Dudley sat on his council , and served as judge of the superior court and censor of the press . He also sat on the committee that worked to harmonize legislation across the dominion . 
 Although Andros ' appointed council was intended to represent all of the combined territories , the difficulties of travel and the failure of the government to reimburse travel expenses meant that his council was dominated by representatives from Boston and Plymouth . Dudley and Randolph were widely regarded as being a significant part of the " tyranny " of Andros ' reign . Dudley 's position as judge brought him the harshest criticisms and complaints , in particular when he enforced unpopular laws concerning taxes , town meetings , and land titles imposed by Andros . 
 When word of the 1688 Glorious Revolution arrived in Massachusetts , a mob rose up and arrested Andros in April 1689 . Dudley was away from the city , but was arrested upon his return . Since he was ill , he was released into house arrest upon payment of a £ 1 @,@ 000 bond , but a mob descended on his home and carried him back to jail . He stayed in jail for ten months , in part for his own safety , and was then sent back to England at the command of King William along with Andros and other dominion leaders . Colonial authorities brought charges against Andros and Dudley , but since none of their agents in London were prepared to take responsibility for making those charges in court , they were dismissed , and both men were freed . The defense he prepared against those charges demonstrated to the Lords of Trade his willingness and ability to follow crown policy directives . 
 Dudley , stranded in London with limited connections , appealed to Blathwayt for assistance . He also asked a business associate , Daniel Coxe , for help in finding a new position . Coxe , a proprietor of West Jersey , considered Dudley for the post of lieutenant governor there . Through these or other connections , Dudley was eventually recommended as chief of council to the new governor of New York , Henry Sloughter , a position he took up in 1691 . In addition to his council duties , he negotiated with New York 's Indians , and sat as chief judge in the trial of Jacob Leisler , who had led the rebellion that in 1689 overthrew Andros ' lieutenant governor , Francis Nicholson . The trial was controversial , and Dudley 's role made him many enemies . Leisler was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death . Governor Sloughter was initially opposed to immediately executing Leisler and his main ally and son @-@ in @-@ law Jacob Milborne , preferring to defer the decision to the king . Under pressure from anti @-@ Leisler forces in his council , Sloughter changed his mind , and the two men were executed on 16 May 1691 . Cotton Mather claimed that Dudley was an influential force arguing for Leisler 's execution , but this is disputed by testimony from anti @-@ Leisler councillor Nicholas Bayard . 
 Dudley left New York for his home in Roxbury in 1692 , and re @-@ established connections with political friends like William Stoughton , who had just been appointed lieutenant governor of the newly chartered Province of Massachusetts Bay under Sir William Phips . 
 = = Patronage = = 
 Returning to England in 1693 , Dudley embarked on a series of intrigues to regain an office in New England . He ingratiated himself to the religious elements of the London political establishment by formally joining the Church of England . He acquired a patron in Baron Cutts , who engineered his appointment as lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight , where Cutts had been appointed governor . Dudley and Cutts assisted each other politically : Cutts worked to advance Dudley 's agenda in London , while Dudley worked to promote that of Cutts on Wight . The principal activity he was engaged in that has been documented is the manipulation of parliamentary election processes in the island 's constituencies to see that Cutts ' chosen candidates were elected . This process made Cutts highly unpopular on Wight , although he continued in its governorship until his death in 1707 . Dudley also tried to assist Cutts with some financial difficulties , unsuccessfully scheming with Cutts ' father @-@ in @-@ law to gain permission to mint coinage for use in the colonies . 
 Dudley 's principal object of intrigue was the removal of William Phips as Massachusetts governor , something he did not hide from the colony 's agents . Phips , whose rule in Massachusetts was unpopular , was recalled to England to answer a variety of charges his opponents made . Dudley caused Phips to be arrested shortly after his arrival , on inflated charges that Phips had withheld customs monies from the crown . Phips died in February 1695 before the charges against him were heard , and Dudley was optimistic that he would be named the next governor . 
 At this point Dudley 's enemies from New York and Massachusetts joined forces against him to deny him the opportunity . Jacob Leisler 's son was in London , attempting to have the attainder against his father 's estate reversed . With assistance from Massachusetts agent Constantine Phips , a bill to do this was introduced into Parliament . The debate included a review of Leisler 's trial , and Dudley was forced to appear and defend his role in it . Afterward , Phips wrote to Cotton Mather , " [ Dudley ] is not so much talked of to be governor . " The appointment to replace Phips went instead to Lord Bellomont . 
 Cutts continued to be active on Dudley 's behalf , and secured for him election as a Member of Parliament representing Newtown in 1701 . This made it possible for Dudley to further expand his own political connections in London . He managed to at least temporarily mend political fences with Constantine Phips and Cotton Mather , and began lobbying for the Massachusetts governorship after the death of Bellomont in 1701 . In this he was successful , receiving commissions as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire on 1 April 1702 from Queen Anne . 
 = = Governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire = = 
 Dudley served as governor until 1715 . His administration was marked , particularly in the earlier years , by regular conflict with the general court . Upon instruction from the colonial office , he was to gain a regular salary for the governor . He and all of the succeeding royal governors were unsuccessful in extracting this concession from the provincial legislature , and it became a regular source of friction between representatives of crown and colony . Dudley pressed his complaint in letters to London , in which he complained of men " who love not the Crown and Government of England to any manner of obedience " . In one letter to his son Paul , then the provincial attorney general , he wrote " this country will never be worth living in for lawyers and gentlemen , till the charter is taken away . " This letter was discovered and published , fueling provincial opposition to his rule . Dudley also angered the powerful Mather family when he awarded the presidency of Harvard to John Leverett instead of Cotton Mather , and consistently vetoed the election of councilors and speakers of the general court who had acted against him in 1689 , further increasing his unpopularity in Massachusetts . In contrast , his tenure as governor of New Hampshire was popular ; its legislature specifically praised him to the queen after learning of complaints levelled against him by his Massachusetts opponents . 
 = = = Queen Anne 's War = = = 
 Dudley was active in managing colonial defenses during Queen Anne 's War . He attempted to forestall French @-@ orchestrated Indian hostilities by meeting with Indians at Casco Bay in June 1703 , but the French had already begun rallying the Indians to their cause , and the war began with raids on the settlements of southern Maine in August 1703 . Dudley called out the militia , and the Massachusetts and New Hampshire frontiers , extending from the Connecticut River to southern Maine , were fortified . The French and Indians raided Deerfield in February 1704 , prompting calls for retaliation . Dudley authorized the aging Indian fighter Benjamin Church to lead a retaliatory expedition against settlements in Acadia . He also engaged in protracted negotiations for the return of captives taken at Deerfield that the French sought to broaden into a wider @-@ ranging agreement . 
 In part because he specifically refused Church permission to attack the Acadian capital and commercial center , Port Royal , Dudley was accused by Boston merchants and the Mathers of being in league with smugglers and traders illegally trading with the French . He sought to forestall these criticisms in 1707 , when he sent the colonial militia on a fruitless expedition against Port Royal . In 1708 a bitter attack on his administration was published in London , entitled The <unk> State of New England by reason of a <unk> and Treacherous Governor and <unk> Counsellors , as part of a campaign to have him recalled . Dudley again rallied the provincial militias for a planned expedition against Quebec in 1709 , but the supporting expedition from England was called off . In 1710 support from England arrived , and a successful siege of Port Royal led to its fall , and the beginning of the Province of Nova Scotia . Boston was again the organizing point for an expedition to Quebec in 1711 . Combining British and provincial forces , the expedition failed disastrously when some of its transports foundered on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River . During the war Dudley also authorized expeditions against the Abenakis of northern New England , but these were largely ineffectual . The war quieted to some extent after the fall of Port Royal , with only small raiding parties hitting frontier communities , and peace came with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . 
 Dudley negotiated a separate peace with the Abenakis at Portsmouth , New Hampshire , in 1713 . Seeking to separate at least the western Kennebec from French influence , he adopted a fairly hard line , threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival , and reiterated claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki . Although the Treaty of Portsmouth that resulted from those negotiations repeats the claims of sovereignty , there is evidence that the implications of the sovereign claim were not explained to Abenaki negotiators , and that the Abenaki explicitly repudiated land claims in the negotiations . In response to Dudley 's claims that the French had ceded Abenaki lands ( claimed as part of Acadia ) , one sachem responded , " The French never said anything to us about it , and wee wonder how they would give it away without asking us " . Nevertheless , Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects , and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine that flared into Dummer 's War in the 1720s . 
 = = = Other issues = = = 
 The war worsened currency and finance problems in Massachusetts . Since the 1690s the province had been issuing paper currency , and the issuance of large amounts of this currency was causing it to depreciate relative to precious metals used in other currencies . How to deal with this divided colonists among themselves and with the governor , and would not be resolved until the 1760s . Business leaders who borrowed money were happy to pay it back later with depreciated currency , while lenders sought reforms to stabilize the currency . In 1714 a major proposal was floated by Dudley 's opponents in which a land bank , secured by the holdings of the shareholder 's properties , would issue as much as £ 50 @,@ 000 in currency . Dudley was opposed to this scheme , and instead convinced the provincial legislature to issue £ 50 @,@ 000 in bills of credit . The financially powerful interests he upset with this move would prove to be his downfall . 
 In 1713 surveys determined that the border between Massachusetts and the Connecticut Colony had been incorrectly sited in the 17th century , and that Massachusetts had consequently distributed lands that actually belonged to Connecticut . Dudley and Connecticut Governor Gurdon Saltonstall negotiated an agreement in which Massachusetts would retain those lands , but grant to Connecticut for distribution an equivalent amount of land . The " Equivalent Lands " amounted to over 100 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 km2 ) of land in an area on either side of the Connecticut River in present @-@ day northern Massachusetts , southeastern Vermont , and southwestern New Hampshire . These lands were auctioned off in April 1716 , and Connecticut used the proceeds to fund Yale College . 
 Following the death in 1714 of Queen Anne , Dudley 's commission and that of Lieutenant Governor William Tailer , like most royal commissions , expired six months later . The governor 's council , dominated by Dudley 's political opponents , at that point asserted its authority , and on 14 February 1715 , assumed control of the government under the provisions of the provincial charter concerning governance in the absence of the governor and his lieutenant . Just six weeks later , news arrived from England that Dudley 's commission had been at least temporarily confirmed by King George I , and he was reinstated on 21 March . 
 However , Dudley 's political opponents , especially those involved in the land bank proposal , were active in London , and they convinced the king to appoint Colonel Elizeus Burges as governor later in the year . Burges ' commission was proclaimed in Boston on 9 November 1715 , ending Dudley 's commission . Since Burges was not in the colony , governance fell to Lieutenant Governor Tailer , whose commission had been renewed . Burges was bribed by Jonathan Belcher and Jeremiah Dummer , the brother of Dudley 's son @-@ in @-@ law William , to resign his commission in April 1716 without leaving England , and a new commission was issued to Samuel Shute , who promised to oppose attempts to introduce the land bank . He arrived in the colony and assumed the post of governor in October 1716 , with William Dummer as his lieutenant . 
 Dudley retired to the family home in Roxbury . He acted as an informal advisor to Governor Shute upon his arrival , and made appearances at public and private functions . He died in Roxbury on 2 April 1720 . He was buried , with pomp and ceremony appropriate to his position , next to his father in Roxbury 's Eliot Burying Ground . 
 = = Family and legacy = = 
 In 1668 , Dudley married Rebecca <unk> , who survived him by two years . They had twelve children , ten of whom survived to adulthood . His son Paul served as attorney general and chief justice of Massachusetts . Dudley , Massachusetts , is named for his sons Paul and William , who were its first proprietors . 
 Dudley at his death owned large tracts of land in Massachusetts , principally in Roxbury and what is now Worcester County . The latter properties he purchased from the Nipmuc in partnership with William Stoughton , and was granted land for the purpose of settling French Huguenots that became part of Oxford . Dudley frequently used his position , especially when president of the dominion and governor of the province , to ensure that the titles to lands he was interested in were judicially cleared , a practice that also benefited friends , relatives , and business partners . Edward Randolph wrote that it was " impossible to bring titles of land to trial before them where his Majesties 's rights are concerned , the Judges also being parties . " 
 Nineteenth century historian John Palfrey wrote of Dudley that he " united rich intellectual attributes with a groveling soul " , forging political connections and relationships in his early years for the purpose of furthering his own advancement . He capitalized on his favorable family connections to the Puritan leadership of Massachusetts to establish connections in England , but then betrayed those Massachusetts connections when it became necessary to further his quest for power . Thomas Hutchinson , who later also served as provincial governor , and wrote an extensive history of Massachusetts , wrote of Dudley that " he had as many virtues as can consist with so great a thirst for honour and power . " Biographer Everett Kimball wrote of Dudley , " ... in spite of his failings of temper he possessed a good deal of tact and personal charm , by which , when everything else failed , he could sometimes transform an enemy into a friend .

Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up , or maybe the same thing happened to you , the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves . Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him " . The song is also lyrically about a break @-@ up with sinful human nature . 
 " So Long Self " was written and composed by MercyMe . It was recorded in Allaire Studios in Shokan , New York ; overdubs were recorded in Oxford Sound in Nashville , Tennessee , while strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London , England . " So Long Self " is a power pop song with a length of four minutes and three seconds . The song is set in the key of E major and has a tempo of 144 beats per minute , with a vocal range spanning from B3 to E5 . " So Long Self " features a guitar solo near the end of the song , and the bridge of the song features what has been described as Electric Light Orchestra @-@ influenced vocals .

Lauren <unk> of Jesus Freak Hideout stated that " Lead single ' So Long Self ' is one the best tracks Coming Up To Breathe has to offer . With a lyrical hook sure to have radio listeners singing along , this song finds [ Bart ] Millard bidding farewell to sinful nature and moving closer to Christ " . Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that " It almost seems like MercyMe is overcompensating to gain artistic credibility with the bouncy single ' So Long Self , ' an undeniably catchy breakup song with our sinful nature that echoes [ Steven Curtis ] Chapman covering The Beatles , going so far as to playfully evoke a carnival in the bridge " .

 The Socorro springsnail , scientific name Pyrgulopsis neomexicana , is an endangered species of minute freshwater snail with a gill and an operculum , an aquatic gastropod mollusk or <unk> in the family <unk> , the mud snails . 
 This tiny snail previously inhabited a small group of thermal springs in the State of New Mexico , USA . Its survival is seriously endangered because its habitat is both vulnerable and severely threatened . The current status of the population of this snail and its habitat area is unknown . The Socorro springsnail has been listed as endangered by the governments of the United States and New Mexico . 
 Very little is known about this snail in general , because of its minute size , its very restricted range , and the fact that the places where it currently lives are on private property which allows no access . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Socorro springsnail was originally described from warm springs in Socorro , New Mexico . The collector and date of the unique first sample are unknown . Specimens came from the collection of American mineralogist Charles Moore Wheatley ( 1822 Essex , England - 1882 , Phoenixville , Pennsylvania , U.S.A. ) and were likely collected in the 19th century . The species was formally described and named <unk> neomexicana by American malacologist ( mollusk expert ) Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1916 . 
 Pilsbry 's original type description , the text where the species is officially named and described , reads as follows : 
 In 1982 , American zoologist John B. Burch reclassified the Socorro springsnail as <unk> neomexicana . In 1987 , two other American zoologists , Robert Hershler from the National Museum of Natural History and Fred Gilbert Thompson from the Florida State Museum ( now the Florida Museum of Natural History ) assigned members of the genus <unk> , including F. neomexicana , to the genus Pyrgulopsis . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Socorro springsnail has an elongate @-@ ovate conical shell that is light tan and short @-@ spired , in other words the shell is low and rounded , without much of a pointed " tip " to it . The shell has 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 whorls . The protoconch is usually eroded . The internal callus is reddish brown to amber , and the operculum is pale . The height of the shell is 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 3 mm , and its aperture is ovate . 
 The body , head , snout and tentacles are dark gray to black in color . The tentacles range from black or dark gray at the base , to pale gray at the tips . Female snails are larger than males . In the male , the penis has a long glandular strip on the terminal lobe , a long penial gland , and three shorter dorsal glandular strips . A detailed description of the reproductive system of this snail species was provided by Hershler in 1994 . 
 The animal <unk> by using a type of gill known as a ctenidium ( a comb @-@ like respiratory apparatus ) which in this species has 20 tall and narrow ctenidial filaments . 
 In all of the species in the genus Pyrgulopsis , the radula ( a strong rasping feeding ribbon covered in microscopic teeth ) is of <unk> type ( seven teeth in each row , i.e. one middle , two laterals and 4 marginals . ) The radula of Pyrgulopsis neomexicana was described in detail by Hershler ( 1994 ) . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 This species is endemic to Socorro County in central New Mexico in the southwestern United States . The original specimen of the Socorro springsnail reportedly came from a thermal spring near Socorro , New Mexico . 
 It is now extinct at the type locality , but the date and cause of the extinction are uncertain . The species has been reported from other springs in Socorro County ( <unk> 1981 ) , although there is disagreement on whether the species historically occurred there . Currently , the Socorro springsnail is known from only one spring : the <unk> Spring in Socorro County , New Mexico , where it was located in 1979 . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 The Socorro springsnail is entirely aquatic , occurring in low @-@ velocity ( slow @-@ moving ) water near spring sources in a thermal habitat , i.e. near hot springs . More precisely , it is found in the uppermost layer of an organic muck substrate or surface . 
 The principal spring source where the Socorro springsnail is currently found has been impounded ( artificially enclosed , blocked off or dammed ) , and this has reduced the flowing @-@ water habitat to a very small pool . Only one tiny spring source remains , and this has a small improved pool ( less than 1 m ² in area ) , with a water temperature of 17 ° C. The species is abundant on rootlets in this pool , but is not found in the ditches and ponds radiating from the spring into irrigation structures . Other mollusks found in the vicinity include <unk> mexicana , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . In 1981 , the colony of Socorro <unk> was found to occupy not only the source , but also the outflow tributary about 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft ) long to an irrigation ditch . No snails were found in the irrigation flow itself however . In 1991 , the total population of the Socorro springsnail in the spring outflow was estimated at 5 @,@ 000 individuals . 
 The snail had formerly occurred throughout the thermal springs west of the city of Socorro , living in the same habitats as the Socorro isopod <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Feeding habits = = = 
 This species is herbivorous . It feeds on algae and other materials that occur in the organic film which is found on the surface of plants and debris . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 The females of the Socorro springsnail are oviparous , in other words , they lay eggs . They probably deposit eggs in spring and summer . 
 = = Threats = = 
 The limited range and precise habitat demands of the Socorro springsnail makes this species vulnerable to habitat loss or alteration . Potential threats to the species include all activities that would significantly reduce either spring flow or availability of the food source that supports this springsnail species . Alterations to the watersheds , springs , or associated runs could cause a reduction in water flow , a change in water temperature or water quality , or could modify the habitat or food source . This could have a devastating impact on the existing populations of the snail . 
 This snail species has extremely limited dispersal capabilities , which means it has little or no ability to find , and disperse to , other suitable habitats , or to move out of a habitat where the conditions have changed such that it is no longer suitable . Consequently , these snails are unable to avoid contaminants or other unfavorable changes to their habitat . 
 The population of the Socorro springsnail is thought to be limited to a single pool which is less than 1 m ² in area , and an outflow ditch about 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft ) in length . Several of the springs that formerly contained the Socorro springsnail have been impounded , and this has eliminated the precise habitat that is critical for the species ’ survival . 
 Perhaps the greatest threat facing this species is the potential loss of water flow . Excessive pumping from the aquifer that supplies water to the springs could destroy both the springs themselves and the species along with them . Potential pollution of the spring could negatively impact this species and perhaps could also cause its extinction . The effects of climate change , if they include widespread drought , decreased spring discharge , or a change in water chemistry , are a newly @-@ recognized threat that could eliminate the species . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The State of New Mexico listed the Socorro springsnail as endangered , group 2 , on March 28 , 1985 ( Section 17 — 2 — 37 through 17 — 2 — 46 <unk> 1978 ) . On October 30 , 1991 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also listed this species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . Because of the extremely limited distribution , the recovery strategy for this species has its foundation in the maintenance of their habitat . While it is possible that additional populations might be established in other thermal springs , this possibility is contingent upon finding springs within the species ’ presumed historic range that have the physical and biologic attributes , including terrestrial habitat components , that the springsnail requires to survive , and which do not support their own endemic fauna . 
 The locality is on private land and access to the spring has been denied since 1995 . Because of this , the recent population numbers are unknown , the status of the habitat is unknown , and the magnitude of current threats is also unknown . Lack of cooperation by the private land owner and impacts caused by their actions were not specifically identified as a threat . However the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommendations for further actions suggested that efforts should continue in an attempt to gain access to the spring . If and when access is granted , it was recommended that life history studies should be carried out , monitor population numbers should be monitored , the attributes of suitable habitat should be determined ( qualities like the exact nature of the preferred substrate , the water temperature limits , pH , hardness , alkalinity etc . ) and that long @-@ term monitoring of discharge and temperature should be set up . If on the other hand , access continues to be denied , the recommendation was to attempt to set up a one @-@ time visit to the spring in order to collect individuals for a captive refugium population . 
 A decision was made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service not to implement the part of the Endangered Species Act which allows the authorities to acquire land as necessary if it is " critical habitat " for the conservation of a listed species , because it was felt in this situation that making the land public would actually expose the remaining population to an even greater risk of extinction from threats such as vandalism and collection by unauthorized parties . A habitat management plan had not yet been written for the species as of 2008 , as was directed by the 1994 recovery plan , which also covered another species , the Alamosa springsnail . The 1994 recovery plan is out of date and needs to be revised and updated . It was recommended that a separate plan should be created .

 Route 109 is a 3 @.@ 06 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 92 km ) state highway located in Cape May County , New Jersey , United States . The route runs from Jackson Street in Cape May north to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) in Lower Township . It crosses one of two road bridges over the Cape May Canal ( the other is Route 162 ) and provides access to the southern end of the Garden State Parkway and County Route 621 ( Ocean Drive ) as well as to Cape May .

 The Iglesia del Dios Vivo , Columna y Apoyo de la Verdad , La Luz del Mundo , ( English : " Church of the Living God , Column and Ground of the Truth , The Light of the World " ) — or simply La Luz del Mundo — is a Christian denomination with international headquarters in Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico . La Luz del Mundo ( abbreviated LLDM , or sometimes The <unk> ) practices a form of restorationist theology centered on three leaders : founder Aarón — born Eusebio — Joaquín González ( 1896 – 1964 ) , Samuel Joaquín Flores ( 1937 – 2014 ) , and Naasón Joaquin García ( born 1969 ) . These three men are regarded by the Church as modern day Apostles of Jesus Christ and Servants of God . 
 The Church had its beginnings in 1926 just as Mexico plunged into a violent struggle between the anti @-@ clerical government and Catholic rebels . The conflict centered in the west @-@ central states like Jalisco , where González focused his missionary efforts . Given the environment of the time , La Luz del Mundo remained a small missionary endeavor until 1934 when it built its first temple . Thereafter the Church continued to grow and expand , interrupted only by an internal schism in 1942 . Apostles : Aarón Joaquín is believed to be designated the ministry of the Lord by revelation of God , then his son Samuel ; thereafter by his son Naasón . The Church is now present in 50 countries and has between 1 and 7 million adherents worldwide . 
 La Luz del Mundo describes itself as the restoration of primitive Christianity . It does not use crosses or images in its worship services and its members do not observe Christmas or Holy Week . Female members follow a dress code that includes long skirts and head coverings during religious services . 
 = = Name = = 
 The full name of the Church is Iglesia del Dios Vivo Columna y Apoyo de la Verdad , La Luz del Mundo ( " Church of the Living God , Column and Support of The Truth , The Light of The World " ) which is derived from two passages in the Bible , Matthew 5 : 14 and 1 Timothy 3 : 15 .

 Eusebio Joaquín González was born on August 14 , 1896 in <unk> , Jalisco . At a young age , he joined the Constitutional Army during the Mexican Revolution . While he was on leave in 1920 , he met Elisa Flores , whom he later married . While stationed in the state of Coahuila in 1926 , he came into contact with <unk> and Silas , two ascetic preachers from the Iglesia Cristiana Espiritual . Their teachings forbade their followers to keep good hygiene and wear regular clothes . After being baptized by the two itinerant preachers , González resigned from the army , and along with his wife became domestic workers to the two preachers . 
 During the 1920s , Mexico underwent a period of instability under the <unk> Elías Calles administration who was seeking to limit the influence of the Catholic Church to modernize and centralize the state within the religious sphere of Mexican society . To protest the policies , the Catholic Church suspended all religious services , bringing about an uprising in Mexico . This uprising , or Cristero War , lasted from 1926 to 1929 and reemerged in the 1930s . On April 6 , 1926 González had a vision in which God changed his name from Eusebio to Aarón and was later told to leave Monterrey where he and his wife served <unk> and Silas . On his journey , he preached near the entrances of Catholic churches — often facing religious persecution — until he arrived at Guadalajara on December 12 , 1926 . The Cristero Wars impacted both Catholic and non @-@ Catholic congregations and preachers , especially evangelical movements . Small movements were attacked by the government and the <unk> , resulting in a hostile environment for González 's work .

 = = = = Early years = = = = 
 Working as a shoe vendor , González formed a group of ten worshipers who met at his wife 's apartment . He began constructing the Church 's hierarchy by instituting the first two deacons , Elisa Flores and Francisca Cuevas . Later he charged the first minister to oversee 14 congregations in Ameca , Jalisco . During these early years ( late 1920s ) , González traveled to the states of Michoacán , Nayarit , and Sinaloa to preach . In 1931 , the first Santa Cena ( Holy Supper ) was held to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus . The Church met in rural areas , fearing complaints from Catholic neighbors . Urbanization contributed migrants from the countryside who added a significant amount of members to the Church . 
 In 1934 , a temple was built in Sector Libertad of Guadalajara 's urban zone and members were encouraged to buy homes in the same neighborhood thereby establishing a community . The temple was registered as Iglesia Cristiana Espiritual ( Spiritual Christian Church ) but González claimed to have received God 's word in the dedication of the temple , saying that it was " light of the world " and that they were the Iglesia del Dios Vivo , Columna y Apoyo de la Verdad ( Church of the Living God , Column and Ground of the Truth ) . The Church used the latter name to identify itself . In 1939 , it moved to a new meeting place at 12 de Octubre street in San Antonio in southeast Guadalajara , forming its second small community which was populated mainly by its members . This community was an attempt to escape the hostile environment , not to create an egalitarian society . 
 In 1938 González returned to Monterrey to preach to his former associates . There he learned that he had been baptized using the Trinitarian formula and not in the name of Jesus Christ as he preached . His re @-@ baptism in the name of Jesus Christ by his collaborator Lino Figueroa marked González 's separation from the rest of the Pentecostal community . 
 = = = = Schism of 1942 = = = = 
 In 1942 , in its most significant schism , at least 250 members left the Church . Tensions began to build after González 's birthday , when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday . This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members , including some pastors . Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which González was accused of having enriched himself at the expense of the faithful . Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members of La Luz del Mundo of committing immoralities with young women . Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission . Members of La Luz del Mundo attribute this episode to the envy and ambition of the dissidents , who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor ( The Good Shepherd ) under the leadership of José María González , with doctrines and practices similar to those of La Luz del Mundo . The leader is considered a prophet of God . As of 2010 , El Buen Pastor Church has a membership of 17 @,@ 700 in Mexico . 
 Among those who defected to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa , the pastor who had re @-@ baptized González in 1938 . González had a vision in July 1943 where the baptism by Figueroa was invalidated and he was ordered to re @-@ baptize himself invoking Jesus ' name . The whole congregation was re @-@ baptized as well , as now González was the source of baptismal legitimacy and authenticity . With all those who had challenged him gone , González was able to consolidate leadership of the Church . 
 With the growth of the Church in the city , issues of safety developed in the 12 de Octubre street meeting place in the late 1940s and early 1950s . In 1952 , González purchased a plot of land outside the city and called it Hermosa Provincia ( Beautiful Province ) . 
 = = = = Hermosa Provincia = = = = 
 In 1952 , González purchased land on the outskirts of Guadalajara with the intent of forming a small community made up exclusively by members of LLDM . The land was then sold at reduced prices to church members . The community included most necessities ; services provided in Hermosa Provincia included health , education , and other urban services , which were provided in full after six years partly with help that the Church received from municipal and non @-@ municipal authorities . This dependency upon outside assistance to obtain public services ended by 1959 when residents formed the Association of Colonists of Hermosa Provincia , which was used to directly petition the government . Hermosa Provincia received a white flag from the city for being the only neighborhood in the city that has eliminated illiteracy by the early 1970s . González started missionary efforts in Central America and by the early 1960s , La Luz del Mundo had 64 congregations and 35 missions . By 1964 , after his death , the Church had between 20 @,@ 000 and 30 @,@ 000 members spread through five countries , including Mexico . The neighborhood became a standard model for the Church which has replicated it in many cities in Mexico and other countries . 
 = = = Ministry of Samuel Joaquin Flores ( 1964 @-@ 2014 ) = = = 
 Samuel Joaquín Flores was born on February 14 , 1937 and became the leader of the Church by the age of 27 after the death of González . He continued his father 's desire for international expansion by traveling outside of Mexico extensively . He first visited members of the Church in the Mexican state of Michoacán in August 1964 and later that year he went to Los Angeles on a missionary trip . By 1970 , the Church had expanded to Costa Rica , Colombia , and Guatemala . The first small temple in the Hermosa Provincia was demolished and replaced by a larger one in 1967 . With Flores ' work , La Luz del Mundo became integrated into Guadalajara and the Church replicated the model of Hermosa Provincia in many cities in Mexico and abroad . By 1972 , there were approximately 72 @,@ 000 members of the Church , which increased to 1 @.@ 5 million by 1986 and to 4 million by 1993 . Anthropologist Patricia Fortuny says that the Church 's growth can be attributed to several factors , including its social benefits , which " improves the living conditions of believers . " Flores oversaw the construction of schools , hospitals and other social services produced by the Church . It also expanded to countries including the UK , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Ethiopia and Israel between 1990 and 2010 . After fifty years at the head of La Luz del Mundo church , Flores died in his home on December 8 , 2014 .

García was born on May 7 , 1969 and previously served as pastor in Los Angeles , California . After one year of arduous work García continues to lead the church , with ambition to fulfill a promise he received from God in a vision , that La Luz del Mundo Church will grow to a number that he could never imagine or perceive . He also urges the youth members of the church to join him in spreading their doctrine to the ends of the earth .

 During La Luz del Mundo 's religious services , male and female members are separated during worship ; from the preacher 's perspective , women sit on the left side of the temple and men on the right . The Church does not use musical instruments during its services . There is no dancing or clapping , and women cover their heads with a veil during worship services . Hymns are sung a cappella ; Despite this , members listen to instrumental music and some have composed Christian music . When singing , all congregants sing at the same time . Congregations practice the songs to maintain proper melody and uniformity during their religious meetings . The Church believes that worship should be done spiritually and only to God , and thus temples are devoid of images , saints , crosses , and anything that might be considered idolatry . The places of worship have plain walls and wide , clear windows . 
 The Church holds three daily prayer meetings during the week , with two meetings on Sundays and one regular consecration . On Sunday mornings , congregants meet at the temple for Sunday School , which begins with prayers and hymns . After that , the preacher — usually a minister — presides over a talk during which he reads from the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week . During the talk , it is common for members of either sex to read a cited verse from the Bible . At the end of the talk , more hymns and prayers are recited and voluntary offerings are given . Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers , after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite from the Bible or sing hymns . A shorter talk is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School 's talk . 
 The Church holds three scheduled prayer meetings each day . The first daily prayer meeting is at 5 : 00 a.m. and usually lasts one hour . The service includes a talk that is meant to <unk> ( remember ) the material covered in the Sunday School . The 9 : 00 a.m. prayer was originally started by González 's wife , Elisa Flores . A female church member presides over the prayer meeting , which includes a talk . The evening prayer has the same structure as the 5 : 00 a.m. meeting . In each prayer meeting members are expected to be prepared with their Bibles , hymn books and notebooks and to be consecrated .

 Members of La Luz del Mundo believe that the Bible along with the teachings of the Apostle are the only source of Christian doctrine . It is used as the source of ministers ' and lay persons ' talks during prayer meetings . Through organizational arrangements , such as Sunday school , church authorities attempt to maintain uniformity of teachings and beliefs throughout all congregations . The Bible is the only historical reference used by La Luz del Mundo during religious services . Members can find cited Bible verses quickly , regardless of their level of education . It is also seen as the one of two " sufficient rules of faith for salvation " . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 La Luz del Mundo teaches that there was no salvation on Earth between the death of the last Apostle ( Apostle John ) around 96 AD and the calling of González in 1926 . Members believe that the Church itself was founded by Jesus Christ approximately two thousand years ago and that after the deaths of the Apostles of God , the church became corrupt and was lost . The Church claims that through González , it is the restoration of the Primitive Christian church that was lost during the formation of the Roman Catholic Church . After those times passed , the beginning of González 's ministry is seen as the restoration of the original Christian Church . Salvation can be attained in the Church by following the Bible @-@ based teachings of their leader . 
 = = = Calling of the Servants of God = = = 
 The Church states that its members believe in " the calling of the Servants of God , sent to express the will of God and Salvation " . It believes that González was called by God to restore the Primitive Christian Church . González was succeeded by Flores upon his death in 1964 ; Flores was in turn succeeded by García upon his death in 2014 . La Luz del Mundo teaches that it is the only true Christian church founded by Jesus Christ because it is led by García , who it considers the only true servant of God and Apostle of Jesus Christ in this era . Members believe that this Apostolic Authority allows them to find peace , feel close to God and attain meaning in their lives from the hopes of joining with Christ to reign with him for eternity . 
 = = = Christology = = = 
 La Luz del Mundo rejects the doctrine of the Trinity as a later addition to Christian theology . It believes in a " one and universal " God and in Jesus Christ who is the " Son of God and Savior of the world " , rather than part of a trinity . God is worshiped " by essence " , whereas Jesus is worshiped " by commandment . " Moreover , by worshiping Jesus Christ they are also worshiping God through him according to their teachings . The Church also preaches baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins , and baptism with the Holy Spirit as confirmation from God for entrance into heaven . 
 There is disagreement among external sources regarding the <unk> of La Luz del Mundo . According to theologian Roger S. Greenway , the Church is trinitarian but baptizes in the name of Jesus to conform to apostolic practice . Theological librarian Kenneth D. Gill agrees with Greenway that the Church is trinitarian , and says it refuses to " use the term ' person ' to describe the three modes of God . " Sociocultural anthropologist Hugo G. Nutini also says the Church is trinitarian but that its worship focuses exclusively on Jesus Christ as the source of salvation . 
 = = = Role of women = = = 
 In the tradition of Pentecostalism , female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full , long skirts . Women can have their hair as short as their shoulder blades . These restrictions do not apply to recreational activities , where wearing bathing suits is permitted . Women wear a head covering during religious meetings . According to an interview of one adherent , women in the Church are considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education , social careers , and other goals that may interest them . 
 González established the 9 a.m. prayer after hearing about one of his followers who was being abused by her Catholic husband . This prayer became one led by women . These prayers are seen as a religious activity equal to all other activities . This prayer provides space for empowerment in which women can express themselves and develop a status within the congregation 's membership . Anthropologist Patricia Fortuny said , concerning the 9 a.m. prayer , that , " I infer from this that , if the membership considers this as [ a ] female [ gathering ] , they would be giving authority to women in the religious or ecclesiastical framework of the ritual , and this then [ would ] put [ them ] on a plane of equality or [ in ] absence of subordination to men . " She said that women of the Church may be playing with their subordinate roles in the Church to acquire certain benefits . 
 Church women personalize their attire , according to Patricia Fortuny . <unk> are worn by indigenous members and specially designed veils by other female members . Fortuny says that , " ... wearing long skirts does not negate the meaning of being a woman and , although it underlines the difference between men and women , [ the Church 's female members ] say that it does not make them feel like inferior human beings " . Fortuny says women describe their attire as part of obeying biblical commands found in 1 Timothy 2 : 9 , and 1 Corinthians 11 : 15 for long hair . Female members say the Church 's dress code makes them feel they are honoring God and that it is part of their " essence " . 
 Fortuny also states that dress codes are a sign of a patriarchal organization because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public . Women , at times , can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico . Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara ( Mexico ) , and Houston ( Texas ) congregations . Many young female members said they want to undergo post @-@ secondary education , and some told Fortuny they were degree students . Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post @-@ compulsory education . Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university . 
 La Luz del Mundo Church does not practice ordination of women . According to Fortuny , women can become missionaries or <unk> ; the lowest tier of the Church 's hierarchy . She states that " the rank of deaconess is not a position which common women could aspire to " . <unk> states that the first two <unk> were Elisa Flores and Francisca Cuevas . Wives of important members of the Church usually get the rank of deaconess , according to <unk> . 
 Women are active and play key roles in organizing activities and administering them in the Church . Female office holders are always head of groups of women and not groups of men . A deaconess can help pastors and deacons , but cannot herself administer the sacrament . All members of the ministerial hierarchy are paid for their services as part of the tithe by the congregational members . 
 At the turn of the century , La Luz del Mundo Church began promoting women to public relations positions that were previously held by men only . As of December 2014 , two women ( and three men ) serve as legal representatives of the church in Northern Mexico . Public relations positions that have been held by women include spokesperson , director of social communication , and assistant director of international affairs . Within church operated civil organizations women also occupy executive positions such as director of La Luz del Mundo Family Services , a violence prevention and intervention center in South Side , Milwaukee ; Director of Social Work and Psychology within the Ministry of Social Welfare ; director of the Samuel Joaquín Flores Foundation ; president of <unk> de México A.C. ; and director of the Association of Students and Professionals in the USA . 
 = = = Other beliefs and practices = = = 
 The Church teaches moral and civil principles such as community service and that science is a gift from God . Members of La Luz Del Mundo do not celebrate Christmas or Holy Week . The most important yearly rituals are the Holy Supper ( Santa Cena in Spanish or " Santa Convocation " ) , held yearly on August 14 , and the anniversary of García 's birth is held on May 7 at its international headquarters in Guadalajara .

 = = = Ecclesiastical organization = = = 
 The organization of La Luz del Mundo is apostolic . The head of the Church is Jesus Christ and in his representation is <unk> Joaquin García , who is the " Apostle and Servant of God " and the organizational authority as General Director of the Church . Below him is the ranks of pastors , who are expected to develop one or more of the qualities as doctor , prophet , and evangelist . All pastors are evangelists and are expected to undertake missionary tasks . As doctors , pastors explain the word of God and as prophets they interpret it . Below them are the deacons , who administer the sacraments to the congregational members . Below the deacons are the <unk> ( managers or overseers ) , who have responsibility for the moral conduct and well @-@ being of certain groups within the congregation . Overseers grant permits to members who wish to leave their congregations for vacations or to take jobs outside of the church district . At the lowest echelon of the hierarchy are the <unk> ( laborers ) , who mainly assist their higher @-@ ups with missionary work . 
 = = = Territorial organization = = = 
 A church , or group , that is unable to fully provide for the religious needs of its members is called a mission . Missions are dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister . A group of several congregations with their missions form a district . The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts . In Mexico , several districts form together into five jurisdictions that act as legal entities . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 La Luz del Mundo uses the architecture of its temples to express its faith through symbolism and to attract potential converts . Among the Church 's buildings are a replica of a Mayan pyramid in Honduras , a mock Taj Mahal in Chiapas , Mexico , and a Greco @-@ Roman @-@ inspired temple in California . Its flagship temple is located in its headquarters in Hermosa Provincia . Two smaller replicas of this temple are being built in Anchorage , Alaska , and in Chile to symbolize " the northern and southern @-@ most reach of the Church 's missionary efforts . " 
 = = = Hermosa Provincia Temple = = = 
 The flagship temple in Guadalajara is pyramidal and has an innovative structure . The project began in 1983 , when the Church 's former temple built to accommodate 8 @,@ 000 people was deemed insufficient to accommodate the growing number of people who attended various annual celebrations . Construction began on July 3 , 1983 when Flores laid the cornerstone and lasted until August 1 , 1992 . The temple was completed largely by members of the Church . It is a notable architectural feature in Guadalajara in a working @-@ class district on the outskirts of the city . Dozens of institutions , architects , and engineers were invited to submit proposals for a new temple . The pyramidal design submitted by Leopoldo Fernández Font was from the final shortlist of four proposals . Fernandez Font was later awarded an honorary degree for this and other structures . He said that one of his favorite works is the Temple of the Resurrection , but that the temple of La Luz del Mundo seemed difficult to him . The temple was built to accommodate 12 @,@ 000 worshipers and is used for annual ceremonies . 
 The building 's design represents the infinite power and existence of God . It consists of seven levels over a base menorah , each of which symbolize steps toward the human spirit 's perfection . In February 1991 , a laser beacon was installed to commemorate the 449 @-@ year anniversary of the founding of Guadalajara . On July 1999 the pinnacle of the temple " La <unk> " was replaced by Aaron 's rod , a twenty @-@ ton bronze sculpture by artist Jorge de la Peña . The installation of the 23 @-@ metre ( 75 ft ) long structure required a special crane . 
 = = = Houston Texas Temple = = = 
 The main temple in Houston , Texas , was inspired by Greco @-@ Roman architecture . It is the largest temple constructed by La Luz del Mundo in the United States as of 2011 . The temple 's pillars resemble the Parthenon , according to religious historian Timothy Wyatt . The front of the building is decorated with carved scenes from the Bible and three panes of stained glass also depict biblical scenes . The temple can hold 4 @,@ 500 people . The interior has marble floors , glass chandeliers , and wood paneling . 
 The structure is worth US $ 18 million and consists of the temple , classrooms , offices , and a parsonage . There is a sitting area with 14 free @-@ standing columns in a circle next to the temple . Each column represents each of the Apostles — including Aarón and Samuel Joaquín . On top of the temple under Aaron 's rod — the Church 's symbol which represents God 's power <unk> spiritual life to believers — is a large , golden dome . The symbol is also a reference to the Church 's founder . 
 Construction of the temple began in 2000 and it was finished in 2005 . Most of the construction was done by Church volunteers , who provided funding and a skilled workforce . The structure was designed by Church members and the design was revised by architects to ensure compliance with building codes . The decorations and ornaments were also designed and installed by Church members . The temple serves as a central congregation for southeastern Texas . 
 = = Statistics = = 
 There are no definitive statistics for the total membership of La Luz del Mundo . It has reported having over five million members worldwide in 2000 with 1 @.@ 5 million in Mexico . The Church does not appear in the 1990 Mexican census or any census prior to that . 
 The 2000 Mexican census reported about 70 @,@ 000 members nationwide , and the 2010 census reported 188 @,@ 326 members . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints , whose numbers also differ significantly from those of the census — 1 @,@ 234 @,@ 545 compared to the census figure of 314 @,@ 932 — said ambiguity in the census questionnaire was the source of the disparity . The World Christian Encyclopedia reports 430 @,@ 000 adherents in Mexico in 2000 and 488 @,@ 000 in Mexico in 2010 . Anthropologist Hugo G. Nutini estimated that the Church had around 1 @,@ 125 @,@ 000 members in 2000 in Mexico . In 2008 , Fortuny and Williams estimated the membership at 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . Anthropologist Ávila Meléndez says that the membership numbers reported by La Luz del Mundo are plausible given the great interest it has generated among " religious authorities " and the following it receives in Mexico . 
 In El Salvador , as of 2009 , there are an estimated 70 @,@ 000 members of La Luz del Mundo , which had 140 congregations with a minister and 160 other congregations with between 13 and 80 members . As of 2008 , there were around 60 @,@ 000 members of the Church in the United States . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 In the wake of the Heaven 's Gate mass suicide , La Luz del Mundo found itself embroiled in a controversy that would play out in some of Mexico 's major media outlets . Former members and anti @-@ cult groups leveraged accusations against the church and its leadership . Church members and sympathizers defended the integrity of the church . Academics , meanwhile , denounced a climate of intolerance toward religious minorities in Mexico . 
 = = = Allegations of potential for mass suicide = = = 
 Following the Heaven 's Gate mass suicide on March 26 , 1997 , Mexican journalists asked which religious group at home could stage similar acts . The following day , in TV Azteca 's flagship program , Jorge Erdely Graham leader of the obscure anti @-@ cult group Instituto Cristiano de Mexico ( Christian Institute of Mexico ) pointed to La Luz del Mundo as a group with the potential to commit mass suicide . Erdely 's claims were based on an interview with three church members conducted two years earlier . La Luz del Mundo denied the claims arguing that the answers of three individuals cannot be used to make generalizations about an entire community . Religious scholars Gordon Melton and David Bromley characterized the accusations as " fraudulent reports by ideological enemies . " Anthropologist Elio <unk> Kan criticized the methodology employed in the interview , noting that the interviewer cornered the subjects to obtain the desired response . 
 This incident focused media attention on the church , and in May 4 , 1997 the accusations were broadcast on Mexico 's most @-@ watched newscast on Televisa . 
 = = = Sexual abuse accusations against Flores = = = 
 On May 18 , 1997 ( a day after Flores ' 35th wedding anniversary ) in a follow @-@ up report on Televisa , a handful of women claimed to have been sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier . In a third report on August 17 , shortly after the church 's most significant holiday , former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager . These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely 's anti @-@ cult group , which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition as a religious organization . Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor , but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed . 
 The issue came back to life in February of the following year when , two days before Flores ' birthday , Padilla reported being kidnapped and stabbed by two gunmen . Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger , but he could have died from blood loss . Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack in which he was allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader . A church spokesman denied that the Church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack in a desperate attempt to authenticate his previous charges against the Church . 
 Judicial authorities investigating the charges said the alleged victims were not being fully cooperative , whereas former members were suspicious of the Mexican legal system , arguing that it favored the church . Ten years later a spokesman for the state prosecutor said the criminal complaints were unsuccessful because , in addition to the statute of limitations , the accusations were unfounded . 
 Sociologist Roberto <unk> called the controversy a " persecution " fueled by " obscure interests . " Journalist Carlos <unk> described the issue as a <unk> campaign . Sociologist Bernardo Barranco described it as a dirty war that was well exploited by the media . Anthropologist Carlos <unk> Navarro criticized that the accusations were first brought before the mass media , and thought it was very likely that the accusations were an attempt to give the church a bad image . Journalist Gastón Pardo called it a smear campaign characterized by the systematic use of defamation and slander .

 = = = Opposition to new temple in California = = = 
 In 1995 , La Luz del Mundo acquired a vacant nursery building in a commercial zone in Ontario , California . The Church planned to use it for religious activities and was assured that it could as long as building requirements were met . The city then passed a law requiring all new religious organizations to obtain a conditional use permit to operate a church in the commercial zone . In 1998 , the Church petitioned for such a permit but concerned residents objected to its plans . María de Lourdes Argüelles , professor at Claremont Graduate University and board member of the Instituto Cristiano de México , led the opposition against the Church , which she called a " destructive sect " . She said she had seen children and teenagers working overnight on the site under precarious conditions . 
 Ontario officials met with objecting residents and began researching the Church and checking with cities where Luz del Mundo had temples , but found no problems . After considering zoning questions and citing traffic , parking and disruption of economic plans for that area , the city denied the permit to the Church . La Luz del Mundo then sued the city for denying it use of its own building for services and for allegedly violating its civil rights . The case was settled out of court in 2004 , and the Church was allowed to build the temple . The city agreed to pay about US $ 150 @,@ 000 in cash and fee credits to the Church . The case was not taken to court because city officials and attorneys concluded the city would most likely lose the case and spend more money than the settlement . 
 = = = Denominational Discrimination = = = 
 According to Patricia Fortuny , members of La Luz del Mundo along with members of other Protestant denominations , are treated as " second class citizens " . She says the Church is called a sect in an offensive manner in Mexico . Rodolfo Morán Quiroz , a sociologist , said that the discrimination started by the Catholic Church , which in the past caused La Luz del Mundo to seek help from the authorities who promoted religious freedom in establishing its community in Hermosa Provincia , continues in Mexico . Church founder González was beaten by <unk> and was jailed by the government for preaching in the open air . 
 In 1995 , as thousands of members of the Church traveled to the Holy Supper celebration in Guadalajara , several members of a neighboring community supported by Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez protested the use of schools to provide temporary shelters for the Luz del Mundo pilgrims . The protesters said that after the ceremony the schools were left in disarray ; however church authorities presented photographic evidence to newspapers to refute these claims . 
 According to Armando Maya Castro , many students who are members of the Church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools , and some have been punished for it . In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper , La Gaceta , a female member of the Church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger , who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt . In July 25 , 2008 , a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta , Jalisco , trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals . This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the Church in the area . Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated the Church was in compliance with local laws . 
 Many female church members have faced discrimination and verbal abuse on buses , schools , and hospitals . Church members who were patients in a Mexican hospital were denied access to their ministers in 2011 . The hospital required permission from Catholic clergy so that LLDM ministers could visit patients . 
 Ministers of the Church reported that the site of a newly constructed temple in <unk> was subject to harassment of its members , vandalism , and physical threats because of religious intolerance , which caused them to request increased police protection . In February 2012 , seventy ministers of La Luz del Mundo from different nations appeared before Mexican authorities in Guadalajara to denounce the lack of police protection for the Church 's residents in the city after a series of attacks left several members hospitalized . 
 = Communist Party of China = 
 The Communist Party of China ( CPC ) is the founding and ruling political party of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) . The CPC is the sole governing party of China , although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front . It was founded in 1921 , chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao . The party grew quickly , and by 1949 the CPC had driven the Kuomintang ( KMT ) government from mainland China after the Second Chinese Civil War , thus leading to the establishment of the People 's Republic of China . The CPC is currently the world 's second largest political party with a membership of 88 @.@ 76 million as of 2016 . 
 The CPC is , officially , organized on the basis of democratic centralism , a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies . The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress , convened every fifth year . When the National Congress is not in session , the Central Committee is the highest body , but since the body meets normally only once a year , most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee . The party 's leader holds the offices of General Secretary ( responsible for civilian party duties ) , Chairman of the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) ( responsible for military affairs ) and state president ( a largely ceremonial position ) . Through these posts the party leader is the country 's paramount leader . The current party leader is Xi Jinping , elected at the 18th National Congress ( held in 2012 ) . 
 The CPC is still committed to communist thought and continues to participate in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers ' Parties each year . According to the party constitution the CPC adheres to Marxism – Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , socialism with Chinese characteristics , Deng Xiaoping Theory , Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development . The official explanation for China 's economic reforms is that the country is in the primary stage of socialism , a developmental stage similar to the capitalist mode of production . The planned economy established under Mao Zedong was replaced by the socialist market economy , the current economic system , on the basis that " Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth " ( i.e. the planned economy was deemed inefficient ) . 
 Since the collapse of Eastern European communist regimes in 1989 – 1990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 , the CPC has emphasized its party @-@ to @-@ party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining socialist states . While the CPC still maintains party @-@ to @-@ party relations with non @-@ ruling communist parties around the world , since the 1980s it has established relations with several non @-@ communist parties , most notably with ruling parties of one @-@ party states ( whatever their ideology ) , dominant parties in democratic systems ( whatever their ideology ) , and social democratic parties .

 = = = Founding and early history ( 1921 – 27 ) = = = 
 The CPC has its origins in the May Fourth Movement of 1919 , during which radical ideologies like Marxism and anarchism gained traction among Chinese intellectuals . Li Dazhao was the first leading Chinese intellectual who publicly supported Leninism and world revolution . In contrast to Chen Duxiu , Li did not renounce participation in the affairs of the Republic of China . Both of them regarded the October Revolution in Russia as groundbreaking , believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere . The CPC was modeled on Vladimir Lenin 's theory of a vanguard party . Study circles were , according to Cai <unk> , " the rudiments [ of our party ] " . Several study circles were established during the New Culture Movement , but " by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread . " 
 The founding National Congress of the CPC was held on 23 – 31 July 1921 . While it was originally planned to be held in Shanghai French Concession , police officers interrupted the meeting on 3 July . Because of that , the congress was moved to a tourist boat on South Lake in Jiaxing , Zhejiang province . Only 12 delegates attended the congress , with neither Li nor Chen being able to attend . Chen sent a personal representative to attend the congress . The resolutions of the congress called for the establishment of a communist party ( as a branch of the Communist International ) and elected Chen as its leader . 
 The communists dominated the left wing of the KMT , a party organized on Leninist lines , struggling for power with the party 's right wing . When KMT leader Sun Yat @-@ sen died in March 1925 , he was succeeded by a rightist , Chiang Kai @-@ shek , who initiated moves to marginalize the position of the communists . Fresh from the success of the Northern Expedition to overthrow the warlords , Chiang Kai @-@ shek turned on the communists , who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China . Ignoring the orders of the Wuhan @-@ based KMT government , he marched on Shanghai , a city controlled by communist militias . Although the communists welcomed Chiang 's arrival , he turned on them , massacring 5000 with the aid of the Green Gang . Chiang 's army then marched on Wuhan , but was prevented from taking the city by CPC General Ye Ting and his troops . Chiang 's allies also attacked communists ; in Beijing , 19 leading communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin , while in Changsha , He Jian 's forces machine gunned hundreds of peasant militiamen . That May , tens of thousands of communists and their sympathizers were killed by nationalists , with the CPC losing approximately 15 @,@ 000 of its 25 @,@ 000 members . 
 The CPC continued supporting the Wuhan KMT government , but on 15 July 1927 the Wuhan government expelled all communists from the KMT . The CPC reacted by founding the Workers ' and Peasants ' Red Army of China , better known as the " Red Army " , to battle the KMT . A battalion led by General Zhu De was ordered to take the city of Nanchang on 1 August 1927 in what became known as the Nanchang Uprising ; initially successful , they were forced into retreat after five days , marching south to Shantou , and from there being driven into the wilderness of Fujian . Mao Zedong was appointed commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Red Army , and led four regiments against Changsha in the Autumn Harvest Uprising , hoping to spark peasant uprisings across Hunan . His plan was to attack the KMT @-@ held city from three directions on 9 September , but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause , attacking the Third Regiment . Mao 's army made it to Changsha , but could not take it ; by 15 September , he accepted defeat , with 1000 survivors marching east to the <unk> Mountains of Jiangxi .

 The near @-@ destruction of the CPC 's urban organizational apparatus led to institutional changes within the party . The party adopted democratic centralism , a way to organize revolutionary parties , and established a Politburo ( functioned as the standing committee of the Central Committee ) . The result was increased centralization of power within the party . At every @-@ level of the party this was duplicated , with standing committees now in effective control . After Chen Duxiu 's dismissal , Li Lisan was able to assume de facto control of the party organization by 1929 – 30 . Li Lisan 's leadership was a failure , and by the end of it , the CPC was on the brink of destruction . The Comintern became involved , and by late @-@ 1930 , his powers had been taken away . By 1935 Mao had become the party 's informal leader , with Zhou Enlai and Zhang <unk> , the formal head of the party , serving as his informal deputies . The conflict with the KMT led to the reorganization of the Red Army , with power now centralized in the leadership through the creation of CPC political departments charged with supervising the army . 
 The Second Sino @-@ Japanese War caused a pause in the conflict between the CPC and the KMT . The Second United Front was established between the CPC and the KMT to tackle the invasion . While the front formally existed until 1945 , all collaboration between the two parties had ended by 1940 . Despite their formal alliance , the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with the KMT . In 1939 the KMT began to restrict CPC expansion within China . This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces . It did not take long before the situation were <unk> , since none of the parties considered a civil war an option at this time . Despite this , by 1943 the CPC was again actively expanding its territory at the expense of the KMT . 
 From 1945 until 1949 , the war had been reduced to two parties ; the CPC and the KMT . This period lasted through four stages ; the first was from August 1945 ( when the Japanese surrendered ) to June 1946 ( when the peace talks between the CPC and the KMT ended ) . By 1945 , the KMT had three @-@ times more soldiers under its command than the CPC , and because of it , it looked early on like it was winning . With the cooperation of the Americans and the Japanese , the KMT was able to retake major parts of the country . However , KMT rule over the <unk> territories would prove unpopular because of endemic corruption within the party . Despite this advantage , the KMT , with 2 million more troops than the CPC , failed to reconquer the rural territories which made up the CPC 's stronghold . Around the same time , the CPC launched an invasion of Manchuria , where they were given assistance by the Soviet Union . The second stage , lasting from July 1946 to June 1947 , saw KMT extend its control over major cities , such as Yan 'an ( the CPC headquarter for much of the war ) . The KMT 's successes were hollow ; the CPC had tactically withdrawn from the cities , and instead attacked KMT authorities by instigating protests amongst students and intellectuals in the cities ( the KMT responded to these events with heavy @-@ handed repression ) . In the meantime , the KMT was struggling with factional infighting and Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's autocratic control over the party , which weakened the KMT 's ability to respond to attacks . The third stage , lasting from July 1947 to August 1948 , saw a limited counteroffensive by the CPC . The objective was to clear " Central China , strengthening North China , and recovering Northeast China . " This policy , coupled with desertions from the KMT military force ( by spring 1948 KMT military had lost an estimated 2 million troops , having 1 million troops left ) and the increasing unpopularity of KMT rule . The result was that the CPC was able to cut off KMT garrisons in Manchuria and retake several lost territories . The last stage , lasting from September 1948 to December 1949 , saw the communist take the initiative and the collapse of KMT rule in mainland China . On 1 October 1949 , Mao declared the establishment of the PRC , which signified the end of the Chinese Revolution ( as it is officially described by the CPC ) . 
 = = = Single Ruling party ( 1949 – present ) = = = 
 The Chinese Revolution , directed by Mao Zedong and the CPC , led to the establishment of the ( PRC ) in 1949 . The PRC was founded on Marxist – Leninist principles , or more precisely , the sinification of Marxism – Leninism ( officially known as Mao Zedong Thought , referred to in the West as Maoism ) . During the 1960s and 1970s , the CPC experienced a significant ideological separation from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . By that time , Mao had begun saying that the " continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat " stipulated that class enemies continued to exist even though the socialist revolution seemed to be complete , leading to the Cultural Revolution . 
 Following Mao 's death in 1976 , a power struggle between CPC General Secretary Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping erupted . Deng won the struggle , and became the " paramount leader " . Deng , alongside Chen Yun and Li <unk> , spearheaded the Reform and opening policy , and introduced the ideological concept of socialism with Chinese characteristics . In reversing some of Mao 's " leftist " policies , Deng argued that a socialist state could use the market economy without itself being capitalist . While asserting the political power of the Party , the change in policy generated significant economic growth . The new ideology , however , was contested on both sides of the spectrum , by Maoists as well as by those supporting political liberalization . With other social factors , the conflicts culminated in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests . Deng 's vision on economics prevailed , and by the early 1990s the concept a socialist market economy had been introduced . In 1997 , Deng 's beliefs ( Deng Xiaoping Theory ) , were embedded in the CPC constitution . 
 CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng as “ paramount leader ” in the 1990s , and continued most of his policies . As part of Jiang Zemin 's nominal legacy , the CPC ratified the Three Represents for the 2003 revision of the Party constitution , as a " guiding ideology " to encourage the Party to represent " advanced productive forces , the progressive course of China 's culture , and the fundamental interests of the people . " The theory has legitimized the entry of private business owners and bourgeois elements into the party . Hu Jintao , Jiang Zemin 's successor as paramount leader , took office in 2002 . Unlike Mao , Deng and Jiang Zemin , Hu laid emphasis on collective leadership and opposed one @-@ man dominance of the political system . The insistence on focusing on economic growth has led to a wide range of serious social problems . To address these , Hu introduced two main ideological concepts : the Scientific Outlook on Development and Harmonious Socialist Society . Hu resigned from his post as CPC General Secretary and Chairman of the CMC at the 18th National Congress held in 2012 , and was succeeded in both posts by Xi Jinping . Since taking power Xi has initiated the most concerted anti @-@ corruption effort in decades , while centralizing powers in the office of CPC General Secretary at the expense of the collective leadership which has led foreign commentators to liken him to Mao . 
 = = Governance = = 
 = = = Collective leadership = = = 
 Currently , in a bid to curtail the powers of the individual , collective leadership , the idea that decisions will be taken through consensus , has become the ideal in the CPC . The concept has its origins back to Vladimir Lenin and the Russian Bolshevik Party . At the level of the central party leadership this means that , for instance , all members of the Politburo Standing Committee are of equal standing ( each member having only one vote ) . A member of the Politburo Standing Committee often represents a sector ; during Mao 's reign , he controlled the People 's Liberation Army , Kang Sheng , the security apparatus , and Zhou Enlai , the State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . This counts as informal power . Despite this , in a paradoxical relation , members of a body are ranked hierarchically ( despite the fact that members are in theory equal to each others ) . In spite of this , the CPC is led by an informal leader principle , each collective leadership is led by a core , that is a paramount leader ; a person who holds the offices of CPC General Secretary , CMC chairman and President of the PRC . Before Jiang Zemin 's tenure as paramount leader , the party core and collective leadership were indistinguishable . In practice , the core was not responsible to the collective leadership . However , by the time of Jiang , the party had begun propagating a responsibility system , referring to it in official pronouncements to the " core of the collective leadership " . 
 = = = Democratic centralism = = = 
 The CPC 's organizational principle is democratic centralism , which is based on two principles ; democracy ( synonymous in official discourse with " socialist democracy " and " inner @-@ party democracy " ) and centralism . This has been the guiding organizational principle of the party since the 5th National Congress , held in 1927 . In the words of the party constitution , " The Party is an integral body organized under its program and constitution and on the basis of democratic centralism " . Mao once quipped that democratic centralism was " at once democratic and centralized , with the two seeming opposites of democracy and centralization united in a definite form . " Mao claimed that the superiority of democratic centralism laid in its internal contradictions , between democracy and centralism , and freedom and discipline . Currently , the CPC is claiming that " democracy is the lifeline of the Party , the lifeline of socialism " . But for democracy to be implemented , and functioning properly , there needs to be centralization . Democracy in any form , the CPC claims , needs centralism , since without centralism there will be no order . According to Mao , democratic centralism " is centralized on the basis of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance . This is the only system that can give full expression to democracy with full powers vested in the people 's congresses at all levels and , at the same time , guarantee centralized administration with the governments at each level exercising centralized management of all the affairs entrusted to them by the people ’ s congresses at the corresponding level and safeguarding whatever is essential to the democratic life of the people " . 
 = = = Multi @-@ party Cooperation System = = = 
 The Multi @-@ party Cooperation and Political Consultation System is led by the CPC in cooperation and consultation with the 8 parties which make up the United Front . Consultation takes place under the leadership of the CPC , with mass organizations , the United Front parties , and " representatives from all walks of life " . These consultations contribute , at least in theory , to the formation of the country 's basic policy in the fields of political , economic , cultural and social affairs . The CPC 's relationship with other parties is based on the principle of " long @-@ term coexistence and mutual supervision , treating each other with full sincerity and sharing weal or woe . " This process is institutionalized in the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference ( CPPCC ) . All the parties in the United Front support China 's road to socialism , and hold steadfast to the leadership of the CPC . Despite all this , the CPPCC is a body without any real power . While discussions do take place , they are all supervised by the CPC . 
 = = Organization = = 
 = = = Central organization = = = 
 The National Congress is the party 's highest body , and , since the 9th National Congress in 1969 , has been convened every five years ( prior to the 9th Congress they were convened on an irregular basis ) . According to the party 's constitution , a congress may not be postponed except " under extraordinary circumstances . " The party constitution gives the National Congress six responsibilities : 
 electing the Central Committee ; 
 electing the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection ( CCDI ) ; 
 examining the report of the outgoing Central Committee ; 
 examining the report of the outgoing CCDI ; 
 discussing and enacting party policies ; and : 
 revising the party 's constitution . : 
 In practice , the delegates rarely discuss issues at length at the National Congresses . Most substantive discussion takes place before the congress , in the preparation period , among a group of top party leaders . In between National Congresses , the Central Committee is the highest decision @-@ making institution . The CCDI is responsible for supervising party 's internal anti @-@ corruption and ethics system . In between congresses the CCDI is under the authority of the Central Committee . 
 The Central Committee , as the party 's highest decision @-@ making institution between national congresses , elects several bodies to carry out its work . The 1st Plenary Session of a newly elected central committee elects the General Secretary of the Central Committee , the party 's titular leader , the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) , the Politburo , the Politburo Standing Committee ( PSC ) , and since 2013 , the Central National Security Commission ( CNSC ) . The first plenum also endorses the composition of the Secretariat and the leadership of the CCDI . According to the party constitution , the General Secretary must be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee ( PSC ) , and is responsible for convening meetings of the PSC and the Politburo , while also presiding over the work of the Secretariat . The Politburo " exercises the functions and powers of the Central Committee when a plenum is not in session " . The PSC is the party 's highest decision @-@ making institution when the Politburo , the Central Committee and the National Congress are not in session . It convenes at least once a week . It was established at the 8th National Congress , in 1958 , to take over the policy @-@ making role formerly assumed by the Secretariat . The Secretariat is the top implementation body of the Central Committee , and can make decisions within the policy framework established by the Politburo ; it is also responsible for supervising the work of organizations that report directly into the Central Committee , for example departments , commissions , publications , and so on . The CMC is the highest decision @-@ making institution on military affairs within the party , and controls the operations of the People 's Liberation Army . The General Secretary has , since Jiang Zemin , also served as Chairman of the CMC . Unlike the collective leadership ideal of other party organs , the CMC Chairman acts as commander @-@ in @-@ chief with full authority to appoint or dismiss top military officers at will . The CNSC " co @-@ ordinates security strategies across various departments , including intelligence , the military , foreign affairs and the police in order to cope with growing challenges to stability at home and abroad . " The General Secretary serves as the Chairman of the CNSC . 
 A first plenum of the Central Committee also elects several departments , bureaus , central leading groups and other institutions to pursue its work during a term ( a " term " being the period <unk> between national congresses , usually five years ) . The General Office is the party 's " nerve centre " , in charge of day @-@ to @-@ day administrative work , including communications , protocol , and setting agendas for meetings . The CPC currently has four main central departments : the Organization Department , responsible for overseeing provincial appointments and vetting cadres for future appointments , the Publicity Department ( formerly " Propaganda Department " ) , which oversees the media and formulates the party line to the media , the International Department , functioning as the party 's " foreign affairs ministry " with other parties , and the United Front Work Department , which oversees work with the country 's non @-@ Communist parties and other mass organizations . The CC also has direct control over the Central Policy Research Office , which is responsible for researching issues of significant interest to the party leadership , the Central Party School , which provides political training and ideological indoctrination in communist thought for high @-@ ranking and rising cadres , the Party History Research Centre , which sets priorities for scholarly research in state @-@ run universities and the Central Party School , and the Compilation and Translation Bureau , which studies and translates the classical works of Marxism . The party 's newspaper , the People 's Daily , is under the direct control of the Central Committee . The theoretical magazines Seeking Truth from Facts and Study Times are published by the Central Party School . The various offices of the " Central Leading Groups " , such as the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office , the Taiwan Affairs Office , and the Central Finance Office , also report to the central committee during a plenary session . 
 = = = Lower @-@ level organizations = = = 
 Party committees exist at the level of provinces ; autonomous regions ; municipalities directly under the central government ; cities divided into districts ; autonomous prefectures ; counties ( including banners ) ; autonomous counties ; cities not divided into districts ; and municipal districts . These committees are elected by party congresses ( at their own level ) . Local party congresses are supposed to be held every fifth year , but under extraordinary circumstances they may be held earlier or postponed . However that decision must be approved by the next higher level of the local party committee . The number of delegates and the procedures for their election are decided by the local party committee , but must also have the approval of the next higher party committee . 
 A local party congress has many of the same duties as the National Congress , and it is responsible for examining the report of the local Party Committee at the corresponding level ; examining the report of the local Commission for Discipline Inspection at the corresponding level ; discussing and adopting resolutions on major issues in the given area ; and electing the local Party Committee and the local Commission for Discipline Inspection at the corresponding level . Party committees of " a province , autonomous region , municipality directly under the central government , city divided into districts , or autonomous prefecture [ are ] elected for a term of five years " , and include full and alternate members . The party committees " of a county ( banner ) , autonomous county , city not divided into districts , or municipal district [ are ] elected for a term of five years " , but full and alternate members " must have a Party standing of three years or more . " If a local Party Congress is held before or after the given date , the term of the members of the Party Committee shall be correspondingly shortened or lengthened . 
 A local Party Committee is responsible to the Party Committee at the next higher level . The number of full and alternate members at the local Party Committee is decided by the Party Committee at the next higher level . Vacancies in a Party Committee shall be filled by an alternate members according to the order of precedence , which is decided by the number of votes an alternate member got during his or hers election . A Party Committee must convene for at least two plenary meetings a year . During its tenure , a Party Committee shall " carry out the directives of the next higher Party organizations and the resolutions of the Party congresses at the corresponding levels . " The local Standing Committee ( analogous to the Central Politburo ) is elected at the first plenum of the corresponding Party Committee after the local party congress . A Standing Committee is responsible to the Party Committee at the corresponding level and the Party Committee at the next higher level . A Standing Committee exercises the duties and responsibilities of the corresponding Party Committee when it is not in session . 
 = = = Members = = = 
 To join the party , an applicant must be 18 years of age , and must spend a year as a probationary member . In contrast to the past , when emphasis was placed on the applicants ' ideological criteria , the current CPC stresses technical and educational qualifications . To become a probationary member , the applicant must take an admission oath before the party flag . The relevant CPC organization is responsible for observing and educating probationary members . <unk> members have duties similar to those of full members , with the exception that they may not vote in party elections nor stand for election . Many join the CPC through the Communist Youth League . Under Jiang Zemin , private entrepreneurs were allowed to become party members . According to the CPC constitution , a member , in short , must follow orders , be disciplined , uphold unity , serve the Party and the people , and promote the socialist way of life . Members enjoy the privilege of attending Party meetings , reading relevant Party documents , receiving Party education , participating in Party discussions through the Party 's newspapers and journals , making suggestions and proposal , making " well @-@ grounded criticism of any Party organization or member at Party meetings " ( even of the central party leadership ) , voting and standing for election , and of opposing and criticizing Party resolutions ( " provided that they resolutely carry out the resolution or policy while it is in force " ) ; and they have the ability " to put forward any request , appeal , or complaint to higher Party organizations , even up to the Central Committee , and ask the organizations concerned for a responsible reply . " No party organization , including the CPC central leadership , can deprive a member of these rights . 
 As of 30 June 2016 , individuals who identify as farmers , herdsmen and fishermen make up 26 million members ; members identifying as workers totalled 7 @.@ 2 million . Another group , the " Managing , professional and technical staff in enterprises and public institutions " , made up 12 @.@ 5 million , 9 million identified as working in administrative staff and 7 @.@ 4 million described themselves as party cadres . 22 @.@ 3 million women are CPC members . The CPC currently has 88 @.@ 76 million members , making it the second largest political party in the world after India 's Bharatiya Janata Party . 
 = = = Communist Youth League = = = 
 The Communist Youth League ( CYL ) is the CPC 's youth wing , and the largest mass organization for youth in China . According to the CPC 's constitution the CYL is a " mass organization of advanced young people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China ; it functions as a party school where a large number of young people learn about socialism with Chinese characteristics and about communism through practice ; it is the Party 's assistant and reserve force . " To join , an applicant has to be between the ages of 14 and 28 . It controls and supervises Young Pioneers , a youth organization for children below the age of 14 . The organizational structure of CYL is an exact copy of the CPC 's ; the highest body is the National Congress , followed by the Central Committee , Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee . However , the Central Committee ( and all central organs ) of the CYL work under the guidance of the CPC central leadership . Therefore , in a peculiar situation , CYL bodies are both responsible to higher bodies within CYL and the CPC , a distinct organization . As of the 17th National Congress ( held in 2013 ) , CYL has 89 million members . 
 = = Symbols = = 
 According to the Article 53 of the CPC constitution , " the Party emblem and flag are the symbol and sign of the Communist Party of China . " At the beginning of its history , the CPC did not have a single official standard for the flag , but instead allowed individual party committees to copy the flag of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . On 28 April 1942 , the Central Politburo decreed the establishment of a sole official flag . " The flag of the CPC has the length @-@ to @-@ width proportion of 3 : 2 with a hammer and sickle in the upper @-@ left corner , and with no five @-@ pointed star . The Political Bureau authorizes the General Office to custom @-@ make a number of standard flags and distribute them to all major organs " . According to People 's Daily , " The standard party flag is 120 centimeters ( cm ) in length and 80 cm in width . In the center of the upper @-@ left corner ( a quarter of the length and width to the border ) is a yellow hammer @-@ and @-@ sickle 30 cm in diameter . The flag sleeve ( pole hem ) is in white and 6 @.@ 5 cm in width . The dimension of the pole hem is not included in the measure of the flag . The red color symbolizes revolution ; the hammer @-@ and @-@ sickle are tools of workers and peasants , meaning that the Communist Party of China represents the interests of the masses and the people ; the yellow color signifies brightness . " In total the flag has five dimensions , the sizes are " no . 1 : 388 cm in length and 192 cm in width ; no . 2 : 240 cm in length and 160 cm in width ; no . 3 : 192 cm in length and 128 cm in width ; no . 4 : 144 cm in length and 96 cm in width ; no . 5 : 96 cm in length and 64 cm in width . " On 21 September 1966 , the CPC General Office issued " Regulations on the Production and Use of the CPC Flag and Emblem " , which stated that the emblem and flag were the official symbols and signs of the party . 
 = = Ideology = = 
 It has been argued in recent years , mainly by foreign commentators , that the CPC does not have an ideology , and that the party organization is pragmatic and interested only in what works . This view is considered wrong by some in many ways , since official statements make it very clear the party does have a coherent worldview . For instance , Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is " threatening to divide us " and that " the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets " . The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message . Before the " Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth " campaign , the relationship between ideology and decision @-@ making was a deductive one , meaning that policy @-@ making was derived from ideological knowledge . Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down , with decision @-@ making justifying ideology and not the other way around . Lastly , Chinese policy @-@ makers believe that one of the reasons for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology . They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party 's rule , unlike the Soviet Union 's communist party , whose ideology they believe became " rigid , unimaginative , ossified , and disconnected from reality . " 
 = = = Formal ideology = = = 
 Marxism – Leninism was the first official ideology of the Communist Party of China . According to the CPC , " Marxism – Leninism reveals the universal laws governing the development of history of human society . " To the CPC , Marxism – Leninism provides a " vision of the contradictions in capitalist society and of the inevitability of a future socialist and communist societies " . According to the People 's Daily , Mao Zedong Thought " is Marxism – Leninism applied and developed in China " . Mao Zedong Thought was conceived not only by Mao Zedong , but by leading party officials . 
 While non @-@ Chinese analysts generally agree that the CPC has rejected orthodox Marxism – Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought ( or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking ) , the CPC itself disagrees . Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CPC 's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction of the ideological theory , the Three Represents . However , party theorist Leng Rong disagrees , claiming that " President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [ ... ] He did not give up Marxism or socialism . He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism — which is why we talk about a ‘ socialist market economy ’ with Chinese characteristics . " The attainment of true " communism " is still described as the CPC 's and China 's " ultimate goal " . While the CPC claims that China is in the primary stage of socialism , party theorists argue that the current development stage " looks a lot like capitalism " . Alternatively , certain party theorists argue that “ capitalism is the early or first stage of communism . ” Some have dismissed the concept of a primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism . According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn , a China analyst , " When I first heard this rationale , I thought it more comic than clever — a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics . But the 100 @-@ year horizon comes from serious political theorists " . 
 Deng Xiaoping Theory was added to the party constitution at the 14th National Congress . The concepts of " socialism with Chinese characteristics " and " the primary stage of socialism " were credited to the theory . Deng Xiaoping Theory can be defined as a belief that state socialism and state planning is not by definition communist , and that market mechanisms are class neutral . In addition , the party needs to react to the changing situation dynamically ; to know if a certain policy is obsolete or not , the party had to " seek truth from facts " and follow the slogan " practice is the sole criterion for the truth " . At the 14th National Congress , Jiang reiterated Deng 's mantra that it was unnecessary to ask if something was socialist or capitalist , since the important factor was whether it worked . 
 The " Three Represents " , literally a Marxism adapted to Chinese conditions , was adopted by the party at the 16th National Congress . Certain segments within the CPC criticized the Three Represents as being un @-@ Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values , supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics . Jiang disagreed , and had concluded that attaining the communist mode of production , as formulated by earlier communists , was more complex than had been realized , and that it was useless to try to force a change in the mode of production , as it had to develop naturally , by following the economic laws of history . The theory is most notable for allowing capitalists , officially referred to as the " new social strata " , to join the party on the grounds that they engaged in " honest labor and work " and through their labour contributed " to build [ ing ] socialism with Chinese characteristics . " The 3rd Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee conceived and formulated the ideology of the Scientific Outlook on Development . It is considered to be Hu Jintao 's contribution to the official ideological discourse . To apply the Scientific Outlook on Development to Chinese conditions , the CPC must adhere to building a Harmonious Socialist Society . 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 Deng did not believe that the fundamental difference between the capitalist mode of production and the socialist mode of production was central planning versus free markets . He said , " A planned economy is not the definition of socialism , because there is planning under capitalism ; the market economy happens under socialism , too . Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity " . Jiang Zemin supported Deng 's thinking , and stated in a party gathering that it did not matter if a certain mechanism was capitalist or socialist , because the only thing that mattered was whether it worked . It was at this gathering that Jiang Zemin introduced the term socialist market economy , which replaced Chen Yun 's " planned socialist market economy " . In his report to the 14th National Congress Jiang Zemin told the delegates that the socialist state would " let market forces play a basic role in resource allocation . " At the 15th National Congress , the party line was changed to " make market forces further play their role in resource allocation " ; this line continued until the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee , when it was amended to " let market forces play a decisive role in resource allocation . " Despite this , the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee upheld the creed " Maintain the dominance of the public sector and strengthen the economic vitality of the State @-@ owned economy . " 
 The CPC views the world as organized into two opposing camps ; socialist and capitalist . They insist that socialism , on the basis of historical materialism , will eventually triumph over capitalism . In recent years , when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring , the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx . Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system , the party 's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist . The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist , it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity . Globalization , as with the market economy , therefore does not have one specific class character ( neither socialist or capitalist ) according to the party . The instance that globalization is not fixed in nature , comes from Deng 's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism . Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CPC that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization , globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism . 
 = = Party @-@ to @-@ party relations = = 
 = = = Communist parties = = = 
 The CPC continues to have relations with non @-@ ruling communist and workers ' parties and attends international communist conferences , most notably the International Meeting of Communist and Workers ' Parties . Delegates of foreign communist parties still visit China ; in 2013 , for instance , the General Secretary of the Portuguese Communist Party ( PCP ) , Jeronimo de Sousa , personally met with Liu <unk> , a member of the Central Politburo . In another instance , Pierre Laurent , the National Secretary of the French Communist Party ( FCP ) , met with Liu Yunshan , a Politburo Standing Committee member . In 2014 Xi Jinping , the CPC General Secretary , personally met with Gennady Zyuganov , the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation ( CPRF ) , to discuss party @-@ to @-@ party relations . While the CPC retains contact with major parties such as the PCP , FCP , the CPRF , the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia , the Communist Party of Brazil , the Communist Party of Nepal ( Unified Marxist − Leninist ) and the Communist Party of Spain , the party retains relations with minor communist and workers ' parties , such as the Communist Party of Australia , the Workers Party of Bangladesh , the Communist Party of Bangladesh ( Marxist – Leninist ) ( Barua ) , the Communist Party of Sri Lanka , the Workers ' Party of Belgium , the Hungarian Workers ' Party , the Dominican Workers ' Party and the Party for the Transformation of Honduras , for instance . In recent years , noting the self @-@ reform of the European social democratic movement in the 1980s and 1990s , the CPC " has noted the increased marginalization of West European communist parties . " 
 = = = = Ruling parties of socialist states = = = = 
 The CPC has retained close relations with the remaining socialist states still espousing communism : Cuba , Laos , North Korea and Vietnam and their respective ruling parties . It spends a fair amount of time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states , trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not , following the collapse of the Eastern European socialist states in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . In general , the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive , and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future . 
 The ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the Communist Party of Vietnam ( CPV ) . In general the CPV is considered a model example of socialist development in the post @-@ Soviet era . Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the Doi Moi reform policy at the 6th CPV National Congress is the key reason for Vietnam 's current success . 
 While the CPC is probably the organization with most access to North Korea , writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed . The few reports accessible to the general public are those about North Korean economic reforms . While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public , in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea 's economic system , the cult of personality which pervades society , the Kim family , the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state , the security state , the use of scarce resources on the Korean People 's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people . There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution . Over the years , the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers ' Party of Korea ( or WPK , North Korea 's ruling party ) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China . For instance , in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK General Secretary Kim Jong @-@ il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China . In general , the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state . 
 There is a considerable degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC . Fidel Castro , the former First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba ( PCC ) , is greatly admired , and books have been written focusing on the successes of the Cuban Revolution . Communication between the CPC and the PCC has increased considerably since the 1990s , hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange . At the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee , which discussed the possibility of the CPC learning from other ruling parties , praise was heaped on the PCC . When Wu Guanzheng , a Central Politburo member , met with Fidel Castro in 2007 , he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao : " Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends , good comrades , and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity . The two countries ' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation , and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated . " 
 = = = Non @-@ communist parties = = = 
 Since the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe , the CPC has begun establishing party @-@ to @-@ party relations with non @-@ communist parties . These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them . For instance , the CPC has been eager to understand how the People 's Action Party of Singapore ( PAP ) maintains its total domination over Singaporean politics through its " low @-@ key presence , but total control . " According to the CPC 's own analysis of Singapore , the PAP 's dominance can be explained by its " well @-@ developed social network , which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party @-@ controlled groups . " While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a democracy , they view it as a guided democracy led by the PAP . Other differences are , according to the CPC , " that it is not a political party based on the working class — instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the parliamentary system , not a revolutionary party . " Other parties the CPC studies and maintains strong party @-@ to @-@ party relations with are the United Malays National Organisation , which has ruled Malaysia democratically since 1957 , and the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan , which dominated Japanese politics for over five uninterrupted decades . 
 The CPC has , since Jiang Zemin 's time , made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe , the Kuomintang . The CPC emphasizes strong party @-@ to @-@ party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China . However , several studies have been written on the KMT 's loss of power in 2000 , after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 ( the KMT officially ruled China from 1928 to 1949 ) . In general , one @-@ party states or dominant @-@ party states are of special interest to the party , and party @-@ to @-@ party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them . For instance , the longevity of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba 'ath Party is attributed to the personalization of power in the al @-@ Assad family , the strong presidential system , the inheritance of power , which passed from Hafez al @-@ Assad to his son Bashar al @-@ Assad , and the role given to the Syrian military in politics . 
 In recent years , the CPC has been especially interested in Latin America , as shown by the increasing number of delegates sent to and received from these countries . Of special fascination for the CPC is the 71 @-@ year @-@ long rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) in Mexico . While the CPC attributed the PRI 's long reign in power to the strong presidential system , tapping into the machismo culture of the country , its nationalist posture , its close identification with the rural populace and the implementation of nationalization alongside the <unk> of the economy , the CPC concluded that the PRI failed because of the lack of inner @-@ party democracy , its pursuit of social democracy , its rigid party structures that could not be reformed , its political corruption , the pressure of globalization , and American interference in Mexican politics . While the CPC was slow to recognize the Pink tide in Latin America , it has strengthened party @-@ to @-@ party relations with several socialist and anti @-@ American political parties over the years . The CPC has occasionally expressed some irritation over Hugo Chavez 's anti @-@ capitalist and anti @-@ American rhetoric . Despite this , in 2013 the CPC reached an agreement with the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( <unk> ) , which was founded by Chavez , for the CPC to educate <unk> cadres in political and social fields . By 2008 , the CPC claimed to have established relations with 99 political parties in 29 Latin American countries . 
 Social democratic movements in Europe have been of great interest to the CPC since the early 1980s . With the exception of a short period in which the CPC forged party @-@ to @-@ party relations with far @-@ right parties during the 1970s in an effort to halt " Soviet expansionism " , the CPC 's relations with European social democratic parties were its first serious efforts to establish cordial party @-@ to @-@ party relations with non @-@ communist parties . The CPC credits the European social democrats with creating a " capitalism with a human face " . Before the 1980s , the CPC had a highly negative and dismissive view of social democracy , a view dating back to the Second International and the Leninist and Stalinist view on the social democratic movement . By the 1980s that view had changed , and the CPC concluded that it could actually learn something from the social democratic movement . CPC delegates were sent all over Europe to observe . It should be noted that by the 1980s most European social democratic parties were facing electoral decline , and were in a period of self @-@ reform . The CPC followed this with great interest , laying most weight on reform efforts within the British Labour Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany .

 Donald Maynard Brashear ( born January 7 , 1972 ) is an American @-@ Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played for five organizations in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , in which he was considered one of the most effective enforcers . His aggressive style led to being among the League leaders in penalty minutes for six seasons , while currently ranking 15th all @-@ time in NHL history , and resulted in multiple suspensions as well . He remains the Vancouver Canucks all @-@ time single season leader in penalty minutes , which he set in the 1997 – 98 season . He was the victim of one most publicized incidents of on @-@ ice violence in NHL history , when he was slashed in the head by Marty McSorley , during the 1999 – 2000 season .

 Brashear is the youngest of three children born to an African @-@ American father , Johnny Brashear , and French Canadian mother , Nicole Gauthier , in Bedford , Indiana . His father was an alcoholic who abused his family , including beating Donald with belts and electrical cords . On one occasion , when Donald was only six months old , he picked him up and threw him out of a window . Nicole , afraid that Johnny might kill her , left the family and returned to Canada . Later she came back to take the children , but left Donald to live with his father for another four years , until Donald 's paternal grandmother sent him to Canada . Donald 's mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and did not want another mixed @-@ race child in the house . 
 Brashear moved in with his mother and his new stepfather in <unk> , Quebec . Unfortunately , he suffered further abuse in his new surroundings ; he was forced to sleep with a garbage bag tied around his waist to keep him from wetting the bed , and was verbally berated for not being able to tie his shoes . His mother finally decided to give him up to foster care , due in part because of what she called " mental problems " from the abuse he had suffered , and because he did not accept her as his mother . Brashear lived in two different foster homes that sent him away since the families believed he was a " little too much to handle . " 
 At the age of eight , Brashear moved to Val @-@ <unk> , Quebec , and settled into a new foster home . Once there , he began playing hockey with his new siblings . In order to help pay for hockey , Brashear sold baked bread and garbage bags door @-@ to @-@ door . Later , he became a paper boy .

 Brashear was signed as a free agent by the Montreal Canadiens in 1992 . He spent parts of three seasons with their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Fredericton Canadiens , before becoming a regular with Montreal at the NHL level . During the 1993 – 94 AHL season , he registered professional career highs of 38 goals and 66 points , along with 250 Penalty Minutes ( PIMs ) in 62 games . His 38 goals tied him for the team lead and the 250 PIMs led Fredericton . Brashear made his NHL debut on November 15 , 1993 , against the Ottawa Senators . He registered an assist in the contest , his first career NHL point . Two days later , he scored his first NHL goal in a game against the Edmonton Oilers . After playing parts of four seasons with the Canadiens , his time in Montreal ended following a heated verbal exchange with Head Coach Mario Tremblay during a team practice on November 9 , 1996 . Four days later , Brashear was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for <unk> <unk> . Brashear finished the year with 13 points and 245 PIMs , seventh @-@ highest in the NHL . 
 The following season , 1997 – 98 , Brashear led the NHL in penalty minutes and set a Canucks franchise record with 372 PIMs , while adding 18 points . During the season , he also received a four @-@ game suspension for delivering a blind @-@ side punch to Ian Laperrière . Brashear stated that he hit Laperrière in retaliation to Laperrière punching Brashear 's teammate Gino Odjick from behind . The 1998 – 99 season marked the only time in his career which he played in all 82 games , again leading the Canucks in penalty minutes and finishing eighth in the NHL . In the 1999 – 2000 season , Brashear set a career @-@ high in goals with 11 , but the season was marred by one of the most published incidents of excessive violence in the modern era of hockey .

 During the February 21 , 2000 game between the Canucks and the Boston Bruins , Brashear was involved in a fight with Marty McSorley . Brashear handily won the fight and on his way to the penalty box taunted the Bruins bench . Later in the game , Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe , who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury . For the rest of the game , McSorley attempted to fight Brashear , who refused . With 4 @.@ 6 seconds left in the game , McSorley struck Brashear with a two @-@ handed slash to the temple with his stick ; Brashear collapsed , and his helmet fell off upon impact . He suffered a seizure on the ice and the slash resulted in a grade three concussion . Goaltender Garth Snow would later try to fight McSorley , but McSorley was ejected with 2 @.@ 8 seconds left in the game . McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions . 
 The case went to trial in British Columbia , where Brashear testified that he had no memory of the incident . McSorley testified that he tried to hit Brashear in the shoulder to start a fight with him , but missed , resulting in the head shot . McSorley was found guilty but avoided a jail sentence . He was required to complete 18 months of probation , in which he was not allowed to play in a game against Brashear . Brashear returned to play prior to the end of the season . McSorley , who missed the remaining 23 games of the regular season , had his suspension officially set at one year following the conviction . However , he ultimately never played in another NHL game during his career .

 Brashear played in 79 games the following season , registering 19 assists and 28 points . After leading the Canucks in penalty minutes for the previous four seasons , Brashear was traded 31 games into the 2001 – 02 season to the Philadelphia Flyers . The Flyers received Brashear and the Canucks ' sixth @-@ round draft pick in 2002 in exchange for Jan <unk> and the Flyers ' third @-@ round pick in the same draft . While splitting time between the two franchises , Brashear set a career @-@ high in points ( 32 ) while also amassing 199 PIMs . In 2002 – 03 , he recorded eight goals , 25 points and 161 PIMs . Thanks in part to his strong work ethic , he was awarded the Pelle Lindbergh Memorial Trophy , an annual award given to the Flyers ' most improved player . During the 2003 – 04 season , he was among the League leaders in PIMs , registering 212 , ranking him fifth overall . His PIM total was aided by his role in the most penalized game in NHL history . On March 5 , 2004 , the Flyers were defeating the Ottawa Senators 5 – 2 , when with 1 : 45 remaining in the game , Brashear fought Ottawa enforcer Rob Ray . The fight was believed to be in retaliation to Flyers forward Mark Recchi being slashed in the face by the Senators Martin <unk> . Following Brashear 's fight , five separate brawls broke out . For his role in starting the fighting , Brashear was assessed 34 PIMs , more than any other Flyer . When asked later why he started the fighting , he responded by saying , " Why wouldn ’ t I ? Did you see the last game ? " 
 Due to the cancellation of the 2004 – 05 NHL season by the NHL lockout , Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi @-@ pro Ligue Nord @-@ Américaine de Hockey league ( <unk> ) . The deal was reportedly worth $ 300 @,@ 000 . He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games , but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little to protect him from players wanting to make a name for themselves against an established NHL enforcer . Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice . 
 Following the lockout , Brashear voiced his displeasure with the new way the League called games , stating that the NHL changed the rules to favor " superstars , " and he felt that there was no longer a way to " get respect " on the ice . His statement came following a game in which he attempted to fight Darius Kasparaitis , who the Flyers believed delivered a " cheap shot " to Simon Gagné in an Olympic game earlier in the year . After Kasparaitis refused to fight Brashear at various points in the game , Brashear hit Kasparaitis with a gloved punch with 1 : 53 remaining in the game . Kasparaitis did not fight back , and instead covered up to protect himself . Brashear was assessed 29 PIMs for the incident , including an instigator penalty . Brashear was given a one @-@ game suspension due to new League rules for the 2005 – 06 season ; any player given an instigator penalty in the final five minutes of regulation or overtime would receive an automatic one @-@ game suspension . At the end of the year , he was again in the top ten ( eighth ) in PIMs , accumulating 166 , but his offensive production dropped to a mere nine points . The Flyers opted not to re @-@ sign the enforcer . 
 The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14 , 2006 , to a one @-@ year , $ 1 million contract . The signing was to provide Alexander Ovechkin with some on @-@ ice protection . Capitals management felt that Brashear was skilled enough not to be a liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence . During the 2006 – 07 season , the Capitals decided to extend Brashear 's contract , signing him to a one @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 1 million contract extension . He was suspended one game by the NHL during the regular season for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan . In the game , Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr , and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight . Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was dusting off his hands . Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear , who responded by punching him in the face , earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension . At season 's end , his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten ( sixth ) in the League for the sixth time in his career . In the 2007 – 08 season , Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals , but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs . However , he served as one of the Capitals ' alternate captains . On January 24 , 2008 , the Capitals once again re @-@ signed Brashear , this time to a one @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 2 million extension . 
 In the 2008 – 09 season , Brashear 's point total dropped to four , his lowest total since 1995 – 96 while he was with the Montreal Canadiens . During the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs , he earned a suspension for two separate on @-@ ice incidents . On April 26 , 2009 , the Capitals faced the New York Rangers in Game 6 of their first @-@ round series . In the pre @-@ game warm @-@ ups , Brashear shoved Rangers enforcer Colton Orr , then delivered a blind @-@ side hit to Blair <unk> @-@ way through the game 's first period . As a result of the hit , and a possible elbow , Betts suffered a broken orbital bone and was out indefinitely . Colin Campbell ruled that the hit was late on an unsuspecting player ; he also believed it targeted the head , and as a result caused significant injury . For his actions , Brashear was given a six @-@ game suspension by the League — one for the pre @-@ game altercation and five for the hit on Betts . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Brashear was not given an extension during the season , and prior to the start of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington , citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup . Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career , taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be the deciding factor in his destination . The Capitals , however , opted not re @-@ sign him . After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) ' s Vityaz Chekhov , he eventually agreed to a two @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 8 million contract with the New York Rangers . At an event for season @-@ ticket holders , Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post @-@ season . He set a personal milestone during the 2009 – 10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers . 
 Brashear struggled in New York , however , registering just one assist and 73 PIMs in 36 games ; he became unhappy with his role in New York and asked the Rangers for a trade . Following a stretch of seven @-@ straight and 12 of 13 games where he was a healthy scratch , the Rangers placed Brashear on waivers . After clearing waivers , he was assigned to the Rangers ' AHL affiliate , the Hartford Wolf Pack . Despite the demotion , Brashear was happy to be receiving steady ice time whilst in Hartford . 
 At the end of the season , the Rangers again placed Brashear on waivers , making him eligible for a contract buyout . Instead of buying @-@ out his contract , however , the Rangers traded Brashear on August 2 , 2010 , along with Patrick <unk> , to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for centre Todd White . Atlanta then placed Brashear on waivers and bought @-@ out the remaining year of his contract , thus making him an unrestricted free agent . At the end of the 2009 – 10 season , Brashear ranked 15th all @-@ time in NHL history for penalty minutes . 
 After not receiving serious interest from any NHL teams , Brashear opted to return to the <unk> and signed with Sorel @-@ Tracy GCI . He noted that his decision was based on his desire to continue playing hockey , his love for playing in the province of Quebec and a chance to reunite with some former teammates . He was later traded during the season to Rivière @-@ du @-@ Loup 3L to add talent and toughness to the team . Rivière @-@ du @-@ Loup considered the acquisition of Brashear a " coup , " noting that they could not pass up the chance to add him to the team . Late in the season , Brashear was given a suspension following a his actions in a brawl against Trois @-@ Rivières . During the melee , Brashear " attacked " goaltender Julien Ellis after he slashed one of Brashear 's teammates who was engaged in a different fight . Brashear hit Ellis with several gloved punches before one of Ellis ' teammates attempted to restrain Brashear . Brashear fought with the intervening player and after falling to the ice , Brashear continued to punch the " defenceless " player . He went back after the goaltender before a linesman tackled him . The suspension was originally set at eight games , but after the League met with Brashear and Rivière @-@ du @-@ Loup 's general manager , it was reduced to five games . 
 In November 2014 , Brashear stepped out of retirement and signed a contract with Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League ( SHL ) for the remainder of the season . He appeared scoreless in 12 games with Modo before concluding his <unk> career at the conclusion of the 2014 – 15 season . 
 = = International play = = 
 Brashear has represented the United States on two separate occasions . He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship , where he registered two goals and five points in eight games , helping the Americans to a sixth @-@ place finish . He later noted that he was surprised by the invitation , but felt that it gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer . He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship , playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Brashear was an enforcer ; his role was to protect his teammates if an opponent went beyond what is considered acceptable physical play to " dirty " play or taking " cheap shots . " Brashear was a tenacious <unk> , who created momentum by playing aggressive and delivering body checks , while possessing an underrated shot . Whilst fighting , he used a combination of balance and upper @-@ body strength while taking his time trying to control his opponents before landing punches . Although left handed by nature , he became adept at using either hand during fights . During his career in the NHL , Brashear was considered one of the toughest players in the League as well as one most feared . 
 In the January 2010 issue of The Hockey News , Brashear was named Enforcer of the Decade , noting that although he did not lead the NHL in number of fights , during the decade , he would have been involved in more if " he wasn 't so feared . " Hockey analyst Bill Clement states that " Brashear has a great sense of when his fighting skills are necessary and he picks his spots before dropping the gloves . He 's excellent at understanding when a bit of pugilism might well provide the push or nudge to get some momentum going for his team . " The Hockey News also assessed his skills by saying he possessed one of the most intimidating packages in the League , had a decent skating stride and was one of the best pugilists in the NHL . He was a bit too deliberate when handling and passing the puck , and fought much less as he got older , while slowly breaking down over time .

 = The Powerpuff Girls = 
 The Powerpuff Girls is an American animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken for Cartoon Network . The show centers on Blossom , Bubbles , and Buttercup , three girls with superpowers , as well as their father , the brainy scientist Professor Utonium , who all live in the fictional city of Townsville , USA . The girls are frequently called upon by the town 's childlike and naive mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers . 
 McCracken originally developed the show in 1992 as a cartoon short entitled Whoopass Stew ! while in his second year at CalArts . Following a name change , Cartoon Network featured the first Powerpuff Girls pilots in its animation showcase program What a Cartoon ! in 1995 and 1996 . The series made its official debut as a Cartoon Cartoon on November 18 , 1998 , with the final episode airing on March 25 , 2005 . A total of 78 episodes were aired in addition to two pilot shorts , a Christmas special , and a feature film . In addition , a tenth anniversary special was made in 2008 . A CGI special was also made in 2014 without McCracken 's input . 
 The series has been nominated for six Emmy Awards , nine Annie Awards , and a Kids ' Choice Award during its run . Spin @-@ off media include an anime , three CD soundtracks , a home video collection , and a series of video games , as well as various licensed merchandise . The series has received generally positive reception and won four awards . On June 16 , 2014 , Cartoon Network announced that the series would be rebooted , which premiered in the United States on April 4 , 2016 . 
 = = Premise = = 
 The show revolves around the adventures of three girls with superpowers : Blossom ( who is pink ) , Bubbles ( blue ) , and Buttercup ( green ) . The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows , with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters . In addition , the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face , such as sibling rivalries , loose teeth , personal hygiene , going to school , bed wetting , or dependence on a security blanket . Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture ( especially noticeable in the episode " Meet the Beat <unk> , " which is an homage to the Beatles ) . The cartoon always tries to keep different ideas within each episode with some small tributes and parodies thrown in . 
 The show is set mainly in the city of Townsville , USA . Townsville is depicted as a major American city , with a cityscape consisting of several major skyscrapers . In his review of The Powerpuff Girls Movie , movie critic Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution said , " the intricate drawings emanate 1950s futuristic pizzazz like a David Hockney <unk> , " and that the show is " one of the few American creations that is both gleeful pop culture and exquisite high art . "

 As depicted in the opening sequence of each episode , the Powerpuff Girls were created by Professor Utonium in an attempt " to create the perfect little girls " using a mixture of " sugar , spice , and everything nice " ( shown in respective fields of light blue , light green , and pink ) . However , he accidentally spilled a mysterious substance called " Chemical X " into the mixture , creating , instead of the " perfect little girl " , three girls ( each possessing one of the above elements dominating her personality ) , and granting all three superpowers including flight , super strength , super speed , near invulnerability , x @-@ ray vision , super senses , heat vision , energy projection , invisibility , and control over lightning . In the original pilot , the accidental substance was a can of " Whoopass " , which was replaced by " Chemical X " in the aired version . 
 The three girls all have oval @-@ shaped heads , abnormally large eyes ( inspired by Margaret Keane 's art ) , stubby arms and legs , and lack noses , ears , fingers , necks , and flat feet with toes ( McCracken preferred them to look more symbolic of actual girls rather than going for a " realistic " look , meaning fewer body parts were needed ) . They wear dresses that match the colors of their eyes with black stripes , as well as white tights and black Mary Janes . They do not have secret identities . The closing theme to the cartoon offers a nutshell description of the three Powerpuff Girls ' personalities : Blossom , commander and the leader . Bubbles , she is the joy and the laughter . Buttercup , ' cause she 's the toughest fighter . 
 Blossom ( voiced by Cathy <unk> ) is the tactician and self @-@ proclaimed leader of the Powerpuff Girls . Her personality ingredient is " everything nice " , her signature color is pink , and she has long red hair with a red bow and a heart @-@ shaped <unk> that can be seen from behind . She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation as shown in the Powerpuff Girls Movie . She is often seen as the most level @-@ headed , and composed member of the group and also strong and determined . Her unique power is freezing objects with her breath as seen in the episode " Ice Sore " . 
 Bubbles ( voiced by Tara Strong in the series and by Kath Soucie in the What a Cartoon ! episodes ) is the cute and sensitive one . Her personality ingredient is sugar , her signature color is blue , and she has short blonde hair in two pigtails . Bubbles is seen as kind and very sweet but she is also capable of extreme rage and can fight monsters just as well as her sisters can . Her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls " <unk> " , and she also loves animals . She exhibits the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals ( squirrels , cats , monsters ) , and her unique power is emitting supersonic waves with her voice . 
 Buttercup ( voiced by E. G. Daily ) is the toughest of the three . Her personality ingredient is spice , her signature color is green , and she has short black hair in a flip . She is a tomboy who loves to get dirty , fights hard and plays rough ; she does not plan and is all action . Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without a unique super power ( aside from being able to curl her tongue as shown in the episode " Nuthin ' Special " ) . But often is shown being much stronger than her sisters . For example , she often takes on many monsters her self and defeats them all . McCracken originally wanted to name the character " Bud " until a friend suggested the name Buttercup .

 During Craig McCracken 's first year in the character animation program of CalArts , he created a series of short cartoons based on a character called " No Neck Joe " . In June 1991 , he created a drawing of three girls on a small sheet of orange construction paper as a birthday card design for his brother . The following year he included the three girls as the main characters of his short film Whoopass Stew ! The Whoopass Girls in : A Sticky Situation . Initially , McCracken wanted to animate four Whoopass Girls shorts , but only one came to be . McCracken 's shorts were selected to be shown at Spike and Mike 's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in 1994 . 
 While working on 2 Stupid Dogs in 1993 , McCracken 's Whoopass Girls short was picked up for a series by Cartoon Network . However , the name Whoopass had to be dropped for the channel to include it as part of its new What a Cartoon ! animated shorts showcase mostly because the name Whoopass sounded inappropriate because it was pronounced whoop ass . The Whoopass Girls then became The Powerpuff Girls , and the " can of whoop ass " was renamed " Chemical X " . McCracken 's new short , entitled " The Powerpuff Girls in : Meat Fuzzy <unk> " , aired as part the network 's World Premiere Toon @-@ In on February 20 , 1995 . The short was not as popular as Dexter 's Laboratory , a project McCracken and former classmate Genndy Tartakovsky ( who also directed many episodes of Powerpuff Girls ) worked on together ; being the most popular of the shorts , Dexter 's Laboratory was the first to be greenlit by the network . Cartoon Network executive Mike Lazzo allowed McCracken to produce a new Powerpuff Girls short titled " Crime 101 " , which aired on What a Cartoon ! in early 1996 . Announcer Ernie Anderson , the narrator of the pilot episodes , died of cancer in 1997 , and he was replaced by Tom Kenny for the remainder of the series . 
 The Powerpuff Girls series debut on November 18 , 1998 , was the highest rated premiere in Cartoon Network 's history at the time . During its run , the series consistently scored the highest rating for an original series each week for the network across a wide range of demographics — from young children to adults . In October 2000 , Cartoon Network credited the series for its Friday night prime time ratings win among cable networks . By the end of 2000 , merchandising based on the series encompassed a whole variety of products , including T @-@ shirts , toys , video games , lunchboxes , and dishware . Concerning the show 's success , Craig McCracken has stated , " I thought it would get on Cartoon Network and college kids would watch it and there would be a few random T @-@ shirts out there in the rave scene or in record shops . But I had no idea that it would take off to this extent . " Following the series ' fourth season , McCracken left The Powerpuff Girls to focus on his new animated series , Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends , leaving Chris Savino to take his place . The show 's last original run episode was on March 25 , 2005 ; in all six seasons were made . Cartoon Network had offered to give McCracken and Savino a seventh season of The Powerpuff Girls , but they believed the series had run its course . 
 All of the original episodes were hand @-@ drawn and produced at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea , except the What a Cartoon ! shorts , with the first one being animated at Animal House in Japan and the second being animated at Fil Cartoons in the Philippines . James L. Venable , Thomas Chase , & Stephen Rucker composed the opening theme of the series , and Scottish band Bis performed the ending theme song , as played during the credits . The opening theme uses a sped @-@ up drum break sample of " Funky Drummer " performed by Clyde Stubblefield .

 In August 2008 , McCracken revealed on his DeviantArt account , as had been announced in that year 's Comic Con , that he was working with Cartoon Network on a new half @-@ hour Powerpuff Girls special to celebrate the series ' tenth anniversary . The special , titled " The Powerpuff Girls Rule ! ! ! " , aired on the Pan @-@ Euro Cartoon Network on November 29 , 2008 , on the Powerpuff Girls Birthday Marathon , and in the United States on January 19 , 2009 , as part of its 10th anniversary marathon .

 On January 28 , 2013 , a new CGI special titled Powerpuff Girls : Dance <unk> was announced to premiere that year , though it was later delayed to January 20 , 2014 . The former Beatle Ringo Starr promoted the special on Cartoon Network singing a new original song " I Wish I Was a Powerpuff Girl " with previews leading up to the airdate . Ringo also voiced a new character named Fibonacci Sequins in the episode . The special was directed by Dave Smith , who directed episodes for the series in the past , and featured the original cast members reprising their roles . This Powerpuff Girls special marked the first time that series creator Craig McCracken had no input . The episode 's plot has Mojo Jojo kidnap Fibonacci along with an opera singer and a badger . The girls rescue all of them , and defeat Mojo yet again with his kidnapping plan . Not deterred he then goes on to invent an evil video game called " Dance Pants R @-@ <unk> " to take over Townsville . Common Sense Media gave the special 3 / 5 stars citing the " tasteful update of the original animation style " however recommends it for older kids around the age of 7 . GON ( <unk> Out Nation ) gave the show a B rank and described it as " ... a good special with the return of the characters that many of us grew up [ with ] " , while they said that the special has few flaws .

The series deviated from its American predecessor in terms of style , storyline , and characterization , but only minimally retained the essential themes that made the original a success . The characters feature three junior high school students Momoko <unk> ( Hyper Blossom ) , Miyako <unk> ( Rolling Bubbles ) , and Kaoru Matsubara ( Powered Buttercup ) as the three heroines .

" Joly Herman of Common Sense Media describes the show as a " cute , highly stylized series thrills the senses with its strange characters , funny situations , and lots of lowbrow humor " . She goes on to say , however , that the show does go from innocent to violent in no time and that there is not much protecting young viewers against the violent undertones . Robert Lloyd of the LA Times said that the series might be " transgressive " based on the violence but " also cute " .

In another episode , Jack 's mother tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him , and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact . In an April 2010 Esquire interview , series creator Tina Fey said that one of the plots the show will never do is have Liz and Jack get together . " Let me put the Internet at ease : Liz and Jack will never be together . " Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook up ; he responded " I sincerely doubt it , and I think the show is better off that way .

 In the beginning of the episode , Liz dreams she is giving birth to Meat Cat , a fictional cartoon mascot for " cheesy blasters " , her favorite cheese snacks . This episode made reference to the mascot as it was first introduced in the fourth season 's premiere episode " Season 4 " . Many television reviewers have noted that Jack 's presentation on how to deal with overbearing mothers , given the acronym " ASQ " ( Always Speak Quietly ) , was a reference to Baldwin 's " ABC " ( Always Be Closing ) speech seen in the film Glengarry Glen Ross ( 1992 ) . The night vision video that Liz shows to her writing staff , in which she is seen sleepwalking , ordering a pizza and eating large amounts of junk food , was a parody of the 2009 horror film Paranormal Activity .

 TV Squad 's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks ' appearance , and said that her role as Jenna 's mother was " good casting . " His only complaint was that this episode had nothing to do with The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan , the fictional show on 30 Rock , and hoped that no other characters have to stay at Liz 's apartment .

" Margaret Lyons for Entertainment Weekly deemed " Verna " a solid episode from the show . Time contributor James Poniewozik enjoyed Hooks ' performance , and that it was good to see Jane Krakowski 's Jenna " get a story that was not solely about her being an insecure <unk> . "

" He noted that the main plot had funny moments but " there wasn 't much else to invest in . " Overall , Canning reasoned that this episode was very much a stand @-@ alone one " built for some good jokes , and not exactly focused on storytelling . [ ... ] An episode like ' Verna ' can still bring a lot of laughs , but you can 't help but feel like it 's missing that extra something . " Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star @-@ Ledger disliked both stories from " Verna " , and wrote that it was a disappointing episode , and that it was " pretty weak overall . " Meredith Blake , a contributor from the Los Angeles Times , reported that despite Hooks ' hilarious performance , the episode still felt a " little bit like filler " , and that there " wasn 't too much that was especially funny or memorable about it " .

 Supercell made a transition to vocalist Nagi Yanagi with their debut single " Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari " ( 2009 ) .

 On December 7 , 2007 , Ryo submitted the song " Melt " ( <unk> , <unk> ) to the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website , and since then the video has been viewed over 5 million times . For the song 's vocals , Ryo used the <unk> singing synthesizer software Hatsune Miku , and he used an illustration of Miku by an artist named 119 ( pronounced <unk> ) on the video without his permission .

 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Daniel Robson of The Japan Times described Supercell 's music as " sentimental J @-@ pop ... [ that ] also explores the genre 's jazzier , <unk> and <unk> elements . " Their sound has been compared to pop singers Aiko and Yui , and Ryo has stated himself that he likes expressing human emotions in his music . When creating a song , Ryo has often hummed a tune into a digital recorder , or starts by playing the piano . While it depends on the song , Ryo has stated he generally " play [ s ] the piano and take [ s ] notes of the chord progression " and then writes the lyrics . Ryo has cited " artists that blend rock and hip @-@ hop styles with today 's latest technology " as influencing his music , including : Massive Attack , Boom Boom Satellites , Portishead , Tricky , and Unkle . 
 Ryo found it difficult at first to write " tenderhearted " lyrics for songs meant to be sung by young women . When describing the lyrics for his songs using Hatsune Miku as the vocalist , Ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best , because the singer , as a computer program , would not feel embarrassed about singing the lyrics . He admitted that his friends would laugh when he played the songs , but he thought that " if a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl is supposed to be singing ... it is best if she sings about romance . " When writing lyrics for human singers , Ryo takes more care in writing lyrics that singers would not be embarrassed to sing . When Ryo receives an offer to compose theme music , he writes lyrics that tie in with the theme and mood of the given work , such as the ending themes " Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari " for the anime Bakemonogatari , and " Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni " for the visual novel <unk> no Yoru .

 The attacks at Fort Blue Mounds were two separate incidents which occurred on June 6 and 20 , 1832 , as part of the Black Hawk War . In the first incident , area residents attributed the killing of a miner to a band of Ho @-@ Chunk warriors , and concluded that more Ho @-@ Chunk planned to join Black Hawk in his war against white settlers . The second incident occurred east of the fort as a Sauk raiding party , estimated by eyewitnesses to be as large as 100 warriors , attacked two militia men who were investigating noises heard the night before . Two members of the militia stationed at Blue Mounds were killed in the attack , and both their bodies were badly mutilated .
