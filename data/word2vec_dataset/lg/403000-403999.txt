 Pascal and Maximus have garnered widespread universal acclaim from film critics , who greeted both characters with nearly equal praise but generally reviewed Maximus more enthusiastically . Citing both characters as " right on the money , " Jonathan Crocker of Total Film described Maximus as " A horse ... who thinks he 's John McClane . " Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic enthused , " In true Disney fashion , two of the most memorable characters are animals : Pascal ... and Maximus , a barrel @-@ chested horse with the tracking skills of a bloodhound and a sense of duty straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan . " The Chicago Tribune 's Michael Phillips wrote that both characters are " Very funny , very noble " and " lovely supporting character [ s ] . " Peter Travers of Rolling Stone admitted to having " fell hard " for Maximus and Pascal . Similarly , Lindsey Ward of Canoe.ca predicted Tangled Ever After , writing , " Kids and adults alike will also fall for Rapunzel 's trusty chameleon sidekick Pascal and palace horse Maximus -- whose hilarious role as Flynn 's foe @-@ turned @-@ BFF might just earn him his own spin @-@ off . " The Globe and Mail 's Jennie Punter hailed them as " characters that only Disney animators could so memorably portray . " Writing for the Miami Herald , Rene Rodriguez described both characters as " terrific , " while Alison Gang of U @-@ T San Diego called them " hilarious . " David Edelstein of Vulture.com admitted that he " can 't help liking a movie with chameleon reaction shots . " Joe Neumaier of the Daily News appreciated the fact that although " There are laughs involving ... Rapunzel 's silent chameleon sidekick ... directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard keep the tale grounded . " Observing the way in which animal sidekicks have become " Disney animation staples , " Doris Toumarkine of Film Journal International wrote that Pascal is " cute @-@ as @-@ can @-@ be , " likening the character to Jiminy Cricket from Disney 's Pinocchio ( 1940 ) . Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote that Pascal " is likely to charm the adults , further designating Tangled as silky @-@ smooth entertainment . " Norman Wilner of Now wrote that " the best performance is a silent one delivered by ... Maximus , a guardsman 's horse clearly modelled on Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive – but funnier . " Describing the character as " marvelously bothered , " Michelle Orange of Movieline wrote that Maximus is " given a nuanced fidelity and expressive agility so precise that it seems more human than human . " Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters called Maximus " magnificent . " Empire 's Helen O 'Hara wrote that Maximus is a " comic scene @-@ stealer and police horse extraordinaire . " While Ian Berriman of SFX dubbed Maximus the film 's " breakout star , " The Age 's Jim Schembri hailed the character as " the funniest horse in film history . " Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald labelled Maximus " The de facto star of ... Tangled " who " possesses the strength of Hercules , the nose of an airport sniffer dog and the <unk> of Harrison Ford . " 
 According to Greno and Howard , the decision to make Pascal and Maximus non @-@ speaking characters has been appreciated by both critics and audiences alike , explaining , " We 've gotten so many compliments about him and Pascal ... and so many people saying : ' Thank you for not making them talk . ' " Hailing Pascal and Maximus as " delightful supporting characters who continue yet another Disney custom without saying a word of dialogue " , Leonard Martin of Indiewire compared Pascal to a " comic Greek chorus " while dubbing Maximus " an extraordinarily expressive equine adversary ... who earns many of the movie 's biggest laughs . Similarly , The Wall Street Journal 's Joe Morgenstern wrote , " No one voices Maximus ... but he steals every scene he 's in " , while calling Pascal " endearing " . The Quad @-@ City Times ' Linda Cook reviewed , " it 's fun to watch the animal sidekicks express themselves , not through words , but facial expressions and body movements . The critters provide much of the comedy " , while Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times penned , " No talking animals here , although when they 're as amusing as a loyal chameleon and a horse who 's partly bloodhound and cop @-@ flick action hero , they don 't need to speak " , joking that the Brothers Grimm " probably wouldn 't object . " ABC Online " like [ d ] the way the animals were used " , explaining , " They don 't talk ... it really is funny " , accrediting this to executive producer John Lasseter 's influence on the film . Criticizing the script 's " abundant chatter , " Justin Chang of Variety commended the filmmaker 's " shrewd decision to have the animal sidekicks ... express themselves without the benefit of speech . " Similarly , Richard Corliss of Time wrote that both characters " radiate plenty of personality without speaking . " 
 Critics who were generally less positive in their opinions of Tangled and its main characters Rapunzel and Flynn Rider were otherwise impressed by Pascal and Maximus ' performances . The Liverpool Echo 's Catherine Jones felt that " Pascal and Maximus shamelessly scene @-@ steal from the human characters " , while Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail wrote , " The enjoyable visual gags generally come from the two animal sidekicks " . The Illinois Times ' Chuck <unk> wrote , " Throw in two animal sidekicks – wily horse Maximus and protective chameleon Pascal – and you have a film that , while not as moving as the Pixar movies , is a satisfying lark . " TV Guide opined that although " There 's nothing particularly innovative about Dan Fogelman 's screenplay " , the author wrote that " a cute animal sidekick ... extend [ s ] to the visual aspects of the film " . Similarly , Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote , " This ride 's a familiar one , but with humourous ( sic ) sidekicks such as horse @-@ who @-@ thinks @-@ he 's @-@ a @-@ dog Maximus and chameleon Pascal , it 's thoroughly enjoyable . " Although Dave White of Movies.com strongly panned Tangled , he dubbed Pascal and Maximus the film 's " Most Memorable Cliché " , writing that the characters " are better than the movie deserves . " White continued , " they both steal scene after scene from the Cream of Wheat @-@ like main characters " , concluding , " I kept wishing I was watching a movie about just them . " The Independent 's Anthony Quinn , who was ambivalent towards the film , admitted that Pascal and Maximus " provide some chuckles . " Similarly , Tom Huddleston of Time Out wrote , " With two such bland heroes , it 's good that plenty of attention is paid to the supporting characters , notably ... a bad tempered but loveable horse " , while Todd Hertz of Christianity Today called Maximus " a more complex , multi @-@ dimensional character than some movies ' leads " . Despite calling the film " bland " , the Houston Chronicle 's Amy Biancolli called Maximus a " stone cool " character . Tyler Hanley Palo Alto Weekly , however , praised the entire ensemble as a whole , calling Rapunzel , Flynn , Pascal and Maximus " a thoroughly enjoyable quartet . " In a lone lukewarm review , James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Pascal " among the least recognizable animal sidekicks ( although he possesses amusing mannerisms ) . " 
 In 2013 , M Magazine ranked Maximus the sixth best Disney sidekick , while Pascal was ranked eighth . In 2014 , BuzzFeed organized a list of the " Definitive Ranking of Disney <unk> " , ranking Pascal and Maximus fourth and fourteenth , respectively . Author Jemima Skelley described Pascal as " The most badass chameleon there ever was " while hailing Maximus as " The fiercest horse you 've probably ever seen . " <unk> , Glamour slightly preferred Pascal to Maximus in the magazine 's article " Our Favorite Disney Animals of All Time " . 
 = = = Merchandise = = = 
 Tom Huddleston of Total Film predicted that the popularity of Pascal and Maximus , combined with the success of Tangled , would ultimately provide Disney with promising merchandising opportunities , describing the characters as " tie @-@ in toys you just pre @-@ ordered in your head , " while Keith Uhlich of Time Out called them " action @-@ figure ready . " Pascal 's likeness has since been adapted into a wide variety of items , including toys , decorations and ornaments , costumes , clothing , jewellery and cosmetics , as demonstrated by the Disney Store 's website . In much of the film 's merchandise , Pascal is included alongside Rapunzel , namely play sets ; The Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set features miniature figurines of both Pascal and Maximus in addition to Rapunzel , Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel . However , merchandise inspired by Maximus remains less common . The character 's likeness has , however , been adapted into a plush toy . 
 = Charles Lloyd ( Australian general ) = 
 Major General Charles Edward Maurice Lloyd , CBE ( 2 February 1899 – 31 May 1956 ) was a senior officer in the Australian Army . Lloyd graduated from the Royal Military College , Duntroon in 1918 as a regular officer in the artillery and subsequently served in a range of staff and regimental positions in the inter @-@ war years . He later saw service in the Second World War , during which he held senior staff and administrative positions in the Middle East , the Netherlands East Indies , Papua and Australia . Later he worked as a newspaper executive , as chief of several United Nations agencies , and in private enterprise . Lloyd died in 1956 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Charles Lloyd was born on 2 February 1899 at South Fremantle , Western Australia , the second and only surviving child of Thomas Edward Lloyd , a postmaster , and his wife Edith , née Lock . His parents separated in 1901 and two years later his father committed suicide . He was subsequently raised by his mother who worked as a telephone attendant at Coolgardie , and then in Fremantle from 1909 . Lloyd was educated at Beaconsfield , Fremantle Boys ' Central and Perth Modern schools . 
 = = Military career = = 
 Entering the Australian Army in 1915 , Lloyd graduated from the Royal Military College , Duntroon in December 1918 as a regular officer in the artillery , too late to see action during the First World War . Lloyd was nicknamed " Gaffer " by the other cadets due to his serious demeanor , and Gavin Long considered him among the " ablest " of the group of officers that joined the Staff Corps at that time . He was appointed as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force upon completing his training at Duntroon and embarked from Sydney in January 1919 , being sent to the United Kingdom and later posted to France . Returning to the Permanent Military Force as the AIF was demobilised , he later completed his training serving with the British Army in England and India in 1919 – 20 . 
 Lloyd married Sybil Drummond in Melbourne on 31 December 1921 . He subsequently held junior staff and regimental postings in Australia during the 1920s , at the same time studying law at the University of Sydney . His next postings included various adjutant and quartermaster roles at battery and brigade level in the 2nd and 3rd Military Districts . Later he attended Staff College , Camberley , in the United Kingdom during 1932 – 33 . Next he was appointed Brigade Major of the 4th Divisional Artillery in Melbourne in 1934 , and was promoted to major in 1937 . He was posted to the Directorate of Artillery at Army Headquarters in Melbourne from 1938 to 1939 . 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Lloyd was seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) for overseas service . He held administrative posts in the 6th Division and I Australian Corps in the Middle East during 1940 , but was transferred before the 6th Division went into combat for the first time . In December that year , ranked colonel , he was posted to the 9th Division as the senior operational officer , serving as chief of staff to Major General Sir Leslie Morshead . In March , the 9th Division moved into the Western Desert , where they were to finalise their training and prepare to join the British advance through Libya . The landing of German forces around Tripoli in April forced the British and Commonwealth armies into withdrawal from Benghazi as the Afrika Korps arrived to reinforce the Italians in North Africa . The Axis forces subsequently began to advance west towards the strategic port of Tobruk . During the Siege of Tobruk which followed , Lloyd saw action between April and October 1941 , until the Australian units were relieved by British forces . Following the evacuation of the 9th Division from Tobruk by sea , Lloyd then served as chief liaison officer at AIF Headquarters , Middle East . 
 Departing the Middle East in late January 1942 , Lloyd was promoted to brigadier and flew to Batavia in the Netherlands East Indies , where elements of the 2nd AIF had been diverted to whilst returning from the Middle East in order to meet the Japanese threat following their initial attacks against British Commonwealth and US forces in the Pacific in December 1941 . He subsequently filled a senior staff posting in General Sir Archibald Wavell 's ABDA Command during its brief existence , holding the position of Deputy Intendant @-@ General with the temporary rank of major general between January and February 1942 . Rising from major to major general in less than two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , he became the youngest general officer in the Australian Army at the age of 42 . In this role he acted as Wavell 's chief administrative officer ; however , he advocated to the Australian high command against British proposals for I Corps remain in Java , which he believed was unsound and likely result in its loss given the precarious tactical situation there , and that it should instead be returned to Australia to be concentrated for operations against the Japanese elsewhere . Ultimately while a few Australian units were landed in Java , where they were inevitably captured in the fighting that followed , the bulk of the 6th and 7th Divisions were returned to Australia following pressure from the Australian government . 
 Following the Netherlands East Indies campaign , Lloyd returned to Australia in April 1942 and reverted to the rank of brigadier . He was subsequently appointed Director of Staff Duties at Land Headquarters ( LHQ ) in July . In September he was briefly posted to I Corps in Papua as Brigadier General Staff under Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Rowell . In February 1943 , Lloyd was promoted again to major general and appointed Adjutant General at LHQ by the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , General Sir Thomas Blamey , remaining in this position until 1946 . Blamey had reportedly been " dissatisfied " with the performance of the previous Adjutant General , Major General Victor Stantke , and appointed Lloyd to rejuvenate the office . Leaving the full @-@ time army , he transferred to the inactive reserve in February 1946 . Described by Chester Wilmot as " one of the ablest staff officers and most colourful characters of the AIF " , and by Wavell as " a staff officer of great quality " , during his service Lloyd had been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( 1941 ) and was mentioned in despatches three times ( 1941 – 42 ) . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1946 , Lloyd became a senior executive of the Argus & Australasian newspaper , before unsuccessfully seeking Liberal Party pre @-@ selection for a seat in Federal parliament the same year . In 1948 , he was appointed as a member of the government committee that reported on the administration of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan . His later work included postings as chief of the United Nations Refugee Organisation in Australia and New Zealand ( 1948 – 51 ) , and Chief of Mission of the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency ( 1951 – 53 ) . On return to Australia he took up a position as vice @-@ chairman of Navcot ( Aust . ) Pty Ltd , a private enterprise which was involved in shipping refugees from Europe as part of the post @-@ war immigration program . Whilst visiting relatives in Western Australia , Lloyd died of jaundice in the Repatriation General Hospital , in Hollywood , Perth , on 31 May 1956 and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery . He was survived by his wife , daughter and two sons . 
 = Spongiforma thailandica = 
 Spongiforma thailandica is a species of fungus in the Boletaceae family , genus Spongiforma . The stemless sponge @-@ like species , first described in 2009 , was found in Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand , where it grows in soil in old @-@ growth forests . The rubbery fruit body , which has a strong odor of coal @-@ tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum , consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore @-@ producing tissue . Phylogenetic analysis suggests the species is closely related to the Boletaceae genera Porphyrellus and Strobilomyces . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described scientifically in 2009 by E. Horak , T. <unk> and D.E. Desjardin , based on specimens collected in July 2002 in Khao Yai National Park , central Thailand , and roughly three years later in the same location . Prior to this , the species had been mentioned in a 2001 Thai publication as an unidentified species of <unk> . Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that Spongiforma is sister ( sharing a common ancestor ) to the genus Porphyrellus . The next most closely related genus is Strobilomyces . All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family , and in the Boletineae , one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder . 
 The genus name Spongiforma refers to the sponge @-@ like nature of the fruit body , while the specific epithet thailandica denotes the country in which the species is found . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body of Spongiforma thailandica is relatively large , up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter by 4 to 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall , and pale brownish @-@ gray to brown or reddish @-@ brown . It is sponge @-@ like and rubbery — if water is squeezed out it will assume its original shape . The surface has irregular , relatively large cavities ( locules ) , 2 – 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , lined with fertile ( spore @-@ producing ) tissue . The mushrooms do not have a stem , but rather a columella — a small internal structure at the base of the fruit body , resembling a column , extending up into the fruit body . The columella has dimensions of 10 – 15 mm tall by 8 – 10 mm diameter ( at the apex ) by 3 – 4 mm ( at the base ) , and it is attached to copious , fine white rhizomorphs . Fruit bodies have a strong odor of coal tar or burnt rubber ( likened to Tricholoma sulphureum ) . The mushroom tissue turns purple when a drop of 3 – 10 % potassium hydroxide is applied . 
 In mass , the spores appear to be brown to reddish @-@ brown in color . Viewed with a microscope , they are <unk> ( almond @-@ shaped ) , and typically measure 10 – 11 @.@ 5 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are cylindrical to roughly club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , with dimensions of 25 – 32 by 6 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 5 μm . They have straight sterigmata ( slender extensions that attach to the spores ) up to 9 @.@ 5 μm long . The cystidia ( large , sterile cells in the hymenium ) are cylindrical to roughly club @-@ shaped , thin @-@ walled , and measure 25 – 48 by 5 – 10 μm . They are inamyloid , meaning they will not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The cystidia are plentiful on the edges of the locules , and occasional among the basidia . The hymenophore is made of interwoven branched hyphae that are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion . These thin @-@ walled cylindrical hyphae have inflated septa ( intracellular partitions ) , and are gelatinous , hyaline ( translucent ) and inamyloid . The subhymenium ( the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium ) is made of inflated hyphae that are hyaline , inamyloid , thin @-@ walled , and non @-@ gelatinous , measuring 9 – 20 by 9 – 14 μm . 
 The fruit bodies vaguely resemble those of the species <unk> <unk> , found in Australia growing in association with Eucalyptus . However , <unk> fruit bodies grow underground , lack a strong odor , do not stain purple with potassium hydroxide , and have longer spores , typically 11 – 16 µm .

 Spongiforma thailandica was found growing on the ground in an old growth forest in Khao Yai National Park ( Nakhon <unk> Province , Thailand ) , at an elevation of about 750 meters ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) . The fungus is thought to grow in a mycorrhizal association with Shorea <unk> and Dipterocarpus gracilis . 
 = Wotton ( Metropolitan Railway ) railway station = 
 Wotton railway station was a small station in Buckinghamshire , England , built by the Duke of Buckinghamshire in 1871 . Part of a private horse @-@ drawn tramway designed to carry freight from and around his lands in Buckinghamshire , Wotton station was intended to serve the Duke 's home at Wotton House and the nearby village of Wotton Underwood . In 1872 the line was extended to the nearby town of Brill , converted to passenger use , equipped with steam locomotives , and renamed the Brill Tramway . In the 1880s , it was proposed to extend the line to Oxford , but the operation of the line was instead taken over by London 's Metropolitan Railway . 
 Although situated in an unpopulated area , Wotton station was relatively well used . It saw the highest passenger numbers of any station on the line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station , and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area 's dairy farms . In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway ( commonly known as the Alternative Route ) was opened , crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton . Although the lines were not connected , a station ( also named Wotton ) was built on the new line very near the existing Wotton station ; the two stations shared a stationmaster . 
 In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway , which leased the line , was taken into public ownership and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport . As a consequence , despite being a small rural station 49 miles ( 79 km ) by train from the City of London , Wotton became a station on the London Underground . Frank Pick , the Chief Executive of the London Passenger Transport Board , aimed to abandon freight operations on the London Underground network , and saw no way in which the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway could ever become viable passenger routes . As a result , all passenger services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn between 1935 and 1936 ; the last trains on the Brill Tramway ran on 30 November 1935 . The line then reverted to the descendants of the Duke of Buckingham , but having no funds and no rolling stock they were unable to operate it . On 2 April 1936 , the line 's entire infrastructure , including Wotton station , was sold for scrap at auction . Except for a small building which once housed the Brill Tramway 's forge , all the station buildings at Wotton have been demolished . 
 = = Wotton Tramway = = 
 On 23 September 1868 , the small Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway ( A & BR ) opened , linking the Great Western Railway 's station at Aylesbury to the London and North Western Railway 's Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction . On 1 September 1894 , London 's Metropolitan Railway ( MR ) reached Aylesbury , and shortly afterwards connected to the A & BR line , with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894 . Through trains from the MR 's London terminus at Baker Street began on 1 January 1897 . 
 Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple @-@ Nugent @-@ Brydges @-@ Chandos @-@ Grenville , 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos , had long had an interest in railways , and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861 . In the early 1870s , he decided to build a light railway to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A & BR 's line at Quainton Road . As the proposed line was to run on land owned by the Duke and by the Winwood Charity Trust , who consented to its construction , the line did not need Parliamentary approval and construction could begin immediately . 
 The first stage of the route , known as the Wotton Tramway , was a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood , opened on 1 April 1871 . Intended for use by horse trams only , the line was built with longitudinal sleepers , to reduce the risk of horses tripping . 
 = = = Extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use = = = 
 Residents of the nearby town of Brill lobbied the Duke for the introduction of passenger services on the line . This led to an upgrading and extension of the line from Wotton , via the original terminus of the tramway system at Wood Siding , to a new terminus at the foot of Brill Hill , north of the hilltop town of Brill itself . The new Brill railway station opened in March 1872 . In addition to freight trains which ran as and when required , two mixed trains per day ran in each direction . The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives , each with a top speed of 8 miles per hour ( 13 km / h ) , although a speed limit of 5 miles per hour ( 8 km / h ) was enforced . With the extension to Brill opened , the line began to be referred to as the Brill Tramway . 
 In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died , and in 1894 the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company ( O & ATC ) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford , but the extension beyond Brill was never built . Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time ; despite being an extremely roundabout route , had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built it would have been the shortest route between Oxford and the City of London . 
 The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899 , and from then on the MR ( the Metropolitan line of the London Underground from July 1933 ) operated all services on the line , although the line continued to be owned by the O & ATC . Throughout the operation of the Brill Tramway the track and stations remained in the ownership of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company ; the MR had an option to purchase the line outright , but it was never taken up . 
 = = Structures and sidings = = 
 Wotton station was situated in open countryside , about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the nearest settlement of Wotton Underwood , which in 1871 had a population of around 220 . Roughly halfway between the line 's terminus at Brill and the junction with the main line at Quainton Road , the station marked the official midpoint of the line for operating purposes . When more than one locomotive was in operation on the line , the Tramway operated a token signalling system using colour @-@ coded staffs ; drivers on the section between Quainton Road and Wotton were obliged to carry a blue staff ; those between Wotton and Brill ( and the Kingswood siding ) a red staff . The station was situated on a sharp curve ; had the extension to Oxford been built , the station would have needed to have been resited to accommodate longer and faster trains . 
 The original station was a crude earth bank 6 inches ( 150 mm ) high , held in place by wooden planks , but it was later rebuilt . The station was equipped with a short level platform , and a small 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) square goods shed . The main users of the goods facilities appear to have been the local dairy farms ; in the 1880s , prior to the transfer to Metropolitan Railway operation , Wotton station was handling from 45 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 gallons ( 200 @,@ 000 to 270 @,@ 000 l ; 54 @,@ 000 to 72 @,@ 000 US gal ) of milk each year . The passenger station building itself was a wooden hut with an iron roof , 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) long by 10 feet 9 inches ( 3 @.@ 28 m ) wide , including a waiting room , a booking office and male and female toilet facilities . Until the early 20th century the station porter was required to keep a three @-@ gallon kettle on the boil for foot warmers , should the passengers require them . A pair of small cottages were built near the station to house Tramway employees . 
 A small siding immediately west of the station originally led to a stable , which housed the Tramway 's horses . After the line 's mechanisation in 1872 the stables were closed , and the siding served a small cattle pen . 
 = = = Church Siding = = = 
 Slightly to the west of the station was a junction with a 1 mile 57 chain ( 1 mile 1 @,@ 300 yards ; 1 @.@ 8 km ) spur line known as Church Siding , which ran through Wotton Underwood to the hamlet of Kingswood . This spur line served two coal merchants , and never officially carried passengers ; it was never upgraded to carry locomotives and remained worked by horses throughout its existence . ( The siting of the coal bay at Kingswood was controversial , as it was inconveniently sited and built on low ground prone to flooding . The Duke and the line 's surveyor had disagreed on the best location for the depot ; to resolve the matter the Duke had thrown his hat in the air and the coal bay was built where the hat landed . ) The spur to Kingswood was abandoned in about 1915 , although a short stub , running between the Brill Tramway and the Duke of Buckingham 's home at Wotton House , remained open for occasional goods traffic until the line was closed . 
 = = = Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway = = = 
 On 2 April 1906 , the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway , commonly known as the Alternative Route , opened to passengers . The new line linked <unk> Junction on the Chiltern Main Line to the Great Central Railway at Grendon Underwood , a short distance northwest of Quainton Road . The Alternative Route crossed the Brill Tramway on a bridge at Wotton , and another station , also named " Wotton " , was built on the embankment immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station . Although the lines did not connect , a temporary siding was built from the Brill Tramway onto the new embankment , and used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line . The two Wotton stations were very close together , and the same stationmaster was responsible for both stations . 
 = = Passenger services = = 
 From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction , and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day . Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway , the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935 . Limited by poor quality locomotives and ungraded , cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills , and stopping at three intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and set down goods , passengers and livestock , trains ran very slowly ; in 1887 trains took between 35 and 45 minutes to travel from Wotton to Brill , and around an hour from Wotton to the junction station with the main line at Quainton Road . 
 Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad , and the use of the MR 's better quality rolling stock , reduced the journey time from Wotton to Brill and Quainton Road to around 10 minutes and 25 minutes respectively . Serving a lightly populated area , Wotton railway station saw little passenger use , although it was the most @-@ used station on the line other than Brill itself and the junction station at Quainton Road ; in 1932 , the last year of private operation , the station saw 2 @,@ 648 passenger journeys earning a total of £ 144 ( about £ 9 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) in passenger receipts . 
 = = Withdrawal of services = = 
 On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway , along with London 's other underground railways aside from the short Waterloo & City Railway , was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) . Thus , despite it being 45 miles ( 72 km ) and over two hours travel from the City of London , Wotton formally became a London Underground station , although in common with all other Metropolitan line stations north of Aylesbury it was never shown on the tube map . Frank Pick , Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB , aimed to move the network away from freight services and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes , concluding that over £ 2 @,@ 000 ( about £ 130 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway . 
 With Pick wanting to abandon freight services and seeing no future for the extremities of the former Metropolitan Railway as passenger routes , the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury . All services on the Brill Tramway were officially withdrawn on 1 December 1935 , with the last trains running on 30 November . While services were withdrawn completely from the Brill Tramway , the LPTB considered the Verney Junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a diversionary route , and continued to maintain the line and to operate freight services until 6 September 1947 . 
 = = Closure = = 
 Following the withdrawal of London Transport services the Metropolitan Railway 's lease was voided and the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company . With no funds and no rolling stock of its own the O & ATC was unable to operate the line , and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction .

 Wotton station on the Alternative Route , which had passed from the ownership of the Great Central Railway to the London and North Eastern Railway , remained open ( albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction ) until 7 December 1953 , when the line was abandoned . All buildings of the Brill Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished , other than a small building which had once housed the Tramway 's forge , which was left derelict . The bridge that had formerly carried the Alternative Route was demolished in 1970 , and the former Great Central Railway station on the Alternative Route was converted to a private house . 
 = <unk> nerve = 
 The pudendal nerve is the main nerve of the perineum . It carries sensation from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum , as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles , including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter . If damaged , most commonly by childbirth , lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence . The nerve may also be temporarily blocked as part of an anaesthetic procedure . 
 The pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term " Alcock 's canal " , after Benjamin Alcock , an Irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836 . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The pudendal nerve is paired , meaning there are two nerves , one on the left and one on the right side of the body . Each is formed as three roots immediately converge above the upper border of the <unk> ligament and the <unk> muscle . The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord , and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the <unk> ligament . The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second , third , and fourth sacral spinal nerves , with the primary contribution coming from the fourth . 
 The pudendal nerve passes between the <unk> muscle and <unk> ( <unk> ) muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen . It crosses over the lateral part of the <unk> ligament and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen . After reentering the pelvis , it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the <unk> fossa , being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal , along with the internal pudendal blood vessels . 
 Inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) . 
 = = = Nucleus = = = 
 The nerve is a major branch of the sacral plexus , with fibers originating in <unk> 's nucleus in the sacral region of the spinal cord . 
 = = = Variation = = = 
 The pudendal nerve may vary in its origins . For example , the pudendal nerve may actually originate off of the sciatic nerve . Consequently , damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well . Sometimes dorsal rami of the first sacral nerve contribute fibers to the pudendal nerve , and even more rarely S5 . 
 = = Function = = 
 The pudendal nerve has both motor and sensory functions . It does not carry parasympathetic fibers , but does carry sympathetic fibers . 
 The pudendal nerve supplies sensation to the penis in males and the clitoris in females , through the branches dorsal nerve of penis and dorsal nerve of clitoris . The posterior scrotum in males and the labia in females are also supplied , via the posterior scrotal nerves ( males ) or posterior labial nerves ( females ) . The pudendal nerve is one of several nerves supplying sensation to these areas . Branches also supply sensation to the anal canal . By providing sensation to the penis and the clitoris , the pudendal nerve is responsible for the afferent component of penile erection and clitoral erection . It is also responsible for ejaculation . 
 Branches also innervate muscles of the perineum and pelvic floor ; namely the <unk> and <unk> muscles , the levator ani muscle ( including the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and either <unk> in females or <unk> in males ) , the external anal sphincter ( via the inferior anal branch ) , and male or female external urethral sphincter . 
 As it functions to innervate the external urethral sphincter it is responsible for the tone of the sphincter mediated via acetylcholine release . This means that during periods of increased acetylcholine release the skeletal muscle in the external urethral sphincter contracts , causing urinary retention . Whereas in periods of decreased acetylcholine release the skeletal muscle in the external urethral sphincter relaxes , allowing voiding of the bladder to occur . ( Clarification : Unlike the internal sphincter muscle , the external sphincter is made of skeletal muscle , therefore it is under voluntary control of the somatic nervous system . )

 = = = Anesthesia = = = 
 A pudendal nerve block , also known as a saddle nerve block , is a local anesthesia technique used in a obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor . In this procedure , an anesthetic agent such as lidocaine is injected through the inner wall of the vagina about the pudendal nerve . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 The pudendal nerve can be compressed or stretched , resulting in temporary or permanent neuropathy . Irreversible nerve injury may occur when nerves are stretched by 12 % or more of their normal length . If the pelvic floor is over @-@ stretched , acutely ( e.g. prolonged or difficult childbirth ) or chronically ( e.g. chronic straining during defecation caused by constipation ) , the pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch @-@ induced neuropathy . <unk> nerve entrapment , also known as Alcock canal syndrome , is very rare and is associated with professional cycling . Systemic diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis can damage the pudendal nerve via demyelination or other mechanisms . A pelvic tumor ( most notably a large <unk> <unk> ) , or surgery to remove the tumor , can also cause permanent damage . 
 Unilateral pudendal nerve neuropathy inconsistently causes fecal incontinence in some , but not others . This is because crossover innervation of the external anal sphincter occurs in some individuals . 
 = = = Imaging = = = 
 The pudendal nerve is difficult to visualize on routine CT or MR imaging , however under CT guidance , a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal neurovascular bundle . The ischial spine , an easily identifiable structure on CT , is used as the level of injection . A spinal needle is advanced via the gluteal muscles and advanced within several millimeters of the ischial spine . Contrast ( X @-@ ray dye ) is then injected , highlighting the nerve in the canal and allowing for confirmation of correct needle placement . The nerve may then be injected with cortisone and local anesthetic to confirm and also treat chronic pain of the external genitalia ( known as <unk> in females ) , pelvic and <unk> pain . 
 = = = = Nerve latency testing = = = = 
 The time taken for a muscle supplied by the pudendal nerve to contract in response to an electrical stimulus applied to the sensory and motor fibers can be quantified . Increased conduction time ( terminal motor latency ) signifies damage to the nerve . 2 stimulating electrodes and 2 measuring electrodes are mounted on the examiner 's gloved finger ( " St Mark 's electrode " ) .

 The term pudendal comes from Latin <unk> , meaning external genitals , derived from <unk> , meaning " parts to be ashamed of " . The pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term " Alcock 's canal " , after Benjamin Alcock , an Irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836 . Alcock documented the existence of the canal and pudendal nerve in a contribution about iliac arteries in Robert Bentley Todd 's " The Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology " .

 = Symphony No. 3 ( Górecki ) = 
 The Symphony No. 3 , Op. 36 , also known as the Symphony of <unk> Songs ( Polish : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , is a symphony in three movements composed by Henryk Górecki in Katowice , Poland , between October and December 1976 . The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki 's dissonant earlier manner and his more tonal later style . It was premièred on 4 April 1977 , at the Royan International Festival , with Stefania Woytowicz as soprano and Ernest <unk> as conductor . 
 A solo soprano sings Polish texts in each of the three movements . The first is a 15th @-@ century Polish lament of Mary , mother of Jesus , the second a message written on the wall of a Gestapo cell during World War II , and the third a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the Silesian uprisings . The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child , and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent . The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war . 
 Until 1992 , Górecki was known only to connoisseurs , primarily as one of several composers responsible for the postwar Polish music renaissance . That year , Elektra @-@ Nonesuch released a recording of the 24 @-@ year @-@ old symphony that topped the classical charts in Britain and the United States . To date , it has sold more than a million copies , vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th @-@ century composer . This success , however , has not generated similar interest in Górecki 's other works . 
 = = Background = = 
 Despite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art ( often denounced as " formalist " by the communist authorities ) , post @-@ war Polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following the establishment of the Warsaw Autumn festival in 1956 . Górecki had won recognition among avant @-@ garde composers for the experimental , dissonant and serialist works of his early career ; he became visible on the international scene through such modernist works as <unk> , which was a success at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn , and his First Symphony , which was awarded a prize at the 1961 Paris Youth <unk> . Throughout the 1960s , he continued to form <unk> with other experimental and serialist composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen . 
 During the 1970s , Górecki began to distance himself from the serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work , and his Third Symphony , like the preceding choral pieces <unk> <unk> et <unk> ( Op. 32 , 1972 ) and Amen ( Op. 35 , 1975 ) , starkly rejects such techniques . The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki 's Third Symphony , and its reliance on repetition , marked a stage in Górecki 's progression towards the harmonic minimalism and the simplified textures of his more recent work . Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period , critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures , tonality , and melody , and who also infused many of their works with religious significance . Like @-@ minded composers , such as Arvo Pärt and John Tavener , are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term " holy minimalism , " although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences . 
 = = Composition = = 
 In 1973 , Górecki approached the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz in search of traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work . Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the Silesia region in south @-@ western Poland . Górecki was impressed by the melody " Where has he gone , my dear young son ? " ( <unk> się <unk> mój <unk> <unk> ? ) , which describes a mother 's mourning for a son lost in war , and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919 – 21 . Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement , but the words and the melody of Dygacz 's new version made a lasting impression on him . He said " for me , it is a wonderfully poetic text . I do not know if a ' professional ' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse , simple words . It is not sorrow , despair or resignation , or the wringing of hands : it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son . " 
 Later that year , Górecki learned of an inscription scrawled on the wall of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane , which lies at the foot of the Tatra mountains in southern Poland . The words were those of 18 @-@ year @-@ old Helena Wanda <unk> , a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944 . It read O Mamo , nie <unk> , nie . <unk> <unk> <unk> , Ty <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Oh Mamma do not cry , no . Immaculate Queen of Heaven , you support me always ) . The composer recalled , " I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words , by calls for revenge . Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way . But the sentence I found is different , almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble ; she is seeking comfort and support in simple , short but meaningful words " . He later explained , " In prison , the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud : ' I 'm innocent ' , ' Murderers ' , ' Executioners ' , ' Free me ' , ' You have to save me ' — it was all so loud , so banal . Adults were writing this , while here it is an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old girl , almost a child . And she is so different . She does not despair , does not cry , does not scream for revenge . She does not think about herself ; whether she deserves her fate or not . Instead , she only thinks about her mother : because it is her mother who will experience true despair . This inscription was something extraordinary . And it really fascinated me . " 
 Górecki now had two texts : one from a mother to her son , the other from a daughter to her mother . While looking for a third that would continue the theme , he decided on a mid @-@ 15th century folk song from the southern city of Opole . Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son dying on the cross : " O my son , beloved and chosen , Share your wounds with your mother ... " ( <unk> <unk> i <unk> , <unk> z <unk> <unk> <unk> ... ) . Górecki said , " this text was folk @-@ like , anonymous . So now I had three acts , three persons ... Originally , I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion . I even chose two verses ( 5 and 6 ) from Psalm 93 / 94 in the translation by Wujek : ' They humiliated Your people , O Lord , and afflicted Your heritage , they killed the widow and the passer @-@ by , murdered the orphans . ' " However , he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony " about war " . Górecki sought to transcend such specifics , and instead structured the work as three independent laments . 
 = = Instrumentation and score = = 
 The symphony is constructed around simple harmonies , set in a neo @-@ modal style which makes use of the medieval musical modes , but does not adhere strictly to medieval rules of composition . A performance typically lasts about 54 minutes . Ronald Blum describes the piece as " mournful , like Mahler , but without the bombast of percussion , horns and choir , just the sorrow of strings and the lone soprano " . The work consists of three elegiac movements , each marked Lento to indicate their slow tempi . Strings dominate the musical textures and the music is rarely loud — the dynamics reach fortissimo in only a few bars . 
 The symphony is scored for solo soprano , four flutes ( two players doubling on piccolos ) , four clarinets in B ♭ , two bassoons , two contrabassoons , four horns in F , four trombones , harp , piano and strings . Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces : 16 first violins , 16 second violins , 12 violas , 12 cellos , and 8 double basses . For most of the score , these are in turn divided into two parts , each notated on a separate staff . Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different parts , on ten separate staves . In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts , which are written on the same staff , so that ten staves are still used for a greater number of parts . 
 Unusually , the score omits oboes , English horns , bass clarinets , and trumpets . The bassoons , contrabassoons , and trombones play only in the first movement , and only for a few bars ( bassoons and contrabassoons : 339 – 342 and 362 – 369 ; trombones : 343 – 348 and 367 – 369 ) . 
 The musicologist Adrian Thomas notes that the symphony lacks dissonance outside of modal inflections ( that is , occasional use of pitches that fall outside the mode ) , and that it does not require nonstandard techniques or virtuosic playing . Thomas further observes that " there is no second @-@ hand stylistic referencing , although if predecessors were to be sought they might be found , distantly removed , in the music of composers as varied as Bach , Schubert , Tchaikovsky , and even Debussy . " 
 = = = Lento — <unk> tranquillo ma cantabile = = = 
 Typically 27 minutes in duration , the first movement equals the combined length of the second and third movements , and is based on a late @-@ 15th century lament of Mary from the <unk> Songs collection of the Holy Cross Monastery ( <unk> . <unk> Monastery ) in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains . Comprising three thematic sections , the movement opens with a canon based on a 24 @-@ bar theme , which is repeated several times . The canon begins in 2 parts ; then , for each repetition of the theme , an extra part is added , until the canon is in eight parts ( with the top two parts doubled at the octave , making for ten voices total ) , using a 24 @-@ bar melody in the Aeolian mode on E. It begins with the double basses , 2nd part , with each succeeding entry occurring one measure later ( i.e. , a new entry begins every 25 measures ) , each starting a diatonic fifth above the last . That means that each appearance of the melody in a new part is in a different mode , in this order : 
 Aeolian on E ( double basses , 2nd part ) 
 Phrygian on B ( double basses , 1st part ) 
 Locrian on F ♯ ( cellos , 2nd part ) 
 Lydian on C ( cellos , 1st part ) 
 Ionian on G ( violas , 2nd part ) 
 Mixolydian on D ( violas , 1st part ) 
 Dorian on A ( 2nd violins , 2nd part ) 
 Aeolian on E ( 1st violins , 2nd part ) 
 After the 8 @-@ part canon is played , it is repeated , with the 1st parts of the 1st and 2nd violins ( silent up to this point ) doubling the other violin parts an octave higher . 
 After that , the canon continues , but the voices gradually drop out one by one , from the lowest upwards ; but the instruments in question , instead of falling silent , double a higher voice that is still playing . Eventually the canon ends , with all the strings ( except the double basses ) ending on a single note , E4 . 
 The soprano enters on the same note in the second section and builds to a climax on the final word , at which point the strings enter forcefully with the climax of the opening canon . The third section of the movement ( Lento — Cantabile semplice ) is a long dénouement , another canon based on the same melody in the opening canon ; but this time it starts with 8 parts ( the top two doubled in octaves ) , and the voices drop out , one by one , from high to low , leaving the movement to end with the second double basses playing the melody alone once more . 
 = = = Lento e largo — <unk> = = = 
 The nine @-@ minute second movement is for soprano , clarinets , horns , harp , piano , and strings , and contains a libretto formed from the prayer to the Virgin Mary inscribed by <unk> on the cell wall in Zakopane . According to the composer , " I wanted the second movement to be of a highland character , not in the sense of pure folklore , but the climate of Podhale ... I wanted the girl 's monologue as if hummed ... on the one hand almost unreal , on the other towering over the orchestra . " 
 The movement opens with a folk drone , A – E , and a melodic fragment , E – G ♯ – F ♯ , which alternate with sudden plunges to a low B ♭ – D ♭ dyad . Thomas describes the effect as " almost cinematic ... suggest [ ing ] the bright open air of the mountains " . As the soprano begins to sing , her words are supported by the orchestra until she reaches a climaxing top A ♭ . The movement is resolved when the strings hold a chord without diminuendo for nearly one and a half minutes . The final words of the movement are the first two lines of the Polish Ave Maria , sung twice on a repeated pitch by the soprano . 
 = = = Lento — Cantabile @-@ semplice = = = 
 The tempo of the third movement is similar to that of the previous two , and subtle changes in dynamism and mode make it more complex and involving than it may at first appear . With a duration of approximately seventeen minutes , it comprises three verses in A minor and , like the first movement , is constructed from evolving variations on a simple motif . The melody is established in the opening verse , and the second and third verses revisit the cradling motifs of the second movement . As in the second movement , the motifs are built up from inversions of plain triads and seventh chords stretching across several octaves . As the soprano sings the final words , the key changes to a pure diatonic A major which accompanies , in writer David Ellis 's words , the " ecstatic final stanza " : 
 O sing for him / God 's little song @-@ birds / Since his mother cannot find him . 
 And you , God 's little flowers / May you blossom all around / that my son may sleep a happy sleep . 
 The orchestra returns to A minor before a final postlude in A major . In Górecki 's own words : " Finally there came that unvarying , persistent , obstinate ' <unk> ' [ on the chord of A ] , sounding well when played piano , so that all the notes were audible . For the soprano , I used a device characteristic of highland singing : suspending the melody on the third [ C ♯ ] and descending from the fifth to the third while the ensemble moves stepwise downward [ in sixths ] " . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 The symphony was dedicated to Górecki 's wife Jadwiga <unk> . When asked why , Górecki responded , " Who was I supposed to dedicate it to ? " He never sought to explain the symphony as a response to a political or historical event . Instead , he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child . Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose . While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to Auschwitz , he resisted that interpretation of the symphony , which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context . Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms , an approach which Górecki also dismissed . Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history : 
 The symphony alludes to each of the main historical and political developments in Poland 's history from the 14th century to 1976 , the year of its composition . What is more , each of the three movements appears to represent a different age . . . and [ they are ] chronologically contiguous . The composer seems to have created three separate and discrete " chapters " in his summary of Poland 's history . 
 Górecki said of the work , " Many of my family died in concentration camps . I had a grandfather who was in Dachau , an aunt in Auschwitz . You know how it is between Poles and Germans . But Bach was a German too — and Schubert , and Strauss . Everyone has his place on this little earth . That 's all behind me . So the Third Symphony is not about war ; it 's not a Dies Irae ; it 's a normal Symphony of <unk> Songs . " 
 = = Critical and cultural reception = = 
 Górecki 's Symphony No. 3 was written in 1976 , when Górecki was , in the words of the music critic Jane <unk> , " a fiery figure , fashionable only among a small circle of modern @-@ music aficionados " . The 1977 world première at the Royan Festival , Ernest <unk> conducting , was reviewed by six western critics , all of them harshly dismissive . Heinz Koch , writing for Musica , said that the symphony " drags through three old folk melodies ( and nothing else ) for an endless 55 minutes " . Górecki himself recalled that , at the premiere , he sat next to a " prominent French musician " ( Górecki did not name names , though it was probably Pierre Boulez ) , who , after hearing the twenty @-@ one repetitions of an A @-@ major chord at the end of the symphony , loudly exclaimed " <unk> ! " 
 The symphony was first recorded in Poland in 1978 by the soprano Stefania Woytowicz . It was deemed a masterpiece by Polish critics , although , during the late 1970s and early 1980s , recordings and performances of the work were widely criticised by the press outside Poland . The symphony drew hostility from critics who felt that Górecki had moved too far away from the established avant @-@ garde style and was , according to Dietmar <unk> ( writing for Österreichische <unk> ) , " simply adding to the decadent trash that encircled the true pinnacles of avant @-@ gardism " . 
 In 1985 , the French filmmaker Maurice <unk> featured a section of the third movement in the ending credits of his movie Police . When the work was later repackaged as a " soundtrack album " , it sold well . Although <unk> 's name was featured prominently on the front cover , the sleeve notes on the back provided precious little information about the work , and Górecki 's name appeared in smaller type than those of the main actors . In the mid @-@ 1980s , British industrial music group Test Dept used the symphony as a backdrop for video collages during their concerts , recasting the symphony as a vehicle for the band 's sympathy with the Polish Solidarity movement , which Górecki also supported ( his 1981 piece Miserere was composed in part as a response to government opposition of Solidarity trade unions ) . During the late 1980s , the symphony received increasing airplay on US and British classical radio stations , notably Classic FM . The fall of communism helped to spread the popularity of Polish music generally , and by 1990 the symphony was being performed in major cities such as New York , London and Sydney . A 1991 recording with the London Sinfonietta , conducted by David Zinman and featuring the soloist Dawn Upshaw , was released in 1992 by the Elektra imprint Nonesuch Records . Within two years , the recording had sold more than 700 @,@ 000 copies worldwide ; the recording climbed to number 6 on the mainstream UK album charts , and while it did not appear on the US Billboard 200 , it stayed at the top of the US classical charts for 38 weeks and stayed on for 138 weeks . The Zinman / Upshaw recording has sold over a million copies . It probably counts as the best selling contemporary classical record of all time . 
 The writer Michael Steinberg described the symphony 's success as essentially a phenomenon of the compact disc , and while live performances are still given , they do not always sell out . Some critics , wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition , suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time . Stephen Johnson , writing in A guide to the symphony , wondered whether the commercial success of the work was " a flash in the pan " or would turn out to have lasting significance . In 1998 , the critic Michael Steinberg asked , " [ are people ] really listening to this symphony ? How many CD buyers discover that fifty @-@ four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don 't understand is more than they want ? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie ? " Steinberg compared the success of Górecki 's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958 : " Everybody rushed to buy the book ; few managed actually to read it . The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity . " Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording 's success , and later speculated that " perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music … . Somehow I hit the right note , something they were missing . Something , somewhere had been lost to them . I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed . " 
 At least a dozen recordings were issued in the wake of the success of the Nonesuch recording , and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide . The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow , including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir 's Fearless ( 1993 ) , in the soundtrack to Paolo Sorrentino 's La grande <unk> ( film ) ( 2013 ) , in Terrence Malick 's To the Wonder and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel 's Basquiat ( 1996 ) . An art gallery in Santa Fe , New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece . In 1995 German rock band Faust used the symphony in a music concrete piece " <unk> Der Stille Teil 1 " which can be found on their " <unk> " CD . The second movement , " Lento e largo " , is used in the documentary Chernobyl Heart . 
 = USS McDougal ( DD @-@ 54 ) = 
 USS McDougal ( Destroyer No. 54 / DD @-@ 54 ) was an O 'Brien @-@ class destroyer built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of David Stockton McDougal , a U.S. Navy officer notable for his leadership during an 1863 battle off Japan while in command of Wyoming . 
 McDougal was laid down by Bath Iron Works of Bath , Maine , in July 1913 and launched in April 1914 . The ship was a little more than 305 feet ( 93 m ) in length , just over 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 020 long tons ( 1 @,@ 040 t ) . She was armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns and had eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . McDougal was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 29 knots ( 54 km / h ) . 
 After her June 1914 commissioning , McDougal sailed off the east coast and in the Caribbean . She was one of seventeen destroyers sent out to rescue survivors from five victims of German submarine U @-@ 53 off the Lightship Nantucket in October 1916 , and carried 6 crewmen from a sunken Dutch cargo ship to Newport , Rhode Island . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , McDougal was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas . Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown , Ireland , McDougal made several unsuccessful attacks on U @-@ boats , and rescued survivors of ships sunk by the German craft . After a collision with a British cargo ship in February 1918 , McDougal was under repair until mid @-@ July , and afterwards , operated out of Brest , France . 
 Upon returning to the United States after the war , McDougal conducted operations with the destroyers of the Atlantic Fleet until August 1919 , when she was placed in reserve , still in commission . After a brief stint of operations in mid 1921 , she was placed in reserve until she was decommissioned at Philadelphia in May 1922 . In June 1924 , Ericsson was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the " Rum Patrol " . She operated under the name USCGC McDougal ( CG @-@ 6 ) until May 1933 , when she was returned to the Navy . In November she dropped her name to free it for a new destroyer of the same name , becoming known only as DD @-@ 54 . She was struck for the Naval Vessel Register in July 1934 and sold for scrapping in August . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 McDougal was authorized in March 1913 as the fourth of six ships of the O 'Brien class , which was an improved version of the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized in 1911 . Construction of the vessel was awarded to Bath Iron Works of Bath , Maine , which laid down her keel on 29 July 1913 . On 22 April 1914 , McDougal was launched by sponsor Miss Marguerite S. LeBreton , granddaughter of the Commander David Stockton McDougal , the ship 's namesake . The ship was the first U.S. Navy ship named for McDougal , notable for his leadership during an 1863 battle off Japan while in command of Wyoming . As built , the destroyer was 305 feet 6 inches ( 93 @.@ 12 m ) in length , 31 feet 1 inch ( 9 @.@ 47 m ) abeam , and drew 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 90 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 020 long tons ( 1 @,@ 040 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 171 long tons ( 1 @,@ 190 t ) when fully loaded . 
 McDougal had two Zoelly steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional triple @-@ expansion steam engine connected to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes . Four oil @-@ burning White @-@ Forster boilers powered the engines , which could generate 17 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) , moving the ship at the design speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ) . During her acceptance trials in May 1914 , McDougal averaged 31 @.@ 02 knots ( 57 @.@ 45 km / h ) in a 15 @-@ minute run , but topped out at 33 @.@ 7 knots ( 62 @.@ 4 km / h ) for a 4 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) , top @-@ speed run . 
 McDougal 's main battery consisted of 4 × 4 in ( 100 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 pounds ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 @-@ pound ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 feet per second ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yards ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . 
 McDougal was also equipped with eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the O 'Brien @-@ class ships , as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines . From sources , it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for McDougal or any of the other ships of the class .

 USS McDougal was commissioned into the United States Navy on 16 June 1914 at Boston under the temporary command of Lieutenant , junior grade , John H. Hoover ; Lieutenant Commander Leigh C. Palmer assumed command on 27 July . After a shakedown cruise , McDougal began duty with the Torpedo Flotilla , Atlantic Fleet . Prior to America ’ s entry into World War I , she operated out of New York and Newport , Rhode Island , and carried out maneuvers and tactical exercises along the east coast . 
 In early April 1915 , McDougal and destroyer Parker were temporarily assigned to patrol near the New York Quarantine Station . There were concerns by Dudley Field Malone , the local port collector , that some of the interned German steamships at New York might try to slip out during a heavy snowstorm . While onboard on McDougal during one of these patrols , Malone discovered what The New York Times termed a " widespread conspiracy " intended to supply British warships outside U.S. territorial waters , in violation of the American neutrality in World War I. 
 She cruised to the Caribbean and took part in fleet war games between January and May 1916 , and in addition served intermittently with the Neutrality patrol . In May , she was declared the " champion smokeless vessel " of the U.S. Navy by The Christian Science Monitor after she was able to steam at 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) for four hours without betraying her position by smoke . In June , The Washington Post reported that she was damaged during maneuvers off Cape Ann , and had to put in to the Boston Navy Yard for leak repairs . 
 At 05 : 30 on Sunday , 8 October 1916 , wireless reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the Lightship Nantucket , off the eastern end of Long Island . After an SOS from the British steamer West Point was received at about 12 : 30 , Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves ordered McDougal and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors . According to a firsthand account of the events by Nathan Levy , a quartermaster on McDougal , published on 22 October in The New York Times , the destroyer steamed the 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) distance to the lightship in three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , arriving after German submarine U @-@ 53 had stopped the Holland America Line cargo ship Blommersdijk and the British passenger ship Stephano . As Rose had done with three other ships U @-@ 53 had sunk earlier in the day , he gave passengers and crew aboard Blommersdijk and Stephano adequate time to abandon the ships . After sinking Blommersdijk with two torpedoes , Rose focused his attention on Stephano , having to signal McDougal and Benham to ask that the two destroyers move farther away so that he could sink the British ship . Six American destroyers witnessed U @-@ 53 sink the liner with her deck gun . In total , 226 survivors from U @-@ 53 's five victims were rescued by the destroyer flotilla ; McDougal rescued 6 of Blommersdijk 's men . 
 McDougal returned to the Caribbean for exercises during the first three months of 1917 , and then returned to New York and Newport to prepare for distant service . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Soon after the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917 , McDougal departed for Europe as a part of the first U.S. destroyer division sent overseas during the war . Steaming with Wadsworth , the division 's flagship , under the command of Joseph K. Taussig , McDougal , Porter , Davis , Conyngham , and Wainwright departed New York on 24 April and arrived at Queenstown , Ireland , on 4 May and began patrolling the southern approaches to the Irish Sea the next day . McDougal patrolled off the Irish coast , escorting convoys of merchant ships and troop transports , searching for German submarines , and performing rescue operations for ships sunk . When British ship Manchester Miller was torpedoed and sunk by U @-@ 66 on 5 June 1917 , McDougal sped to her assistance and rescued 33 survivors . 
 On 8 September , as McDougal escorted a convoy off the southwest coast of England , she detected a surfaced submarine in the early morning hours and gave chase at full speed . The U @-@ boat submerged about 500 yards ( 460 m ) ahead of the closing destroyer , and McDougal dropped two depth charges which brought an oil slick to the surface . According to the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships , McDougal 's actions prevented an attack on the convoy and resulted in " probable damage " to the submarine . 
 On 4 February 1918 , McDougal and the British cargo ship <unk> collided in the Irish Sea . The destroyer made her way to Liverpool and underwent repairs that lasted until mid @-@ July . Upon reentering service , McDougal was transferred to Brest to serve as an escort for convoys approaching the French port . 
 = = Postwar = = 
 Following the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 , which ended all fighting , McDougal remained in French waters for a time . Crewmen aboard McDougal helped raise money to provide a Thanksgiving dinner for 150 " poor children " of Brest on 28 November , Thanksgiving Day in the United States . When President Woodrow Wilson arrived at Brest on George Washington just over two weeks later , the destroyer served as part of that transport 's escort into the harbor . On 21 December , McDougal departed Brest 21 December with Destroyer Division 7 and reached New York 8 January 1919 . 
 McDougal resumed duty along the east coast and , during May , provided part of the comprehensive at @-@ sea support as U.S. Navy seaplanes undertook the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic . After completing exercises in the Caribbean , she was placed in commission , in reserve at New York on 7 August . She was laid up in reduced commission at Philadelphia and Charleston , South Carolina , in the years that followed . She was reactivated for training in New England waters during the summer of 1921 , but returned to Philadelphia , where she was decommissioned on 26 May 1922 . 
 = = United States Coast Guard career = = 
 On 17 January 1920 , Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States . Soon , the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant . The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol . To cope with the problem , President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission . McDougal was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924 . Designated CG @-@ 6 , McDougal was commissioned on 28 May 1925 , and joined the " Rum Patrol " to aid in the attempt to enforce prohibition laws . 
 In August 1929 , McDougal and Tampa were dispatched to locate and sink the steamer <unk> , which had been reported as abandoned and on fire in the Atlantic 1 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 000 km ) east of Norfolk , Virginia . In April 1933 , McDougal was one of the Coast Guard ships deployed to search for the U.S. Navy airship Akron when it crashed into the Atlantic on the night of 3 / 4 April . Later that same month , McDougal was dispatched to help the Italian steamer Voluntas when she had requested assistance on the 23rd , but was recalled when Voluntas rescinded the call for help . 
 After nearly eight years of Coast Guard service , McDougal was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1933 and returned to the custody of the U.S. Navy on 30 June . On 1 November 1933 , she dropped the name McDougal to free it for a new destroyer of the same name , becoming known only as DD @-@ 54 . The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934 , and , on 22 August , was sold for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments . 
 = Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution = 
 The Fourteenth Amendment ( Amendment XIV ) to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9 , 1868 , as one of the Reconstruction Amendments . The amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws , and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War . The amendment was bitterly contested , particularly by Southern states , which were forced to ratify it in order for them to regain representation in Congress . The Fourteenth Amendment , particularly its first section , is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution , forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) regarding abortion , Bush v. Gore ( 2000 ) regarding the 2000 presidential election , and Obergefell v. Hodges ( 2015 ) regarding same @-@ sex marriage . The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials , including those acting on behalf of such an official . 
 The amendment 's first section includes several clauses : the Citizenship Clause , Privileges or Immunities Clause , Due Process Clause , and Equal Protection Clause . The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship , overruling the Supreme Court 's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ( 1857 ) , which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States . The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted in such a way that it does very little . 
 The Due Process Clause prohibits state and local government officials from depriving persons of life , liberty , or property without legislative authorization . This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states , as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements that state laws must satisfy . 
 The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people within its jurisdiction . This clause was the basis for Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) , the Supreme Court decision that precipitated the dismantling of racial segregation , and for many other decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups . 
 The second , third , and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated . However , the second section 's reference to " rebellion and other crime " has been invoked as a constitutional ground for felony disenfranchisement . The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment 's provisions by " appropriate legislation " . However , under City of Boerne v. Flores ( 1997 ) , Congress 's enforcement power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court interpretation of the amendment .

 Section 1 . All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . 
 Section 2 . Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers , counting the whole number of persons in each State , excluding Indians not taxed . But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the Executive and Judicial officers of a State , or the members of the Legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State , being twenty @-@ one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty @-@ one years of age in such State . 
 Section 3 . No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress , or elector of President and Vice President , or hold any office , civil or military , under the United States , or under any State , who , having previously taken an oath , as a member of Congress , or as an officer of the United States , or as a member of any State legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any State , to support the Constitution of the United States , shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same , or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may , by a vote of two @-@ thirds of each House , remove such disability . 
 Section 4 . The validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law , including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion , shall not be questioned . But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States , or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave ; but all such debts , obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void . 
 Section 5 . The Congress shall have power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article .

 In the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed , Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment , the latter of which had formally abolished slavery . Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress , however , Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic @-@ dominated Southern States . Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation , rather than the three @-@ fifths previously mandated by the Three @-@ Fifths Compromise , the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population @-@ based House of Representatives , regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote . Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage , either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves , or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement . 
 In 1865 , Congress passed what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race , color , or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude . The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law , a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post @-@ war states . The Black Codes attempted to return ex @-@ slaves to something like their former condition by , among other things , restricting their movement , forcing them to enter into year @-@ long labor contracts , prohibiting them from owning firearms , and preventing them from suing or testifying in court . 
 Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill , President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27 , 1866 . In his veto message , he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress , and that it discriminated in favor of African @-@ Americans and against whites . Three weeks later , Johnson 's veto was overridden and the measure became law . Despite this victory , even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws . The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights , rather than relying on temporary political majorities . 
 Over 70 proposals for an amendment were drafted . In late 1865 , the Joint Committee on Reconstruction proposed an amendment stating that any citizens barred from voting on the basis of race by a state would not be counted for purposes of representation of that state . This amendment passed the House , but was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of Radical Republicans led by Charles Sumner , who believed the proposal a " compromise with wrong " , and Democrats opposed to black rights . Consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio , which would enable Congress to safeguard " equal protection of life , liberty , and property " of all citizens ; this proposal failed to pass the House . In April 1866 , the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress , a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex @-@ Confederates . The House of Representatives passed House Resolution 127 , 39th Congress several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action . The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed . Amendments to Sections 2 , 3 and 4 were adopted on June 8 , 1866 and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote . The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138 @-@ 36 vote . A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18 . 
 The Radical Republicans were satisfied that they had secured civil rights for blacks , but were disappointed that the amendment would not also secure political rights for blacks , in particular the right to vote . For example , Thaddeus Stevens , a leader of the disappointed Radical Republicans , said : " I find that we shall be obliged to be content with patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice , and leaving it , in many of its parts , to be swept through by the <unk> , the frosts , and the storms of despotism . " Abolitionist Wendell Phillips called it a " fatal and total surrender " . This point would later be addressed by the Fifteenth Amendment . 
 = = = Ratification by the states = = = 
 Ratification of the amendment was bitterly contested . State legislatures in every formerly Confederate state , with the exception of Tennessee , refused to ratify it . This refusal led to the passage of the Reconstruction Acts . Ignoring the existing state governments , military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified . It also prompted Congress to pass a law on March 2 , 1867 , requiring that a former Confederate state must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before " said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress " . 
 The first twenty @-@ eight states to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment were : 
 Connecticut – June 30 , 1866 
 New Hampshire – July 6 , 1866 
 Tennessee – July 18 , 1866 
 New Jersey – September 11 , 1866 ( Rescinded ratification – February 20 , 1868 / March 24 , 1868 ; re @-@ ratified – April 23 , 2003 ) 
 Oregon – September 19 , 1866 ( Rescinded ratification – October 16 , 1868 ; re @-@ ratified – April 25 , 1973 ) 
 Vermont – October 30 , 1866 
 New York – January 10 , 1867 
 Ohio – January 11 , 1867 ( Rescinded ratification – January 13 , 1868 ; re @-@ ratified – March 12 , 2003 ) 
 Illinois – January 15 , 1867

 Nebraska – June 15 , 1867 
 Iowa – March 16 , 1868 
 Arkansas – April 6 , 1868 
 Florida – June 9 , 1868 
 North Carolina – July 4 , 1868 ( After rejection – December 14 , 1866 ) 
 Louisiana – July 9 , 1868 ( After rejection – February 6 , 1867 ) 
 South Carolina – July 9 , 1868 ( After rejection – December 20 , 1866 ) 
 On July 20 , 1868 , Secretary of State William H. Seward certified that the amendment had become part of the Constitution on July 9 , 1868 , if withdrawals of ratification by New Jersey and Ohio were ineffective . The following day , Congress adopted and transmitted to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution and directing the Secretary of State to promulgate it as such . Both New Jersey and Ohio were named in the congressional resolution as having ratified the amendment . Their inclusion as ratifying states by Congress goes to the merits of rescinding a ratification after it has been affirmed , and of approving a ratification after it has been rejected . It would appear that Congress has determined both have no impact on the ratification process – see Coleman v. Miller . Accordingly , Seward issued an unconditional certificate of ratification , dated July 28 , 1868 , declaring that the Fourteenth Amendment had been duly ratified by the requisite three @-@ fourths of the states . During the preceding week , two additional states had ratified the amendment , which left no doubt that the amendment had indeed become operational . 
 The Fourteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified : 
 Alabama – July 13 , 1868 
 Georgia – July 21 , 1868 ( After rejection – November 9 , 1866 ) 
 Virginia – October 8 , 1869 ( after rejection – January 9 , 1867 ) 
 Mississippi – January 17 , 1870 
 Texas – February 18 , 1870 ( after rejection – October 27 , 1866 ) 
 Delaware – February 12 , 1901 ( after rejection – February 8 , 1867 ) 
 Maryland – April 4 , 1959 ( after rejection – March 23 , 1867 ) 
 California – May 6 , 1959 
 Kentucky – March 30 , 1976 ( after rejection – January 8 , 1867 ) 
 Since Ohio and New Jersey re @-@ ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 2003 , all U.S. states that existed during Reconstruction have ratified the amendment . 
 = = Citizenship and civil rights = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Section 1 of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state or state actor . <unk> or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment ; the Supreme Court held in the Civil Rights Cases ( 1883 ) that the amendment was limited to " state action " and , therefore , did not authorize the Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations ( though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution ) . U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Bradley commented in the Civil Rights Cases that " individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject @-@ matter of the [ 14th ] Amendment . It has a deeper and broader scope . It nullifies and makes void all state legislation , and state action of every kind , which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States , or which injures them in life , liberty or property without due process of law , or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws . " 
 The Radical Republicans who advanced the Thirteenth Amendment hoped to ensure broad civil and human rights for the newly freed people — but its scope was disputed before it even went into effect . The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted these principles enshrined in the Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and also to prevent a future Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote . This section was also in response to violence against black people within the Southern States . The Joint Committee on Reconstruction found that only a Constitutional amendment could protect black people 's rights and welfare within those states . 
 This first section of the amendment has been the most frequently litigated part of the amendment , and this amendment in turn has been the most frequently litigated part of the Constitution . 
 = = = Citizenship Clause = = = 
 The Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court 's Dred Scott decision that black people were not citizens and could not become citizens , nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship . Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act . The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power , and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <unk> this rule . 
 There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress and of the ratifying states , based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment , as well as the customs and understandings prevalent at that time . Some of the major issues that have arisen about this clause are the extent to which it included Native Americans , its coverage of non @-@ citizens legally present in the United States when they have a child , whether the clause allows revocation of citizenship , and whether the clause applies to illegal immigrants . 
 Historian Eric Foner , who has explored the question of U.S. birthright citizenship to other countries and argues that : 
 Many things claimed as uniquely American — a devotion to individual freedom , for example , or social opportunity — exist in other countries . But birthright citizenship does make the United States ( along with Canada ) unique in the developed world . [ ... ] Birthright citizenship is one expression of the commitment to equality and the expansion of national consciousness that marked Reconstruction . [ ... ] Birthright citizenship is one legacy of the titanic struggle of the Reconstruction era to create a genuine democracy grounded in the principle of equality . 
 = = = = Native Americans = = = = 
 During the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan — the author of the Citizenship Clause — described the clause as having the same content , despite different wording , as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866 , namely , that it excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and " persons born in the United States who are foreigners , aliens , who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers . " According to historian Glenn W. <unk> of Western Kentucky University , " A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause . " Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded . 
 Senator James Rood Doolittle of Wisconsin asserted that all Native Americans were subject to United States jurisdiction , so that the phrase " Indians not taxed " would be preferable , but Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull and Howard disputed this , arguing that the federal government did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes , which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States . In Elk v. Wilkins ( 1884 ) , the clause 's meaning was tested regarding whether birth in the United States automatically extended national citizenship . The Supreme Court held that Native Americans who voluntarily quit their tribes did not automatically gain national citizenship . The issue was resolved with the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 , which granted full U.S. citizenship to indigenous peoples . 
 = = = = Children born to citizens of other countries = = = = 
 The Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents . At the time of the amendment 's passage , three Senators , including Trumbull , the author of the Civil Rights Act , as well as President Andrew Johnson , asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth ; however , Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion . These congressional remarks applied to non @-@ citizens lawfully present in the United States , as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866 , and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants , although the law of the land continues to be based on the standard interpretation . Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of " birth tourism " , in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child 's citizenship . 
 The clause 's meaning with regard to a child of legal immigrants was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark ( 1898 ) . The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment , a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States — and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power — was a citizen of the United States . Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non @-@ Chinese descent . 
 = = = = Loss of citizenship = = = = 
 Loss of national citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances : 
 Fraud in the naturalization process . Technically , this is not loss of citizenship but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant never was a citizen of the United States . 
 Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship . This may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by the State Department or through other actions that demonstrate desire to give up national citizenship . 
 For much of the country 's history , voluntary acquisition or exercise of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship . This concept was enshrined in a series of treaties between the United States and other countries ( the Bancroft Treaties ) . However , the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk ( 1967 ) , as well as Vance v. Terrazas ( 1980 ) , holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship . However , Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States . 
 = = = Privileges or Immunities Clause = = = 
 The Privileges or Immunities Clause , which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states , was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV , which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states . In the Slaughter @-@ House Cases ( 1873 ) , the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship — " national citizenship " and " state citizenship " — and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship . The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that " owe their existence to the Federal government , its National character , its Constitution , or its laws . " The Court recognized few such rights , including access to seaports and navigable waterways , the right to run for federal office , the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country , the right to travel to the seat of government , the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government , the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , and the right to participate in the government 's administration . This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times . Largely as a result of the narrowness of the Slaughter @-@ House opinion , this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century . 
 In Saenz v. Roe ( 1999 ) , the Court ruled that a component of the " right to travel " is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause : 
 Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Slaughter @-@ House Cases ( 1873 ) , it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel . Writing for the majority in the Slaughter @-@ House Cases , Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges conferred by this Clause " is that a citizen of the United States can , of his own volition , become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein , with the same rights as other citizens of that State . " ( emphasis added ) 
 Justice Miller actually wrote in the Slaughter @-@ House Cases that the right to become a citizen of a state ( by residing in that state ) " is conferred by the very article under consideration " ( emphasis added ) , rather than by the " clause " under consideration . 
 In McDonald v. Chicago ( 2010 ) , Justice Clarence Thomas , while concurring with the majority in incorporating the Second Amendment against the states , declared that he reached this conclusion through the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause . Randy Barnett has referred to Justice Thomas 's concurring opinion as a " complete restoration " of the Privileges or Immunities Clause .

 The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only against the states , but it is otherwise textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment , which applies against the federal government ; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process . Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person 's protected interests in life , liberty , or property , and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights , which were originally applied against only the federal government , and applies them against the states . 
 = = = = Substantive due process = = = = 
 Beginning with <unk> v. Louisiana ( 1897 ) , the Court interpreted the Due Process Clause as providing substantive protection to private contracts , thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation ; this principle was referred to as " freedom of contract " . Thus , the Court struck down a law decreeing maximum hours for workers in a bakery in Lochner v. New York ( 1905 ) and struck down a minimum wage law in Adkins v. Children 's Hospital ( 1923 ) . In Meyer v. Nebraska ( 1923 ) , the Court stated that the " liberty " protected by the Due Process Clause 
 [ w ] ithout doubt ... denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract , to engage in any of the common occupations of life , to acquire useful knowledge , to marry , establish a home and bring up children , to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience , and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men . 
 However , the Court did uphold some economic regulation , such as state Prohibition laws ( Mugler v. Kansas , 1887 ) , laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers ( Holden v. Hardy , 1898 ) , laws declaring maximum hours for female workers ( Muller v. Oregon , 1908 ) , and President Woodrow Wilson 's intervention in a railroad strike ( Wilson v. New , 1917 ) , as well as federal laws regulating narcotics ( United States v. Doremus , 1919 ) . The Court repudiated , but did not explicitly overrule , the " freedom of contract " line of cases in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish ( 1937 ) . 
 In Poe v. Ullman ( 1961 ) , dissenting judge John Marshall Harlan II adopted a broad view of the " liberty " protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause : 
 [ T ] he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution . This <unk> ' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property ; the freedom of speech , press , and religion ; the right to keep and bear arms ; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures ; and so on . It is a rational continuum which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints , . . . and which also recognizes , what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must , that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment . 
 This broad view of liberty was adopted by the Supreme Court in Griswold v. Connecticut ( for further information see below ) . Although the " freedom of contract " described above has fallen into disfavor , by the 1960s , the Court had extended its interpretation of substantive due process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in the Constitution but that , according to the Court , extend or derive from existing rights . For example , the Due Process Clause is also the foundation of a constitutional right to privacy . The Court first ruled that privacy was protected by the Constitution in Griswold v. Connecticut ( 1965 ) , which overturned a Connecticut law criminalizing birth control . While Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority that the right to privacy was found in the " penumbras " of various provisions in the Bill of Rights , Justices Arthur Goldberg and John Marshall Harlan II wrote in concurring opinions that the " liberty " protected by the Due Process Clause included individual privacy . 
 The right to privacy was the basis for Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) , in which the Court invalidated a Texas law forbidding abortion except to save the mother 's life . Like Goldberg 's and Harlan 's concurring opinions in Griswold , the majority opinion authored by Justice Harry Blackmun located the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause 's protection of liberty . The decision disallowed many state and federal abortion restrictions , and it became one of the most controversial in the Court 's history . In Planned Parenthood v. Casey ( 1992 ) , the Court decided that " the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed . " 
 In Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , the Court found that a Texas law against same @-@ sex sexual intercourse violated the right to privacy . In Obergefell v. Hodges ( 2015 ) , the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marriage included same @-@ sex couples being able to marry . 
 = = = = Procedural due process = = = = 
 When the government seeks to burden a person 's protected liberty interest or property interest , the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that , at a minimum , the government provide the person notice , an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing , and a decision by a neutral decision maker . For example , such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees , expel a student from public school , or cut off a welfare recipient 's benefits . 
 The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest . For example , in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co . ( 2009 ) , the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court . 
 = = = = Incorporation = = = = 
 While many state constitutions are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws , those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the Bill of Rights . In Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) , the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government , not the states . However , the Supreme Court has subsequently held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called " incorporation . " 
 Whether incorporation was intended by the amendment 's framers , such as John Bingham , has been debated by legal historians . According to legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar , the framers and early supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment believed that it would ensure that the states would be required to recognize the same individual rights as the federal government ; all of these rights were likely understood as falling within the " privileges or immunities " safeguarded by the amendment . 
 By the latter half of the 20th century , nearly all of the rights in the Bill of Rights had been applied to the states . The Supreme Court has held that the amendment 's Due Process Clause incorporates all of the substantive protections of the First , Second , Fourth , Fifth ( except for its Grand Jury Clause ) and Sixth Amendments and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment . While the Third Amendment has not been applied to the states by the Supreme Court , the Second Circuit ruled that it did apply to the states within that circuit 's jurisdiction in Engblom v. Carey . The Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in civil cases has been held not to be applicable to the states , but the amendment 's Re @-@ Examination Clause applies not only to federal courts , but also to " a case tried before a jury in a state court and brought to the Supreme Court on appeal . " 
 = = = Equal Protection Clause = = = 
 The Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with Black Codes . Under Black Codes , blacks could not sue , give evidence , or be witnesses . They also were punished more harshly than whites . In 1880 , the Supreme Court stated in Strauder v. West Virginia that the Equal Protection Clause was 
 designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons , and to give to that race the protection of the general government , in that enjoyment , whenever it should be denied by the States . 
 The Clause mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by the law . Although the text of the Fourteenth Amendment applies the Equal Protection Clause only against the states , the Supreme Court , since Bolling v. Sharpe ( 1954 ) , has applied the Clause against the federal government through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment under a doctrine called " reverse incorporation . " 
 In Yick Wo v. Hopkins ( 1886 ) , the Supreme Court has clarified that the meaning of " person " and " within its jurisdiction " in the Equal Protection Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans , but would extend to other races , colors , and nationalities such as ( in this case ) legal aliens in the United States who are Chinese citizens : 
 These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction , without regard to any differences of race , of color , or of nationality , and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws . 
 Persons " within its jurisdiction " are entitled to equal protection from a state . Largely because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states , the Supreme Court has rarely construed the phrase " within its jurisdiction " in relation to natural persons . In Plyler v. Doe ( 1982 ) , where the Court held that aliens illegally present in a state are within its jurisdiction and may thus raise equal protection claims the Court explicated the meaning of the phrase " within its jurisdiction " as follows : " [ U ] se of the phrase " within its jurisdiction " confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment 's protection extends to anyone , citizen or stranger , who is subject to the laws of a State , and reaches into every corner of a State 's territory . " The Court reached this understanding among other things from Senator Howard , a member of the Joint Committee of Fifteen , and the floor manager of the amendment in the Senate . Senator Howard was explicit about the broad objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment and the intention to make its provisions applicable to all who " may happen to be " within the jurisdiction of a state : 
 The last two clauses of the first section of the amendment disable a State from depriving not merely a citizen of the United States , but any person , whoever he may be , of life , liberty , or property without due process of law , or from denying to him the equal protection of the laws of the State . This abolishes all class legislation in the States and does away with the injustice of subjecting one caste of persons to a code not applicable to another . ... It will , if adopted by the States , forever disable every one of them from passing laws trenching upon those fundamental rights and privileges which pertain to citizens of the United States , and to all person who may happen to be within their jurisdiction . [ emphasis added by the U.S. Supreme Court ] 
 The relationship between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in Wong Wing v. United States ( 1896 ) . He observed with respect to the phrase " within its jurisdiction " : " The term ' person , ' used in the Fifth Amendment , is broad enough to include any and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic . A resident , alien born , is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to . He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled , and , as a consequence , he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws . ... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar — in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . " 
 The Supreme Court also decided whether foreign corporations are also within the jurisdiction of a state , ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court in which it was not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit . When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders , that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations . 
 In Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad ( 1886 ) , the court reporter included a statement by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in the decision 's headnote : 
 The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws , applies to these corporations . We are all of the opinion that it does . 
 This dictum , which established that corporations enjoyed personhood under the Equal Protection Clause , was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts . It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century , though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas . Between 1890 and 1910 , Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks , 288 to 19 . 
 In the decades following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , the Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from juries ( Strauder v. West Virginia , 1880 ) or discriminating against Chinese Americans in the regulation of laundry businesses ( Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 1886 ) , as violations of the Equal Protection Clause . However , in Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) , the Supreme Court held that the states could impose segregation so long as they provided similar facilities — the formation of the " separate but equal " doctrine . 
 The Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in Berea College v. Kentucky ( 1908 ) , holding that the states could force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from having both black and white students . By the early 20th century , the Equal Protection Clause had been eclipsed to the point that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. dismissed it as " the usual last resort of constitutional arguments . " 
 The Court held to the " separate but equal " doctrine for more than fifty years , despite numerous cases in which the Court itself had found that the segregated facilities provided by the states were almost never equal , until Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) reached the Court . In Brown the Court ruled that even if segregated black and white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers , segregation was inherently harmful to black students and so was unconstitutional . Brown met with a campaign of resistance from white Southerners , and for decades the federal courts attempted to enforce Brown 's mandate against repeated attempts at circumvention . This resulted in the controversial desegregation busing decrees handed down by federal courts in various parts of the nation . In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 ( 2007 ) , the Court ruled that race could not be the determinative factor in determining to which public schools parents may transfer their children . 
 In Plyler v. Doe ( 1982 ) the Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute denying free public education to illegal immigrants as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because discrimination on the basis of illegal immigration status did not further a substantial state interest . The Court reasoned that illegal aliens and their children , though not citizens of the United States or Texas , are people " in any ordinary sense of the term " and , therefore , are afforded Fourteenth Amendment protections . 
 In Hernandez v. Texas ( 1954 ) , the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects those beyond the racial classes of white or " Negro " and extends to other racial and ethnic groups , such as Mexican Americans in this case . In the half @-@ century following Brown , the Court extended the reach of the Equal Protection Clause to other historically disadvantaged groups , such as women and illegitimate children , although it has applied a somewhat less stringent standard than it has applied to governmental discrimination on the basis of race ( United States v. Virginia ( 1996 ) ; Levy v. Louisiana ( 1968 ) . ) 
 The Supreme Court ruled in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke ( 1978 ) that affirmative action in the form of racial quotas in public university admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ; however , race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI . In Gratz v. Bollinger ( 2003 ) and Grutter v. Bollinger ( 2003 ) , the Court considered two race @-@ conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan . The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity . In Gratz , the Court struck down a points @-@ based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status , finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause ; in Grutter , the Court upheld a race @-@ conscious admissions process for the university 's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission . In Fisher v. University of Texas ( 2013 ) , the Court ruled that before race can be used in a public university 's admission policy , there must be no workable race @-@ neutral alternative . In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action ( 2014 ) , the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action . 
 Reed v. Reed ( 1971 ) , which struck down an Idaho probate law favoring men , was the first decision in which the Court ruled that arbitrary gender discrimination violated the Equal Protection Clause . In Craig v. Boren ( 1976 ) , the Court ruled that statutory or administrative sex classifications had to be subjected to an intermediate standard of judicial review . Reed and Craig later served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws discriminating by gender . 
 Since Wesberry v. Sanders ( 1964 ) and Reynolds v. Sims ( 1964 ) , the Supreme Court has interpreted the Equal Protection Clause as requiring the states to apportion their congressional districts and state legislative seats according to " one man , one vote " . The Court has also struck down redistricting plans in which race was a key consideration . In Shaw v. Reno ( 1993 ) , the Court prohibited a North Carolina plan aimed at creating majority @-@ black districts to balance historic underrepresentation in the state 's congressional delegations . 
 The Equal Protection Clause served as the basis for the decision in Bush v. Gore ( 2000 ) , in which the Court ruled that no constitutionally valid recount of Florida 's votes in the 2000 presidential election could be held within the needed deadline ; the decision effectively secured Bush 's victory in the disputed election . In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry ( 2006 ) , the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay 's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause . 
 = = = State actor doctrine = = = 
 Individual liberties guaranteed by the United States Constitution protect , with exception of the Thirteenth Amendment 's ban on slavery , not against actions by private persons or entities , but only against actions by government officials . Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment , the Supreme Court ruled in Shelley v. Kraemer ( 1948 ) : " [ T ] he action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States . That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct , however discriminatory or wrongful . " The court added in Civil Rights Cases ( 1883 ) : " It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited . Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amendment . It has a deeper and broader scope . It nullifies and makes void all State legislation , and State action of every kind , which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States , or which injures them in life , liberty , or property without due process of law , or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws . " 
 Vindication of federal constitutional rights are limited to those situations where there is " state action " meaning action of government officials who are exercising their governmental power . In Ex parte Virginia ( 1880 ) , the Supreme Court found that the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment " have reference to actions of the political body denominated by a State , by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken . A State acts by its legislative , its executive , or its judicial authorities . It can act in no other way . The constitutional provision , therefore , must mean that no agency of the State , or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted , shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . Whoever , by virtue of public position under a State government , deprives another of property , life , or liberty , without due process of law , or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws , violates the constitutional inhibition ; and as he acts in the name and for the State , and is clothed with the State 's power , his act is that of the State . " 
 There are however instances where people are the victims of civil @-@ rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors . In the 1960s , the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action opening the door to wide @-@ ranging civil @-@ rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors ( i.e. , acts done or otherwise " sanctioned in some way " by the state ) . The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities , due process , and equal protection of the laws . 
 The critical factor in determining the existence of state action is not governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations , but " the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself . " " Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the <unk> involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance . " 
 The Supreme Court asserted that plaintiffs must establish not only that a private party " acted under color of the challenged statute , but also that its actions are properly attributable to the State . [ ... ] " " And the actions are to be attributable to the State apparently only if the State compelled the actions and not if the State merely established the process through statute or regulation under which the private party acted . " 
 The rules developed by the Supreme Court for business regulation are that ( 1 ) the " mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment , " and ( 2 ) " a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement , either overt or covert , that the choice must be deemed to be that of the State . " 
 = = Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives = = 
 Section 2 altered the way each state 's representation in the House of Representatives is determined . It counts all residents for apportionment , overriding Article I , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution , which counted only three @-@ fifths of each state 's slave population . 
 Section 2 also reduces a state 's apportionment if it wrongfully denies any adult male 's right to vote . However , this part of Section 2 was not enforced , and so Southern States continued to use pretexts to prevent many blacks from voting until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Abolitionist leaders criticized the amendment 's failure to specifically prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis of race . Section 2 protects the right to vote only of adult males , not adult females , making it the only provision of the Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex . Section 2 was condemned by women 's suffragists , such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony , who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights . The separation of black civil rights from women 's civil rights split the two movements for decades . 
 Some have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the Fifteenth Amendment , but the Supreme Court acknowledged the provisions of Section 2 in some later decisions . For example , in Richardson v. Ramirez ( 1974 ) , the Court cited Section 2 as justifying the states disenfranchising felons . In Hunter v. Underwood ( 1985 ) , a case involving disenfranchising black <unk> , the Supreme Court concluded that the Tenth Amendment cannot save legislation prohibited by the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment . More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause by the " other crime " provision of Section 2 . The Court held that Section 2 " was not designed to permit the purposeful racial discrimination [ ... ] which otherwise violates [ Section ] 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment . " 
 = = Participants in rebellion = = 
 Section 3 prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection , rebellion or treason . However , a two @-@ thirds vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation . In 1898 , the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3 's limitation . In 1975 , the citizenship of Confederate general Robert E. Lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution , retroactive to June 13 , 1865 . In 1978 , pursuant to Section 3 , the Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate president Jefferson Davis . 
 Section 3 was used to prevent Socialist Party of America member Victor L. Berger , convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his anti @-@ militarist views , from taking his seat in the House of Representatives in 1919 and 1920 . 
 = = Validity of public debt = = 
 Section 4 confirmed the legitimacy of all public debt appropriated by the Congress . It also confirmed that neither the United States nor any state would pay for the loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred by the Confederacy . For example , during the Civil War several British and French banks had lent large sums of money to the Confederacy to support its war against the Union . In Perry v. United States ( 1935 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that under Section 4 voiding a United States bond " went beyond the congressional power . " 
 The debt @-@ ceiling crises of 2011 and 2013 raised the question of what is the President 's authority under Section 4 . Some , such as legal scholar Garrett Epps , fiscal expert Bruce Bartlett and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , have argued that a debt ceiling may be unconstitutional and therefore void as long as it interferes with the duty of the government to pay interest on outstanding bonds and to make payments owed to pensioners ( that is , Social Security and Railroad Retirement Act recipients ) . Legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen has argued that Section 4 gives the President unilateral authority to raise or ignore the national debt ceiling , and that if challenged the Supreme Court would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss the case altogether for lack of standing . Erwin <unk> , professor and dean at University of California , Irvine School of Law , has argued that not even in a " dire financial emergency " could the President raise the debt ceiling as " there is no reasonable way to interpret the Constitution that [ allows him to do so ] " . Jack Balkin , Knight Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale University , opined that like Congress the President is bound by the Fourteenth Amendment , for otherwise he could violate any part of the amendment at will . Because the President must obey the Section 4 requirement not to put the validity of the public debt into question , Balkin argued that President Obama is obliged " to prioritize incoming revenues to pay the public debt : interest on government bonds and any other ' vested ' obligations . What falls into the latter category is not entirely clear , but a large number of other government obligations — and certainly payments for future services — would not count and would have to be sacrificed . This might include , for example , Social Security payments . " 
 = = Power of enforcement = = 
 Section 5 , also known as the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , enables Congress to pass laws enforcing the amendment 's other provisions . In the Civil Rights Cases ( 1883 ) , the Supreme Court interpreted Section 5 narrowly , stating that " the legislation which Congress is authorized to adopt in this behalf is not general legislation upon the rights of the citizen , but corrective legislation " . In other words , the amendment authorizes Congress to pass laws only to combat violations of the rights protected in other sections . 
 In Katzenbach v. Morgan ( 1966 ) , the Court upheld Section 4 ( e ) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which prohibits certain forms of literacy requirements as a condition to vote , as a valid exercise of Congressional power under Section 5 to enforce the Equal Protection Clause . The Court ruled that Section 5 enabled Congress to act both remedially and <unk> to protect the rights guaranteed by the amendment . However , in City of Boerne v. Flores ( 1997 ) , the Court narrowed Congress 's enforcement power , holding that Congress may not enact legislation under Section 5 that substantively defines or interprets Fourteenth Amendment rights . The Court ruled that legislation is valid under Section 5 only if there is a " congruence and proportionality " between the injury to a person 's Fourteenth Amendment right and the means Congress adopted to prevent or remedy that injury .

 The Pisa class consisted of three armored cruisers built in Italy in the first decade of the 20th century . Two of these were for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) and the third was sold to the Royal Hellenic Navy and named Georgios Averof . This ship served as the Greek flagship for the bulk of her active career and participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912 – 13 , fighting in two battles against the Ottoman Navy . She played a minor role in World War II after escaping from Greece during the German invasion in early 1941 . Influenced by communist agitators , her crew mutinied in 1944 , but it was suppressed without any bloodshed . Georgios Averof returned to Greece after the German evacuation in late 1944 and became a museum ship in 1952 . She is the only surviving armored cruiser in the world . 
 The two Italian ships participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 during which they supported ground forces in Libya with naval gunfire and helped to occupy towns in Libya and islands in the Dodecanese . They played a minor role in World War I after a submarine sank Amalfi shortly after Italy joined the war in 1915 . Her sister ship , Pisa , became a training ship after the war and was broken up for scrap in 1937 .

 The Pisa class was designed in 1904 by Italian engineer Giuseppe Orlando , who attempted to replicate on a smaller scale the armament and armor of the Regina Elena @-@ class battleships then entering the service of the Regia Marina . The Italians classified large armored cruisers like the <unk> as second @-@ class battleships . For ships of their displacement , they were considered to have been heavily armed , but inferior to battlecruisers , a type introduced during their lengthy construction time . 
 The Pisa @-@ class ships had a length between perpendiculars of 130 meters ( 426 ft 6 in ) and an overall length of 140 @.@ 5 meters ( 460 ft 11 in ) . They had a beam of 21 meters ( 68 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 1 meters ( 23 ft 4 in ) .

 The Italian ships mounted eight Cannone da 190 / 45 V Modello 1906 in four hydraulically powered twin @-@ gun turrets , two in each side amidships , as their secondary armament . These Vickers 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) guns fired 91 @-@ kilogram ( 201 lb ) AP shells at 850 – 870 m / s ( 2 @,@ 789 – 2 @,@ 853 ft / s ) . The Elswick Pattern ' B ' 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns aboard Georgios Averof used 90 @.@ 7 @-@ kilogram ( 200 lb ) AP shells which were fired at muzzle velocities of 844 m / s ( 2 @,@ 770 ft / s ) . 
 For defense against torpedo boats , all three ships mounted 16 Vickers quick @-@ firing ( QF ) Cannone da 76 / 40 V Modello 1908 guns . This gun fired a 6 @.@ 5 @-@ kilogram ( 14 lb ) projectile at a muzzle velocity of 930 meters per second ( 3 @,@ 100 ft / s ) . The ships were also fitted with eight ( Pisa and Amalfi ) or four ( Georgios Averof ) QF Cannone da 47 / 40 V Modello 1908 guns . The two Italian ships were equipped with three submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes while those of Georgios Averof were 457 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter . 
 During World War I , Pisa 's 76 and 47 mm guns were replaced by twenty 76 / 40 guns ; six of these were anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns while Georgios Averof received one additional 76 mm AA gun . During her 1925 refit , the latter ship had her light armament changed to four 76 mm low @-@ angle guns , two 76 mm AA guns , four 47 mm low @-@ angle guns and five 40 mm AA guns .

 Two of the three Pisa @-@ class armored cruisers were originally built for the Regia Marina . The third ship was built on speculation and was sold to Greece and completed as Georgios Averof , named after a wealthy Greek businessman who had left a sizeable legacy for the increase of the Greek Navy in his will . The ship participated in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V of the United Kingdom in 1911 shortly after commissioning . She served in the Balkan Wars and was instrumental in the Greek victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Battles of Elli and Lemnos during the First Balkan War . During World War I , Georgios Averof did not see much active service , as Greece was neutral during the first years of the war . After the Noemvriana riots of 1916 , she was seized by the French to ensure that she could do nothing against the <unk> . After the war 's end , the ship participated in the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1919 – 22 and helped in the evacuation of the refugees after the Greek Army 's defeat . In 1925 – 27 Georgios Averof was reconstructed in France and rearmed . 
 The ship was seized by rebels during the failed 1935 Greek coup d 'état attempt and was present at the 1935 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review for King George V. During World War II , the ship escaped to Egypt after the Allied defense began to collapse in 1941 during the Battle of Greece . She performed convoy escort and patrolling duties in the Indian Ocean until the end of 1942 . Her crew mutinied in early 1944 under the influence of communist sympathizers of the ELAN . The mutiny was suppressed and she ferried the Greek government @-@ in @-@ exile to Athens in late 1944 . She was decommissioned in 1952 and is now preserved as a museum ship in <unk> Bay near Athens . Georgios Averof is the only armored cruiser still in existence . 
 Pisa and Amalfi both participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , during which Pisa supported the occupations of Tobruk , Libya and several islands in the Dodecanese while Amalfi briefly blockaded Tripoli and supported the occupation of Derna , Libya . The sisters came together in 1912 and they bombarded the fortifications defending the entrance to the Dardanelles in July . After the end of the war , Amalfi escorted the Italian king and queen on the royal yacht to Germany and Sweden during a 1913 visit . 
 After Amalfi was sunk by the submarine U @-@ 26 ( actually the Imperial German submarine SM UB @-@ 14 flying the Austro @-@ Hungarian flag ) on 7 July 1915 , Pisa 's activities were limited by the threat of submarine attack , although the ship did participate in the bombardment of Durazzo , Albania in late 1918 . After the war she became a training ship and was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 before being scrapped . 
 = 55 Cancri d = 
 55 Cancri d ( abbreviated 55 Cnc d ) , also named Lipperhey , is an extrasolar planet in a long @-@ period orbit around the Sun @-@ like star 55 Cancri A. Located at a similar distance from its star as Jupiter is from our Sun , it is the fifth and outermost known planet in its planetary system . 55 Cancri d was discovered on June 13 , 2002 . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was Lippershey for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands . It honors the spectacle maker and telescope pioneer Hans Lippershey . In January 2016 , in recognition that his actual name was Lipperhey ( with Lippershey an error introduced in the 19th century ) , the exoplanet name was corrected to Lipperhey by the IAU and that name was submitted to the official sites that keep track of astronomical information . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , 55 Cancri d was detected by observing changes in its star 's radial velocity . This was achieved by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the star 's spectrum . At the time of discovery , 55 Cancri A was already known to possess one planet ( 55 Cancri b ) , however there was still a drift in the radial velocity measurements which was unaccounted @-@ for . 
 In 2002 , further measurements revealed the presence of a long @-@ period planet in an orbit at around 5 AU from the star . The same measurements also indicated the presence of another inner planet , designated 55 Cancri c . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 When 55 Cancri d was discovered , it was thought to be on a fairly low eccentricity orbit similar to Jupiter in the Solar System , though the orbital elements were not well determined . As more data were collected , the best @-@ fit solution for this planet turned out to be highly eccentric , more so than any of the planets in the Solar System . In 2008 , after a complete orbit of this planet had been observed , the true orbit was revealed , indicating that as had been originally suspected , the planet 's 14 year orbit was in fact near @-@ circular , located about 5 @.@ 77 AU from the star . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet 's mass can be obtained . In the case of 55 Cancri d , this lower limit was around 3 @.@ 835 times the mass of Jupiter . In 2004 , astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet 's orbit is inclined by around 53 ° with respect to the plane of the sky . If this measurement is confirmed , it implies that the planet 's true mass is 25 % greater than the lower limit , at around 4 @.@ 8 Jupiter masses ; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b ( both 85 ° ) . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Given the planet 's high mass , the planet is a gas giant with no solid surface . Since the planet has only been detected indirectly , parameters such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . 
 Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and that the planet 's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium , it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds : the planet 's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia @-@ based clouds that are typical of Jupiter . Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter , or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter 's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star . 
 = American bullfrog = 
 The American bullfrog ( <unk> <unk> or Rana catesbeiana ) , often simply known as the bullfrog in Canada and the United States , is an amphibious frog , a member of the family Ranidae , or “ true frogs ” . This frog has an olive green back and sides blotched with brownish markings and a whitish belly spotted with yellow or grey . The upper lip is often bright green and males have yellow throats . It inhabits large , permanent water bodies , such as swamps , ponds , and lakes , where it is usually found along the water 's edge . The male bullfrog defends a territory during the breeding season . His call is reminiscent of the roar of a bull , which gives the frog its common name . This frog is native to southern and eastern parts of the United States and Canada , but has been widely introduced across other parts of North , Central and South America , Western Europe , and parts of Asia , and in some areas is regarded as an invasive species . 
 The bullfrog is harvested for use as food in North America and in several countries into which it has been introduced . It is also cultured in controlled environments , though this is a difficult and not always successful undertaking . Some international trade in frog legs occurs for human consumption . Bullfrogs are used in biology classes in schools for dissection and are sometimes kept as pets . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Some authorities use the scientific name , <unk> catesbeiana , although others prefer Rana catesbeiana . A systematic review of the <unk> true frogs in 2016 used Rana catesbeiana , as does <unk> , an online compendium of amphibian names and information available at http : / / <unk> / . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The specific name , catesbeiana ( feminine ) or <unk> ( masculine ) , is in honor of English naturalist Mark Catesby . 
 = = Description = = 
 The dorsal ( upper ) surface of the bullfrog has an olive @-@ green basal color , either plain or with a mottling and banding of grayish @-@ brown . The ventral ( under ) surface is off @-@ white blotched with yellow or gray . There is often a marked contrast in color between the green upper lip and the pale lower lip . The teeth are tiny and are useful only in grasping . The eyes are prominent with brown irises and horizontal almond @-@ shaped pupils . The tympani ( eardrums ) are easily seen just behind the eyes and the dorsolateral folds of skin end close to them . The limbs are blotched or banded with gray . The forelegs are short and sturdy and the hind legs long . The front toes are not webbed , but the back toes have webbing between the digits with the exception of the fourth toe which is <unk> . 
 Bullfrogs are sexually dimorphic , with males being smaller than females and having yellow throats . Males have tympani larger than their eyes , whereas the tympani in females are about the same size as the eyes . Bullfrogs measure about 3 @.@ 6 to 6 in ( 9 to 15 cm ) from snout to vent . They grow fast in the first eight months of life , typically increasing in weight from 5 to 175 g ( 0 @.@ 18 to 6 @.@ 17 oz ) , and large mature individuals can weigh up to 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) . In some cases bullfrogs have been recorded as attaining 800 g ( 1 @.@ 8 lb ) and measuring up to 8 in ( 20 cm ) in length . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The bullfrog is native to eastern North America . Its natural range extends from the Atlantic Coast to as far west as Oklahoma and Kansas . It is not found on offshore islands near Cape Cod and is largely absent from Florida , Colorado , Nebraska , South Dakota , and Minnesota . It has been introduced into Nantucket island , Arizona , Utah , other parts of Colorado and Nebraska , Nevada , California , Oregon , Washington , and Hawaii . In these states , it is considered to be an invasive species and there is concern that it may outcompete native species of amphibians and upset the ecological balance . It is very common in California , where it is believed to pose a threat to the California red @-@ legged frog and is considered to be a factor in the decline of that vulnerable species . 
 Other countries into which the bullfrog has been introduced include Mexico , the western half of Canada , Cuba , Jamaica , Italy , the Netherlands , and France . It is also found in Argentina , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Colombia , China and Japan . The reasons for introducing the bullfrog to these countries have included their intentional release , either to provide a source of food or as biological control agents , the escape of frogs from breeding establishments , and the escape or release of frogs kept as pets . Conservationists are concerned the bullfrog is relatively immune to the fungal infection chytridiomycosis and as it invades new territories , it may assist the spread of this lethal disease to more susceptible native species of frog . 
 = = Breeding behavior = = 
 The bullfrog breeding season typically lasts two to three months . A study of bullfrogs in Michigan showed the males arriving at the breeding site in late May or early June , and remaining in the area into July . The territorial males that occupy sites are usually spaced some 3 to 6 m ( 9 @.@ 8 to 19 @.@ 7 ft ) apart and call loudly . At least three different types of calls have been noted in male bullfrogs under different circumstances . These distinctive calls include territorial calls made as threats to other males , advertisement calls made to attract females , and encounter calls which precede combat . 
 The bullfrogs have a prolonged breeding season , with the males continuously engaging in sexual activity throughout . Males are present at the breeding pond for longer periods than females during the entire season , increasing their chances of multiple matings . The sex ratio is typically skewed toward males . Conversely , females have brief periods of sexual receptivity during the season . In one study , female sexual activity typically lasted for a single night and mating did not occur unless the females initiated the physical contact . Males only clasp females after they have indicated their willingness to mate . This finding refutes previous claims that a male frog will clasp any proximate female with no regard to whether the female has consented . 
 These male and female behaviors cause male @-@ to @-@ male competition to be high within the bullfrog population and sexual selection for the females to be an intense process . Kentwood Wells postulated leks , territorial polygyny , and harems are the most likely classifications for the bullfrog mating system . <unk> would be a valid description because males congregate to attract females , and the females arrive to the site for the purpose of copulation . In a 1980 study on bullfrogs in New Jersey , the mating system was classified as resource @-@ defense polygyny . The males defended territories within the group and demonstrated typical physical forms of defense . 
 = = = Choruses = = = 
 Male bullfrogs aggregate into groups called choruses . The male chorus behavior is analogous to the lek formation of birds , mammals , and other vertebrates . Choruses are dynamic , forming and remaining associated for a few days , breaking down temporarily , and then forming again in a new area with a different group of males . Male movement has experimentally been noted to be dynamic . In the Michigan study , the choruses were described as “ centers of attraction ” in which their larger numbers enhanced the males ’ overall acoustical displays . This is more attractive to females and also attractive to other sexually active males . Choruses in this study were dynamic , constantly forming and breaking up . New choruses were formed in other areas of the site . Males moved around and were highly mobile within the choruses . 
 A review of multiple studies on bullfrogs and other anurans noted male behavior within the groups changes according to the population density of the leks . At higher population densities , leks are favored due to the difficulty in defending individual territories among a large population of males . This variance causes differences in how females choose their mates . When the male population density is low and males maintain clearer , more distinct territories , female choice is mostly determined by territory quality . When male population density is higher , females depend on other cues to select their mates . These cues include the males ’ positions within the chorus and differences in male display behaviors among other determinants . Social dominance within the choruses is established through challenges , threats , and other physical displays . Older males tend to acquire more central locations while younger males were restricted to the periphery . 
 Chorus tenure is the number of nights that a male participates in the breeding chorus . One study distinguishes between chorus tenure and dominant tenure . Dominant tenure is more strictly defined as the amount of time a male maintains a dominant status . Chorus tenure is restricted due to increased risk of predation , lost foraging opportunities , and higher energy consumption . Calling is postulated to be energetically costly to anurans in general . Energy is also expended through locomotion and aggressive interactions of male bullfrogs within the chorus . 
 = = = Aggressive behavior = = = 
 To establish social dominance within choruses , bullfrogs demonstrate various forms of aggression , especially through visual displays . Posture is a key factor in establishing social position and threatening challengers . Territorial males have inflated postures while nonterritorial males remain in the water with only their heads showing . For dominant ( territorial ) males , their elevated posture reveals their yellow @-@ colored throats . When two dominant males encounter each other , they engage in a wrestling bout . The males have their <unk> clasped , each individual in an erect position rising to well above water level . The New Jersey study noted the males would approach each other to within a few centimeters and then tilt back their heads , displaying their brilliantly colored gular sacs . The gular is dichromatic in bullfrogs , with dominant and fitter males displaying yellow <unk> . The New Jersey study also reported low posture with only the head exposed above the water surface was typical of subordinate , or nonterritorial males , and females . High posture was demonstrated by territorial males , which floated on the surface of the water with their lungs inflated , displaying their yellow <unk> . Males optimize their reproductive fitness in a number of ways . Early arrival at the breeding site , prolonged breeding with continuous sexual activity throughout the season , ownership of a centrally located territory within the chorus , and successful movement between the dynamically changing choruses are all common ways for males to maintain dominant , or territorial , status within the chorus . Older males have greater success in all of these areas than younger males . Some of the males display a more inferior role , termed by many researchers as the silent male status . These silent males adopt a submissive posture , sit near resident males and make no attempt to displace them . The silent males do not attempt to intercept females but are waiting for the territories to become vacant . This has also been called the alternate or satellite male strategy . 
 = = Growth and development = = 
 After selecting a male , the female deposits eggs in his territory . During the mating grasp , or amplexus , the male rides on top of the female , grasping her just behind her fore limbs . The female chooses a site in shallow water among vegetation , and lays a batch of up to 20 @,@ 000 eggs , and the male simultaneously releases sperm , resulting in external fertilization . The eggs form a thin , floating sheet which may cover an area of 0 @.@ 5 to 1 m2 ( 5 @.@ 4 to 10 @.@ 8 sq ft ) . The embryos develop best at water temperatures between 24 and 30 ° C ( 75 and 86 ° F ) and hatch in three to five days . If the water temperature rises above 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) , developmental abnormalities occur , and if it falls below 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) , normal development ceases . Newly hatched tadpoles show a preference for living in shallow water on fine gravel bottoms . This may reflect a lesser number of predators in these locations . As they grow , they tend to move into deeper water . The tadpoles initially have three pairs of external gills and several rows of labial teeth . They pump water through their gills by movements of the floor of their mouths , trapping bacteria , single @-@ celled algae , protozoans , pollen grains , and other small particles on mucus in a filtration organ in their <unk> . As they grow , they begin to ingest larger particles and use their teeth for rasping . They have downward @-@ facing mouths , deep bodies , and tails with broad dorsal and ve <unk> fins . 
 Time to metamorphosis ranges from a few months in the southern part of the range to three years in the north where the colder water slows development . Maximum lifespan in the wild is estimated to be eight to ten years , but one frog lived for almost sixteen years in captivity . 
 = = Feeding = = 
 Bullfrogs are voracious , opportunistic , ambush predators that prey on any small animal they can overpower and stuff down their throats . Bullfrog stomachs have been found to contain rodents , small reptiles , amphibians , crayfish , birds , and bats , as well as the many invertebrates , such as insects , which are the usual food of <unk> frogs . These studies revealed the bullfrog 's diet to be unique among North American ranids in the inclusion of a large percentage of aquatic animals , such as fish , tadpoles , ram 's horn snails , and <unk> beetles . Bullfrogs can capture large , strong prey because of the powerful grip of their jaws after the initial <unk> tongue strike . The bullfrog is able to make allowance for light refraction at the water @-@ air interface by striking at a position posterior to the target 's perceived location . The comparative ability of bullfrogs to capture submerged prey , compared to that of the green frog , leopard frog , and wood frog ( L. clamitans , L. pipiens , and L. sylvaticus , respectively ) was also demonstrated in laboratory experiments . 
 Prey motion elicits feeding behavior . First , if necessary , the frog performs a single , orienting bodily rotation ending with the frog aimed towards the prey , followed by approaching leaps , if necessary . Once within striking distance , the bullfrog begins its feeding strike , which consists of a ballistic lunge ( eyes closed as during all leaps ) that ends with the mouth opening . At this stage , the fleshy , mucous @-@ coated tongue is extended towards the prey , often engulfing it , while the jaws continue their forward travel to close ( bite ) just as the tongue is retracted . Large prey that do not fit entirely into the mouth are stuffed in with the hands . In laboratory observations , bullfrogs taking mice usually swam underwater with prey in mouth , apparently with the advantageous result of altering the mouse 's defense from counter @-@ attack to struggling for air . <unk> is the most likely cause of death of endothermic ( warm @-@ blooded ) prey . 
 = = = Biomechanical background of tongue projection = = = 
 Ballistic tongue projection of the related leopard frog is possible due to the presence of elastic structures that allow storage and subsequent release of elastic recoil energy . This is what accounts for the tongue projecting with higher power output that would develop by muscular action alone . Also , such mechanism relieves the tongue ’ s musculature from physiological constraints such as limited peak power output - mechanical efficiency and thermal dependence by uncoupling the activation of the depressor <unk> ’ s contractile units from actual muscular movement . In other words , the kinematic parameters developed by contribution of the elastic structures differ from those developed by muscular projection , accounting for the difference in velocity , power output and thermal dependence . 
 = = Jumping - " Catch Mechanism " = = 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 Bullfrogs are able to jump distances ten times their body length thanks to the ability of activating muscular contractile units prior to extension of the plantaris muscle . In this process , <unk> contraction generates strain in elastic structures such as tendons , which in turn “ catch ” the energy generated by the strain . Such is subsequently released as the plantaris actively stretched during jumping , adding to the energy generated by muscular action alone , and thus generating <unk> powers that will allow the bullfrog to jump great distances . Thus , the catch mechanism relies on elastic structures acting as muscle power amplifiers thanks to their ability of absorbing elastic strain energy and retaining it for later explosive release during jumping . 
 = = = Advantages = = = 
 The fact that the catch mechanism relies on elastic structures used as power amplifiers implies a series of conditions much convenient for the bullfrog . <unk> and <unk> recordings of the plantaris muscle corroborate a relationship between presence of muscle @-@ tendon units and decreasing , variable gearing . By supplying additional work output through the coupling of elastic strain energy , elastic structures relieve the musculature from the need of shortening at velocities that would otherwise hinder the amount of force generated and thus , the magnitude of power output . This is also aided by a decreasing gearing , which makes it possible for the bullfrog to generate the desired velocity of movement by relieving the plantaris from <unk> shortening velocities , achieving the velocity desired by slower , forceful contractions . Like in the case of its ballistic tongue projection , elastic structures in the plantaris muscle also confer it thermal independence . Studies show that jumping peak power output and mechanical efficiency of high elevation frogs of the families Hyla , Eleutherodactylus , Colostethus and Atelopus , which achieve these at temperatures as low as <unk> , are not statistically different from those achieved by tropical Bufo frogs at <unk> . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Bullfrogs are an important item of prey to many birds ( especially large herons ) , North American river otters ( Lontra canadensis ) , predatory fish , and occasionally other amphibians . Predators of American bullfrogs once in their adult stages can range from 150 g ( 5 @.@ 3 oz ) belted kingfishers ( Megaceryle alcyon ) to 1 @,@ 100 pound American alligators ( Alligator mississippiensis ) . The eggs and larvae are unpalatable to many salamanders and fish , but the high levels of activity of the tadpoles may make them more noticeable to a predator not deterred by their unpleasant taste . Humans hunt <unk> as game and consume their legs . Adult frogs try to escape by splashing and leaping into deep water . A trapped individual may squawk or emit a piercing scream , which may surprise the attacker sufficiently for the frog to escape . An attack on one bullfrog is likely to alert others in the vicinity to danger and they will all retreat into the safety of deeper water . Bullfrogs may be at least partially resistant to the venom of copperhead ( Agkistrodon contortrix ) and cottonmouth ( Agkistrodon piscivorus ) snakes , though these species are known natural predators of bullfrogs as are northern water snakes ( Nerodia <unk> ) . 
 = = Human use = = 
 The American bullfrog provides a food source , especially in the Southern and some areas of the Midwestern United States . The traditional way of hunting them is to paddle or pole silently by canoe or flatboat in ponds or swamps at night ; when the frog 's call is heard , a light is shone at the frog which temporarily inhibits its movement . The frog will not jump into deeper water as long as it is approached slowly and steadily . When close enough , the frog is gigged with a multiple @-@ <unk> spear and brought into the boat . Bullfrogs can also be stalked on land , by again taking great care not to startle them . In some states , breaking the skin while catching them is illegal , and either grasping gigs or hand capture are used . The only parts normally eaten are the rear legs , which resemble small chicken drumsticks and can be cooked in similar ways . 
 Commercial bullfrog culture in near @-@ natural enclosed ponds has been attempted , but is fraught with difficulties . Although pelleted feed is available , the frogs will not willingly consume artificial diets , and providing sufficient live prey is challenging . Disease also tends to be a problem even when great care is taken to provide sanitary conditions . Other challenges to be overcome may be predation , cannibalism , and low water quality . The frogs are large , have powerful leaps , and inevitably escape after which they may wreak havoc among the native frog population . Countries that export bullfrog legs include Belgium , the Netherlands , Mexico , Bangladesh , Japan , China , Taiwan and Indonesia . Most of these frogs are caught from the wild , but some are captive @-@ reared . The United States is a net importer of frog legs . 
 The American bullfrog is used as a specimen for dissection in many schools across the world . It is the state amphibian of Missouri , Ohio , and Oklahoma . 
 = Music of Madagascar = 
 The highly diverse and distinctive music of Madagascar has been shaped by the musical traditions of Southeast Asia , Africa , Arabia , England , France and the United States as successive waves of settlers have made the island their home . Traditional instruments reflect these widespread origins : the <unk> and kabosy owe their existence to the introduction of the guitar by early Arab or European seafarers , the ubiquitous djembe originated in mainland Africa and the valiha — the bamboo tube zither considered the national instrument of Madagascar — directly evolved from an earlier form of zither carried with the first Austronesian settlers on their outrigger canoes . 
 Malagasy music can be roughly divided into three categories : traditional , contemporary and popular music . Traditional musical styles vary by region and reflect local ethnographic history . For instance , in the Highlands , the valiha and more subdued vocal styles are emblematic of the Merina , the predominantly Austronesian ethnic group that has inhabited the area since at least the 15th century , whereas among the southern Bara people , who trace their ancestry back to the African mainland , their a cappella vocal traditions bear close resemblance to the polyharmonic singing style common to South Africa . Foreign instruments such as the acoustic guitar and piano have been adapted locally to create uniquely Malagasy forms of music . Contemporary Malagasy musical styles such as the salegy or tsapika have evolved from traditional styles modernized by the incorporation of electric guitar , bass , drums and synthesizer . Many Western styles of popular music , including rock , gospel , jazz , reggae , hip @-@ hop and folk rock , have also gained in popularity in Madagascar over the later half of the 20th century . 
 Music in Madagascar has served a variety of sacred and profane functions . In addition to its performance for entertainment or personal creative expression , music has played a key part in spiritual ceremonies , cultural events and historic and contemporary political functions . By the late 19th century , certain instruments and types of music became primarily associated with specific castes or ethnic groups , although these divisions have always been fluid and are continually evolving . 
 = = Traditional music = = 
 Malagasy music is highly melodic and distinguishes itself from many traditions of mainland Africa by the predominance of chordophone relative to percussion instruments . Musical instruments and vocal styles found in Madagascar represent a blend of widespread commonalities and highly localized traditions . A common vocal style among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands , for instance , does not preclude differences in the prevalence of particular instrument types ( the valiha among the Merina , and the marovany and kabosy among the Betsileo ) . Similarly , the practice of tromba ( entering a trance state , typically induced by music ) is present on both the western and eastern coasts of the island but the vocal styles or instruments used in the ceremony will vary regionally . Music in Madagascar tends toward major keys and diatonic scales , although coastal music makes frequent use of minor keys , most likely due to early Arab influences at coastal ports of call . Malagasy music has served a wide range of social , spiritual and mundane functions across the centuries . 
 = = = Vocal traditions = = = 
 Vocal traditions in Madagascar are most often polyharmonic ; southern vocal styles bear strong resemblance to South African singing ( as exemplified by groups such as Salala or Senge ) , whereas Highland harmonies , strongly influenced in the past two hundred years by European church music , are more reminiscent of Hawaiian or other Polynesian vocal traditions . In the Highlands , and particularly in the 19th century , vocal performance by large groups called antsa was favored , while in the south and western coastal regions singing was performed with more elaborate ornamentation and in small groups . Musical performance in Madagascar has often been associated with spiritual functions . Music is a key component in achieving a trance state in tromba ( or bilo ) spiritual rituals practiced in several regions of the island , as it is believed that each spirit has a different preferred piece of music . The association between music and ancestors is so strong on the eastern coast that some musicians will put rum , cigarettes or other valued objects inside an instrument ( through the tone hole , for instance ) as an offering to the spirits to receive their blessings . Similarly , music has long been central to the famadihana ceremony ( periodic reburial of ancestors ' shroud @-@ wrapped mortal remains ) . 
 = = = Musical instruments = = = 
 Instruments in Madagascar were brought to the island by successive waves of settlers from across the Old World . Over 1500 years ago , the earliest settlers from Indonesia brought the oldest and most emblematic instruments , including the tube zither ( valiha ) which evolved into a box form ( marovany ) distinct to the island . Later settlers from the Arabian peninsula and the eastern coast of Africa contributed early lutes , whistles and other instruments that were incorporated into local musical traditions by the mid @-@ 16th century . The influence of instruments and musical styles from France and Great Britain began to have a significant impact on music in Madagascar by the 19th century .

 The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar , the valiha , is a bamboo tube zither very similar in form to those used traditionally in Indonesia and the Philippines .

It is typically tuned to a diatonic mode to produce complex music based on harmonic , parallel thirds accompanied by a melodic bass line . The strings are traditionally cut and raised from the fibrous surface of the bamboo tube itself , although a contemporary form also exists that instead uses bicycle brake cables for strings to give the instrument a punchier sound . 
 Strings may be plucked with the fingernails , which are allowed to grow longer for this purpose . The instrument was originally used for rituals and for creative artistic expression alike . However , beginning in the mid @-@ 19th century , playing the instrument became the prerogative of the Merina aristocracy to such an extent that possessing long fingernails became symbolic of nobility . While the tubular valiha is the most emblematic form of the instrument most likely due to its popularization by the 19th century Merina aristocracy , other forms of the instrument exist across the island . In the region around the eastern port city of Toamasina , for instance , valiha used in tromba ceremonies may take a rectangular box form called marovany . While some regions construct their marovany from wood , near Toamasina the box is constructed of metal sheeting with much thicker and heavier strings that produce a different sound from the bamboo and bicycle cable valiha of the Highlands . 
 The kabosy ( or <unk> ) is a four to six @-@ stringed simple guitar common in the southern Highlands moving toward the east , particularly among the Betsimisaraka and Betsileo ethnic groups . The <unk> , which is typically square or rectangular today , was originally circular in form , first made from a tortoise shell and later from wood carved into a rounded shape . <unk> and <unk> are the Antandroy names of a popular Southern chordophone similar to the kabosy but with nylon fishing line for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument 's tuning . 
 The jejy voatavo is a chordophone that traditionally has two sisal strings , three frets and a calabash resonator , although modern versions may have as many as eleven or thirteen strings , typically made of steel . A maximum of four of these are strung over the frets , while the rest are strung lengthwise down the sides of the neck and are strummed with the fingers in accompaniment to the primary melody which is played with a bow . This more elaborate jejy voatavo is especially popular among the Betsileo of the southern Highlands and the Betsimisaraka of the southeast , who play it in accompaniment to their sung epic poems , called rija . In 19th @-@ century Highlands society under the Kingdom of Imerina , the jejy voatavo was considered to be a slave instrument which only mature men were permitted to play . The <unk> , an evolved jejy with the sound box carved to resemble a three @-@ stringed fiddle , is popular among the Southern Antandroy and Bara ethnic groups . The simplest form of instrument in this family is the jejy lava ( musical bow ) , believed to have been brought to Madagascar by settlers from mainland Africa . 
 The piano was introduced to the royal Merina court in the early 19th century by envoys of the London Missionary Society , and soon afterward , local musicians began creating their own compositions for piano based on valiha technique . Piano compositions reached their peak with the Kalon 'ny Fahiny style in the 1920s and 1930s before declining in the 1940s . Today , the compositions of this period by pianist theatrical composers like <unk> Ratianarivo ( 1895 – 1949 ) and Naka <unk> ( 1892 – 1952 ) form part of the canon of classical Malagasy music and feature in the repertoire of Malagasy students of piano . 
 When the modern acoustic guitar was first popularized in Madagascar , it was adopted by the lower classes who were inspired by the Kalon 'ny Fahiny piano style but for whom the purchase of a costly piano was out of reach . Early guitarists adapted the piano style ( itself based on valiha style ) to this novel stringed instrument to create a genre that came to be known as ba @-@ gasy . Soon afterward , the guitar was widely disseminated throughout the island , producing an explosion of regionally distinctive Malagasy guitar styles inspired by the music played on local traditional instruments . Finger picking is the favored technique and guitarists frequently experiment with original tunings to obtain the desired range . One of the most common tunings drops the sixth string from E to C and the fifth string from A to G , thereby enabling the guitarist to capture a range approximating that of a vocal choir . The Malagasy acoustic guitar style has been internationally promoted by such artists as Erick Manana and pioneering Bara artist Ernest <unk> ( better known by his stage name D <unk> ) , who blends the rhythms of <unk> with innovative open tunings to approximate the sounds of the <unk> , valiha and marovany .

 The sodina , an end @-@ blown flute , is believed to be one of the oldest instruments on the island . There exists the more common and well @-@ known short sodina , about a foot long with six finger holes and one for the thumb , and another similar end @-@ blown flute over two feet long with three holes at the far end . Both are open @-@ ended and are played by blowing diagonally across the near opening . The master of sodina performance , Rakoto Frah , was featured on the 1000 Malagasy franc ( 200 ariary ) banknote after independence in 1960 and his death on September 29 , 2001 prompted national mourning . 
 The conch shell ( <unk> or <unk> ) is a similarly ancient instrument believed to have been brought over by early Indonesian settlers . Mainly played by men , it features a lateral blow hole in the Polynesian style and is typically reserved for ritual or spiritual uses rather than to create music for entertainment . The <unk> flute is a simple <unk> brought to Madagascar after 1000 CE by immigrants from Africa . 
 The two @-@ octave diatonic accordion ( <unk> ) , popular across Madagascar , is believed to have been imported by French colonists after 1896 . In the 20th century , the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra . In the 1970s , the renitra was incorporated for the performance of electrified salegy music . This accordion style was also integrated into the performance of tsapika , while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands . Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument , accordions continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of tromba ceremonial music . Artists like half @-@ brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players . Régis <unk> brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene , winning several international awards for his accordion performance . 
 A variety of European aerophones were introduced in the 19th century under the Merina monarchy . These most notably include bugles ( <unk> ) and clarinets ( mainty <unk> ) , and less frequently the trombone or oboe ( <unk> ) . Their use today is largely restricted to the Highlands and the hira gasy or <unk> bands that perform at famadihana ( <unk> ) , circumcisions and other traditional celebrations . Metal and wood harmonicas are also played . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Various types of membranophones , traditionally associated with solemn occasions , are found throughout the island . In the Highlands , European bass drums ( <unk> ) and snare drums introduced in the 19th century have replaced an earlier drum ( <unk> ’ ny <unk> ) traditionally beat to accentuate the discourse of a <unk> speaker during a hira gasy or other formal occasions where the oratory art of kabary is practiced . Only men can play the <unk> , while women and men may both play the smaller <unk> drum . The <unk> ( " male wood " ) drum produces the deepest sound and is reserved for the most significant occasions such as famadihana , circumcision ceremonies and the ancient festival of the royal bath . 
 = = = = Idiophones = = = = 
 Bamboo shakers ( <unk> ) filled with seeds are integral to the performance of tromba on the eastern coast of the island , although modern items such as empty insecticide tins or sweetened condensed milk cans filled with pebbles increasingly take the place of traditional bamboo . Shakers of this sort are used throughout Madagascar , commonly in conjunction with tromba and other ceremonies . During the slave trade era , another idiophone — a scraper called the <unk> — was popularized in Madagascar after being imported there from Brazil where it is known as a <unk> . 
 Early forms of xylophone such as the <unk> are found throughout the island and are believed to have come across with the original Indonesian settlers . The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women , one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box . Each woman strikes the <unk> with a pair of sticks , one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody . The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot @-@ resistant wood called <unk> . A similar xylophone called <unk> is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups . 
 = = Contemporary music = = 
 Contemporary music comprises modern @-@ day compositions that have their roots in traditional musical styles and have been created for entertainment purposes , typically with the intent of eventual mass dissemination via cassette , compact disc , radio or internet . Modern forms of Malagasy music may incorporate such innovations as amplified or imported instruments ( particularly electric guitar , bass guitar , synthesizer and drum kit ) , blend the sounds of new and traditional instruments or use traditional instruments in innovative ways . As contemporary artists adapt their musical heritage to today 's market , they manage to preserve the melodic , chordophone @-@ dominated sound that distinguishes traditional Malagasy music from the more percussion @-@ heavy traditions of mainland Africa . 
 = = = Highlands = = = 
 In the 1950s and 1960s , a variety of bands in the Highlands ( in the area between and around Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa ) were performing covers of European and American hits or adapting mainland African tunes for local audiences . Madagascar got its first supergroup in the 1970s with Mahaleo , whose members blended traditional Malagasy sounds with soft rock to enormous and enduring success . Rossy emerged as a superstar shortly afterward , adapting the instrumentation , rhythms and vocal styles of the hira gasy to create a distinctly Malagasy radio @-@ friendly sound . His open and enthusiastic support for then @-@ President Didier Ratsiraka assured his band regular performances in association with Presidential functions , and his band came to define the Ratsiraka epoch for many . 
 Other important contemporary musicians from the Highlands include Justin Vali and Sylvestre <unk> , both valiha virtuosos ; Rakoto Frah , who could play two sodina simultaneously ; Solo Miral , featuring guitar played in the style of a valiha ; <unk> , a Malagasy fusion band based in England ; <unk> Ricky , a highly accomplished solo vocalist , and Samoëla , a roots artist whose blunt social and political critiques propelled his group to popularity . 
 = = = Coastal styles = = = 
 Distinct contemporary forms of music , rooted in local musical traditions , have emerged in the coastal regions since the 1960s . Chief among these are two up @-@ tempo dance music styles that have become especially popular across Madagascar and have achieved crossover success : salegy , a 6 / 8 style that originated in the northwest around Mahajanga and Antsiranana , and tsapika , a 4 / 4 style centered in the southwest between Toliara and Betroka . Other key coastal styles include basesa of Diego @-@ Suarez and the northeast coast as popularized by Mika sy Davis , <unk> of Morondava and the southwestern interior performed by such groups as <unk> , mangaliba of the southern Anosy region , <unk> of the northeast as popularized by Jerry <unk> , the southern <unk> polyharmonic tradition performed by bands like Senge and <unk> , and kwassa @-@ kwassa and sega music from neighboring Reunion Island and Mauritius . 
 Salegy : Salegy today , as it has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and Mily Clément or relative newcomers <unk> <unk> , Wawa , <unk> <unk> or Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars , is a funky , energetic form of dance music dominated by ringing electric guitars , accordion ( real or synthesized ) , and call @-@ and @-@ response polyphonic vocals , propelled by heavy electric bass and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit , djembe and shakers . Salegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals as performed by Mama Sana . 
 In addition to their commonalities in tempo , vocal style , and tendency toward minor keys ( which some attribute to an Arab influence , and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music ) , the salegy shares the antsa 's structure in that it always features a middle section called the <unk> ( " broken " ) which is primarily instrumental — voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing — and during which the vocalists ( and the audience ) will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand @-@ clapping to the beat of the music . 
 <unk> : Like the salegy , tsapika ( or <unk> ) is an energetic form of dance music that originated from the traditional music of the southwestern region around Toliara and that has recently been adapted to contemporary instruments such as electric guitar , bass guitar and drum kit . Generally even more rapid than the salegy , this 4 / 4 form of music features a guitar performance style inspired by traditional marovany compositions , but the influence of South African township music is evident in both the guitars and polyharmonic vocals , often performed by female singers who repeat variations on a short refrain throughout the song . <unk> music is performed at all manner of ceremonial occasion in the South , whether a birthday celebration , community party , or funeral . While salegy had risen to national popularity by the mid @-@ 1980s ( some would argue the 1970s ) , tsapika only truly began to garner a similar level of widespread appreciation by the mid @-@ 1990s . It was not until the 2000 release of the " <unk> Never Sleeps " compilation album that the genre achieved international exposure on a major label . This compilation , however , showcases " traditional " tsapika , such as might have more commonly been performed in rural villages twenty years ago , rather than the amplified , synthesized and remixed style in heavy rotation on radio stations performed by national stars like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Mamy <unk> . 
 There are many more regional styles of contemporary music that have yet to achieve the level of national recognition attained by salegy and tsapika just as there are many nationally and internationally acclaimed musicians who draw upon the musical traditions of the coastal regions in their compositions . Of note are <unk> ( a largely acoustic roots band from the Southeast that plays mangaliba ) , D <unk> ( an acclaimed acoustic guitarist from the inland South near Betroka ) , and Toto <unk> ( who popularized Congolese <unk> @-@ style guitar , and whose band performs a fusion of Central / East African and Malagasy dance styles ) . 
 = = = Popular music = = = 
 A wide range of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar , including French chanson performed by artists such as <unk> , reggae , gospel music , and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and <unk> . Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas <unk> . Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid @-@ nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18 @,@ 3 . More recently bands like <unk> are experimenting with the fusion of hip @-@ hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments . 
 = = Performance of Malagasy music = = 
 Music has long served a variety of secular and sacred purposes in Madagascar . Song may accompany daily tasks , provide entertainment , preserve history or communicate social and political messages . Music is likewise integral to the experience of spiritual ritual among many ethnic and religious groups on the island . 
 = = = Secular performance = = = 
 Among some ethnic groups music would help advance a repetitive or arduous task . Geo Shaw , a missionary to Madagascar in the 19th century , described observing Betsileo and Merina serfs singing in the rice fields , " timing the music to the movements of their bodies , so that at each accented note they plant a stalk . " Similarly , songs may accompany the paddling of dugout canoes on long journeys . Music may also accompany another form of entertainment , such as songs chanted by female spectators at matches of <unk> , a traditional form of full @-@ body wrestling popular in coastal regions . 
 The preservation of oral history may be achieved through musical performance in Madagascar . Among the Betsileo , for instance , oral histories are retold through a form of musical performance called the rija , which in its current form may represent a combination of the original , single @-@ verse rija and an epic poem called the <unk> . The Betsileo rija is performed by two men who each play a jejy while singing very loudly with a strained pitch in the soprano range . The structure of the song is complex and , unlike other Malagasy musical styles , parallel thirds are not predominant in the harmony . Other Southern ethnic groups also perform simplified variations of the rija featuring for example a solo musician who strums rather than fiddles his accompanying instrument and sings at a lower , more natural pitch . While the Betsileo rija can address diverse themes , those performed by other southern groups are almost always praise songs recalling a favorably memorable event . 
 Endogenous musical styles may also serve as a form of artistic expression , as in the highly syncopated ba @-@ gasy genre of Imerina . The ba @-@ gasy emerged in conjunction with the French introduction of operetta and the subsequent rise of Malagasy theater at the Theatre <unk> d <unk> beginning in the late 1910s . The vocal style used in ba @-@ gasy is characterized by female use of <unk> , a vocal ornamentation delivered in a nasal tone , offset by the <unk> ( tenor ) and rapid @-@ moving <unk> ( baritone ) line sung by the men . Ba @-@ gasy inspired the musical duet style <unk> 'ny Fahiny , popularized in Imerina during the final two decades of the colonial period , in which the ba @-@ gasy vocal sensibilities are applied to love themes and accompanied by a syncopated composition for piano or occasionally guitar . 
 Musical performance in the Highlands took on a distinctly political and educative role through the hira gasy ( hira : song ; gasy : Malagasy ) . The hira gasy is a day @-@ long spectacle of music , dance , and a stylized form of traditional oratory known as kabary performed by a troupe or as a competition between two or more troupes . While the origins of the hira gasy are uncertain , oral history attributes its modern form to 18th century Merina king Andrianampoinimerina , who reportedly employed musicians to gather the public together for royal speeches and announcements ( kabary ) and to entertain them as they labored on public works projects such as building dikes to irrigate the rice paddies surrounding Antananarivo . Over time , these musicians formed independent troupes who used and continue to use the non @-@ threatening performance format to explore sensitive social and political themes in the public arena . 
 The hira gasy troupes of today are remnants of a tradition of court musicians that persisted through the end of the 19th century . Under Queen Ranavalona III , the final monarch in the Merina dynasty , there were three official groups of state musicians : one for the queen , one for her prime minister , and another for the city of Antananarivo . The queen 's troupe consisted of over 300 musicians . Until slavery was abolished , musicians in these groups were members of the slave class ( andevo ) directed by a Hova ( free Merina ) . Each year at Christmas , the directors of each group would arrange a performance before the queen of a new original composition ; the queen would select a winner among the three . While court musicians ( and therefore the earliest hira gasy troupes ) originally performed using traditional instruments - namely the sodina , jejy voatavo and drums - over the course of the 19th century the increasing European influence led court musicians and hira gasy troupes alike to make increasing use of foreign instruments such as violins , clarinets , trombones and trumpets . The tradition of the court musician died out with the abolition of the monarchy in Madagascar after French colonization , but the hira gasy tradition has continued to thrive . 
 Musical styles from abroad have been merged with pre @-@ existing Malagasy musical traditions to create distinctly Malagasy sounds with foreign roots . An example of this is the <unk> , a tune based on the French quadrille that was popularized in the Malagasy court in the 19th century . A specific form of partner dance accompanies this piece , in which dancers will form a long chain of male @-@ female pairs with the woman at the front of each pair , both facing forward holding each other 's hands while advancing to the rhythm of the music . From its origins as a courtly dance , the <unk> today is a quintessentially Malagasy tradition performed at the beginning of a social event or concert to kick off the festivities . 
 = = = Sacred performance = = = 
 Music is a common element of spiritual ritual and ceremonies throughout the island . For instance , members of hira gasy troupes are traditionally invited to perform at the famadihana reburial ceremonies of central Madagascar . In coastal regions , music is crucial to helping a medium enter a trance state during a tromba ritual . While in a trance , the medium is possessed by an ancestral spirit . Each spirit is believed to prefer a particular tune or style of music and will not enter the medium unless the suitable piece of music is performed at the ceremony . 
 British missionaries of the London Missionary Society ( LMS ) arrived in Antananarivo in 1820 during the reign of King Radama I. The subsequent spread of Christianity in Madagascar was coupled with the introduction of solfège as missionaries developed Malagasy @-@ language hymns for their nascent church . The first wave of missionaries was obliged to depart Madagascar under Ranavalona I in 1836 , but the hymns they developed became anthems for early Malagasy converts persecuted under the Queen 's traditionalist policies . In 1871 , an LMS missionary ( J. Richardson ) improved the rhythm and harmony of these original hymns , which were considerably influenced by European musical styles such as quadrilles and waltzes . Originally , church music was performed by slaves seated in groups of four to five at the front of the church . By the 1870s a more European congregational style had been adopted with all members of the church rising to their feet to sing together . 
 = History of the Han dynasty = 
 The Han dynasty ( 206 BCE – 220 CE ) , founded by the peasant rebel leader Liu Bang ( known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu ) , was the second imperial dynasty of China . It followed the Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BCE ) , which had unified the Warring States of China by conquest . Interrupted briefly by the Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 CE ) of Wang Mang , the Han dynasty is divided into two periods : the Western Han ( 206 BCE – 9 CE ) and the Eastern Han ( 25 – 220 CE ) . These appellations are derived from the locations of the capital cities Chang 'an and Luoyang , respectively . The third and final capital of the dynasty was Xuchang , where the court moved in 196 CE during a period of political turmoil and civil war . 
 The Han dynasty ruled in an era of Chinese cultural consolidation , political experimentation , relative economic prosperity and maturity , and great technological advances . There was unprecedented territorial expansion and exploration initiated by struggles with non @-@ Chinese peoples , especially the nomadic Xiongnu of the Eurasian Steppe . The Han emperors were initially forced to acknowledge the rival Xiongnu <unk> as their equals , yet in reality the Han was an inferior partner in a tributary and royal marriage alliance known as heqin . This agreement was broken when Emperor Wu of Han ( r . 141 – 87 BCE ) launched a series of military campaigns which eventually caused the fissure of the Xiongnu Federation and redefined the borders of China . The Han realm was expanded into the Hexi Corridor of modern Gansu province , the Tarim Basin of modern Xinjiang , modern Yunnan and Hainan , modern northern Vietnam , modern North Korea , and southern Outer Mongolia . The Han court established trade and tributary relations with rulers as far west as the Arsacids , to whose court at Ctesiphon in Mesopotamia the Han monarchs sent envoys . Buddhism first entered China during the Han , spread by missionaries from Parthia and the Kushan Empire of northern India and Central Asia . 
 From its beginning , the Han imperial court was threatened by plots of treason and revolt from its subordinate kingdoms , the latter eventually ruled only by royal Liu family members . Initially , the eastern half of the empire was indirectly administered through large semi @-@ autonomous kingdoms which pledged loyalty and a portion of their tax revenues to the Han emperors , who ruled directly over the western half of the empire from Chang 'an . Gradual measures were introduced by the imperial court to reduce the size and power of these kingdoms , until a reform of the middle 2nd century BCE abolished their semi @-@ autonomous rule and staffed the kings ' courts with central government officials . Yet much more volatile and consequential for the dynasty was the growing power of both consort clans ( of the empress ) and the eunuchs of the palace . In 92 CE , the eunuchs entrenched themselves for the first time in the issue of the emperors ' succession , causing a series of political crises which culminated in 189 CE with their downfall and slaughter in the palaces of Luoyang . This event triggered an age of civil war as the country became divided by regional warlords vying for power . Finally , in 220 CE , the son of an imperial chancellor and king accepted the abdication of the last Han emperor , who was deemed to have lost the Mandate of Heaven according to Dong Zhongshu 's ( 179 – 104 BCE ) cosmological system that intertwined the fate of the imperial government with Heaven and the natural world . Following the Han , China was split into three states : Cao Wei , Shu Han , and Eastern Wu ; these were <unk> into one empire by the Jin dynasty ( 265 – 420 CE ) .

 = = = Collapse of Qin = = = 
 The Zhou dynasty ( c . 1050 – 256 BCE ) had established the State of Qin in Western China as an outpost to breed horses and act as a defensive buffer against nomadic armies of the Rong , Qiang , and Di peoples . After conquering six Warring States ( i.e. Han , Zhao , Wei , Chu , Yan , and Qi ) by 221 BCE , the King of Qin , Ying Zheng , unified China under one empire divided into 36 centrally @-@ controlled commanderies . With control over much of China proper , he affirmed his enhanced prestige by taking the unprecedented title huangdi ( <unk> ) , or ' emperor ' , known thereafter as Qin Shi Huang ( i.e. the first emperor of Qin ) . Han @-@ era historians would accuse his regime of employing ruthless methods to preserve his rule . 
 Qin Shi Huang died of natural causes in 210 BCE . In 209 BCE the conscription officers Chen Sheng and Wu Guang , leading 900 conscripts through the rain , failed to meet an arrival deadline ; the Standard Histories claim that the Qin punishment for this delay would have been execution . To avoid this , Chen and Wu started a rebellion against Qin , known as the <unk> Uprising , but they were thwarted by the Qin general Zhang Han in 208 BCE ; both Wu and Chen were subsequently assassinated by their own soldiers . Yet by this point others had rebelled , among them Xiang Yu ( d . 202 BCE ) and his uncle Xiang Liang ( <unk> / <unk> ) , men from a leading family of the Chu aristocracy . They were joined by Liu Bang , a man of peasant origin and supervisor of convicts in Pei County . Mi Xin , grandson of King Huai I of Chu , was declared King Huai II of Chu at his powerbase of Pengcheng ( modern Xuzhou ) with the support of the <unk> , while other kingdoms soon formed in opposition to Qin . Despite this , in 208 BCE Xiang Liang was killed in a battle with Zhang Han , who subsequently attacked Zhao Xie the King of Zhao at his capital of Handan , forcing him to flee to Julu , which Zhang put under siege . However , the new kingdoms of Chu , Yan , and Qi came to Zhao 's aid ; Xiang Yu defeated Zhang at Julu and in 207 BCE forced Zhang to surrender . 
 While Xiang was occupied at Julu , King Huai II sent Liu Bang to capture the Qin heartland of Guanzhong with an agreement that the first officer to capture this region would become its king . In late 207 BCE , the Qin ruler Ziying , who had claimed the reduced title of King of Qin , had his chief eunuch Zhao Gao killed after Zhao had orchestrated the deaths of Chancellor Li Si in 208 BCE and the second Qin emperor Qin Er Shi in 207 BCE . Liu Bang gained Ziying 's submission and secured the Qin capital of Xianyang ; persuaded by his chief advisor Zhang Liang ( d . 189 BCE ) not to let his soldiers loot the city , he instead sealed up its treasury . 
 = = = Contention with Chu = = = 
 The Standard Histories allege that when Xiang Yu arrived at Xianyang two months later in early 206 BCE , he looted it , burned it to the ground , and had Ziying executed . In that year , Xiang Yu offered King Huai II the title of Emperor Yi of Chu and sent him to a remote frontier where he was assassinated ; Xiang Yu then assumed the title Hegemon @-@ King of Western Chu ( <unk> ) and became the leader of a confederacy of 18 kingdoms . At the Feast at Hong Gate , Xiang Yu considered having Liu Bang assassinated , but Liu , realizing that Xiang was considering killing him , escaped during the middle of the feast . In a slight towards Liu Bang , Xiang Yu carved Guanzhong into three kingdoms with former Qin general Zhang Han and two of his subordinates as kings ; Liu Bang was granted the frontier Kingdom of Han in Hanzhong , where he would pose less of a political challenge to Xiang Yu . 
 In the summer of 206 BCE , Liu Bang heard of Emperor Yi 's fate and decided to rally some of the new kingdoms to oppose Xiang Yu , leading to a four @-@ year war known as the Chu – Han contention . Liu initially made a direct assault against Pengcheng and captured it while Xiang was battling another king who resisted him — Tian Guang ( <unk> ) the King of Qi — but his forces collapsed upon Xiang 's return to Pengcheng ; he was saved by a storm which delayed the arrival of Chu 's troops , although his father Liu <unk> ( <unk> ) and wife Lü Zhi were captured by Chu forces . Liu barely escaped another defeat at <unk> , but Xiang Yu was unable to pursue him because Liu Bang induced Ying Bu ( <unk> ) , the King of Huainan , to rebel against Xiang . After Liu Bang occupied <unk> along with a large Qin grain storage , Xiang threatened to kill Liu 's father if he did not surrender , but Liu did not give in to Xiang 's threats . 
 With <unk> and his food supplies lost , and with Liu Bang 's general Han Xin ( d . 196 BCE ) having conquered Zhao and Qin to Chu 's north , in 203 BCE Xiang Yu offered to release Liu Bang 's relatives from captivity and split China into political halves : the west would belong to Han and the east to Chu . Although Liu accepted the truce , it was short @-@ lived , and in 202 BCE at <unk> in modern Anhui , the Han forces forced Xiang Yu to flee from his fortified camp in the early morning with only 800 cavalry , pursued by 5 @,@ 000 Han cavalry . After several bouts of fighting , Xiang Yu became surrounded at the banks of the Yangzi River , where he committed suicide . Liu Bang took the title of emperor , and is known to posterity as Emperor Gaozu of Han ( r . 202 – 195 BCE ) . 
 = = Reign of Gaozu = = 
 = = = Consolidation , precedents , and rivals = = = 
 Emperor Gaozu initially made Luoyang his capital , but then moved it to Chang 'an ( near modern Xi 'an , Shaanxi ) due to concerns over natural defences and better access to supply routes . Following Qin precedent , Emperor Gaozu adopted the administrative model of a tripartite cabinet ( formed by the Three Excellencies ) along with nine subordinate ministries ( headed by the Nine Ministers ) . Despite Han statesmen 's general condemnation of Qin 's harsh methods and Legalist philosophy , the first Han law code compiled by Chancellor Xiao He in 200 BCE seems to have borrowed much from the structure and substance of the Qin code ( excavated texts from Shuihudi and Zhangjiashan in modern times have reinforced this suspicion ) . 
 From Chang 'an , Gaozu ruled directly over 13 commanderies ( increased to 16 by his death ) in the western portion of the empire . In the eastern portion , he established 10 semi @-@ autonomous kingdoms ( Yan , Dai , Zhao , Qi , Liang , Chu , Huai , Wu , Nan , and Changsha ) that he bestowed to his most prominent followers to placate them . Due to alleged acts of rebellion and even alliances with the Xiongnu — a northern nomadic people — by 196 BCE Gaozu had replaced nine of them with members of the royal family . 
 According to Michael Loewe , the administration of each kingdom was " a small @-@ scale replica of the central government , with its chancellor , royal counsellor , and other functionaries . " The kingdoms were to transmit census information and a portion of their taxes to the central government . Although they were responsible for maintaining an armed force , kings were not authorized to mobilize troops without explicit permission from the capital . 
 Wu Rui ( <unk> ) , King of Changsha , was the only remaining king not of the Liu clan . When Wu Rui 's great @-@ grandson Wu Zhu ( <unk> ) or Wu Chan ( <unk> ) died heirless in 157 BCE , Changsha was transformed into an imperial commandery and later a Liu family principality . South of Changsha , Gaozu sent Lu Jia ( <unk> ) as ambassador to the court of Zhao Tuo to acknowledge the latter 's sovereignty over Nanyue ( Vietnamese : Triệu Dynasty ; in modern Southwest China and northern Vietnam ) . 
 = = = Xiongnu and <unk> = = = 
 The Qin general Meng Tian had forced <unk> , the Chanyu of the Xiongnu , out of the Ordos Desert in 215 BCE , but <unk> 's son and successor Modu Chanyu built the Xiongnu into a powerful empire by subjugating many other tribes . By the time of Modu 's death in 174 BCE , the Xiongnu domains stretched from what is now northeast China and Mongolia to the Altai and Tian Shan mountain ranges in Central Asia . The Chinese feared incursions by the Xiongnu under the guise of trade and were concerned that Han @-@ manufactured iron weapons would fall into Xiongnu hands . Gaozu thus enacted a trade embargo against the Xiongnu . To compensate the Chinese border merchants of the northern kingdoms of Dai and Yan for lost trade , he made them government officials with handsome salaries . Outraged by this embargo , Modu Chanyu planned to attack Han . When the Xiongnu invaded Taiyuan in 200 BCE and were aided by the defector King Xin of Hán ( 韓 / <unk> , not to be confused with the ruling Hàn <unk> dynasty , or the general Han Xin ) , Gaozu personally led his forces through the snow to Pingcheng ( near modern Datong , Shanxi ) . In the ensuing Battle of <unk> , Gaozu 's forces were heavily surrounded for seven days ; running short of supplies , he was forced to flee . 
 After this defeat , the court adviser Liu Jing ( <unk> , originally named Lou Jing [ <unk> ] ) convinced the emperor to create a peace treaty and marriage alliance with the Xiongnu Chanyu called the heqin agreement . By this arrangement established in 198 BCE , the Han hoped to modify the Xiongnu 's nomadic values with Han luxury goods given as tribute ( silks , wine , foodstuffs , etc . ) and to make Modu 's half @-@ Chinese successor a subordinate to grandfather Gaozu . The exact amounts of annual tribute as promised by Emperor Gaozu given to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BCE shortly after the defeat are unknown . In 89 BCE , however , <unk> Chanyu ( <unk> ) ( r . 95 – 85 BCE ) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement with the increased amount of annual tribute at 400 @,@ 000 L ( 11 @,@ 350 U.S. bu ) of wine , 100 @,@ 000 L ( 2 @,@ 840 U.S. bu ) of grain , and 10 @,@ 000 bales of silk ; thus previous amounts would have been less than these figures . 
 Although the treaty acknowledged both huangdi and chanyu as equals , Han was in fact the inferior partner since it was forced to pay tribute to appease the militarily powerful Xiongnu . Emperor Gaozu was initially set to give his only daughter to Modu , but under the opposition of Empress Lü , Emperor Gaozu made a female relative princess and married her to Modu . Until the 130s BCE , the offering of princess brides and tributary items scarcely satisfied the Xiongnu , who often raided Han 's northern frontiers and violated the 162 BCE treaty that established the Great Wall as the border between Han and Xiongnu .

 When Ying Bu rebelled in 195 BCE , Emperor Gaozu personally led the troops against Ying and received an arrow wound which allegedly led to his death the following year . His heir apparent Liu Ying took the throne and is posthumously known as Emperor Hui of Han ( r . 195 – 188 BCE ) . Shortly afterwards Gaozu 's widow Lü Zhi , now empress dowager , had Liu <unk> , a potential claimant to the throne , poisoned and his mother , the Consort Qi , brutally mutilated . When the teenage Emperor Hui discovered the cruel acts committed by his mother , Loewe says that he " did not dare disobey her . " 
 Hui 's brief reign saw the completion of the defensive city walls around the capital Chang 'an in 190 BCE ; these brick and rammed earth walls were originally 12 m ( 40 ft ) tall and formed a rough rectangular ground plan ( with some irregularities due to topography ) ; their ruins still stand today . This urban construction project was completed by 150 @,@ 000 conscript laborers . Emperor Hui 's reign saw the repeal of old Qin laws banning certain types of literature and was characterized by a cautious approach to foreign policy , including the renewal of the heqin agreement with the Xiongnu and Han 's acknowledgment of the independent sovereignty of the Kings of Donghai and Nanyue . 
 = = = Regency and downfall of the Lü clan = = = 
 Since Emperor Hui did not sire any children with his empress Zhang Yan , after his death in 188 BCE , Lü Zhi , now grand empress dowager and regent , chose his successor from among his sons with other consorts . She first placed Emperor <unk> of Han ( r . 188 – 184 BCE ) on the throne , but then removed him for another puppet ruler Emperor <unk> of Han ( r . 184 – 180 BCE ) . She not only issued imperial edicts during their reigns , but she also appointed members of her own clan as kings against Emperor Gaozu 's explicit prohibition ; other clan members became key military officers and civil officials . 
 The court under Lü Zhi was not only unable to deal with a Xiongnu invasion of Longxi Commandery ( in modern Gansu ) in which 2 @,@ 000 Han prisoners were taken , but it also provoked a conflict with Zhao Tuo , King of Nanyue , by imposing a ban on exporting iron and other trade items to his southern kingdom . Proclaiming himself Emperor Wu of Nanyue ( <unk> ) in 183 BCE , Zhao Tuo attacked the Han Kingdom of Changsha in 181 BCE . He did not rescind his rival imperial title until the Han ambassador Lu Jia again visited Nanyue 's court during the reign of Emperor Wen . 
 After Empress Dowager Lü 's death in 180 BCE , it was alleged that the Lü clan plotted to overthrow the Liu dynasty , and Liu Xiang the King of Qi ( Emperor Gaozu 's grandson ) rose against the Lüs . Before the central government and Qi forces engaged each other , the Lü clan was ousted from power and destroyed by a coup led by the officials Chen Ping and Zhou Bo ( <unk> ) at Chang 'an . Although Liu Xiang had resisted the Lüs , he was passed over to become emperor because he had mobilized troops without permission from the central government and because his mother ' s family possessed the same ambitious attitude as the Lüs . Consort Bo , the mother of Liu Heng , King of Dai , was considered to possess a noble character , so her son was chosen as successor to the throne ; he is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Han ( r . 180 – 157 BCE ) .

 = = = Reforms and policies = = = 
 During the " Rule of Wen and Jing " ( the era named after Emperor Wen and his successor Emperor Jing ( r . 157 – 141 BCE ) , the Han Empire witnessed greater economic and dynastic stability , while the central government assumed more power over the realm . In an attempt to distance itself from the harsh rule of Qin , the court under these rulers abolished legal punishments involving mutilation in 167 BCE , declared eight widespread amnesties between 180 – 141 BCE , and reduced the tax rate on households ' agricultural produce from one @-@ fifteenth to one @-@ thirtieth in 168 BCE . It was abolished altogether the following year , but reinstated at the rate of one @-@ thirtieth in 156 BCE . 
 Government policies were influenced by the proto @-@ Daoist Huang @-@ Lao ( <unk> ) ideology , a mix of political and cosmological precepts given patronage by Wen 's wife Empress Dou ( d . 135 BCE ) , who was empress dowager during Jing 's reign and grand empress dowager during the early reign of his successor Emperor Wu ( r . 141 – 87 BCE ) . Huang @-@ Lao , named after the mythical Yellow Emperor and the 6th @-@ century @-@ BCE philosopher Laozi , viewed the former as the founder of ordered civilization ; this was unlike the Confucians , who gave that role to legendary sage kings Yao and Shun . Han imperial patrons of Huang @-@ Lao sponsored the policy of " nonaction " or <unk> ( <unk> ) ( a central concept of Laozi 's Daodejing ) , which claimed that rulers should interfere as little as possible if administrative and legal systems were to function smoothly . The influence of Huang @-@ Lao doctrines on state affairs became eclipsed with the formal adoption of Confucianism as state ideology during Wu 's reign and the later view that Laozi , not the Yellow Emperor , was the originator of Daoist practices . 
 From 179 – 143 BCE , the number of kingdoms was increased from eleven to twenty @-@ five and the number of commanderies from nineteen to forty . This was not due to a large territorial expansion , but because kingdoms that had rebelled against Han rule or failed to produce an heir were significantly reduced in size or even abolished and carved into new commanderies or smaller kingdoms . 
 = = = Rebellion of Seven States = = = 
 When Liu Xian ( <unk> ) , the heir apparent of Wu , once made an official visit to the capital during Wen 's reign , he played a board game called <unk> with then crown prince Liu Qi , the future Emperor Jing . During a heated dispute , Liu Qi threw the game board at Liu Xian , killing him . This outraged his father Liu Pi ( <unk> ) , the King of Wu and a nephew of Emperor Gaozu 's , who was nonetheless obliged to claim allegiance to Liu Qi once he took the throne . 
 Still bitter over the death of his son and fearful that he would be targeted in a wave of reduction of kingdom sizes that Emperor Jing carried out under the advice of Imperial Counselor Chao Cuo ( d . 154 BCE ) , the King of Wu led a revolt against Han in 154 BCE as the head of a coalition with six other rebelling kingdoms : Chu , Zhao , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Jinan , which also feared such reductions . However , Han forces commanded by Zhou Yafu were ready and able to put down the revolt , destroying the coalition of seven states against Han . Several kingdoms were abolished ( although later reinstated ) and others significantly reduced in size . Emperor Jing issued an edict in 145 BCE which outlawed the independent administrative staffs in the kingdoms and abolished all their senior offices except for the chancellor , who was henceforth reduced in status and appointed directly by the central government . His successor Emperor Wu would diminish their power even further by abolishing the kingdoms ' tradition of primogeniture and ordering that each king had to divide up his realm between all of his male heirs . 
 = = = Relations with the Xiongnu = = = 
 In 177 BCE , the Xiongnu Wise King of the Right raided the non @-@ Chinese tribes living under Han protection in the northwest ( modern Gansu ) . In 176 BCE , Modu Chanyu sent a letter to Emperor Wen informing him that the Wise King , allegedly insulted by Han officials , acted without the Chanyu 's permission and so he punished the Wise King by forcing him to conduct a military campaign against the nomadic Yuezhi . Yet this event was merely part of a larger effort to recruit nomadic tribes north of Han China , during which the bulk of the Yuezhi were expelled from the Hexi Corridor ( fleeing west into Central Asia ) and the sedentary state of Loulan in the Lop Nur salt marsh , the nomadic Wusun of the Tian Shan range , and twenty @-@ six other states east of Samarkand were subjugated to Xiongnu hegemony . Modu Chanyu 's implied threat that he would invade China if the heqin agreement was not renewed sparked a debate in Chang 'an ; although officials such as Chao Cuo and Jia Yi ( d . 169 BCE ) wanted to reject the heqin policy , Emperor Wen favored renewal of the agreement . Modu Chanyu died before the Han tribute reached him , but his successor Laoshang Chanyu ( 174 – 160 BCE ) renewed the heqin agreement and negotiated the opening of border markets . Lifting the ban on trade significantly reduced the frequency and size of Xiongnu raids , which had necessitated tens of thousands of Han troops to be stationed at the border . However , Laoshang Chanyu and his successor Junchen Chanyu ( <unk> ) ( r . 160 – 126 BCE ) continued to violate Han 's territorial sovereignty by making incursions despite the treaty . While Laoshang Chanyu continued the conquest of his father by driving the Yuezhi into the Ili River valley , the Han quietly built up its strength in cavalry forces to later challenge the Xiongnu .

 = = = Confucianism and government recruitment = = = 
 Although Emperor Gaozu did not ascribe to the philosophy and system of ethics attributed to Confucius ( fl . 6th century BCE ) , he did enlist the aid of Confucians such as Lu Jia and Shusun Tong ( <unk> ) ; in 196 BCE he established the first Han regulation for recruiting men of merit into government service , which Robert P. Kramer calls the " first major impulse toward the famous examination system . " Emperors Wen and Jing appointed Confucian academicians to court , yet not all academicians at their courts specialized in what would later become orthodox Confucian texts . For several years after Liu Che took the throne in 141 BCE ( known posthumously as Emperor Wu ) , the Grand Empress Dowager Dou continued to dominate the court and did not accept any policy which she found unfavorable or contradicted Huang @-@ Lao ideology . After her death in 135 BCE , a major shift occurred in Chinese political history . 
 After Emperor Wu called for the submission of memorial essays on how to improve the government , he favored that of the official Dong Zhongshu ( 179 – 104 BCE ) , a philosopher whom Kramers calls the first Confucian " theologian " . Dong 's synthesis fused together the ethical ideas of Confucius with the cosmological beliefs in yin and yang and Five Elements or <unk> by fitting them into the same holistic , universal system which governed heaven , earth , and the world of man . Moreover , it justified the imperial system of government by providing it its place within the greater cosmos . Reflecting the ideas of Dong Zhongshu , Emperor Wu issued an edict in 136 BCE that abolished academic chairs other than those focused on the Confucian Five Classics . In 124 BCE Emperor Wu established the Imperial University , at which the academicians taught 50 students ; this was the incipient beginning of the civil service examination system refined in later dynasties . Although sons and relatives of officials were often privileged with nominations to office , those who did not come from a family of officials were not barred from entry into the bureaucracy . Rather , education in the Five Classics became the paramount prerequisite for gaining office ; as a result , the Imperial University was expanded dramatically by the 2nd century CE when it accommodated 30 @,@ 000 students . With Cai Lun 's ( d . 121 CE ) invention of the papermaking process in 105 CE , the spread of paper as a cheap writing medium from the Eastern Han period onwards increased the supply of books and hence the number of those who could be educated for civil service . 
 = = = War against the Xiongnu = = = 
 The death of Empress Dou also marked a significant shift in foreign policy . In order to address the Xiongnu threat and renewal of the heqin agreement , Emperor Wu called a court conference into session in 135 BCE where two factions of leading ministers debated the merits and faults of the current policy ; Emperor Wu followed the majority consensus of his ministers that peace should be maintained . A year later , while the Xiongnu were busy raiding the northern border and waiting for Han 's response , Wu had another court conference assembled . The faction supporting war against the Xiongnu was able to sway the majority opinion by making a compromise for those worried about stretching financial resources on an indefinite campaign : in a limited engagement along the border near Mayi , Han forces would lure Junchen Chanyu over with gifts and promises of defections in order to quickly eliminate him and cause political chaos for the Xiongnu . When the Mayi trap failed in 133 BCE ( Junchen Chanyu realized he was about to fall into a trap and fled back north ) , the era of heqin @-@ style appeasement was broken and the Han court resolved to engage in full @-@ scale war . 
 Leading campaigns involving tens of thousands of troops , in 127 BCE the Han general Wei Qing ( d . 106 BCE ) recaptured the Ordos Desert region from the Xiongnu and in 121 BCE Huo Qubing ( d . 117 BCE ) expelled them from the Qilian Mountains , gaining the surrender of many Xiongnu aristocrats . At the Battle of <unk> in 119 BCE , generals Wei and Huo led the campaign to the <unk> Mountains where they forced the chanyu to flee north of the Gobi Desert . The maintenance of 300 @,@ 000 horses by government slaves in thirty @-@ six different pasture lands was not enough to satisfy the cavalry and baggage trains needed for these campaigns , so the government offered exemption from military and corvée labor for up to three male members of each household who presented a privately bred horse to the government . 
 = = = Expansion and colonization = = = 
 After Xiongnu 's King <unk> surrendered to Huo Qubing in 121 BCE , the Han acquired a territory stretching from the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur , thus cutting the Xiongnu off from their Qiang allies . New commanderies were established in the Ordos as well as four in the Hexi Corridor — Jiuquan , <unk> , Dunhuang , and Wuwei — which were populated with Han settlers after a major Qiang @-@ Xiongnu allied force was repelled from the region in 111 BCE . By 119 BCE , Han forces established their first garrison outposts in the Juyan Lake Basin of Inner Mongolia , with larger settlements built there after 110 BCE . Roughly 40 % of the settlers at Juyan came from the Guandong region of modern Henan , western Shandong , southern Shanxi , southern Hebei , northwestern Jiangsu , and northwestern Anhui . After <unk> 's surrender , the Han court moved 725 @,@ 000 people from the Guandong region to populate the <unk> ( <unk> ) region south of the bend of the Yellow River . In all , Emperor Wu 's forces conquered roughly 4 @.@ 4 million km2 ( 1 @.@ 7 million mi2 ) of new land , by far the largest territorial expansion in Chinese history . Self @-@ sustaining agricultural garrisons were established in these frontier outposts to support military campaigns as well as secure trade routes leading into Central Asia , the eastern terminus of the Silk Road . The Han @-@ era Great Wall was extended as far west as Dunhuang and sections of it still stand today in Gansu , including thirty Han beacon towers and two fortified castles .

 Starting in 139 BCE , the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi ( who were evicted from Gansu by the Xiongnu in 177 BCE ) ; however , Zhang 's travels revealed entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of , the remnants of the conquests of Alexander the Great ( r . 336 – 323 BCE ) . When Zhang returned to China in 125 BCE , he reported on his visits to Dayuan ( Fergana ) , Kangju ( Sogdiana ) , and Daxia ( Bactria , formerly the Greco @-@ Bactrian Kingdom which was subjugated by the Da Yuezhi ) . Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China , and although he did not venture there , described <unk> ( the Indus River valley of Northwestern India ) and Anxi ( Arsacid territories ) further west . <unk> sent to these states returned with foreign delegations and lucrative trade caravans ; yet even before this , Zhang noted that these countries were importing Chinese silk . After interrogating merchants , Zhang also discovered a southwestern trade route leading through Burma and on to India . The earliest known Roman glassware found in China ( but manufactured in the Roman Empire ) is a glass bowl found in a Guangzhou tomb dating to the early 1st century BCE and perhaps came from a maritime route passing through the South China Sea . Likewise , imported Chinese silk attire became popular in the Roman Empire by the time of Julius Caesar ( 100 – 44 BCE ) . 
 After the heqin agreement broke down , the Xiongnu were forced to extract more crafts and agricultural foodstuffs from the subjugated Tarim Basin urban centers . From 115 – 60 BCE the Han and Xiongnu battled for control and influence over these states , with the Han gaining , from 108 – 101 BCE tributary submission of Loulan , Turpan , <unk> , Dayuan ( Fergana ) , and Kangju ( Sogdiana ) . The farthest @-@ reaching and most expensive invasion was Li <unk> 's four @-@ year campaign against Fergana in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya valleys ( modern Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan ) . Historian Laszlo <unk> ( 1997 ) asserts that Fergana threatened to cut off Han 's access to the Silk Road , yet historian Sima Qian ( d . 86 BCE ) downplayed this threat by asserting that Li 's mission was really a means to punish Dayuan for not providing tribute of prized Central Asian stallions . 
 To the south , Emperor Wu assisted King Zhao Mo in fending off an attack by Minyue ( in modern Fujian ) in 135 BCE . After a pro @-@ Han faction was overthrown at the court of Nanyue , Han naval forces conquered Nanyue in 111 BCE during the Han – Nanyue War , bringing areas of modern Guangdong , Guangxi , Hainan Island , and northern Vietnam under Han control . Emperor Wu also launched an invasion into the Dian Kingdom of Yunnan in 109 BCE , subjugating its king as a tributary vassal , while later Dian rebellions in 86 BCE and 83 BCE , 14 CE ( during Wang Mang 's rule ) , and 42 – 45 CE were quelled by Han forces . Wu sent an expedition into what is now North Korea in 128 BCE , but this was abandoned two years later . In 108 BCE , another expedition established four commanderies there , only two of which ( i.e. Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery ) remained after 82 BCE . Although there was some violent resistance in 108 BCE and irregular raids by Goguryeo and Buyeo afterwards , Chinese settlers conducted peaceful trade relations with native Koreans who lived largely independent of ( but were culturally influenced by ) the sparse Han settlements . 
 = = = Economic reforms = = = 
 To fund his prolonged military campaigns and colonization efforts , Emperor Wu turned away from the " nonaction " policy of earlier reigns by having the central government commandeer the private industries and trades of salt mining and iron manufacturing by 117 BCE . Another government monopoly over liquor was established in 98 BCE , but the majority consensus at a court conference in 81 BCE led to the breaking up of this monopoly . The mathematician and official Sang Hongyang ( d . 80 BCE ) , who later became Imperial Counselor and one of many former merchants drafted into the government to help administer these monopolies , was responsible for the ' equable transportation ' system that eliminated price variation over time from place to place . This was a government means to interfere in the profitable grain trade by eliminating speculation ( since the government stocked up on grain when cheap and sold it to the public at a low price when private merchants demanded higher ones ) . This along with the monopolies were criticized even during Wu 's reign as bringing unnecessary hardships for merchants ' profits and farmers forced to rely on poor @-@ quality government @-@ made goods and services ; the monopolies and equable transportation did not last into the Eastern Han Era ( 25 – 220 CE ) . 
 During Emperor Wu 's reign , the poll tax for each minor aged three to fourteen was raised from 20 to 23 coins ; the rate for adults remained at 120 . New taxes exacted on market transactions , wheeled vehicles , and properties were meant to bolster the growing military budget . In 119 BCE a new bronze coin weighing five shu ( 3 @.@ 2 g / 0 @.@ 11 oz ) — replacing the four shu coin — was issued by the government ( remaining the standard coin of China until the Tang dynasty ) , followed by a ban on private minting in 113 BCE . Earlier attempts to ban private minting took place in 186 and 144 BCE , but Wu 's monopoly over the issue of coinage remained in place throughout the Han ( although its stewardship changed hands between different government agencies ) . From 118 BCE to 5 CE , the Han government minted 28 billion coins , an average of 220 million a year .

 Emperor Wu 's first wife , Empress Chen Jiao , was deposed in 130 BCE after allegations that she attempted witchcraft to help her produce a male heir . In 91 BCE , similar allegations were made against Emperor Wu 's Crown Prince Liu Ju , the son of Emperor Wu 's second wife Empress Wei Zifu . Prince Liu Ju , in fear of Emperor Wu 's believing the false allegations , began a rebellion in Chang 'an which lasted for five days , while Emperor Wu was away at his quiet summer retreat of <unk> ( <unk> ; in modern Shaanxi ) , . After Liu Ju 's defeat , both he and Empress Wei committed suicide . 
 Eventually , due to his good reputation , Huo Qubing 's half @-@ brother Huo Guang was entrusted by Wu to form a triumvirate regency alongside ethnically Xiongnu Jin Midi ( d . 86 BCE ) and Shangguan Jie ( <unk> ) ( d . 80 BCE ) over the court of his successor , the child Liu <unk> , known posthumously as Emperor Zhao of Han ( r . 87 – 74 BCE ) . Jin Midi died a year later and by 80 BCE Shangguan Jie and Imperial Counselor Sang Hongyang were executed when they were accused of supporting Emperor Zhao 's older brother Liu Dan ( <unk> ) the King of Yan as emperor ; this gave Huo unrivaled power . However , he did not abuse his power in the eyes of the Confucian establishment and gained popularity for reducing Emperor Wu 's taxes . 
 Emperor Zhao died in 74 BCE without a successor , while the one chosen to replace him on July 18 , his nephew Prince He of <unk> , was removed on August 14 after displaying a lack of character or capacity to rule . Prince He 's removal was secured with a memorial signed by all the leading ministers and submitted to Empress Dowager Shangguan for approval . Liu <unk> ( Liu Ju 's grandson ) was named Emperor Xuan of Han ( r . 74 – 49 BCE ) on September 10 . Huo Guang remained in power as regent over Emperor Xuan until he died of natural causes in 68 BCE . Yet in 66 BCE the Huo clan was charged with conspiracy against the throne and eliminated . This was the culmination of Emperor Xuan 's revenge after Huo Guang 's wife had poisoned his beloved Empress Xu <unk> in 71 BCE only to have her replaced by Huo Guang 's daughter Empress Huo <unk> ( the latter was deposed in September 66 BCE ) . Liu Shi , son of Empress Xu , succeeded his father as Emperor Yuan of Han ( r . 49 – 33 BCE ) . 
 = = = Reforms and frugality = = = 
 During Emperor Wu 's reign and Huo Guang 's regency , the dominant political faction was the Modernist Party . This party favored greater government intervention in the private economy with government monopolies over salt and iron , higher taxes exacted on private business , and price controls which were used to fund an aggressive foreign policy of territorial expansion ; they also followed the Qin dynasty approach to discipline by <unk> out more punishments for faults and less rewards for service . After Huo Guang 's regency , the Reformist Party gained more leverage over state affairs and policy decisions . This party favored the abolishment of government monopolies , limited government intervention in the private economy , a moderate foreign policy , limited colonization efforts , frugal budget reform , and a return to the Zhou dynasty ideal of granting more rewards for service to display the dynasty 's magnanimity . This party 's influence can be seen in the abolition of the central government 's salt and iron monopolies in 44 BCE , yet these were reinstated in 41 BCE , only to be abolished again during the 1st century CE and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship . By 66 BCE the Reformists had many of the lavish spectacles , games , and entertainments installed by Emperor Wu to impress foreign dignitaries cancelled on the grounds that they were excessive and ostentatious . 
 Spurred by alleged signs from Heaven warning the ruler of his incompetence , a total of eighteen general amnesties were granted during the combined reigns of Emperor Yuan ( Liu Shi ) and Emperor Cheng of Han ( r . 37 @-@ 3 BCE , Liu Ao <unk> ) . Emperor Yuan reduced the severity of punishment for several crimes , while Cheng reduced the length of judicial procedures in 34 BCE since they were disrupting the lives of commoners . While the Modernists had accepted sums of cash from criminals to have their sentences commuted or even dropped , the Reformists reversed this policy since it favored the wealthy over the poor and was not an effective deterrent against crime . 
 Emperor Cheng made major reforms to state @-@ sponsored religion . The Qin dynasty had worshipped four main legendary deities , with another added by Emperor Gaozu in 205 BCE ; these were the Five Powers , or Wudi ( <unk> ) . In 31 BCE Emperor Cheng , in an effort to gain Heaven 's favor and bless him with a male heir , halted all ceremonies dedicated to the Five Powers and replaced them with ceremonies for the supreme god <unk> , who the kings of Zhou had worshipped . 
 = = = Foreign relations and war = = = 
 The first half of the 1st century BCE witnessed several succession crises for the Xiongnu leadership , allowing Han to further cement its control over the Western Regions . The Han general Fu Jiezi assassinated the pro @-@ Xiongnu King of Loulan in 77 BCE . The Han formed a coalition with the Wusun , <unk> , and Wuhuan , and the coalition forces inflicted a major defeat against the Xiongnu in 72 BCE . The Han regained its influence over the Turpan Depression after defeating the Xiongnu at the Battle of <unk> in 67 BCE . In 65 BCE Han was able to install a new King of Kucha ( a state north of the Taklamakan Desert ) who would be agreeable to Han interests in the region . The office of the Protectorate of the Western Regions , first given to Zheng Ji ( d . 49 BCE ) , was established in 60 BCE to supervise colonial activities and conduct relations with the small kingdoms of the Tarim Basin . 
 After Zhizhi Chanyu ( r . 56 – 36 BCE ) had inflicted a serious defeat against his rival brother and royal contender Huhanye Chanyu ( 呼韓邪 ) ( r . 58 – 31 BCE ) , Huhanye and his supporters debated whether to request Han aid and become a Han vassal . He decided to do so in 52 BCE . Huhanye sent his son as a hostage to Han and personally paid homage to Emperor Xuan during the 51 BCE Chinese New Year celebration . Under the advocacy of the Reformists , Huhanye was seated as a distinguished guest of honor and rich rewards of 5 kg ( 160 oz t ) of gold , 200 @,@ 000 cash coins , 77 suits of clothes , 8 @,@ 000 bales of silk fabric , 1 @,@ 500 kg ( 3 @,@ 300 lb ) of silk floss , and 15 horses , in addition to 680 @,@ 000 L ( 19 @,@ 300 U.S. bu ) of grain sent to him when he returned home . 
 Huhanye Chanyu and his successors were encouraged to pay further trips of homage to the Han court due to the increasing amount of gifts showered on them after each visit ; this was a cause for complaint by some ministers in 3 BCE , yet the financial consequence of pampering their vassal was deemed superior to the heqin agreement . Zhizhi Chanyu initially attempted to send hostages and tribute to the Han court in hopes of ending the Han support of Huhanye , but eventually turned against Han . Subsequently , the Han general Chen Tang and Protector General Gan <unk> ( <unk> / <unk> ) , acting without explicit permission from the Han court , killed Zhizhi at his capital of <unk> City ( in modern <unk> , Kazakhstan ) in 36 BCE . The Reformist Han court , reluctant to award independent missions let alone foreign interventionism , gave Chen and Gan only modest rewards . Despite the show of favor , Huhanye was not given a Han princess ; instead , he was given the Lady Wang Zhaojun , one of the Four Beauties of ancient China . This marked a departure from the earlier heqin agreement , where a Chinese princess was handed over to the Chanyu as his bride .

 The long life of Empress Wang Zhengjun ( 71 BCE – 13 CE ) , wife of Emperor Yuan and mother to Emperor Cheng , ensured that her male relatives would be appointed one after another to the role of regent , officially known as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . Emperor Cheng , who was more interested in cockfighting and chasing after beautiful women than administering the empire , left much of the affairs of state to his relatives of the Wang clan . On November 28 , 8 BCE Wang Mang ( 45 BCE – 23 CE ) , a nephew of Empress Dowager Wang , became the new General @-@ in @-@ Chief . However , when Emperor Ai of Han ( r . 7 – 1 BCE , Liu Xin ) took the throne , his grandmother Consort Fu ( Emperor Yuan 's concubine ) became the leading figure in the palace and forced Wang Mang to resign on August 27 , 7 BCE , followed by his forced departure from the capital to his marquessate in 5 BCE . 
 Due to pressure from Wang 's supporters , Emperor Ai invited Wang Mang back to the capital in 2 BCE . A year later Emperor Ai died of illness without a son . Wang Mang was reinstated as regent over Emperor Ping of Han ( r . 1 BCE – 6 CE , Liu <unk> ) , a first cousin of the former emperor . Although Wang had married his daughter to Emperor Ping , the latter was still a child when he died in 6 CE . In July of that year , Grand Empress Dowager Wang confirmed Wang Mang as acting emperor ( <unk> <unk> ) and the child Liu Ying as his heir to succeed him , despite the fact that a Liu family marquess had revolted against Wang a month earlier , followed by others who were outraged that he was assuming greater power than the imperial Liu family . These rebellions were quelled and Wang Mang promised to hand over power to Liu Ying when he reached his majority . Despite promises to relinquish power , Wang initiated a propaganda campaign to show that Heaven was sending signals that it was time for Han 's rule to end . On January 10 , 9 CE he announced that Han had run its course and accepted the requests that he proclaim himself emperor of the Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 CE ) . 
 = = = Traditionalist reforms = = = 
 Wang Mang had a grand vision to restore China to a fabled golden age achieved in the early Zhou dynasty , the era which Confucius had idealized . He attempted sweeping reforms , including the outlawing of slavery and institution of the King 's Fields system in 9 CE , nationalizing land ownership and allotting a standard amount of land to each family . Slavery was reestablished and the land reform regime was cancelled in 12 CE due to widespread protest . 
 The historian Ban Gu ( 32 – 92 CE ) wrote that Wang 's reforms led to his downfall , yet aside from slavery and land reform , historian Hans Bielenstein points out that most of Wang 's reforms were in line with earlier Han policies . Although his new denominations of currency introduced in 7 CE , 9 CE , 10 CE , and 14 CE debased the value of coinage , earlier introductions of lighter @-@ weight currencies resulted in economic damage as well . Wang renamed all the commanderies of the empire as well as bureaucratic titles , yet there were precedents for this as well . The government monopolies were rescinded in 22 CE because they could no longer be enforced during a large @-@ scale rebellion against him ( spurred by massive flooding of the Yellow River ) . 
 = = = Foreign relations under Wang = = = 
 The half @-@ Chinese , half @-@ Xiongnu noble <unk> ( <unk> ) , son of Huhanye Chanyu and Wang Zhaojun , became a vocal partisan for Han China within the Xiongnu realm ; Bielenstein claims that this led conservative Xiongnu nobles to anticipate a break in the alliance with Han . The moment came when Wang Mang assumed the throne and demoted the Chanyu to a lesser rank ; this became a pretext for war . During the winter of 10 – 11 CE , Wang amassed 300 @,@ 000 troops along the northern border of Han China , a show of force which led the Xiongnu to back down . Yet when raiding continued , Wang Mang had the princely Xiongnu hostage held by Han authorities executed . Diplomatic relations were repaired when Xian ( <unk> ) ( r . 13 – 18 CE ) became the chanyu , only to be soiled again when Huduershi Chanyu ( <unk> ) ( r . 18 – 46 CE ) took the throne and raided Han 's borders in 19 CE . 
 The Tarim Basin kingdom of <unk> ( Karasahr , located east of Kucha , west of Turpan ) rebelled against Xin authority in 13 CE , killing Han 's Protector General Dan Qin ( <unk> ) . Wang Mang sent a force to retaliate against Karasahr in 16 CE , quelling their resistance and ensuring that the region would remain under Chinese control until the widespread rebellion against Wang Mang toppled his rule in 23 CE . Wang also extended Chinese influence over Tibetan tribes in the <unk> region and fended off an attack in 12 CE by Goguryeo ( an early Korean state located around the Yalu River ) in the Korean peninsula . However , as the widespread rebellion in China mounted from 20 – 23 CE , the Koreans raided Lelang Commandery and Han did not reassert itself in the region until 30 CE .

 Before 3 CE , the course of the Yellow River had emptied into the Bohai Sea at Tianjin , but the gradual buildup of silt in its riverbed — which raised the water level each year — overpowered the dikes built to prevent flooding and the river split in two , with one arm flowing south of the Shandong Peninsula and into the East China Sea . A second flood in 11 CE changed the course of the northern branch of the river so that it emptied slightly north of the Shandong Peninsula , yet far south of Tianjin . With much of the southern North China Plain inundated following the creation of the Yellow River 's southern branch , thousands of starving peasants who were displaced from their homes formed groups of bandits and rebels , most notably the Red Eyebrows . Wang Mang 's armies tried to quell these rebellions in 18 and 22 CE but failed . 
 Liu Yan ( d . 23 CE ) , a descendant of Emperor Jing , led a group of rebelling gentry groups from Nanyang who had Yan 's third cousin Liu Xuan ( <unk> ) accept the title Emperor Gengshi of Han ( r . 23 – 25 ) on March 11 , 23 CE . Liu Xiu , a brother of Liu Yan and future Emperor Guangwu of Han ( r . 25 – 57 CE ) , distinguished himself at the Battle of <unk> on July 7 , 23 CE when he relieved a city sieged by Wang Mang 's forces and turned the tide of the war . Soon afterwards , Emperor Gengshi had Liu Yan executed on grounds of treason and Liu Xiu , fearing for his life , resigned from office as Minister of Ceremonies and avoided public mourning for his brother ; for this , the emperor gave Liu Xiu a marquessate and a promotion as general . 
 Gengshi 's forces then targeted Chang 'an , but a local insurgency broke out in the capital , sacking the city on October 4 . From October 4 – 6 Wang Mang made a last stand at the Weiyang Palace only to be killed and decapitated ; his head was sent to Gengshi 's headquarters at Wan ( i.e. , Nanyang ) before Gengshi 's armies even reached Chang 'an on October 9 . Emperor Gengshi settled Luoyang as his new capital where he invited Red Eyebrows leader Fan Chong ( <unk> ) to stay , yet Gengshi granted him only honorary titles , so Fan decided to flee once his men began to desert him . Gengshi moved the capital back to Chang 'an in 24 CE , yet in the following year the Red Eyebrows defeated his forces , appointed their own puppet ruler Liu <unk> , entered Chang 'an and captured the fleeing Gengshi who they demoted as King of Changsha before killing him .

 While acting as a commissioner under Emperor Gengshi , Liu Xiu gathered a significant following after putting down a local rebellion ( in what is now Hebei province ) . He claimed the Han throne himself on August 5 , 25 CE and occupied Luoyang as his capital on November 27 . Before he would eventually unify the empire , there were 11 others who claimed the title of emperor . With the efforts of his officers Deng Yu and Feng Yi , Guangwu forced the wandering Red Eyebrows to surrender on March 15 , 27 CE , resettling them at Luoyang , yet had their leader Fan Chong executed when a plot of rebellion was revealed . 
 From 26 – 30 CE , Guangwu defeated various warlords and conquered the Central Plain and Shandong Peninsula in the east . Allying with the warlord Dou Rong ( <unk> ) of the distant Hexi Corridor in 29 CE , Guangwu nearly defeated the Gansu warlord Wei Xiao ( <unk> / <unk> ) in 32 CE , seizing Wei 's domain in 33 CE . The last adversary standing was Gongsun Shu ( <unk> ) , whose base was at Chengdu in modern Sichuan . Although Guangwu 's forces successfully burned down Gongsun 's fortified pontoon bridge stretching across the Yangzi River , Guangwu 's commanding general <unk> Peng ( <unk> ) was killed in 35 CE by an assassin sent by Gongsun Shu . Nevertheless , Han General Wu Han ( d . 44 CE ) resumed <unk> 's campaign along the Yangzi and Min rivers and destroyed Gongsun 's forces by December 36 CE . 
 Since Chang 'an is located west of Luoyang , the names Western Han ( 202 BCE – 9 CE ) and Eastern Han ( 25 – 220 CE ) are accepted by historians . Luoyang 's 10 m ( 32 ft ) tall eastern , western , and northern walls still stand today , although the southern wall was destroyed when the Luo River changed its course . Within its walls it had two prominent palaces , both of which existed during Western Han , but were expanded by Guangwu and his successors . While Eastern Han Luoyang is estimated to have held roughly 500 @,@ 000 inhabitants , the first known census data for the whole of China , dated 2 CE , recorded a population of nearly 58 million . Comparing this to the census of 140 CE ( when the total population was registered at roughly 48 million ) , there was a significant migratory shift of up to 10 million people from northern to southern China during Eastern Han , largely because of natural disasters and wars with nomadic groups in the north . Population size fluctuated according to periodically updated Eastern @-@ Han censuses , but historian Sadao Nishijima notes that this does not reflect a dramatic loss of life , but rather government inability at times to register the entire populace .

 Scrapping Wang Mang 's denominations of currency , Emperor Guangwu reintroduced Western Han 's standard five shu coin in 40 CE . Making up for lost revenue after the salt and iron monopolies were canceled , private manufacturers were heavily taxed while the government purchased its armies ' swords and shields from private businesses . In 31 CE he allowed peasants to pay a military substitution tax to avoid conscription into the armed forces for a year of training and year of service ; instead he built a volunteer force which lasted throughout Eastern Han . He also allowed peasants to avoid the one @-@ month corvée duty with a commutable tax as hired labor became more popular . Wang Mang had demoted all Han marquesses to commoner status , yet Guangwu made an effort from 27 CE onwards to find their relatives and restore abolished marquessates . 
 Emperor Ming of Han ( r . 57 – 75 CE , Liu Yang ) reestablished the Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization and the price stabilization system where the government bought grain when cheap and sold it to the public when private commercial prices were high due to limited stocks . However , he canceled the prize stabilization scheme in 68 CE when he became convinced that government hoarding of grain only made wealthy merchants even richer . With the renewed economic prosperity brought about by his father 's reign , Emperor Ming addressed the flooding of the Yellow River by repairing various dams and canals . On April 8 , 70 CE , an edict boasted that the southern branch of the Yellow River emptying south of the Shandong Peninsula was finally cut off by Han engineering . A patron of scholarship , Emperor Ming also established a school for young nobles aside from the Imperial University . 
 Emperor Zhang of Han ( r . 75 – 88 CE , Liu Da ) faced an agrarian crisis when a cattle epidemic broke out in 76 CE . In addition to providing disaster relief , Zhang also made reforms to legal procedures and lightened existing punishments with the bastinado , since he believed that this would restore the seasonal balance of yin and yang and cure the epidemic . To further display his benevolence , in 78 CE he ceased the corvée work on canal works of the <unk> River running through the Taihang Mountains , believing it was causing too much hardship for the people ; in 85 CE he granted a three @-@ year poll tax exemption for any woman who gave birth and exempted their husbands for a year . Unlike other Eastern Han rulers who sponsored the New Texts tradition of the Confucian Five Classics , Zhang was a patron of the Old Texts tradition and held scholarly debates on the validity of the schools . Rafe de Crespigny writes that the major reform of the Eastern Han period was Zhang 's reintroduction in 85 CE of an amended Sifen calendar , replacing Emperor Wu 's Taichu calendar of 104 BCE which had become inaccurate over two centuries ( the former measured the tropical year at 365 @.@ 25 days like the Julian Calendar , while the latter measured the tropical year at 365385 ⁄ 1539 days and the lunar month at 2943 ⁄ 81 days ) . 
 Emperor He of Han ( r . 88 – 105 CE , Liu Zhao ) was tolerant of both New Text and Old Text traditions , though orthodox studies were in decline and works skeptical of New Texts , such as Wang Chong 's ( 27 – c . 100 CE ) Lunheng , disillusioned the scholarly community with that tradition . He also showed an interest in history when he commissioned the Lady Ban Zhao ( 45 – 116 CE ) to use the imperial archives in order to complete the Book of Han , the work of her deceased father and brother . This set an important precedent of imperial control over the recording of history and thus was unlike Sima Qian 's far more independent work , the Records of the Grand Historian ( 109 – 91 BCE ) . When plagues of locusts , floods , and earthquakes disrupted the lives of commoners , Emperor He 's relief policies were to cut taxes , open granaries , provide government loans , forgive private debts , and resettle people away from disaster areas . Believing that a severe drought in 94 CE was the cosmological result of injustice in the legal system , Emperor He personally inspected prisons . When he found that some had false charges levelled against them , he sent the Prefect of Luoyang to prison ; rain allegedly came soon afterwards .

 The Vietnamese <unk> Sisters led an uprising in the Red River Delta of Jiaozhi Commandery in 40 CE . Guangwu sent the elderly general Ma Yuan ( ~ 14 BCE – 49 CE ) , who defeated them in 42 – 43 CE . The sisters ' native Dong Son drums were melted down and recast into a large bronze horse statue presented to Guangwu at Luoyang . 
 Meanwhile , Huduershi Chanyu was succeeded by his son Punu ( <unk> ) in 46 CE , thus breaking Huhanye 's orders that only a Xiongnu ruler 's brother was a valid successor ; Huduershi 's nephew Bi ( <unk> ) was outraged and in 48 CE was proclaimed a rival Chanyu . This split created the Northern Xiongnu and Southern Xiongnu , and like Huhanye before him , Bi turned to the Han for aid in 50 CE . When Bi came to pay homage to the Han court , he was given 10 @,@ 000 bales of silk fabrics , 2 @,@ 500 kg ( 5 @,@ 500 lb ) of silk , 500 @,@ 000 L ( 14 @,@ 000 U.S. bu ) of rice , and 36 @,@ 000 head of cattle . Unlike in Huhanye 's time , however , the Southern Xiongnu were overseen by a Han Prefect who not only acted as an arbiter in Xiongnu legal cases , but also monitored the movements of the Chanyu and his followers who were settled in Han 's northern commanderies in Shanxi , Gansu , and Inner Mongolia . Northern Xiongnu attempts to enter Han 's tributary system were rejected . 
 Following Xin 's loss of the Western Territories , the Kingdom of Yarkand looked after the Chinese officials and families stranded in the Tarim Basin and fought the Xiongnu for control over it . Emperor Guangwu , preoccupied with civil wars in China , simply granted King Kang of Yarkand an official title in 29 CE and in 41 CE made his successor King Xian a Protector General ( later reduced to the honorary title of " Great General of Han " ) . Yarkand overtaxed its subjects of Khotan , Turpan , Kucha , and Karasahr , all of which decided to ally with the Northern Xiongnu . By 61 CE Khotan had conquered Yarkand , yet this led to a war among the kingdoms to decide which would be the next hegemon . The Northern Xiongnu took advantage of the infighting , conquered the Tarim Basin , and used it as a base to stage raids into Han 's Hexi Corridor by 63 CE . In that year , the Han court opened border markets for trade with the Northern Xiongnu in hopes to appease them . 
 Yet Han sought to reconquer the Tarim Basin . At the Battle of <unk> in 73 CE , Dou Gu ( d . 88 CE ) reached as far as Lake <unk> when he defeated a Northern Xiongnu chanyu and established an agricultural garrison at Hami . Although Dou Gu was able to evict the Xiongnu from Turpan in 74 CE , when the Han appointed Chen Mu ( d . 75 CE ) as the new Protector General of the Western Regions , the Northern Xiongnu invaded the <unk> Mountains while their allies <unk> and Kucha killed Chen Mu and his troops . The Han garrison at Hami was forced to withdraw in 77 CE ( and was not reestablished until 91 CE ) . The next Han expedition against the Northern Xiongnu was led in 89 CE by Dou Xian ( d . 92 CE ) ; at the Battle of <unk> Bayan , Dou 's forces chased the Northern Chanyu into the Altai Mountains , allegedly killing 13 @,@ 000 Xiongnu and accepting the surrender of 200 @,@ 000 Xiongnu from 81 tribes . 
 After Dou sent 2 @,@ 000 cavalry to attack the Northern Xiongnu base at Hami , he was followed by the initiative of the general Ban Chao ( d . 102 CE ) , who earlier installed a new king of Kashgar as a Han ally . When this king turned against him and enlisted the aid of Sogdiana in 84 CE , Ban Chao arranged an alliance with the Kushan Empire ( of modern North India , Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Tajikistan ) , which put political pressure on Sogdiana to back down ; Ban later assassinated King Zhong of Kashgar . Since Kushan provided aid to Ban Chao in quelling Turpan and sent tribute and hostages to Han , its ruler Vima <unk> ( r. c . 90 – c . 100 CE ) requested a Chinese princess bride ; when this was rejected in 90 CE , Kushan marched 70 @,@ 000 troops to Wakhan against Ban Chao . Ban used scorched earth tactics against Kushan , forcing them to request food supplies from Kucha . When Kushan messengers were intercepted by Ban , Kushan was forced to withdraw . In 91 CE , Ban was appointed as Protector General of the Western Regions , an office he filled until 101 CE . 
 Tributary gifts and emissaries from the Arsacid Empire , then under Pacorus II of Parthia ( r . 78 – 105 CE ) , came to the Han in 87 CE , 89 CE , and 101 CE bringing exotic animals such as ostriches and lions . When Ban Chao dispatched his emissary Gan Ying in 97 CE to reach Daqin ( the Roman Empire ) , he did not reach farther than a " large sea " , perhaps the Persian Gulf . However , from oral accounts Gan was able to describe Rome as having hundreds of walled cities , a postal delivery network , the submission of dependent states , and a system of government where the Roman " king " ( i.e. consul ) is " not a permanent figure but is chosen as the man most worthy . " Elephants and rhinoceroses were also presented as gifts to the Han court in 94 CE and 97 CE by a king in what is now Burma . The first known diplomatic mission from a ruler in Japan came in 57 CE ( followed by another in 107 CE ) ; a golden seal of Emperor Guangwu 's was even discovered in 1784 in <unk> Province . The first mentioning of Buddhism in China was made in 65 CE , when the Chinese clearly associated it with Huang @-@ Lao Daoism . Emperor Ming had the first Buddhist temple of China — the White Horse Temple — built at Luoyang in honor of two foreign monks : <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> <unk> ) and Zhu <unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> the Indian ) . These monks allegedly translated the Sutra of Forty @-@ two Chapters from Sanskrit into Chinese , although it is now proven that this text was not translated into Chinese until the 2nd century CE . 
 = = = Court , kinsmen , and consort clans = = = 
 Besides his divorcing Guo <unk> in 41 CE to install his original wife Empress Yin <unk> as empress instead , there was little drama with imperial kinsmen at Guangwu 's court , as Empress Guo was made a queen dowager and her son , the former heir apparent , was demoted to the status of a king . However , trouble with imperial kinsmen turned violent during Ming 's reign . In addition to exiling his half @-@ brother Liu Ying ( d . 71 CE , committed suicide ) after Liu Ying allegedly used witchcraft to curse him , Emperor Ming also targeted hundreds of others with similar charges ( of using occult omens and witchcraft ) resulting in exile , torture for gaining confessions , and execution . This trend of persecution did not end until Emperor Zhang took the throne , who was for the most part generous towards his brothers and called back many to the capital who had been exiled by Ming . 
 Of greater consequence for the dynasty , however , was Emperor He 's coup of 92 CE in which eunuchs made their first significant involvement in court politics of Eastern Han . Emperor Zhang had upheld a good relationship with his titular mother and Ming 's widow , the humble Empress Dowager Ma ( d . 79 CE ) , but Empress Dowager Dou ( d . 97 CE ) , the widow of Emperor Zhang , was overbearing towards Emperor He ( son of Emperor Zhang and Consort Liang ) in his early reign and , concealing the identity of his natural mother from him , raised He as her own after purging the Liang family from power . In order to put He on the throne , Empress Dowager Dou had even demoted the crown prince Liu Qing ( 78 – 106 CE ) as a king and forced his mother , Consort Song ( d . 82 CE ) to commit suicide . Unwilling to yield his power to the Dou clan any longer , Emperor He enlisted the aid of palace eunuchs led by Zheng Zhong ( d . 107 CE ) to overthrow the Dou clan on charges of treason , stripping them of titles , exiling them , forcing many to commit suicide , and had the Empress Dowager placed under house arrest .

 Empress Deng Sui ( d . 121 CE ) , widow to Emperor He , became empress dowager in 105 CE and thus had the final say in appointing He 's successor ( since he had appointed none ) ; she placed his infant son Liu Long on the throne , later known as Emperor Shang of Han ( r . 105 – 106 ) . When the latter died at only age one , she placed his young nephew Liu Hu ( Liu Qing 's son ) on the throne , known posthumously as Emperor An of Han ( r . 106 – 125 CE ) , bypassing Emperor He 's other son Liu Sheng ( <unk> ) . With a young ruler on the throne , Empress Deng was the de facto ruler until her death , since her brother Deng Zhi 's ( <unk> ) brief occupation as the General @-@ in @-@ Chief ( <unk> ) from 109 – 110 CE did not in fact make him the ruling regent . With her death on April 17 , 121 CE , Emperor An accepted the charge of eunuchs Li Run ( <unk> ) and Jiang Jing ( <unk> ) that she had plotted to overthrow him ; on June 3 he charged the Deng clan with treason and had them dismissed from office , stripped of title , reduced to commoner status , exiled to remote areas , and drove many to commit suicide . 
 The Yan clan of Empress Yan Ji ( d . 126 CE ) , wife of Emperor An , and the eunuchs Jiang Jing and Fan Feng ( <unk> ) pressured Emperor An to demote his nine @-@ year @-@ old heir apparent Liu Bao to the status of a king on October 5 , 124 CE on charges of conspiracy , despite protests from senior government officials . When Emperor An died on April 30 , 125 CE the Empress Dowager Yan was free to choose his successor , Liu Yi ( grandson of Emperor Zhang ) , who is known as Emperor Shao of Han . After the child died suddenly in 125 CE , the eunuch Sun Cheng ( d . 132 CE ) made a palace coup , slaughtering the opposing eunuchs , and thrust Liu Bao on the throne , later to be known as Emperor Shun of Han ( r . 125 – 144 CE ) ; Sun then put Empress Dowager Yan under house arrest , had her brothers killed , and the rest of her family exiled to Vietnam . 
 Emperor Shun had no sons with Empress Liang Na ( d . 150 CE ) , yet when his son Liu Bing briefly took the throne in 145 CE , the mother of the latter , Consort Yu , was in no position of power to challenge Empress Dowager Liang . After the child Emperor Zhi of Han ( r . 145 – 146 CE ) briefly sat on the throne , Empress Dowager Liang and her brother Liang Ji ( d . 159 CE ) , now regent General @-@ in @-@ Chief , decided that Liu Zhi , known posthumously as Emperor Huan of Han ( r . 146 – 168 CE ) , should take the throne , as he was betrothed to their sister Liang <unk> . When the younger Empress Liang died in 159 CE , Liang Ji attempted to control Emperor Huan 's new favorite Consort Deng Mengnü ( later empress ) ( d . 165 CE ) . When she resisted Liang Ji had her brother @-@ in @-@ law killed , prompting Emperor Huan to use eunuchs to oust Liang Ji from power ; the latter committed suicide when his residence was surrounded by imperial guards . Emperor Huan died with no official heir , so his third wife Empress Dou Miao ( d . 172 CE ) , now the empress dowager , had Liu Hong , known posthumously as Emperor Ling of Han ( r . 168 – 189 CE ) , take the throne . 
 = = = Reforms and policies of middle Eastern Han = = = 
 To mitigate the damage caused by a series of natural disasters , Empress Dowager Deng 's government attempted various relief measures of tax remissions , donations to the poor , and immediate shipping of government grain to the most hard @-@ hit areas . Although some water control works were repaired in 115 CE and 116 CE , many government projects became underfunded due to these relief efforts and the armed response to the large @-@ scale Qiang people 's rebellion of 107 – 118 CE . Aware of her financial constraints , the Empress Dowager limited the expenses at banquets , the fodder for imperial horses who weren 't pulling carriages , and the amount of luxury goods manufactured by the imperial workshops . She approved the sale of some civil offices and even secondary marquess ranks to collect more revenue ; the sale of offices was continued by Emperor Huan and became extremely prevalent during Emperor Ling 's reign . 
 Emperor An continued similar disaster relief programs that Empress Dowager Deng had implemented , though he reversed some of her decisions , such as a 116 CE edict requiring officials to leave office for three years of mourning after the death of a parent ( an ideal Confucian more ) . Since this seemed to contradict Confucian morals , Emperor An 's sponsorship of renowned scholars was aimed at shoring up popularity among Confucians . Xu Shen ( 58 – 147 CE ) , although an Old Text scholar and thus not aligned with the New Text tradition sponsored by Emperor An , enhanced the emperor 's Confucian credentials when he presented his groundbreaking dictionary to the court , the Shuowen Jiezi . 
 Financial troubles only worsened in Emperor Shun 's reign , as many public works projects were handled at the local level without the central government 's assistance . Yet his court still managed to supervise the major efforts of disaster relief , aided in part by a new invention in 132 CE of a seismometer by the court astronomer Zhang Heng ( 78 – 139 CE ) who used a complex system of a vibration @-@ sensitive swinging pendulum , mechanical gears , and falling metal balls to determine the direction of earthquakes hundreds of kilometers ( miles ) away . Shun 's greatest patronage of scholarship was repairing the now dilapidated Imperial University in 131 CE , which still operated as a pathway for young gentrymen to enter civil service . Officials protested against the enfeoffment of eunuch Sun Cheng and his associates as marquesses , with further protest in 135 CE when Shun allowed the sons of eunuchs to inherit their fiefs , yet the larger concern was over the rising power of the Liang faction . 
 To abate the unseemly image of placing child emperors on the throne , Liang Ji attempted to paint himself as a populist by granting general amnesties , awarding people with noble ranks , reducing the severity of penalties ( the bastinado was no longer used ) , allowing exiled families to return home , and allowing convicts to settle on new land in the frontier . Under his stewardship , the Imperial University was given a formal examination system whereby candidates would take exams on different classics over a period of years in order to gain entrance into public office . Despite these positive reforms , Liang Ji was widely accused of corruption and greed . Yet when Emperor Huan overthrew Liang by using eunuch allies , students of the Imperial University took to streets in the thousands chanting the names of the eunuchs they opposed in one of the earliest student protests in history . 
 After Liang Ji was overthrown , Huan distanced himself from the Confucian establishment and instead sought legitimacy through a revived imperial patronage of Huang @-@ Lao Daoism ; this renewed patronage of Huang @-@ Lao was not continued after his reign . As the economy worsened , Huan built new hunting parks , imperial gardens , palace buildings , and expanded his harem to house thousands of concubines . The gentry class became alienated by Huan 's corrupt government dominated by eunuchs and many refused nominations to serve in office , since current Confucian beliefs dictated that morality and personal relationships superseded public service . Emperor Ling hosted much less concubines than Huan , yet Ling left much of the affairs of state to his eunuchs . Instead , Ling busied himself play @-@ acting as a traveling salesman with concubines dressed as market vendors or dressing in military costume as the ' General Supreme ' for his parading Army of the Western Garden . 
 = = = Foreign relations and war of middle Eastern Han = = = 
 The Eastern @-@ Han court colonized and periodically reasserted the Chinese military presence in the Western Regions only as a means to combat the Northern Xiongnu . Han forces were expelled from the Western Regions first by the Xiongnu between 77 – 90 CE and then by the Qiang between 107 – 122 CE . In both of these periods , the financial burdens of reestablishing and expanding western colonies , as well as the liability of sending financial aid requested by Tarim @-@ Basin tributary states , were viewed by the court as reasons to forestall the reopening of foreign relations in the region . 
 At the beginning of Empress Dowager Deng 's regency , the Protector General of the Western Regions Ren Shang ( d . 118 CE ) was besieged at Kashgar . Although he was able to break the siege , he was recalled and replaced before the Empress Dowager began to withdraw forces from the Western Regions in 107 CE . However , a transitional force was still needed . The Qiang people , who had been settled by the Han government in southeastern Gansu since Emperor Jing 's reign , would aid Han in this withdrawal . Throughout Eastern Han , the Qiang often revolted against Han authority after Han border officials robbed them of goods and even women and children . A group of Qiang people conscripted to reinforce the Protector General during his withdrawal decided instead to mutiny against him . Their revolt in the northwestern province of Liang ( <unk> ) was put down in 108 CE , but it spurred a greater Qiang rebellion that would last until 118 CE , cutting off Han 's access to Central Asia . The Qiang problem was exacerbated in 109 CE by a combined Southern Xiongnu , Xianbei , and Wuhuan rebellion in the northeast . The total monetary cost for putting down the Qiang rebellion in Liang province was 24 million cash ( out of an average of 220 million cash minted annually ) , while the people of three entire commanderies within eastern Liang province and one commandery within Bing province were temporarily resettled in 110 CE . 
 Following general Ban Yong 's reopening of relations with the Western Regions in 123 CE , two of the Liang province commanderies were reestablished in 129 CE , only to be withdrawn again a decade later . Even after eastern Liang province ( comprising modern southeastern Gansu and Ningxia ) was resettled , there was another massive rebellion there in 184 CE , instigated by Han Chinese , Qiang , Xiongnu , and Yuezhi rebels . Yet the Tarim @-@ Basin states continued to offer tribute and hostages to China into the final decade of Han , while the agricultural garrison at Hami was not gradually abandoned until after 153 CE . 
 Of perhaps greater consequence for the Han dynasty and future dynasties was the ascendance of the Xianbei people . They filled the vacuum of power on the vast northern steppe after the Northern Xiongnu were defeated by Han and fled to the Ili River valley ( in modern Kazakhstan ) in 91 CE . The Xianbei quickly occupied the deserted territories and incorporated some 100 @,@ 000 remnant Xiongnu families into their new federation , which by the mid 2nd century CE stretched from the western borders of the Buyeo Kingdom in Jilin , to the <unk> in southern Siberia , and all the way west to the Ili River valley of the Wusun people . Although they raided Han in 110 CE to force a negotiation of better trade agreements , the later leader Tanshihuai ( <unk> ) ( d . 180 CE ) refused kingly titles and tributary arrangements offered by Emperor Huan and defeated Chinese armies under Emperor Ling . When Tanshihuai died in 180 CE , the Xianbei Federation largely fell apart , yet it grew powerful once more during the 3rd century CE . 
 After being introduced in the 1st century CE , Buddhism became more popular in China during the 2nd century CE . The Parthian monk An Shigao traveled from Parthia to China in 148 CE and made translations of Buddhists works on the Hinayana and yoga practices which the Chinese associated with Daoist exercises . The Kushan monk Lokaksema from Gandhara was active in China from 178 – 198 CE , translated the Perfection of Wisdom , Shurangama Sutra , and Pratyutpanna Sutra , and introduced to China the concepts of Akshobhya Buddha , Amitābha Buddha ( of Pure Land Buddhism ) , and teachings about Manjusri . In 166 CE , Emperor Huan made sacrifices to Laozi and the Buddha . In that same year , the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to Huan 's court , claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus ( <unk> <unk> ) ( r . 161 – 180 CE ) . Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants , not diplomats .

 In 166 CE , the official Li Ying ( 李膺 ) was accused by palace eunuchs of plotting treason with students at the Imperial University and associates in the provinces who opposed the eunuchs . Emperor Huan was furious , arresting Li and his followers , who were only released from prison the following year due to pleas from the General @-@ in @-@ Chief Dou Wu ( d . 168 CE ) ( Emperor Huan 's father @-@ in @-@ law ) . However , Li Ying and hundreds of his followers were proscribed from holding any offices and were branded as partisans ( <unk> ) . 
 After Emperor Huan 's death , at the urging of the Grand Tutor ( <unk> ) Chen Fan ( <unk> ) ( d . 168 CE ) , Dou Wu presented a memorial to the court in June 168 CE denouncing the leading eunuchs as corrupt and calling for their execution , but Empress Dowager Dou refused the proposal . This was followed by a memorial presented by Chen Fan calling for the heads of Hou Lan ( d . 172 CE ) and Cao Jie ( d . 181 CE ) , and when this too was refused Dou Wu took formal legal action which could not be ignored by the court . When Shan Bing , a eunuch associate of Chen and Dou 's , gained a forced confession from another eunuch that Cao Jie and Wang Fu ( <unk> ) plotted treason , he prepared another damning written memorial on the night of October 24 – 25 which the opposing eunuchs secretly opened and read . Cao Jie armed Emperor Ling with a sword and hid him with his wet nurse , while Wang Fu had Shan Bing killed and Empress Dowager Dou incarcerated so that the eunuchs could use the authority of her seal . 
 Chen Fan entered the palace with eighty followers and engaged in a shouting match with Wang Fu , yet Chen was gradually surrounded , detained , and later trampled to death in prison that day ( his followers were unharmed ) . At dawn , the general Zhang Huan ( <unk> ) , misled by the eunuchs into believing that Dou Wu was committing treason , engaged in a shouting match with Dou Wu at the palace gates , but as Dou 's followers slowly deserted him and trickled over to Zhang 's side , Dou was forced to commit suicide . In neither of these confrontations did any actual physical fighting break out . 
 With Dou Wu eliminated and the Empress Dowager under house arrest , the eunuchs renewed the proscriptions against Li Ying and his followers ; in 169 CE they had hundreds more officials and students prohibited from serving office , sent their families into exile , and had Li Ying executed . The eunuchs barred potential enemies from court , sold and bartered offices , and infiltrated the military command . Emperor Ling even referred to eunuchs Zhao Zhong and Zhang Rang as his " mother " and " father " ; the latter two had so much influence over the emperor that they convinced him not to ascend to the top floors of tall towers in the capital , which was an effort to conceal from him the enormous mansions that the eunuchs built for themselves . Although the partisan prohibitions were extended to hundreds more in 176 CE ( including the distant relatives of those earlier proscribed ) , they were abolished in 184 CE with the outbreak of the Yellow Turban Rebellion , largely because the court feared the gentry — bitter from their banishment from office — would join the rebel cause . 
 = = = Yellow Turban Rebellion = = = 
 In 142 CE , Zhang Daoling founded the Five Pecks of Rice religious society in Sichuan . After claiming to have seen the deified Laozi as a holy prophet who appointed him as his earthly representative known as the Celestial Master , Zhang created a highly organized , hierarchical Daoist movement which accepted only pecks of rice and no money from its lay followers . In 184 CE , the Five Pecks of Rice under Zhang Lu staged a rebellion in Sichuan and set up a theocratic Daoist state that endured until 215 CE . 
 Like the Five Pecks of Rice , the Yellow Turban Daoists of the Yellow and Huai River regions also built a hierarchical church and believed that illness was the result of personal sins needing confessions . The Yellow Turbans became a militant organization that challenged Han authority by claiming they would bring about a utopian era of peace . Zhang Jue , renowned faith @-@ healer and leader of the Yellow Turbans , and his hundreds of thousands of followers , designated by the yellow cloth that they wrapped around their foreheads , led a rebellion across eight provinces in 184 CE . They had early successes against imperial troops but by the end of 184 CE the Yellow Turban leadership — including Zhang — had been killed . Smaller groups of Yellow Turbans continued to revolt in the following years ( until the last large group was incorporated into the forces of Chancellor Cao Cao in 192 CE ) , yet Crespigny asserts that the rebellion 's impact on the fall of Han was less consequential than events which transpired in the capital following the death of Emperor Ling on May 13 , 189 CE . However , Patricia Ebrey points out that many of the generals who raised armies to quell the rebellion never disbanded their forces and used them to amass their own power outside of imperial authority . 
 = = = Downfall of the eunuchs = = = 
 He Jin ( d . 189 CE ) , half @-@ brother to Empress He ( d . 189 CE ) , was given authority over the standing army and palace guards when appointed as General @-@ in @-@ Chief during the Yellow Turban Rebellion . Shortly after Empress He 's son Liu Bian , known later as Emperor Shao of Han , was put on the throne , the eunuch Jian Shi plotted against He Jin , was discovered , and executed on May 27 , 189 CE ; He Jin thus took over Jian 's Army of the Western Garden . Yuan Shao ( d . 202 CE ) , then an officer in the Army of the Western Garden , plotted with He Jin to overthrow the eunuchs by secretly ordering several generals to march towards the capital and forcefully persuade the Empress Dowager He to hand over the eunuchs . Yuan had these generals send in petition after petition to the Empress Dowager calling for the eunuchs ' dismissal ; <unk> Beck states that this " psychological war " finally broke the Empress Dowager 's will and she consented . However , the eunuchs discovered this and used Empress Dowager He 's mother Lady <unk> and her brother He Miao ( <unk> ) , both of whom were sympathetic to the eunuchs , to have the order rescinded . On September 22 , the eunuchs learned that He Jin had a private conversation with the Empress Dowager about executing them . They sent message to He Jin that the Empress Dowager had more words to share with him ; once he sat down in the hall to meet her , eunuchs rushed out of hiding and beheaded He Jin . When the eunuchs ordered the imperial secretaries to draft an edict dismissing Yuan Shao , the former asked for He Jin 's permission , so the eunuchs showed them He Jin 's severed head . 
 However , the eunuchs became besieged when Yuan Shao attacked the Northern Palace and his brother Yuan Shu ( d . 199 CE ) attacked the Southern Palace , breaching the gate and forcing the eunuchs to flee to the Northern Palace by the covered passageway connecting both . Zhao Zhong was killed on the first day and the fighting lasted until September 25 when Yuan Shao finally broke into the Northern Palace and purportedly slaughtered two thousand eunuchs . However , Zhang Rang managed to flee with Emperor Shao and his brother Liu Xie to the Yellow River , where he was chased down by the Yuan family troops and committed suicide by jumping into the river and drowning . 
 = = = Coalition against Dong Zhuo = = = 
 Dong Zhuo ( d . 192 CE ) , General of the Van ( under Huangfu Song ) who marched on to Luoyang under Yuan Shao 's request , saw the capital in flames from a distance and heard that Emperor Shao was wandering in the hills nearby . When Dong approached Emperor Shao , the latter became frightened and unresponsive yet his brother Liu Xie explained to Dong what had happened . The ambitious Dong took over effective control of Luoyang and forced Yuan Shao to flee the capital on September 26 . Dong was made Excellency of Works ( <unk> ) , one of the Three Excellencies . Despite protests , Dong had Emperor Shao demoted as the Prince of <unk> on September 28 while elevating his brother Liu Xie as emperor , later known as Emperor Xian of Han ( r . 189 – 220 CE ) . Empress Dowager He was poisoned to death by Dong Zhuo on September 30 , followed by the Prince of <unk> on March 3 , 190 CE . 
 Yuan Shao , once he left the capital , led a coalition of commanders , former officials , and soldiers of fortune to challenge Dong Zhuo . No longer viewing Luoyang as a <unk> , Dong burned the city to the ground and forced the imperial court to resettle at Chang 'an in May 191 CE . In a conspiracy headed by the Minister over the Masses , Wang Yun ( d . 192 CE ) , Dong was killed by his adopted son Lü Bu ( d . 198 CE ) . Dong 's subordinates then killed Wang and forced Lü to flee , throwing Chang 'an into chaos . 
 Emperor Xian fled Chang 'an in 195 CE and returned to Luoyang by August 196 CE . Meanwhile , the empire was being carved into eight spheres of influence , each ruled by powerful commanders or officials : in the northeast there was Yuan Shao and Cao Cao ( 155 – 220 CE ) ; south of them was Yuan Shu , located just southeast of the capital ; south of this was Liu Biao ( d . 208 CE ) in Jing ; Sun Ce ( d . 200 CE ) controlled the southeast ; in the southwest there was Liu Zhang ( d . 219 CE ) and Zhang Lu ( d . 216 CE ) located just north of him in Hanzhong ; the southern Liang Province was inhabited by the Qiang people and various rebel groups . Although prognostication fueled speculation over the dynasty 's fate , these warlords still claimed loyalty to Han , since the emperor was still at the pinnacle of a cosmic @-@ religious system which ensured his political survival . 
 = = = Rise of Cao Cao = = = 
 Cao Cao , a Commandant of Cavalry during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and then Colonel in the Army of the Western Garden by 188 CE , was Governor of Yan Province ( modern western Shandong and eastern Henan ) in 196 CE when he took the emperor from Luoyang to his headquarters at Xuchang . Yuan Shu declared his own Zhong Dynasty ( <unk> ) in 197 CE , yet this bold move earned him the desertion of many of his followers , dying penniless in 199 CE after attempting to offer his title to Yuan Shao . Gaining more power after defeating Gongsun Zan ( d . 199 ) , Yuan Shao regretted not seizing the emperor when he had the chance and decided to act against Cao . The confrontation culminated in Cao Cao 's victory at the Battle of Guandu in 200 CE , forcing Yuan to retreat to his territory . After Yuan Shao died in 202 CE , his sons fought over his inheritance , allowing Cao Cao to eliminate Yuan Tan ( 173 – 205 CE ) and drive his brothers Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi to seek refuge with the Wuhuan people . Cao Cao asserted his dominance over the northeast when he defeated the Wuhuan led by <unk> at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207 CE ; the Yuan brothers fled to Gongsun Kang ( d . 221 CE ) in Liaodong , but the latter killed them and sent their heads to Cao Cao in submission . 
 When there was speculation that Liu Bei ( 161 – 223 CE ) , a scion of the imperial family who was formerly in the service of Cao Cao , was planning to take over the territory of the now ill Liu Biao in 208 CE , Cao Cao forced Liu Biao 's son to surrender his father 's land . Expecting Cao Cao to turn on him next , Sun Quan ( 182 – 252 CE ) , who inherited the territory of his brother Sun Ce in 200 CE , allied with Liu Bei and faced Cao Cao 's naval force in 208 CE at the Battle of Chibi . This was a significant defeat for Cao Cao which ensured the continued disunity of China during the Three Kingdoms ( 220 – 265 CE ) . 
 = = = Fall of the Han = = = 
 When Cao Cao moved Emperor Xian to Xuchang in 196 CE , he took the title of Excellency of Works as Dong Zhuo had before him . In 208 CE , Cao abolished the three most senior offices , the Three Excellencies , and instead recreated two offices , the Imperial Counselor and Chancellor ; he occupied the latter post . Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei in 213 CE , had Emperor Xian divorce Empress Fu Shou in 214 CE , and then had him marry his daughter as Empress Cao Jie in 215 CE . Finally , Cao took the title King of Wei in 216 CE , violating the rule that only Liu family members could become kings , yet he never deposed Emperor Xian . After Cao Cao died in 220 CE , his son Cao Pi ( 186 – 226 CE ) inherited the title King of Wei and gained the uneasy allegiance of Sun Quan ( while Liu Bei at this point had taken over Liu Zhang 's territory of Yi Province ) . With debates over prognostication and signs from heaven showing the Han had lost the Mandate of Heaven , Emperor Xian agreed that the Han dynasty had reached its end and abdicated to Cao Pi on December 11 , 220 CE , thus creating the state of Cao Wei , soon to oppose Shu Han in 221 CE and Eastern Wu in 229 CE . 
 = Green Lantern ( Six Flags Great Adventure ) = 
 Green Lantern is a steel stand @-@ up roller coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township , New Jersey . Green Lantern stands 155 feet ( 47 m ) tall and features a top speed of 63 miles per hour ( 101 km / h ) . The 4 @,@ 155 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 1 @,@ 266 m ) ride features five inversions and a duration of approximately 21 ⁄ 2 minutes . The ride was manufactured by Swiss firm Bolliger & Mabillard . Green Lantern is fairly similar to Mantis , another stand @-@ up coaster at Cedar Point , but taller , faster , and featuring two more inversions . 
 The ride originally operated at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville , Kentucky from 1997 to 2009 , where it was known as Chang . Upon opening in 1997 , it set world records for this type of coaster in height , drop , speed , length and number of inversions . The introduction of the ride caused Kentucky Kingdom to achieve record attendance levels . After Six Flags abandoned Kentucky Kingdom in 2009 , the ride was relocated to Six Flags Great Adventure . The ride debuted in 2011 as Green Lantern , replacing the former Great American Scream Machine roller coaster .

 Chang ( " long " in Mandarin Chinese ) opened at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom on April 4 , 1997 , setting world records for this type of coaster in height , drop , speed , length and number of inversions . When it debuted , Chang had a yellow track and supports . The ride was constructed by Martin & Vleminckx . Around 1999 , its track was painted lime green and the support columns violet . In early @-@ 2006 the track was returned to its original yellow , while the supports were painted blue . Six Flags originally announced that the ride would have a Batman theme , along with its T2 coaster . T2 was expected to be known as " Batman : The Ride " and Chang " Riddler 's Revenge " , but those plans were later canceled . 
 Chang was removed over the weekend of September 19 , 2009 to expand Splashwater Kingdom , but the proposal for the expansion was scrapped , while Six Flags later announced plans to dispose of its Kentucky Kingdom property . The removal of Chang and the closure of Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom caused the owners of the park land ( the Kentucky State Fair Board ) to sue Six Flags for ownership of the rides . Kentucky Kingdom is now open under new operators as of May 24 , 2014 . 
 = = = Green Lantern ( 2011 – present ) = = = 
 In 2010 , parts from Chang reportedly appeared at Six Flags Great America . The ride was planned to be moved to Six Flags Great America in 2011 ; the park obtained approval to exceed the 125 @-@ foot ( 38 m ) height limit imposed on the park , but plans were later canceled in favor of a water park expansion . 
 On July 5 , 2010 Six Flags Great Adventure announced that its Great American Scream Machine would close on July 18 to make way for a new attraction the following year , sparking rumors that Chang would move there in 2011 . Although Six Flags did not confirm the speculation , a first look at the park 's new @-@ ride layout from the Jackson Township zoning board meeting was posted on the <unk> Magazine website and the layout was identical to that of Chang . 
 On September 16 , Six Flags Great Adventure announced that it would open a Green Lantern @-@ themed roller coaster in 2011 . The specifications released for the new ride matched those of Chang . As part of the relocation , the ride would receive technical renovations and a new coat of paint . 
 Footers were poured for the ride in December 2010 , with track installation beginning the following month . In January 2011 , construction of the lift hill was completed . In April 2011 the final pieces of track were put in place . 
 On May 19 , Green Lantern soft @-@ opened to a select group of season @-@ pass holders , media and families from Children 's Miracle Network . The ride opened to the public on May 25 .

 Green Lantern is located in the Boardwalk section of the park . Green Lantern is the third roller coaster to occupy this plot of land , following the Sarajevo Bobsled ( which ran at Great Adventure from 1984 – 1988 before moving to Six Flags Great America and Great Escape ) and the Great American Scream Machine ( an Arrow Dynamics looping coaster which had occupied this area from 1989 to 2010 ) . Like the Great American Scream Machine , the infield of Green Lantern is covered with gravel . The coaster also reuses the Scream Machine 's queue area building . 
 = = = Manufacturer = = = 
 Green Lantern is Six Flags Great Adventure 's fifth Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster , joining Batman : The Ride , Bizarro , Nitro and Superman : Ultimate Flight . The coaster is the park 's second standup coaster ; the first was a smaller coaster manufactured by Intamin , Shockwave , which operated from 1990 to 1992 . Shockwave had also been installed at Six Flags Magic Mountain , preceding Riddler 's Revenge . 
 = = = Theme = = = 
 As its name suggests , Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics character of the same name . The theme was chosen to coincide with the Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011 . The track is painted green , with the exception of the yellow vertical loop . The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow , but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop . The loop is yellow because Green Lantern 's enemy is the yellow Parallax . In June 2011 , a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop . The ride 's queue area features a series of comic @-@ book @-@ style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan ( the Green Lantern ) and the Green Lantern Corps . 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 Green Lantern currently operates with two steel @-@ and @-@ fiberglass trains . Each train has seven cars with four seats in a single row , for a total of 28 riders . Riders are secured by an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder harness . Although Green Lantern is a stand @-@ up roller coaster , there is a small bicycle seat on which riders can lean . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 The first section of Green Lantern is basically a mirrored version of Rougarou , a roller coaster at Cedar Point in Ohio . Leaving the station , the train starts by climbing the 155 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 47 m ) chain lift hill , on which the Green Lantern oath is played over loudspeakers along the steps . At the top , the train goes through a pre @-@ drop before making a slightly @-@ banked 180 ° turnaround . After this , the train goes down a 144 feet ( 44 m ) drop into a 121 @.@ 6 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 37 @.@ 1 m ) vertical loop . Out of the loop , the track rises to the right into a 103 @.@ 8 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 31 @.@ 6 m ) diving loop , hugging the first drop of Superman : Ultimate Flight . Riders then rise into a diving turnaround over the station , and the train enters a right @-@ leaning 72 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 22 m ) inclined loop . After a small hill , the train then rises to the left into the mid @-@ course brake run . It then drops into a right corkscrew , turning right and weaving through the diving loop . The track then makes a ground @-@ hugging left turn and enters a low , second right corkscrew . After a right turn the train makes a final , 180 ° left turn into the final brake run before returning to the station . Green Lantern is 4 @,@ 155 feet ( 1 @,@ 266 m ) long , with a ride taking about 21 ⁄ 2 minutes to complete .

 At its opening , Chang claimed the record for the tallest vertical loop of any roller coaster in the world . At the time , it was the world 's tallest , fastest and longest stand @-@ up coaster . It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand @-@ up roller coaster . All of these records had eclipsed those set by Mantis , which opened at Cedar Point in 1996 . In 1998 Riddler 's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain , and Chang surrendered its titles .

Although the ride was Kentucky Kingdom 's marquee attraction , in Mitch Hawker 's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll Chang peaked at 47 in 1999 . The ride 's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the following table : 
 After the ride 's relocation to Six Flags Great Adventure , Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times ranked it 8 of the park 's 13 roller coasters . <unk> Murphy of The New York Times highlighted the different forces at play on a stand @-@ up roller coaster , compared with a traditional one : " Other coasters create pressure mostly in your upper body ; Green Lantern creates pressure in your legs , making them a much more active part of the experience " . Both <unk> Magazine and The Star @-@ Ledger interviewed a number of park guests and coaster enthusiasts when the Green Lantern opened ; all gave favorable reviews .

 On July 12 a supercell thunderstorm developed over eastern New Jersey in association with a surface low @-@ pressure area in southwestern Ontario . Daytime heating in the Tri @-@ State Region led to moderate instability , a key factor in the development of showers and thunderstorms . With conditions favorable for the development of a tornado , the Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch at 12 : 40 p.m. EDT ( 16 : 40 UTC ) . A strong thunderstorm developed around 2 : 00 p.m. EDT ( 18 : 00 UTC ) which produced a funnel cloud near Carlstadt at around 2 : 45 p.m. EDT ( 18 : 45 UTC ) , although no damage was associated with the funnel . That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into New York . About 15 minutes later , a tornado warning was issued for southern Rockland and Westchester counties which would remain in effect until 4 : 15 p.m. EDT ( 21 : 15 UTC ) .

 The tornado hit the town of Sleepy Hollow , New York , around 3 : 37 p.m. EDT ( 19 : 37 UTC ) ; two minutes later , a 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado . As the tornado neared New York State Route 9A , it intensified to F2 status , generating winds up to 157 mph ( 253 km / h ) , and struck the California Closet Warehouse . At the time , the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd ( 274 m ) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County . Shortly after , it weakened back to F1 intensity . Minor damage was reported through the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla as the tornado neared the New York – Connecticut border . The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi ( 13 km ) . After crossing the state border into Fairfield County , Connecticut , it weakened further before lifting at 4 : 03 p.m EDT ( 20 : 03 UTC ) in Greenwich after traveling 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) in Connecticut . Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the Merritt Parkway . Overall , the tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi ( 21 km ) through two states over a period over 33 minutes .
