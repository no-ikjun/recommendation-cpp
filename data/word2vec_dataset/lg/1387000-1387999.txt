It is one of the world 's most populated cities , with a population of 17 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area . Located in an eponymous district and division , it lies along the east bank of the Buriganga River in the heart of the Bengal delta .

It is the largest city in the Bengal region . It is also a major city of South Asia and among the OIC states . 
 The old city of Dhaka was the Mughal capital of Bengal . The city 's name was Jahangir Nagar ( City of Jahangir ) in the 17th century . It was a cosmopolitan commercial centre and the hub of the worldwide muslin and silk trade . The city hosted two important caravansaries of the subcontinent : the Bara Katra and <unk> Katra , located on the riverfront of the Buriganga . The Mughals decorated the city with well @-@ laid out gardens , tombs , mosques , palaces and forts . Dhaka became known as the City of Mosques in Bengal . It was also described as the Venice of the East . The old city was home to various Eurasian merchant groups . At the height of its medieval glory , Dhaka was regarded as one of the wealthiest and most prosperous cities in the world . It was central to the economy of Mughal Bengal , which generated 50 % of Mughal GDP . 
 Modern Dhaka developed from the late 19th century under the British Raj . Between 1905 and 1912 , it was the capital of British Eastern Bengal and Assam . In 1947 , after the Partition of British India , it became the administrative capital of the eastern wing of Pakistan . It was declared as the legislative capital of Pakistan in 1962 .

 The origins of the name for Dhaka are uncertain . Once dhak tree was very common in the area and the name may have originated from it . Alternatively , this name may refer to the hidden goddess <unk> , whose shrine is located in the south @-@ western part of the city . Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a <unk> instrument , dhak which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inaugurating of the Bengal capital in 1610 . Some references also say that it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa ; or Dhakka , used in the <unk> for a watch @-@ station ; or it is the same as <unk> , mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of <unk> as an eastern frontier kingdom . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of urban settlement in the area of modern @-@ day Dhaka dates to the 1st century . The region was part of the ancient district of <unk> , which was ruled by the Hindu Sena dynasty . Under Islamic rule , it became part of the historic district of Sonargaon , the regional administrative hub of the Delhi and the Bengal Sultanates . The Grand Trunk Road passed through the region , connecting it with North India , Central Asia and the southeastern port city of Chittagong . 
 The Mughal Empire conquered the region during the late 16th @-@ century . Under Mughal rule , the Old City of Dhaka grew on the banks of the Buriganga River . Dhaka was proclaimed the capital of Mughal Bengal in 1608 . Islam Khan Chishti was the first administrator of the city . Khan christened it as " Jahangir Nagar " ( City of Jahangir ) in honour of the Emperor Jahangir . The name was dropped soon after the emperor 's death . The main expansion of the city took place under Mughal governor <unk> Khan . The city then measured 19 by 13 kilometres ( 11 @.@ 8 by 8 @.@ 1 mi ) , with a population of nearly one million . Dhaka was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the Indian subcontinent . It grew into a regional economic centre during the 17th and 18th centuries , serving as a hub for Eurasian traders , including Bengalis , Marwaris , Gujaratis , Armenians , Arabs , Persians , Greeks , Dutchmen , Frenchmen , Englishmen and the Portuguese . The city was a centre of the worldwide muslin industry , with 80 @,@ 000 skilled weavers . Mughal Bengal generated 50 % of the Mughal Empire 's GDP , which at the time constituted 25 % of world GDP . Dhaka was the commercial capital of the empire . The city had well @-@ laid out gardens , monuments , mosques , temples , bazaars , churches and caravansaries . The Bara Katra was the largest caravansary . The riverbanks were dotted with numerous stately mansions . Eurasian traders built neighbourhoods in <unk> ( French Bazaar ) , Armanitola ( Armenian Quarter ) and <unk> ( Portuguese Quarter ) . With the defeat of the Nawab of Bengal at the Battle of Buxar in 1764 , British East India company gained the right to collect taxes from the Mughal province of Benga @-@ Bihar . The city formally passed to the control of the British East India Company in 1793 and Dhaka got plugged into the imperial mercantile networks of the British Empire . With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain , Dhaka became a leading centre of the jute trade , as Bengal accounted for the largest share of the world 's jute production . 
 Dhaka suffered stagnation and decline during the early 19th @-@ century . Its muslin industry was destroyed by high colonial taxation , restriction of trade and forced imports of British manufactured textiles . The city 's weavers starved to death during Bengal famines . The rise of the colonial capital Calcutta caused a sharp decline in the city 's population . Dhaka became heavily impoverished . In 1824 , an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins . During the mutiny of 1857 , the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army . The British Raj was established following the mutiny . It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family , which dominated the city 's political and social elite . The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army . The British developed the modern city around Ramna , Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park . A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874 . The electricity supply began in 1901 . 
 By the early @-@ 20th century , Dhaka projected itself as the standard bearer of Muslim minorities in British India ; as opposed to the heavily Hindu @-@ dominated city of Calcutta . During the abortive Partition of Bengal in 1905 , Dhaka became the short lived capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam . In 1906 , the All India Muslim League was formed at the Ahsan Manzil , during a conference on liberal education hosted by Nawab Sir <unk> Salimullah . Bengal was reunited in 1911 . The University of Dacca was established in 1921 . It gained prestige as the Oxford of the East in its early years . <unk> , a subsidiary of the <unk> Steel Company , began widescale power distribution in 1930 . With the Partition of British India in 1947 , Dhaka became the capital of East Pakistan . The city 's population increased dramatically because of Muslim migration from across Bengal and other parts of the subcontinent , putting heavy strains on infrastructure . 
 The Awami League was formed at the Rose Garden Palace in 1949 as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan . Growing political , cultural and economic rifts emerged between the two wings of the country . The Bengali Language Movement reached its peak in 1952 . Dhaka remained a centre of revolutionary and political activity , as student activism and demands for autonomy increased . The Six point movement in 1966 was widely supported by the city 's residents . The city had an influential press , with prominent newspapers like the Ittefaq and the Weekly Holiday . During the political and constitutional crisis in 1971 , the military junta led by Yahya Khan refused to transfer power to the newly elected National Assembly , causing mass riots , civil <unk> and a movement for self @-@ determination . On 7 March 1971 , Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a massive public gathering at the Ramna Race Course Maidan in Dhaka , in which he declared the beginning of the independence struggle . Subsequently , East Pakistan came under a non @-@ co @-@ operation movement against the Pakistani state . On Pakistan 's Republic Day ( 23 March 1971 ) , Bangladeshi flags were hoisted throughout Dhaka in a show of resistance . 
 On 25 March 1971 , the Pakistan Army launched military operations under Operation Searchlight against the population of East Pakistan . Dhaka bore the brunt of the army 's atrocities , witnessing a genocide and a campaign of widescale repression , with the arrest , torture and murder of the city 's civilians , students , intelligentsia , political activists and religious minorities . The army faced mutinies from the East Pakistan Rifles and the Bengali police . Large parts of the city were burnt and destroyed , including Hindu neighbourhoods . Much of the city 's population was either displaced or forced to flee to the countryside . In the ensuing Bangladesh Liberation War , the Mukti Bahini launched regular guerrilla attacks and ambush operations against Pakistani forces . Dhaka was struck with numerous air raids by the Indian Air Force in December . It was liberated by Bangladesh @-@ India Allied Forces on 16 December 1971 with the surrender of Pakistan . 
 The post @-@ independence period witnessed rapid growth as Dhaka attracted migrant workers from across rural Bangladesh . In August 1975 , Sheikh <unk> was assassinated in a military coup . There were further coups in November 1975 and March 1985 . In the 1980s , Bangladesh pioneered the formation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( <unk> ) and hosted its first summit in Dhaka . A mass uprising in 1990 led to the restoration of parliamentary democracy . In the 1990s and 2000s , Dhaka experienced improved economic growth and the emergence of affluent business districts and satellite towns .

Tropical vegetation and moist soils characterise the land , which is flat and close to sea level . This leaves Dhaka susceptible to flooding during the monsoon seasons owing to heavy rainfall and cyclones . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Dhaka experiences a hot , wet , and humid tropical climate . Under the Köppen climate classification , Dhaka has a tropical savanna climate . The city has a distinct monsoonal season , with an annual average temperature of 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) and monthly means varying between 19 ° C ( 66 ° F ) in January and 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) in May . Approximately 87 % of the annual average rainfall of 2 @,@ 123 millimetres ( 83 @.@ 6 inches ) occurs between May and October . Increasing air and water pollution emanating from traffic congestion and industrial waste are serious problems affecting public health and the quality of life in the city . Water bodies and wetlands around Dhaka are facing destruction as these are being filled up to construct multi @-@ storied buildings and other real estate developments . Coupled with pollution , such erosion of natural habitats threatens to destroy much of the regional biodiversity .

 = = = Civic administration = = = 
 The Dhaka municipality was founded on 1 August 1864 , and upgraded to " Corporation " status in 1978 . The Dhaka City Corporation is a self @-@ governing corporation which runs the affairs of the city . Recently ( i.e. 2011 ) , Dhaka City Corporation has been divided into two administrative parts – these are ( 1 ) Dhaka North City Corporation and ( 2 ) Dhaka South City Corporation – for ensuring better civic facilities . These two corporations are headed by two administrators . The incorporated area is divided into several wards , which have elected commissioners . The Dhaka Education Board is responsible for administering all public schools and most private schools except for English @-@ medium schools and <unk> . All <unk> in Bangladesh are governed by a central board while English @-@ medium schools are under separate educational and governance structures . 
 The Dhaka Metropolitan Police ( <unk> ) was established in 1976 and had 6 @,@ 000 personnel in 12 police stations . With the rapid growth of the city , the force has been raised to 26 @,@ 661 personnel and the establishment of 49 police stations has been completed . 
 To fight rising traffic congestion and population , the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanisation of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten @-@ year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka . 
 = = = Administrative agencies = = = 
 Unlike other megacities around the world , Dhaka serviced by over four dozen government organisations under different ministries . The two corporations , north and south , are headed by two powerless mayors really do not have any control over them . Moreover , a lack of co @-@ ordination among them and centralisation of all powers by Government of Bangladesh , keeps the development and maintenance of the city in a chaotic situation . 
 = = Water management = = 
 Aside from Chittagong , Dhaka has a water @-@ borne sewage system , but this serves only 22 % of the population while another 30 % are served with septic tanks . Only two @-@ thirds of households in Dhaka are served by the city water supply system . More than 9 @.@ 7 million tons of solid wastes are produced in Dhaka city each year . While private and government efforts have succeeded in collecting refuse city @-@ wide and using it as manure , most solid wastes are often dumped untreated in nearby low @-@ lying areas and water bodies . The utility in charge of water and sanitation in Dhaka , DWASA , addresses these challenges with a number of measures . It says that in 2011 it achieved a continuous water supply 24 hours per day 7 days a week , an increase in revenues so that operating costs are more than covered , and a reduction of water losses from 53 % in 2003 to 29 % in 2010 . For these achievements DWASA , got a " Performer of the Year Award " at the Global Water Summit 2011 in Berlin . In the future DWASA plans massive investment to replace dwindling groundwater resources with treated surface water from less polluted rivers located up to 160 km from the city . In 2011 Bangladesh 's capital development authority , Rajdhani <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , made rainwater harvesting for new houses mandatory in an effort to address water scarcity and reduce flooding . 
 82 % of the city 's water supply is abstracted from groundwater through 577 deep tube wells , while four relatively small surface water treatment plants provide the remaining 18 % . Groundwater levels are dropping at two to three metres every year . The city 's water table has sunk by 50 metres in the past four decades and the closest underground water is now over 60 metres below ground level . The Asian Development Bank estimated in 2007 that by 2015 a severe supply shortage would occur if the utility did not reduce groundwater abstraction . Nevertheless , DWASA announced in 2012 that it will develop a new <unk> with 46 wells providing 150 @,@ 000 m3 ( 5 @,@ 297 @,@ 200 cu ft ) of water per day at a cost of 63 million USD , of which 45 million USD will be financed by the government of South Korea . 
 The utility plans to substitute surface water for groundwater through the construction of four large water treatment plants until 2020 at a cost of 1 @.@ 8 billion USD ( <unk> Phase II and III , Padma / Pagla and <unk> ) . The treatment plants will draw water from more distant and less polluted rivers up to 160 km from the city . The four plants are expected to have a combined capacity of 1 @.@ 63 million cubic metres per year , compared to a 2010 supply of 2 @.@ 11 million cubic metre per year that is mainly from groundwater . As of 2011 , funding had been secured for the first plant which is under construction thanks to a 250 million USD contribution from Danish development assistance . In 2012 the government signed a contract with a Chinese company to build a water treatment plant at Munshiganj on the Padma River . The project costs 407 million USD , of which 290 @.@ 8 million USD is financed by a soft loan from the Chinese government , the remainder coming from the Bangladeshi government .

 = Murray cod = 
 The Murray cod ( Maccullochella peelii ) is a large Australian predatory freshwater fish of the Maccullochella genus and the <unk> family . Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular , it is not related to the Northern Hemisphere marine cod ( <unk> ) species . The Murray cod is an important part of Australia 's vertebrate wildlife and is found in the Murray @-@ Darling River system in Australia . The Murray cod is the largest exclusively freshwater fish in Australia , and one of the largest in the world . Other common names for Murray cod include cod , <unk> , <unk> , Mary River cod , Murray perch , <unk> , <unk> and Queensland freshwater cod . 
 The scientific name of Murray cod derives from an early Australian fish researcher with the surname McCulloch and the river from which the explorer Major Mitchell first scientifically described the species , the Peel River . This was for a number of years changed to M. peelii peelii to differentiate Murray cod from Mary River cod , which were designated as a subspecies of Murray cod . However , as of 2010 , Mary River cod have been raised to full species status ( M. <unk> ) , thus Murray cod have reverted simply to M. peelii . 
 Murray cod populations have declined severely since European colonisation of Australia due to a number of causes , including severe overfishing , river regulation , and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species . However , they once inhabited almost the entire Murray @-@ Darling basin , Australia 's largest river system , in very great numbers . 
 A long @-@ lived fish , adult Murray cod are carnivorous and mainly eat other fish . The species exhibits a high degree of parental care for their eggs , which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces . Murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species . Often available through the aquarium trade , they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Murray cod is a large grouper @-@ like fish with a deep , elongated body that is round in cross section . It has a broad , scooped head , and a large mouth lined with pads of very small , needle @-@ like teeth . The jaws of the Murray cod are equal , or the lower jaw protrudes slightly . 
 The spiny dorsal fin of Murray cod is moderate to low in height and is partially separated by a notch from the high , rounded soft dorsal fin . Soft dorsal , anal , and caudal ( tail ) fins are all large and rounded , and are dusky grey or black with distinct white edges . The large , rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to the flanks . The pelvic fins are large , angular , and set forward of the pectoral fins . The leading white @-@ coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two trailing white filaments , while the pelvic fins themselves are usually a translucent white or cream , tending toward opacity in large fish . 
 Murray cod are white to cream on their ventral ( belly ) surfaces . Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish @-@ green to green , overlain with heavy darker green , but occasionally brown or black , mottling . The effect is a marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard 's markings . Colouration is related to water clarity ; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats . Small to medium @-@ sized Murray cod from clear @-@ water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration . Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey @-@ green colouration . 
 = = = Size = = = 
 Murray cod are large fish , with adult fish regularly reaching 80 – 100 cm ( 31 – 39 in ) in length in all but the very smallest waterways . Murray cod are capable of growing well over 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) in length and the largest on record was over 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) and about 113 kg ( 249 lb ) in weight . Large breeding fish are rare in most wild populations today due to overfishing . 
 = = Related species = = 
 Murray cod continue a pattern present in Murray @-@ Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species : Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species . The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because , being adaptable and successful fish , Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats , while the now endangered trout cod stray ( or did stray , before their decline ) well down the upland / lowland transition zone , which can be extensive in Murray @-@ Darling Rivers . Nevertheless , the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present . 
 Murray cod , like a number of other Murray @-@ Darling native fish species , have also managed to cross the Great Dividing Range at least once through natural river capture events , leading to several species and subspecies of coastal cod . The best known are eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales , and Mary River cod of the Mary River system in south eastern Queensland , both of which are endangered , but survive today . Coastal cod were also found in the Richmond River system in northern New South Wales and the Brisbane River system in southern Queensland , but are now extinct . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In the 1800s and early 1900s , commercial fishermen , recreational fishermen , riverside residents , and some fisheries scientists ( e.g. Anderson , Stead , Langtry ) distinctly recognised two species of cod in the southern Murray @-@ Darling basin , Murray cod and trout cod or " blue nose cod " . <unk> however , confusion abounded . Ignoring glaring differences in size at sexual maturity , and via some rather unscientific reasoning , some prominent fisheries scientists ( e.g. Whitley ) insisted on recognising only one species of cod — the Murray cod ( then named Maccullochella <unk> , after an early Australian fish researcher with the surname McCulloch and the Macquarie River in New South Wales where the holotype was captured ) . Then , as trout cod declined into near extinction over the 1900s , the distinction between the two species was further eroded and finally questioned . In the 1970s , early genetic techniques confirmed that trout cod were a separate species and further showed that the original " Murray cod " specimen was in fact a trout cod . Following the rules of scientific classification , the name M. <unk> remained with the original specimen , now known to be the trout cod , and a new name , M. peelii , for the Peel River where the new holotype was captured , was coined for the Murray cod . Subsequently , two further cod were identified as separate species , the eastern freshwater cod ( M. <unk> ) and the Mary River cod ( M. <unk> ) . 
 = = Range = = 
 The Murray cod is named after the Murray River , part of the Murray @-@ Darling basin in eastern Australia , Australia 's largest and most important river system , draining around 14 % of the continent . The Murray cod 's natural range encompasses virtually the whole Murray @-@ Darling basin , particularly the lowland areas , and extending well into upland areas — to about 700 m ( 2 @,@ 297 ft ) elevation in the southern half of the basin and to about 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) in the northern half of the basin . 
 Consequently , Murray cod inhabit a remarkably wide variety of habitats , from cool , clear , fast @-@ flowing streams with riffle @-@ and @-@ pool structure and rocky substrates in upland areas to large , slow flowing , meandering rivers in the extensive alluvial lowland reaches of the Murray @-@ Darling basin . 
 Murray cod have died out in many of their upland habitats , particularly in the southern Murray @-@ Darling basin , due to a combination of overfishing , siltation , dams and weirs blocking migration , pollution from arsenic @-@ based sheep @-@ dips , mining , and in some cases , introduced trout stockings , which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species . 
 = = Age = = 
 Murray cod are very long @-@ lived , which is characteristic of many freshwater native fish in Australia . Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event , which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades . Murray cod are the most long @-@ lived freshwater native fish in Australia . The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age , and the even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages , of 70 years or more . 
 = = Diet = = 
 The Murray cod is the apex aquatic predator in the rivers of the Murray @-@ Darling basin , and will eat almost anything smaller than itself , including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod , golden perch , silver perch , bony bream , eel @-@ tailed catfish , western carp gudgeon , and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp , goldfish , and redfin ( English perch ) , as well as crustaceans such as yabbies , freshwater shrimp , and Murray crayfish . Fish compose the majority of the diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats , and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats . Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks , cormorants , freshwater turtles , water dragons , snakes , mice , and frogs . The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct . While this behaviour is typical during the day , at night , Murray cod are active pelagic predators , venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Murray cod reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age , generally five years . Sexual maturity in Murray cod is dependent on age . Therefore , roughly 70 % of wild river Murray cod , with their slower growth rate , have reached sexual maturity by 50 cm ( 20 in ) in length . Wild Murray cod in impoundments like Lake <unk> , with their faster growth rates , do not reach sexual maturity until they are well over 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) in length . These data strongly indicate the 60 @-@ cm ( 20 @-@ in ) size limit for Murray cod is inadequate and should be increased substantially to allow for a greater chance of reproduction before capture . 
 Large female Murray cod in the 15 – to 35 @-@ kg ( 35 – to 80 @-@ lb ) range are the most important breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons ; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs , and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours . Such large females may also have valuable , successful genes to pass on . All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish . 
 Female Murray cod , upon first reaching sexual maturity , have egg counts of no more than 10 @,@ 000 . Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80 @,@ 000 – 90 @,@ 000 , although a recent , very large 33 @-@ kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110 @,@ 000 viable eggs . Egg counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species . 
 Murray cod spawn in spring , cued by rising water temperatures and increasing photoperiod ( daylight length ) . Initially , fish biologists working with Murray cod considered spring floods and temperatures of 20 – 21 ° C ( 68 – 70 ° F ) to be necessary and that spring flooding is critical for successful recruitment ( i.e. survival to juvenile stages ) of young cod by providing an influx of pelagic zooplankton and early life @-@ stage macroinvertebrates off the flood plain into the main river channel for first feeding , but more recent research has shown Murray cod breed annually , with or without spring floods , and at temperatures as low as 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) . Additionally , recent research has shown abundant epibenthic / epiphytic ( bottom dwelling / edge clinging ) prey in unflooded lowland rivers , traits in Murray cod larvae that should allow survival in a variety of challenging conditions , and a significant proportion of Murray cod larvae feeding successfully in unflooded rivers . 
 Latest research has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream . Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains , or the larvae feed on floodplains , are incorrect . Murray cod breed in the main river channel or , in times of spring flood , the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels , but not on floodplains . Murray cod larvae feed within the main river channel or , in times of spring flood , on the inundated upper portion of the main channel and the channel / floodplain boundary , but not on the floodplain . 
 Spawning is preceded by significant upstream migrations if high spring flows or floods allow . Radio @-@ tracked Murray cod in the Murray River have migrated up to 120 km ( 75 mi ) upstream to spawn , before returning to exactly the same snag from where they departed , an unusual homing behaviour in a freshwater fish . Decades of observations by recreational and commercial fishermen suggest such spring spawning migrations are common across the Murray cod 's geographical range . Spawning is initiated by pairing up and courtship rituals . During the courtship ritual a spawning site is selected and cleaned — hard surfaces such as rocks in upland rivers and impoundments , and logs and occasionally clay banks in lowland rivers , at a depth of 2 – 3 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 – 9 @.@ 8 ft ) , are selected . The female lays the large adhesive eggs as a mat on the spawning surface , which the male fertilises . The female then leaves the spawning site . The male remains to guard the eggs during incubation , which takes six to 10 days ( depending on water temperature ) , and to guard the hatched larvae for a further week or so until they disperse . Larvae disperse from the nest site by drifting in river currents at night , and continue this behaviour around four to seven days . During this dispersal process , larvae simultaneously absorb the remainder of their yolk sac and begin to feed on pelagic zooplankton , small , early life @-@ stage macroinvertebrates and epibenthic / epiphytic ( bottom dwelling / edge clinging ) <unk> . 
 The relationship between river flows and Murray cod recruitment are more complex than first thought , and in less regulated rivers , Murray cod may be able to recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows . ( Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low @-@ flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven . ) This information also suggests that <unk> @-@ regulation @-@ related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought ; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought ; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks , through depletion of spawning adults , than first thought . 
 These findings do not mean that river regulation and water extraction have not had adverse effects on fish stocks . Rather , river regulation has been a major factor in the decline of Murray cod and other native fish . Thermal pollution is also a major problem , evidence indicates strong Murray cod recruitment events ( which may be important for sustaining Murray cod populations over the long term ) can result from spring flooding , and the health of Australian lowland river ecosystems generally rely on periodic spring flooding . Also , due to the regulation of most of the rivers in the Murray @-@ Darling River system , mainly for irrigation purposes , only exceptional spring floods manage to " break free " . The long @-@ term viability of wild Murray cod , other native fish species and river ecosystems , in the face of this fact , are of great concern . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Murray cod were originally the most common large native fish in the Murray @-@ Darling basin . Contrary to some fishery department literature , the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing . In the latter half of the 1800s and the early 1900s , Murray cod — very large , very long @-@ lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen . For example , one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855 , targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river , and yet within eight years , grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation , and complaints about the near @-@ absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds , were being raised in the main state newspaper , The Argus . Yet , fishing effort continued to increase in the region , so in the late 1880s and early 1890s , between 40 @,@ 000 and 150 @,@ 000 kg of mostly Murray cod ( between 7 @,@ 500 and 27 @,@ 000 fish , at an average weight of 5 @.@ 5 kg ) were caught near Echuca . Similarly , in 1883 , more than 147 @,@ 000 kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town ( <unk> ) . By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large @-@ scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible . Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era , using rods and reels , handlines , setlines , drum nets , gill nets , and even explosives , with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold . Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the Register News ( a South Australian newspaper ) in 1929 : 
 In [ the last ] 29 years 26 @,@ 214 @,@ 502 lbs ( nearly 11 @,@ 703 tons ) [ 11 @,@ 915 @,@ 683 kg ] of Murray cod has been eaten by the people of Melbourne . The Superintendent of Markets ( Mr G. B. Minns ) included these figures in a statement he made today pointing out that the supply was declining . In 1918 , the peak year , 2 @,@ 229 @,@ 024 lb [ 1 @,@ 011 @,@ 068 kg ] was received at the market , but since 1921 , when 1 @,@ 101 @,@ 520 lb [ 499 @,@ 640 kg ] was sent to Melbourne , supply has decreased . Last year [ 1928 ] it was only 551 @,@ 040 lb [ 249 @,@ 950 kg ] . 
 Incredibly , 20 years later , the aquatic ecologist <unk> Langtry was still compelled to criticise the extremely heavy , lawless , fishing pressure , in the form of both uncontrolled small @-@ scale commercial fishing and rampant illegal fishing , with which he was confronted in all reaches of the Murray River he investigated in 1949 – 1950 . 
 Indeed , a thorough reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports reveals that the whole history of wild Murray cod between the mid – 1800s and the mid – 1900s was one of citizen agitation , government inaction , and ongoing stock decline . For decade after decade , riverside residents , commercial fishermen , recreational fishermen , local fisheries inspectors , fish retailers , and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently , continuously declining Murray cod stocks , to be met in turn either with government denials , or conversely , with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries , and various ineffective control measures . For decade after decade , debate about excessive fishing pressure , number of fishermen , number of nets , net mesh size , bag limits , minimum size limits and take of small cod , closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring , and other sundry issues , raged on and on without proper resolution , with fishing regulations either not amended , or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored , and with heavy commercial , recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated . The end result was a Murray cod population , initially unimaginably abundant , continually fished down and down and down without pause , until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation ( listed below ) emerged to drive the species even further into decline . All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation . There are now grave concerns for the long @-@ term survival of wild Murray cod populations . 
 Although angler effects are sometimes disregarded in the overall picture today , recent population studies have shown that while all year classes are well represented up to the minimum legal angling size ( now 60 centimetres in most states ) , above that size , numbers of fish are dramatically reduced almost to the point of non @-@ existence in many waters . Some emphasis has been made of the results of two small surveys which suggested a majority of Murray cod are released by anglers . However , there are valid questions as to the representativeness of these surveys , these surveys do not explain the dramatic disappearance of large numbers of young Murray cod at exactly the minimum size limit , and most importantly , any emphasis on these surveys miss the fundamental point — as a large , long @-@ lived species with relatively low fecundity and delayed sexual maturity wild Murray cod populations are extremely vulnerable to overfishing , even with only modest angler @-@ kill . A tightening of fishing regulations for wild Murray cod , as referred to above , and a switch by fishermen to a largely catch and release approach for wild Murray cod would alleviate this problem . Recognising these issues , in late 2014 the New South Wales and Victorian fishery departments amended their regulations so that a slot limit of 55 to 75 cm now applies in these states . ( I.e. Only Murray cod between 55 and 75 cm may be taken ; those above and below this size range or " slot " must be released . ) This measure should have positive effects for the Murray cod population by protecting and increasing the proportion of large breeding Murray cod . 
 Another issue is that Murray cod caught and released in winter , while developing their eggs , or in spring prior to spawning , resorb their eggs and do not spawn . This may be a minor issue compared to some of the other threats facing Murray cod , nevertheless , concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times . At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period , during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod , even on a catch and release basis . 
 State Government Fisheries departments support Murray cod populations by stocking with hatchery bred fish , especially in man made lakes . Important issues affecting restoration of cod populations , such as the need for spring floods and excessive angler take , are slowly being acknowledged but are yet to be definitely addressed . 
 = = = Effects of river regulation = = = 
 The Murray River and southern tributaries originally displayed a pattern of high flows in winter , high flows and floods in spring , and low flows in summer and autumn . The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray @-@ Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns . River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns , with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod . The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring . Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood @-@ pulse have been completely eliminated . 
 It is estimated that flows at the river mouth by 1995 had declined to only 27 % of natural outflows . The probability of the bottom end of the Murray experiencing drought like flows had increased from 5 % under natural conditions to 60 % by 1995 . 
 Thermal pollution is the artificial reduction in water temperatures , especially in summer and autumn , caused when frigid water is released from the bottom of reservoirs for irrigation demands . Such temperature suppression typically extends several hundred kilometres downstream . Thermal pollution inhibits both the breeding of Murray cod and the survival of Murray cod larvae , and in extreme cases inhibits even the survival of adult Murray cod . 
 The rare floods that do break free of the dams and weirs of the Murray @-@ Darling system have their magnitude and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators . Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray @-@ Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide . 
 = = = Physical barriers to fish movement = = = 
 Dams , weirs and other instream barriers block the migration of adult and juvenile Murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations . Additionally , recent study has proven approximately 50 % of Murray cod larvae are killed when they pass through undershot weirs . 
 = = = Habitat degradation / siltation = = = 
 Hundreds of thousands , perhaps more than a million , submerged timber " snags " , mainly River Red Gum , have been removed from lowland reaches of the Murray @-@ Darling basin over the past 150 years . The removal of such a vast number of snags has had devastating impacts on Murray cod and river ecosystems . <unk> are critical habitats and spawning sites for Murray cod . <unk> are also critical for the functioning of lowland river ecosystems — as one of the few hard substrates in lowland river channels composed of fine silts snags are crucial sites for biofilm growth , macroinvertebrate grazing and general in @-@ stream productivity . 
 Vegetation clearing and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation , which fill in pools , degrade river ecosystems and make rivers and streams uninhabitable for Murray cod . This is exacerbated by removal of riparian ( riverbank ) vegetation which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways . 
 = = = Overfishing = = = 
 While extremely severe commercial and recreational overfishing in the 1800s and the early 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod , overfishing by recreational fishermen , aided by inadequate fishing regulations , continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod . The current size limit of 60 centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod . This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70 centimetres and reducing the bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long @-@ term viability of wild Murray cod populations . As of November 2014 , the NSW Department of Fisheries has introduced a maximum size limit of 75 cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish , as well as a new minimum size limit of 55 cm . 
 = = = Introduced carp = = = 
 Evidence is mounting that there is serious competition for food between larval / early juvenile introduced carp and larval / early juvenile native fish . Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray @-@ Darling rivers ; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up , and the large numbers of larvae carp produce , causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish . Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite ( Lernaea <unk> ) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = = Introduced pathogens = = = 
 Murray cod have soft skin and very fine scales that leave them vulnerable to infection from exotic disease organisms . The following exotic disease organisms all seriously affect wild Murray cod ; all have been introduced by imports of exotic fish . <unk> is a single @-@ celled , parasitic protozoa that infects the skin of Murray cod and has caused a number of serious kills of wild Murray cod . Saprolegnia is a fungus @-@ like oomycete or " water mould " that frequently infects Murray cod eggs and the skin of Murray cod that have been roughly handled through poor catch and release technique . ( It is essential that Murray cod intended for release only touch cool wet surfaces and are not put down on any hard , dry , rough or hot surfaces , e.g. boat gunwales , boat floors , dry grass , dry rocks , gravel banks , dry towels or mats , etc . Hands should also be wetted before touching them . ) Wild Murray cod populations across their range suffer extremely severe infestations of Lernaea or " anchor worm " , a parasitic copepod vectored by introduced carp and that burrows into the skin of Murray cod . Lernaea puncture wounds are often secondarily infected by bacteria . Severe Lernaea infestations probably causes the death of many more adult Murray cod than commonly recognised . Ebner reports a young adult Murray cod seemingly killed by severe Lernaea infestation .

 Murray cod play a very important role in the mythology of many Aboriginal tribes in the Murray @-@ Darling basin , and for some tribes , particular those living along the Murray River , Murray cod were the icon species . The myths of these tribes describe the creation of the Murray River by a gigantic Murray cod fleeing down a small creek to escape from a renowned hunter . In these myths , the fleeing Murray cod enlarges the river and the beating of its tail create the bends in it . The cod is eventually speared near the terminus of the Murray River , chopped into pieces , and the pieces thrown back into the river . The pieces become all the other fish species of the river . The cod 's head is kept intact , told to " keep being Murray cod " , and also thrown back into the river .

 = Younger Than Yesterday = 
 Younger Than Yesterday is the fourth album by the American rock band The Byrds and was released on February 6 , 1967 on Columbia Records ( see 1967 in music ) . It saw the band continuing to integrate elements of psychedelic rock into their music , a process they had begun on their previous album , Fifth Dimension . In addition , the album captured the band and record producer Gary Usher experimenting with new musical textures , including brass instruments , reverse tape effects and an electronic oscillator . 
 The album also marked the emergence of the band 's bass player Chris Hillman as a talented songwriter and vocalist . Prior to Younger Than Yesterday , Hillman had only received one shared writing credit with The Byrds , but this album saw him credited as the sole composer of four songs and a co @-@ writer of " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " . Byrds expert Tim Connors has noted that two of Hillman 's compositions on Younger Than Yesterday exhibited country and western influences and thus can be seen as early indicators of the country rock experimentation that would feature — to a greater or lesser degree — on all of The Byrds ' subsequent albums . 
 Upon release , the album peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached number 37 on the UK Albums Chart . It was preceded by the " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " single in January 1967 , which reached the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 . Two additional singles taken from the album , " My Back Pages " and " Have You Seen Her Face " , were also moderately successful on the Billboard singles chart . However , none of the singles taken from the album charted in the United Kingdom . Music critics Richie Unterberger and David Fricke have both noted that although it was largely overlooked by the public at the time of its release , the album 's critical standing has improved over the years and today Younger Than Yesterday is considered one of The Byrds ' best albums . The title of Younger Than Yesterday is derived from the lyrics of " My Back Pages " , a song written by Bob Dylan , which was covered on the album .

 The Byrds had initially come to international prominence in mid @-@ 1965 , when their folk rock interpretation of Bob Dylan 's " Mr. Tambourine Man " reached number 1 on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart . Further commercial successes followed , with the band releasing two hit albums and reaching number 1 for a second time in the U.S. , with a cover version of Pete Seeger 's " Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! ( to Everything There is a Season ) " . Throughout the latter half of 1965 , the band enjoyed tremendous popularity among teenage pop fans and their music received widespread airplay on Top 40 radio . In early 1966 , The Byrds ' principal songwriter , Gene Clark , departed the band , leaving Jim McGuinn , David Crosby , Chris Hillman , and Michael Clarke to complete the band 's third album , Fifth Dimension , without him . Upon release , Fifth Dimension received a mixed critical reception and was less commercially successful than the band 's earlier albums . As a result , The Byrds ' popularity began to wane and by late 1966 , they had been all but forgotten by mainstream pop audiences . 
 Shortly after the release of Fifth Dimension , The Byrds found themselves without a record producer , when Allen Stanton , who had worked with them on that album , left Columbia Records to work for A & M. The band chose to replace Stanton with Gary Usher , a former songwriting partner of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys , who had recently co @-@ produced Gene Clark 's debut solo album , Gene Clark with the <unk> Brothers . In addition to producing the recording sessions for Younger Than Yesterday , Usher would produce the band 's next two albums as well . The Byrds ' biographer Johnny Rogan states that Usher 's wealth of production experience and love of innovative studio experimentation would prove invaluable as the group entered their most creatively adventurous phase . Author David N. Howard has also remarked that despite the hodgepodge of styles and genres present on Younger Than Yesterday , Usher 's studio expertise gives the album an impressively uniform consistency . 
 Following an intensive period of rehearsal at their Sunset Boulevard headquarters , The Byrds completed the entire Younger Than Yesterday album at Columbia Studios , Hollywood , during a work @-@ intensive , eleven @-@ day period , starting on November 28 and finishing on December 8 , 1966 . The original working title for the LP was Sanctuary , but ultimately this was dropped in favor of a title inspired by the chorus lyrics of the album 's Bob Dylan cover , " My Back Pages " : 
 Ah , but I was so much older then , 
 I 'm younger than that now . 
 Although Clark had left The Byrds prior to completion of the Fifth Dimension album , he did participate in the recording of the songs " Eight Miles High " and " Captain Soul " from that record . As a result , Younger Than Yesterday was the first album to be entirely recorded by The Byrds without Clark 's participation . As on Fifth Dimension , guitarists Jim McGuinn and David Crosby continued to hone their songwriting skills in an attempt to fill the void left by Clark 's departure . 
 However , the most surprising development within The Byrds at this time was the emergence of bass player Chris Hillman as both a lead vocalist and the band 's third songwriter . Prior to the recording of Younger Than Yesterday , Hillman had never sung lead vocals on a Byrds ' recording and his only writing contribution with the band had been a shared credit for the instrumental track " Captain Soul " . On this album , however , he is credited as the sole songwriter of " Have You Seen Her Face " , " Time Between " , " Thoughts and Words " , and " The Girl with No Name " , with all four tracks featuring him as the lead vocalist . Hillman is also credited as the co @-@ writer of " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " , which he sings with McGuinn and Crosby . 
 = = Music = = 
 Younger Than Yesterday found The Byrds expanding their musical style in several different directions . Chris Hillman contributed two country rock @-@ flavored songs with " Time Between " and " The Girl with No Name " , the latter of which was inspired by a young lady with the unusual moniker of Girl Freiberg . " Time Between " , on the other hand , was a Paul McCartney @-@ influenced pop song and the result of Hillman 's first ever attempt at writing a song on his own . Both songs featured the country @-@ style guitar playing of session musician Clarence White , who would go on to become a full member of The Byrds ' latter @-@ day line @-@ up from 1968 through to 1973 . Byrds expert Tim Connors has suggested that the pop @-@ country sound of " Time Between " and " The Girl with No Name " — like " Mr. Spaceman " from the band 's previous album — anticipated the experimentation with country music that would color The Byrds ' subsequent albums . 
 In addition to these two country @-@ tinged songs , Hillman also contributed the LSD @-@ influenced " Thoughts and Words " , a metaphysical meditation on human relationships that featured the sitar @-@ like sound of backwards guitar effects . A fourth Hillman @-@ penned song on the album , the British Invasion @-@ influenced " Have You Seen Her Face " , was considered commercial enough to be issued as a single in the U.S. some months after the release of the album . Tim Connors had noted on his <unk> website that these four melodic , romantically themed Hillman songs brought to the album elements that had largely been missing from the band 's recordings since Clark 's departure . 
 Hillman also had a hand in writing the album 's opening track , " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " . With its satirical and sarcastic lyrics , the song was an acerbic , but good @-@ natured swipe at the success of manufactured pop bands like The Monkees . However , Tim Connors has stated that " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " also suggests certain ironies due to pre @-@ fabricated aspects of The Byrds ' own origin , including drummer Michael Clarke having been initially recruited for his good looks , rather than for his musical ability . As a result of this , Music journalist David Fricke has noted that some fans have mistaken " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " for an autobiographical song . Hillman 's driving bassline and McGuinn 's chiming twelve @-@ string Rickenbacker guitar riff form the core of the song , with the production being rounded off by the sound of screaming teenage fans , which had been recorded at a Byrds ' concert in Bournemouth during the band 's 1965 English tour . South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela contributed the trumpet solo featured in the song , which represented the first use of brass on a Byrds ' recording . Masekela and The Byrds would later perform " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " together at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17 , 1967 . 
 McGuinn and Crosby 's songs , written both separately and together , represented an expansion of the jazz influences and psychedelia that had been featured heavily on the band 's previous album . The song " C.T.A.-102 " , named after the CTA @-@ 102 quasar and written by McGuinn and his science @-@ fiction @-@ minded friend Bob Hippard , was a whimsical , but ultimately serious song that speculated on the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life . McGuinn explained the inspiration for the song in a 1973 interview with ZigZag magazine : " At the time we wrote it I thought it might be possible to make contact with quasars , but later I found out that they were stars which are imploding at a tremendous velocity . They 're condensing and spinning at the same time , and the nucleus is sending out tremendous amounts of radiation , some of which is audible as an electronic impulse on a computerized radio telescope . It comes out in a rhythmic pattern ... and originally , the radio astronomers who received these impulses thought they were from a life @-@ form in space . " Although the band 's earlier song " Mr. Spaceman " had been thematically similar , " C.T.A.-102 " was a slightly more serious attempt at tackling the subject matter , highlighted by the extensive use of studio sound effects , simulated alien voices and the sound of an electronic oscillator . 
 Crosby 's songwriting skills had also developed rapidly , with journalist David Fricke citing " Renaissance Fair " ( co @-@ written with McGuinn ) as an example of his increasingly wistful lyricism and writing style . The song was inspired by a visit to the Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California and Byrds expert Tim Connors has noted that its dream @-@ like medieval ambiance can be seen as a thematic precursor to Crosby 's later song " <unk> " . David Fricke has also praised the instrumental interplay between the " church bell peal " of Crosby and McGuinn 's guitars , and Hillman 's melodic , loping bass , while describing the song as " a radiant evocation of a medieval festival , and by extension the sensual idealism of the hippie dream . " Writing for the Allmusic website , critic Bruce Eder attempted to sum up the song 's contemporary relevance by suggesting that it was " a topical song every bit as tied to real events as Buffalo Springfield 's ' For What It 's Worth ' . " In addition , Eder also described " Renaissance Fair " as " a perfect synthesis of the group 's original electric @-@ folk sound evolved into a new , more contemporary form of music and songwriting , almost hippie @-@ folk music . " 
 Another of Crosby 's songwriting contributions to the album was the moody , jazz @-@ influenced " Everybody 's Been Burned " , a somber meditation on the need to find a balance between disillusionment and resolute perseverance in a relationship . Although the song was regarded by many critics as a leap forward in terms of musical sophistication upon its release , it actually dated back to 1962 , before the formation of The Byrds . Originally written as a nightclub torch song , Crosby had recorded demos of " Everybody 's Been Burned " as early as 1963 . An acoustic recording of the song by Crosby , dating from this pre @-@ Byrds period , was eventually released on the archival album Preflyte Plus in 2012 . Author Johnny Rogan has stated that The Byrds ' recording of the song features one of Crosby 's best vocal performances and one of McGuinn 's most moving guitar solos , while critic Thomas Ward described it as " one of the most haunting songs in the Byrds ' catalogue , and one of David Crosby 's finest compositions . " 
 Crosby 's ambitions for artistic control within the band were expanding along with his compositional skill , and the resulting turmoil would ultimately lead to his dismissal from the group during recording sessions for The Byrds ' next album , The Notorious Byrd Brothers . One source of discontent for Crosby during the recording of Younger Than Yesterday was related to the Bob Dylan cover " My Back Pages " . The song had been suggested as a suitable vehicle for The Byrds by their manager , Jim Dickson , but since it was the fourth song from Dylan 's Another Side of Bob Dylan album that the band had covered , Crosby felt that recording " My Back Pages " was formulaic and a step backwards artistically . However , since the album 's release , critics have praised the song as one of The Byrds ' strongest Dylan interpretations . 
 Meanwhile , Crosby insisted upon the inclusion of the contentious track " Mind Gardens " , which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no " rhythm , meter , or rhyme . " In conversation with the Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980 , Crosby defended the song by stating " it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they 'd never heard anything like it before . At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm . And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm , so it was outside of their experience . It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain , then you also shut out the joy and the love . " Although " Mind Gardens " is often dismissed by critics and fans for being excessively self @-@ indulgent , Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance , symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture The Byrds at their most creatively ambitious . 
 Crosby also fought to have the song " Why " ( co @-@ written with McGuinn ) included on the album , despite it having already been issued as the B @-@ side of the band 's " Eight Miles High " single , some eleven months earlier . However , the version of " Why " included on Younger Than Yesterday was recorded during sessions for that album and is a totally different take from the previously released B @-@ side version . Exactly why Crosby insisted on resurrecting the song , when there was newer original material in reserve , remains a mystery , although The Byrds ' roadie , Jimmi Seiter , has speculated that it was an attempt to increase Crosby 's share of the songwriting on the album . Author Peter Lavezzoli has commented that " Why " features verses with a chord structure reminiscent of " ( Love Is Like a ) Heat Wave " by Martha and the Vandellas and a raga @-@ flavored lead guitar solo inspired by the music of sitarist Ravi Shankar . However , biographer Johnny Rogan has noted that the song 's Indian classical music influences were considerably watered down on the re @-@ recorded version that appeared on Younger Than Yesterday when compared to the earlier B @-@ side recording .

 The album was preceded by the " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " single , which was released on January 9 , 1967 and reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 , but failed to chart in the UK . Two additional singles taken from the album , " My Back Pages " and " Have You Seen Her Face " , reached number 30 and number 74 on the Billboard chart respectively , but again missed the UK chart . The " My Back Pages " single was the last single release by The Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 .

 Upon release , the album received mostly positive reviews from the music press , with Billboard magazine predicting that " The Byrds will be riding high on the LP charts again with this top rock package . " Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times was more cautious , noting that " the album is a good one , but it would be sad if it served as a monument , marking the end of The Byrds ' development . There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity . " A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly , writing in Hi @-@ Fi / Stereo Review , who described the record as " an enjoyable and well @-@ made album which , if listened to closely enough , explains a good deal about what is going on around us . " 
 However , the burgeoning underground press in the U.S. was less complimentary , with Richard Goldstein , writing in New York 's The Village Voice , noting that " There is nothing new or startling on Younger Than Yesterday . " A slightly more positive review by Sandy Pearlman in Crawdaddy ! expressed some reservations , but praised the album 's musical eclecticism , while noting " This sound is dense , but not obviously and impressively complicated . That is , it is very coherent . It works because of its unity , not out of an accumulation of contrasting effects such as volume changes and syncopations . " 
 In the UK , journalist Penny Valentine , writing in Disc magazine , described the album as a return to form for The Byrds , before declaring that the band were " back where they belong with a sound as fresh as cream and sunflowers . " Melody Maker was also enthusiastic about the album , commenting , " if you ignore this album you are not only foolish - but deaf ! " . Record Mirror awarded the album four stars out of five and Allen Evans of the NME also praised the LP : " This is an exciting album , at times brash and noisy ( ' So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star ' , ' Have You Seen Her Face ' ) , spooky ( the science @-@ fiction outer @-@ space sounds on ' C.T.A.-102 ' ) , folksy ( ' Everybody 's Been Burned ' ) , weird ( the irritating , monotonous backing to ' Mind Gardens ' ) , and pleasant ( the soft swinging of ' The Girl with No Name ' ) . A lot of thought has gone into this album and it 's good because of it . " 
 Author Peter Buckley attempted to evaluate Younger Than Yesterday 's contemporary impact more than 30 years after the fact in his 1999 book , The Rough Guide to Rock : " The album had room for everything from Hugh Masekela 's trumpet to droning sitar @-@ like riffs , a brew that may 've been too rich for The Byrds ' rapidly shrinking teen audience , but was perfectly in tune with a new underground following who disdained hit singles but were coming to regard albums as major artistic statements .

 Although Younger Than Yesterday was somewhat overlooked by the record @-@ buying public at the time of its release , achieving only moderate chart success as a result , its critical stature has grown substantially over the years . In his 2003 book Eight Miles High : Folk @-@ Rock 's Flight from Haight @-@ Ashbury to Woodstock , Richie Unterberger states that Younger Than Yesterday " was [ the Byrds ' ] best album besides Mr. Tambourine Man , and more progressive in many ways . " The author goes on to say that the album and its follow @-@ up are " now revered as two of the great 1960s albums by historians and fans " , while also acknowledging that " at the time , though , the Byrds were considered by many to be waning . " Unterberger also praised the album in his review for the Allmusic website , describing it as one of " the most durable of the Byrds ' albums " . 
 Rock critic Robert Christgau , writing for Rolling Stone magazine in 2007 , called Younger Than Yesterday " the Byrds ' first mature album , a blend of space @-@ flight twang and electric hoedown infused with the imminent glow of 1967 yet underlined with crackling realism . " Critic John Nork gave the album a glowing review on the Analogue Planet website , calling it " a <unk> smorgasbord of eclectic musical styles and groundbreaking innovation " , before concluding that " in every sense , Younger Than Yesterday is an utterly brilliant album , arguably the Byrds ' best . " Alan <unk> , writing in the book Rhino 's Psychedelic Trip , described Younger Than Yesterday as " an essential snapshot of an incense @-@ scented , acid @-@ drenched world in motion : a kaleidoscope whose every turn yielded some fantastic window on the age . " 
 In 2003 , the album was ranked at number 124 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . When the list was revised in 2012 , to accommodate a number of albums released since 2003 , Younger Than Yesterday was repositioned at number 127 .

 Younger Than Yesterday was issued on Compact Disc for the first time by Edsel Records in 1987 . It was later reissued by Columbia in the U.S. in 1989 and in the UK in 1993 . It was then remastered at 20 @-@ bit resolution and reissued ( with three of its tracks remixed ) in an expanded form on April 30 , 1996 , as part of the Columbia / Legacy Byrds series . The Columbia / Legacy reissue featured six bonus tracks , including " Lady Friend " and " Old John Robertson " , which had both been issued on a non @-@ album single in July 1967 . The remastered CD also included the David Crosby @-@ penned track " It Happens Each Day " , which had been omitted from the original album , and " Don 't Make Waves " , a song that had been written and recorded by The Byrds for the 1967 Alexander Mackendrick film Don 't Make Waves . The final track on the Columbia / Legacy CD extends to include a hidden track featuring the guitar parts from " Mind Gardens " , which were heard on the album playing backwards , but are presented here playing forwards , as they were originally recorded . 
 In 2011 , the audiophile record label Audio Fidelity released the original mono mix of Younger Than Yesterday on CD for the first time , remastered by audio engineer Steve Hoffman .

 Younger Than Yesterday was one of four Byrds albums that were remixed as part of their re @-@ release on Columbia / Legacy . The reason for these remixes was explained by Bob Irwin ( who produced these re @-@ issues for compact disc ) during an interview with ICE magazine in 1996 :

 = University of Michigan Men 's Glee Club = 
 The University of Michigan Men 's Glee Club is an all @-@ male glee club ( or choir ) at the University of Michigan . With roots tracing back to 1859 , it is the second oldest glee club in the United States and is the oldest student organization at the university . The club has won the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod on four separate occasions . Since 2011 , the Club 's musical director has been Eugene Rogers who has continued to expand the Club 's repertoire and arranged performances . 
 The origins of the club stem from a variety of groups that came together in 1876 . After a number of years including banjo and mandolin players in the club , it reverted to simply a vocal group by the mid @-@ 1920s . It received a substantial rise in profile under the directory of Philip Duey in the 1950s , who organised national , then international tours , and numerous television appearances . Since then , the club has continued to tour internationally at high @-@ profile venues . 
 The club is entirely managed by students , except for the musical director , taken from the university staff . It has a number of traditions , including the practice of snapping fingers instead of clapping . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The club is a student @-@ managed organization , which undertakes all management facilities , including all finances and tour arrangements . Only the musical director is a member of the faculty . It accepts members from both undergraduates and graduates of the university , who are chosen by audition . Membership is made up of the majority of the university 's 17 colleges . 
 The group is composed of about 100 singers from several of the schools and colleges at the University of Michigan . They perform repertoire ranging from music of the Renaissance to African @-@ American spirituals . Their official motto is " In Tradition , <unk> , and Musical Excellence " . 
 A number of traditions are upheld and recognised by choristers . Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other 's achievements ( i.e. a good performance on a solo ) because it is more difficult to clap with one 's music in the other hand . The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented .

 Originally , there were individual Glee Clubs consisting of ten to twenty members , arranged by graduating class . The current framework of a cross @-@ college club started with eight members in 1876 , doubling to sixteen in 1877 . Amongst their early repertoire included numbers written by Fred Newton Scott . In the 1890s , the organisation gained a banjo and mandolin club , causing the name to temporarily change to the University Glee , Banjo , and Mandolin Club . A Freshmen Glee Club was active during the 1890s and 1900s . 
 In the early twentieth century , the club held operas to help raise funds to build the Michigan Union . Because the club was male @-@ only , all female parts were played by men . Several popular songs performed by the club , like " The Bum Army " and " Ann Arbor Days " , were written during this time . 
 In 1908 , the club began to be led by the university faculty , although its official history still notes that this was merely an " advisory " role for over a decade later . By 1914 , the club included two other groups ; the Varsity <unk> and the Midnight Sons , which allowed singers to tackle barbershop and similar music requiring less singers . 
 The " Banjo " was dropped from the name in 1905 , and " Mandolin " in 1923 , after which the group concentrated on vocal performances without instrumentation , becoming the University of Michigan Glee Club . The group was renamed the University of Michigan Men 's Glee Club in 1938 , in reference to a Women 's Glee Club that had gained popularity during the 1930s , and between 1944 and 1948 was briefly known as the University of Michigan Varsity Club . 
 For most of the twentieth century , the club toured locally around Michigan , but did tour across other US states in 1926 and 1941 . World War II prevented any touring , which did not resume until 1947 . 
 = = = The Duey years and later tours = = = 
 Philip Duey took over conducting duties in 1947 and began increasing the Club 's profile with radio and television performances . In 1947 , the group started recording numbers , including " The Friar 's Song " and " ' Tis of Michigan We Sing " to be broadcast on local radio . In the fall of 1951 , the Glee Club started the tradition of performing joint concerts with the Glee Club of a football opponent when they invited the Cornell Glee Club to Ann Arbor . The following year , they made a national television appearance on Ed Sullivan 's " Toast of the Town " . In 1954 , the Glee Club provided the music for an RKO film , Songs of the Colleges , which featured scenes from colleges and universities from around the country . 
 The Glee Club had not previously had the membership base or the financial resources to attempt an international trip , but in the spring of 1955 , a four @-@ week trip to Western Europe was undertaken . Highlights included an appearance at the American Embassy in Rome and a performance before Queen Juliana of the Netherlands . In 1958 , the club made another national television appearance on the Pat Boone Show , 
 In 1956 , Dr. Walter Collins temporarily took over leadership of the club from Duey . During his tenure , an associated group , known as The Friars , was formed . It is named after a former drinking club at the university , and specializes in parodies of popular songs . 
 The European tour in 1959 commemorated the centennial of the Glee Club . In addition to a four @-@ week concert tour , the group competed in the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen , Wales , one of the world 's most significant choral competitions . The boat the club were travelling on was nearly a day late arriving , nearly missing the competition , and they performed having had only three hours sleep . Despite this , the club became the first American choir ever to win the male choir competition . 
 In 1963 , a five @-@ week tour included performances at the residence of the American Ambassador in Athens and the American Embassy in London . The club took first prize in the Llangollen Eisteddfod for a second time , winning over 20 groups from 11 different countries . In 1967 , the club undertook a world tour of 17 different nations , including the Soviet Union . The club returned to Llangollen , where they took third place in the <unk> third place . In March 1969 , Duey retired after 22 years of service . 
 The club toured Europe again in 1971 with new musical director Willis Patterson and won the Eisteddfod for a third time . This feat was repeated for a fourth time in 1978 under the direction of Leonard Johnson , marking four separate occasions when the club had won the competition . To celebrate their four victories , the Glee Club gives out four " Llangollen Awards " annually to members who embody the spirit of this competition . 
 Many other highlights come from the Duey years . In September 1965 the Glee Club — along with Harvard University , Smith College , and Howard University — was invited to represent the United States at the first International University Choral Festival . This event was held at Lincoln Center in New York and at the National Cathedral in Washington , D.C.

 The club performed the pre @-@ game festivities for the final game of the 1984 World Series at Tiger Stadium , but their performance was overshadowed by scenes of violence and rioting after the game . Their tour bus was set upon by rioters , who vandalised it , while the singers fled to safety . A more favourable appearance occurred the following year when , under the direction of Patrick Gardner , the club undertook a 36 @-@ day tour across Europe , which culminated in another appearance at Llangollen , where they placed third . 
 Under the direction of Jerry Blackstone , the Michigan Men 's Glee Club embarked on four major overseas tours . In 1989 the Glee Club spent three weeks touring Asia with concerts in Hong Kong , Japan , and South Korea . In 1992 the Club embarked on a trip to Eastern Europe , where they were one of the first American groups to visit the new country of Estonia , which had recently declared independence from the defunct Soviet Union . 1996 brought the Club to South America including Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay , Chile , and Peru , and the Club most recently traversed Australia in 2000 . The highlight of this tour was the inaugural Men of Song Festival hosted by the Brisbane Boys ' College in which 140 pupils participated in a workshop and joint concert . 
 Under Blackstone 's direction the Club was invited to perform at several conventions of the American Choral Directors Association , including the 1997 National Convention in San Diego . The Club also released six compact discs during this time and was featured on Mannheim Steamroller 's 2001 album Christmas <unk> , with Blackstone co @-@ credited as choir director . In the spring of 2001 the combined Men 's Glee Club and Smith College Glee Club and Chorale gave a performance of Brahms ' Ein deutsches Requiem in Northampton , Massachusetts . The following fall the endeavor was repeated in Hill Auditorium with the Smith and Michigan Women 's Glee Clubs . Blackstone retired in 2002 , with the club 's CD I have had singing being a retrospective of his tenure as conductor . His time spent conducting the club has been well @-@ received , with the secretary of the Warsaw <unk> stating , " I was completely enchanted . It is unbelievable that an amateur group could surpass our most professional choirs with such ease of execution . " 
 Stephen <unk> took over leadership until 2005 ; highlights of his tenure include an appearance at the Intercollegiate Men 's Choruses National Convention at Harvard University , a sixteen @-@ day tour of Great Britain and Ireland in 2004 and the club 's premiere performance at Carnegie Hall with the Smith College Glee Club in 2005 . 
 From 2005 to 2011 , the Club was under the direction of Paul Rardin . Notable achievements during this time include international tours to Spain in 2008 and Cuba in 2011 . The Cuban tour was considered especially significant , given that Americans have not easily been able to travel to the country legally , but the University gave financial assistance and an offer of a cultural exchange to make the tour happen . In 2010 , the club celebrated its 150th anniversary , and as part of the celebrations performed a set of joint concerts with the Harvard University and University of Virginia Glee Clubs , taking a variety of music including contemporary American songs , folk and Renaissance music . Rardin said " It 's a wonderful opportunity for all of us to see , hear and learn from three different ensembles . " 
 Rardin left the University of Michigan after the Cuban tour to accept the position of Director of Choirs at Temple University in 2011 . As of the fall term of 2011 , Eugene Rogers now directs the Club . Notable achievements during his tenure include an international tour to China in 2012 , a major tour of the East Coast of the United States which concluded in a joint concert with the Glee Clubs of Harvard and Yale Universities , and the nationwide extension of the Club 's Brothers in Song program which partners with underserved young men 's choral programs in public schools . 
 The club continues to collaborate with others . Tom Harle , MD of the Naperville Glee Club said " There 's a lot to be said about them . They 're one of the most prestigious and one of the oldest men 's glee clubs in the country . "

 = History of Arsenal F.C. ( 1886 – 1966 ) = 
 The history of Arsenal Football Club between 1886 and 1966 covers the time from the club 's foundation , through the first two major periods of success ( the 1930s , and the late 1940s and early 1950s , respectively ) and the club 's subsequent decline to mid @-@ table status in the 1960s . 
 Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers ' team from Woolwich , then in Kent , now southeast London . They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later . They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were close to bankruptcy by 1910 . They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club 's financial standing , he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium , Highbury , north London in 1913 . After the First World War he arranged for the club 's promotion back to the First Division , in controversial circumstances . 
 It was not until the appointment of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success ; Chapman modernised and reformed the club 's practices and tactics , and under him and his successor George Allison ( who took over after Chapman 's death in January 1934 ) , Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s . After the Second World War , Tom Whittaker continued the success , leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup . After Whittaker 's death Arsenal 's fortunes gradually declined ; by 1966 , they were in mid @-@ table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years . This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966 , and with it the appointment of Bertie Mee , who would go on to turn around the club 's fortunes . 
 = = Early years ( 1886 – 1910 ) = = 
 Arsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at the Royal Arsenal , an armaments factory in Woolwich , Kent ( formally part of the new County of London from 1889 ) . They were led by a Scotsman , David Danskin , who purchased the club 's first football , and Jack Humble . Among their number was the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Fred Beardsley , who would later along with Morris Bates obtain a set of red kits from his old club , thus giving Arsenal the colours they still wear today . 
 Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers on an open field on the Isle of Dogs , which they won 6 – 0 . The club were renamed Royal Arsenal soon after , reportedly on Christmas Day . Initially the club played on Plumstead Common , but soon sought alternative homes , firstly the Sportsman Ground in Plumstead before moving to the adjacent Manor Ground in 1888 . Unhappy with the Manor Ground 's poor facilities , the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890 , before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground 's rent proved too expensive . 
 During this period , Royal Arsenal started to win local trophies , winning both the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889 – 90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890 – 91 ; they also entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1889 – 90 . However , the gulf between Arsenal and the professional sides from the North soon became apparent , and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer ; after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891 , they attempted to sign two of Arsenal 's amateur players on professional contracts . Royal Arsenal 's move to professionalism in 1891 was frowned upon by many of the amateur southern clubs , and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association . With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal , they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League , but the move failed . The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground . Woolwich Arsenal 's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893 . Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League , initially joining the Second Division ; in response , some of the club 's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers ' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal , broke away to form a short @-@ lived alternative side , Royal Ordnance Factories . 
 Woolwich Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons , and generally occupied mid @-@ table before the appointment of Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1899 ; Bradshaw and his star signings , including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft ( Arsenal 's first England international ) and captain Jimmy Jackson , won promotion to the First Division in 1903 – 04 . However , Bradshaw moved on to Fulham in May 1904 , before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight . Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup – the club reached the semi @-@ finals in 1905 – 06 and 1906 – 07 – Arsenal were never able to challenge for the League title , only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913 . 
 The cause of this decline was the club 's ongoing financial problems ; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century , the club 's geographic isolation , in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead ( then on the outskirts of urban London ) , meant attendances and thus income were low . To stay afloat , Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players ( including Ashcroft , as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman ) , and slowly started to slip down the table , which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell . By the end of the decade the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11 @,@ 000 , a little over half of what it had been in 1904 . The club were close to bankruptcy , and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen ; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris , who was also the chairman of Fulham . 
 = = Move to Highbury and the Promotion Controversy ( 1910 – 25 ) = = 
 Norris was acutely aware of the problems associated with Woolwich Arsenal 's location , and was desperate to improve the club 's income . First , Norris tried to merge Woolwich Arsenal with his other club , Fulham . When that was blocked by the Football League , Norris abandoned the merger and looked to move the club elsewhere , eventually picking a site in Highbury , north London . Despite objections both from Woolwich @-@ based fans and residents of Highbury , Norris tenaciously saw the move through . He reportedly spent £ 125 @,@ 000 ( Historic Opportunity cost of that project is £ 12 @,@ 530 @,@ 000 , Labour cost of that project is £ 42 @,@ 450 @,@ 000 , Economic cost of that project is £ 88 @,@ 070 @,@ 000 ) on building the new stadium , designed by Archibald Leitch , on a divinity college 's playing fields . Woolwich Arsenal moved there in the 1913 close season , having finished bottom and relegated to the Second Division in 1912 – 13 . They replaced the " Woolwich " in their name with " The " in April 1914 , finally becoming plain " Arsenal " in November 1919 , although the press at the time continued to refer to them as " The Arsenal " and some still do . The move to Highbury brought about much larger crowds ; the average attendance in Arsenal 's first season at the new ground was 23 @,@ 000 ( compared to 11 @,@ 000 at the Manor Ground ) and rose further after promotion in 1919 , finally warding off the spectre of financial ruin . 
 The club controversially rejoined the First Division in 1919 , despite only finishing sixth in 1914 – 15 , the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened — although an error in the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth , an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975 . The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22 , and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League . On past precedent the two places would be given to the two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated , namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur . Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place . The candidates included 20th @-@ placed Tottenham Hotspur and , from the second division , Barnsley ( who had finished third ) ; Wolves , ( fourth ) ; Birmingham ( fifth later amended to sixth ) ; Hull City ( seventh ) ; and Nottingham Forest ( eighteenth ) . 
 The League voted to promote sixth @-@ placed Arsenal , for reasons of history over merit ; Norris argued that Arsenal be promoted for their " long service to league football " , having been the first League club from the South . The League board agreed ; Arsenal received 18 votes , Tottenham 8 . Barnsley 5 , Wolves 4 with a further 6 votes shared between the other clubs . 
 According to Soar and Tyler , the announcement of the vote seemed to catch all the clubs , except Arsenal , unawares and the affair is a major contributing factor to the rivalry which has fuelled the long @-@ standing enmity between the two North London clubs . There is also an inconsistency in the argument - if " long service to league football " was the criterion for promoting Arsenal instead of Tottenham then Wolves , who finished two points ahead of Arsenal and were founder members of the Football League , would appear to have a stronger claim . It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals or even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris , colluding with his friend John McKenna , the chairman of Liverpool and the Football League , who recommended Arsenal 's promotion at the AGM . 
 No conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light , though other aspects of Norris 's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter ; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929 , having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities ; he was found to have misused his expenses account , and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus . Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919 , Arsenal have remained in the top division since then , and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top @-@ flight football . 
 There appear to be no extant records of the meetings which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919 , however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year . The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war ( 1914 – 15 ) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted . He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United ( who had been found guilty of match fixing ) be punished by relegation or expulsion , and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done . To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division . 
 The club 's return to the First Division was not immediately successful . Under Leslie Knighton , the club never finished better than ninth , and in 1923 – 24 came close to returning to the Second Division , finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone . Arsenal did no better the following season , finishing 20th ( although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time , being seven points clear of the relegation places ) , which was the last straw for Norris ; he fired Knighton in May 1925 , and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager , Herbert Chapman in his place . 
 = = The Chapman era ( 1925 – 34 ) = = 
 Chapman reformed many of the club 's practices , including modernising the training and physiotherapy regimes , adding numbers to the players ' shirts in August 1928 , and changing the team 's colours , adding white sleeves to the red shirt in March 1933 . Chapman also insisted on journalists dropping the definite article from the club 's name , becoming just " Arsenal " , and he successfully campaigned for the renaming of the local Tube station , Gillespie Road , to Arsenal . At the same time , Chapman had a large transfer budget by virtue of Arsenal 's improved revenue from their new stadium and a change of heart from Henry Norris ; previously a highly prudent chairman , Norris now dictated that there was to be heavy spending on new players . This led to Arsenal becoming known as the Bank of England club . 
 Chapman 's first signing was veteran Charlie Buchan from Sunderland ; as well as his contributions on the pitch , Buchan would play an important part off it . After Arsenal were beaten 7 – 0 by Newcastle United in October 1925 , Buchan suggested a change to the formation to adapt to a relaxation of the offside law , adjusting Arsenal 's formation to the " WM " , strengthening the defence by pushing the centre half back into defence and the full @-@ backs out to the wings . Over time , Chapman developed the formation further , putting an emphasis on a pacey forward line , wingers cutting inside , and the role of a creative ball @-@ playing midfielder . 
 Arsenal came second in Chapman 's first season , their best finish at that time , but this proved to be a false dawn ; for the next few seasons they stayed in mid @-@ table as Chapman took his time to assemble his side , slotting new signings such as winger Joe Hulme , forward Jack Lambert and defenders Tom Parker and Herbie Roberts into his new formation . In 1926 – 27 , Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final , only to lose 1 – 0 to Cardiff City , after Arsenal 's goalkeeper Dan Lewis let a harmless @-@ looking shot slip through his arms and into the net ; it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England . 
 Chapman was not deterred , and continued to build his side , signing future captain Eddie Hapgood , as well as three of the club 's great attacking players , David Jack , Alex James and Cliff Bastin ; it was especially Alex James , Arsenal 's playmaker in midfield , supplying the forward line and wingers , who became celebrated as the engine of the team . Three years after their first Cup final , in 1929 – 30 , Arsenal reached Wembley again , this time up against Chapman 's old club Huddersfield Town . The match was notable for being " buzzed " by the enormous German airship Graf Zeppelin . Arsenal were not distracted from their task ; they won 2 – 0 with goals from James and Lambert to bring home the club 's first major trophy . 
 On 30 August 1930 , Arsenal helped create a new attendance record of 28 @,@ 723 at Blackpool 's Bloomfield Road ground . They helped set it again over the next two seasons with crowds of 29 @,@ 576 and 30 @,@ 218 . 
 Their FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England . They won the First Division for the first time in 1930 – 31 ; Arsenal performed strongly in a free @-@ scoring title race with Aston Villa , recording several heavy wins ( including 7 – 1 against Blackpool , 7 – 2 v Leicester City , and 9 – 1 v Grimsby Town , which remains a club record for the top flight ) . Arsenal won the title with two games to spare , and finished the season having scored 127 league goals ( another club record ) , though Aston Villa managed to score 128 , which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season . 
 The following season , 1931 – 32 , Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again , losing controversially to Newcastle United . Arsenal had led 1 – 0 with a Bob John goal , but Newcastle 's equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line , and out for a goal kick ; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies ; Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 2 – 1 . Arsenal 's pain was compounded by the fact that Everton had pipped them to the League title ; a poor start to the 1931 – 32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch @-@ up for most of the season , finishing two points adrift . 
 Arsenal bounced back the following season , winning their second League title . Arsenal had started the season weakly , but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa , whom they beat 5 – 0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title . By this time Chapman 's first set of signings had started to show their age so with an eye to the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker , and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack . The only blot on the club 's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup ; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves , but despite six first @-@ team players Arsenal lost 2 – 0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time . One of the stand @-@ ins , Tommy Black , was particularly to blame ( conceding a penalty for Walsall 's second ) , and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result ; another , striker Charlie Walsh , was transferred to Brentford a week later . 
 = = A hat @-@ trick of League titles ( 1934 – 39 ) = = 
 Arsenal had started the 1933 – 34 season solidly , but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died suddenly from pneumonia . Despite this , under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season ; Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion , and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season , scoring only 75 in the League , compared with 118 in 1932 – 33 . 
 George Allison ( who had formerly been a director of the club ) took over the job of team manager in summer 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side , including wing halves Jack Crayston and Wilf Copping ( whose signings had been initiated by Chapman ) , and striker Ted Drake . With these new signings , Allison oversaw the completion of a hat @-@ trick of League titles in 1934 – 35 , and Arsenal were back to their attacking best ; Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily one @-@ sided scorelines reminiscent of the 1930 – 31 season ( including 7 – 0 v. Wolves , 8 – 1 v. Liverpool , and 8 – 0 twice , v. Leicester City and v. Middlesbrough ) . Such was Arsenal 's strength that in November 1934 , seven players that started for the England side that beat World Champions Italy 3 – 2 ( in the so @-@ called " Battle of Highbury " ) were on Arsenal 's books , a record number of players from a single club , which still stands today . 
 Arsenal 's ongoing success attracted larger and larger crowds . Arsenal 's home , Highbury , was completely redeveloped , with Leitch 's stands from 1913 demolished and replaced with modern Art Deco stands , parts of which remain to this day — the façade of the East Stand is now a Grade II listed building , and both façades have been retained as part of the modern @-@ day redevelopment of Highbury into an apartment complex . Meanwhile , the North Bank and Clock End terraces had roofs installed . The new stadium saw its largest attendance , 73 @,@ 295 , on 9 March 1935 for a match against Sunderland . 
 Arsenal 's dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935 – 36 , winning 1 – 0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake . Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934 – 35 title , and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club 's inability to replace him , as well as long @-@ term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme . Nevertheless , they won a fifth League title in 1937 – 38 , <unk> Wolves on the final day of the season , to cap off a highly successful decade . 
 = = The Second World War ( 1939 – 45 ) = = 
 Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , all first @-@ class football in Britain was suspended , and the 1939 – 40 Football League season annulled . Highbury was requisitioned as an ARP station , with a barrage balloon operating behind the Clock End . During the Blitz , a bomb fell on the North Bank , destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace . With Highbury closed , Arsenal instead played their home matches at White Hart Lane , home of their rivals Tottenham Hotspur . Wartime matches do not count in official statistics ; competitions were played on a regional basis and teams often did not complete a full season ; many footballers served in the armed forces as trainers or instructors and were away from their clubs for long periods of time , so they would often star as " guests " at other clubs . Arsenal won the Football League War Cup South in 1942 – 43 and the London or Southern league titles in 1939 – 40 , 1941 – 42 and 1942 – 43 . Participation in the London League led to their expulsion from The Football League in 1941 along with 14 other clubs ; it was not until April 1942 when they were readmitted after expressing regret and paying a £ 10 fine . 
 In November 1945 , with league competition still suspended , Arsenal were one of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK . With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces , Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players , including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen , which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI , although three of the side were actually Welsh . In any case , Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from <unk> Moscow . The match , at White Hart Lane , kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 4 – 3 , after Arsenal had led 3 – 1 at half @-@ time . 
 Though the score is generally agreed upon , after that accounts of the match diverge ; even the identity of the goalscorers is disputed . English reports alleged Dynamo fielded twelve players at one point , and tried to pressurise the referee into abandoning the match when they had been behind ; in turn , the Soviets accused Arsenal of persistent foul play and even alleged George Allison had bet money on the result ( a claim that was later retracted ) . The acrimony after the match was such that it inspired George Orwell to write his 1945 essay The Sporting Spirit , in which he famously opined on the nature of sport , namely that in his view " it is war minus the shooting " . With the fog obscuring much of the action , not to mention the language barriers and the early @-@ Cold War mutual suspicion between both sides , it is unlikely any reliable account of the match will emerge . 
 = = The post @-@ war years ( 1945 – 66 ) = = 
 The war had claimed the lives of nine Arsenal first team players , the most of any top flight club , and the intervening time had cut short the careers of several others , including Bastin and Drake . Additionally , the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden , and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946 . They lost 6 – 1 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 1945 – 46 FA Cup , and upon the league 's resumption in 1946 – 47 the club finished 13th , their worst in 17 years . George Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season , and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker , a long @-@ time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman . 
 Whittaker enjoyed immediate success , winning the League title in 1947 – 48 ; led by captain Joe Mercer 's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke , Arsenal were top of the table from October until the season 's climax , winning by a seven @-@ point margin . However , given the age of the Arsenal side at the time ( Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty , as were Denis and Leslie Compton ) , long @-@ term success was not possible . In response , Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman , Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton . Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title , with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949 – 50 , with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2 – 0 win over Liverpool . 
 The 1951 – 52 season saw the club nearly win the Double , but ultimately end up empty @-@ handed ; a series of injuries and a fixture pile @-@ up at the end of the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches , including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season ; after losing 6 – 1 , the Gunners finished third , equal on points with Tottenham . A week later , Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final , with several recovering players rushed back into the first team ; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes ( no substitutes were allowed then ) , and ten @-@ man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton , Roper and Daniel , so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch ; with the numerical advantage in their favour , Newcastle won 1 – 0 with a goal from George Robledo . 
 Despite the disappointment of the previous season , Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952 – 53 ; in one of the closest title races , they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points . The title looked to be Preston 's after Arsenal lost to them 2 – 0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season , but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3 – 2 , to take the title on 0 @.@ 099 of a goal . That proved to be Arsenal 's last trophy for seventeen years , as Arsenal 's fortunes began to wane , particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956 . 
 As the club 's fortunes declined , they found themselves unable to attract many stars ( Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception ) , while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs . Jack Crayston and George <unk> , both former players , followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success . Apart from finishing third in 1958 – 59 and fifth in both 1955 – 56 and 1956 – 57 , Arsenal usually finished in mid @-@ table . Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951 – 52 , Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter @-@ finals again until 1970 – 71 . To make matters worse for the club , Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960 – 61 . 
 In 1962 , Arsenal made the bold but ultimately unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager , despite his lack of managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club . Like his two immediate predecessors , Wright was not very successful , although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition , in the 1963 – 64 Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962 – 63 . In his final season , Arsenal finished 14th , their lowest position in 36 years , and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury — 4 @,@ 554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966 . The only Arsenal player to figure in England 's 1966 FIFA World Cup @-@ winning squad was George Eastham , who did not play at all during the tournament . Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966 , and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee . Though the club 's directors did not know it at the time , Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years .

 The Potter @-@ Collyer house is a timber frame house that was originally constructed on the west side of Pine Street , but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling . The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half story gabled roof cottage with a cross @-@ gable in the center , a style popular during the mid @-@ century in Pawtucket . This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards . A two @-@ story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases , one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902 . Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time . The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides . The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition . 
 The house has an unconventional floor plan which has two doorways on opposite ends of the original cottage with the main entrance formerly on the east side . The NRHP nomination again notes that the doorways may have replaced an earlier vestibule on the original house . The eastern entrance leads to a library / office , that may have originally been a stairhall , and is connected to the eastern of the two front rooms . The western doorway , opposite , leads to a hallway with a three @-@ run staircase with <unk> and balusters . The western room has a Renaissance Revival @-@ style built @-@ in bookcase and a slate fireplace mantel . The rear addition holds the dining room which has a " pseudo @-@ exposed @-@ beam ceiling " dated to around 1909 . Though not detailed in the NRHP listing , the survey notes that the upstairs is simple in detail and appears intact , but that the " chamber floor plan in the front of the house appears to have been altered during the 1880s remodeling " .

 The Potter @-@ Collyer House is architecturally significant as a unique example of vernacular architecture of Pawtucket in the 19th century . The NRHP nomination states that the alterations and remodeling of the home have produced a " most unusually composed and picturesquely detailed [ building ] . " Despite having been moved and altered , the house is unique and significant example of vernacular architecture . The Potter @-@ Collyer House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 . 
 = Potassium = 
 Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K ( derived from Neo @-@ Latin , kalium ) and atomic number 19 . It was first isolated from potash , the ashes of plants , from which its name derives . In the Periodic table , potassium is one of seven elements in column ( group ) 1 ( alkali metals ) . All elements in Group 1 have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell , which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge - a cation , which combines with anions to form salts . Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts . Elemental potassium is a soft silvery @-@ white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water , generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac @-@ colored flame . It is found dissolved in sea water ( which is 0 @.@ 04 % potassium by weight ) , and is part of many minerals . 
 Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes , of which 40K is radioactive . Traces of 40K are found in all potassium , and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body . 
 Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium , the previous element in Group 1 of the periodic table . They have a similar ionization energy , which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron . That they are different elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts was suspected in 1702 , and was proven in 1807 using electrolysis . 
 Most industrial applications of potassium exploit the high solubility in water of potassium compounds , such as potassium soaps . Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium , and this depletion is prevented and remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium , accounting for 95 % of global potassium chemical production . 
 Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells . The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission ; potassium depletion in excess can result in numerous abnormalities , including an abnormal heart rhythm and various <unk> ( ECG ) abnormalities . Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium . The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium , which raises serum potassium levels , with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells and an increase in potassium excretion by the kidney . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Physical = = = 
 Potassium is the second least dense metal after lithium . It is a soft solid with a low melting point , and can be easily cut with a knife . Freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance , but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air . In a flame test , potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766 @.@ 5 nanometers 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 Neutral potassium atoms have 19 electrons , one more than the extremely stable configuration of the noble gas argon . Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 418 @.@ 8 kJ / mol , the potassium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge ( though negatively charged alkalide K − ions are not impossible . ) This process requires so little energy that potassium is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen . In contrast , the second ionization energy is very high ( <unk> kJ / mol ) , because removal of two electrons breaks the stable noble gas electronic configuration ( the configuration of the inert argon ) . Potassium therefore does not readily form compounds with the oxidation state of + 2 or higher . 
 Potassium is an extremely active metal that reacts violently with oxygen and water in air . With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide , and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide . The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character and the production of hydrogen gas . Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen , producing water , which reacts with the remaining potassium . This reaction requires only traces of water ; because of this , potassium and the liquid sodium @-@ potassium — <unk> — are potent desiccants that can be used to dry solvents prior to distillation . 
 Because of the sensitivity of potassium to water and air , reactions with other elements are possible only in an inert atmosphere such as argon gas using air @-@ free techniques . Potassium does not react with most hydrocarbons such as mineral oil or kerosene . It readily dissolves in liquid ammonia , up to 480 g per 1000 g of ammonia at 0 ° C. Depending on the concentration , the ammonia solutions are blue to yellow , and their electrical conductivity is similar to that of liquid metals . In a pure solution , potassium slowly reacts with ammonia to form <unk> 
 2 , but this reaction is accelerated by minute amounts of transition metal salts . Because it can reduce the salts to the metal , potassium is often used as the reductant in the preparation of finely divided metals from their salts by the <unk> method . For example , the preparation of magnesium by this method employs potassium as the reductant : 
 <unk> 
 2 + 2 K → Mg + 2 KCl 
 = = = = Compounds = = = = 
 The only common oxidation state for potassium is + 1 . Potassium metal is a powerful reducing agent that is easily oxidized to the <unk> cation , K + . Once oxidized , it is very stable and difficult to reduce back to the metal . 
 Potassium hydroxide reacts readily with carbon dioxide to produce potassium carbonate , and is used to remove traces of the gas from air . In general , potassium compounds have excellent water solubility , owing to the high hydration energy of the K + ion . The potassium ion is colorless in water and is very difficult to precipitate ; possible precipitation methods include reactions with sodium tetraphenylborate , hexachloroplatinic acid , and sodium cobaltinitrite . 
 Potassium oxidizes faster than most metals and forms oxides with oxygen @-@ oxygen bonds , as do all alkali metals except lithium . Three species are formed during the reaction : potassium oxide , potassium peroxide , and potassium superoxide formed of three different oxygen @-@ based ions : oxide ( O2 − ) , peroxide ( O2 − 
 2 ) , and superoxide ( O − 
 2 ) . The last two species , especially the superoxide , are rare and are formed only in reaction with very electropositive metals ; these species contain oxygen @-@ oxygen bonds . All potassium @-@ oxygen binary compounds are known to react with water violently , forming potassium hydroxide . This compound is a very strong alkali , and 1 @.@ 21 kg of it can dissolve in as little as a liter of water . 
 Potassium compounds are typically highly ionic and thus most of them are soluble in water . The main species in water solution are the <unk> complexes [ K ( H 
 2O ) 
 n ] + where n = 6 and 7 . Some of the few poorly soluble potassium salts include potassium tetraphenylborate , potassium hexachloroplatinate , and potassium cobaltinitrite . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 There are 24 known isotopes of potassium , three of which occur naturally : <unk> ( 93 @.@ 3 % ) , 40K ( 0 @.@ <unk> % ) , and <unk> ( 6 @.@ 7 % ) . Naturally occurring 40K has a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 250 × 109 years . It decays to stable 40Ar by electron capture or positron emission ( 11 @.@ 2 % ) or to stable 40Ca by beta decay ( 88 @.@ 8 % ) . The decay of 40K to 40Ar is the basis of a common method for dating rocks . The conventional K @-@ Ar dating method depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon ( 40Ar ) was quantitatively retained . Minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic 40Ar that has accumulated . The minerals best suited for dating include biotite , muscovite , metamorphic hornblende , and volcanic feldspar ; whole rock samples from volcanic flows and shallow <unk> can also be dated if they are unaltered . Apart from dating , potassium isotopes have been used as tracers in studies of weathering and for nutrient cycling studies because potassium is a macronutrient required for life . 
 40K occurs in natural potassium ( and thus in some commercial salt substitutes ) in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations . 40K is the radioisotope with the largest abundance in the body . In healthy animals and people , 40K represents the largest source of radioactivity , greater even than 14C . In a human body of 70 kg mass , about 4 @,@ 400 nuclei of 40K decay per second . The activity of natural potassium is 31 Bq / g . 
 = = Cosmic formation and distribution = = 
 Potassium is formed in supernovas by nucleosynthesis from lighter atoms . Potassium is principally created in Type II supernovas via the explosive oxygen @-@ burning process . 40K is also formed in s @-@ process nucleosynthesis and the neon burning process . 
 Potassium makes up about 2 @.@ 6 % of the weight of the earth 's crust and is the seventh most abundant element in the crust . It is the 17th most abundant element by weight in the earth , and 20th most abundant element in the solar system . The potassium concentration in seawater is 0 @.@ 39 g / L ( 0 @.@ 039 wt / v % ) , about one @-@ quarter the concentration of sodium . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Neither elemental potassium nor potassium salts ( as separate entities from other salts ) were known in Roman times , and the Latin name of the element , kalium , is not Classical Latin but rather neo @-@ Latin . <unk> was taken from the word alkali , which in turn came from Arabic : <unk> al @-@ <unk> " plant ashes . " The similar @-@ sounding English term alkali is from this same root , whereas the word for potassium in Modern Standard Arabic is <unk> <unk> . 
 In 1797 , the German chemist Martin Klaproth discovered " potash " in the minerals leucite and lepidolite , and realized that " potash " was not a product of plant growth but was actually a new element , which he proposed to call kali . In 1809 , the German physicist and chemist Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert proposed the names <unk> for Humphry Davy 's " potassium " and <unk> for Davy 's " sodium " . In 1814 , the Swedish chemist Berzelius advocated the name kalium for potassium , with the chemical symbol K. 
 The English name for the element potassium comes from the word " potash " , and refers to the method of producing potassium : placing in a pot the ash of burnt wood or tree leaves , adding water , heating , and evaporating the solution . 
 = = Potash = = 
 Potash is primarily a mixture of potassium salts because plants have little or no sodium content , and the rest of a plant 's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water . While potash has been used since ancient times , it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts . Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702 , and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736 . The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds , and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium , was not known then , and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789 . For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass , bleach , soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate . Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water @-@ soluble and of softer texture , and are therefore known as soft soaps . The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts . Wood @-@ ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer , but , with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt , Germany , the production of potassium @-@ containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale . Other potash deposits were discovered , and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer . 
 = = The metal = = 
 Potassium metal was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy , who derived it from caustic potash ( KOH , potassium hydroxide ) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile . Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis . Later in the same year , Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative ( caustic soda , NaOH , or lye ) rather than a plant salt , by a similar technique , demonstrating that the elements , and thus the salts , are different . Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements , it took some time before this view was universally accepted . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Elemental potassium does not occur in nature because of its high reactivity . It reacts violently with water ( see section Precautions below ) and also reacts with oxygen . <unk> ( potassium feldspar ) is a common rock @-@ forming mineral . Granite for example contains 5 % potassium , which is well above the average in the Earth 's crust . <unk> ( KCl ) , carnallite ( KCl · <unk>

 4 ) are the minerals found in large evaporite deposits worldwide . The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble at the bottom and the most soluble on top . Deposits of <unk> ( potassium nitrate ) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere , mostly in caves ; because of the good water solubility of <unk> the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions . 
 = = Commercial production = = 
 Potassium salts such as carnallite , langbeinite , <unk> , and sylvite form extensive deposits in ancient lake bottoms and seabeds , making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable . The principal source of potassium – potash – is mined in Canada , Russia , Belarus , Germany , Israel , United States , Jordan , and other places around the world . The first mined deposits were located near Staßfurt , Germany , but the deposits span from Great Britain over Germany into Poland . They are located in the <unk> and were deposited in the Middle to Late Permian . The largest deposits ever found lie 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 feet ) below the surface of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan . The deposits are located in the Elk Point Group produced in the Middle Devonian . Saskatchewan , where several large mines have operated since the 1960s pioneered the technique of freezing of wet sands ( the Blairmore formation ) to drive mine shafts through them . The main potash mining company in Saskatchewan is the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan . The water of the Dead Sea is used by Israel and Jordan as a source of potash , while the concentration in normal oceans is too low for commercial production at current prices . 
 Several methods are used to separate potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds . The most @-@ used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures . Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines . The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps . Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing . The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash , <unk> of potash , or simply MOP . 
 Pure potassium metal can be isolated by electrolysis of its hydroxide in a process that has changed little since Davy . Although the electrolysis process was developed and used in industrial scale in the 1920s , the thermal method by reacting sodium with potassium chloride in a chemical equilibrium reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s . 
 The production of sodium potassium alloys is accomplished by changing the reaction time and the amount of sodium used in the reaction . The <unk> process employing the reaction of potassium fluoride with calcium carbide was also used to produce potassium . 
 Na + KCl → NaCl + K ( Thermal method )

 <unk> @-@ grade potassium metal costs about $ 10 @.@ 00 / pound ( $ 22 / kg ) in 2010 when purchased by the tonne . Lower purity metal is considerably cheaper . The market is volatile because long @-@ term storage of the metal is difficult . It must be stored in a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of potassium superoxide , a pressure @-@ sensitive explosive that detonates when scratched . The resulting explosion often starts a fire difficult to extinguish . 
 = = Biological role = = 
 Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass ( 0 @.@ 2 % ) in the human body , so that a 60 kg adult contains a total of about 120 g of potassium . The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine , and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant . Potassium ions are present in a wide variety of proteins and enzymes .

 Potassium levels influence multiple physiological processes , including

 Potassium homeostasis denotes the maintenance of the total body potassium content , plasma potassium level , and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits , in the face of pulsatile intake ( meals ) , obligatory renal excretion , and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments . 
 = = = = Plasma levels = = = = 
 Plasma potassium is normally kept at 3 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 0 <unk> ( mmol ) [ or <unk> ( mEq ) ] per liter by multiple mechanisms . Levels outside this range are associated with an increasing rate of death from multiple causes , and some cardiac , kidney , and lung diseases progress more rapidly if serum potassium levels are not maintained within the normal range . 
 An average meal of 40 @-@ 50 mmol presents the body with more potassium than is present in all plasma ( 20 @-@ 25 mmol ) . However , this surge causes the plasma potassium to rise only 10 % at most as a result of prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra @-@ renal mechanisms . 
 Hypokalemia , a deficiency of potassium in the plasma , can be fatal if severe . Common causes are increased <unk> loss ( vomiting , diarrhea ) , and increased renal loss ( diuresis ) . Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness , paralytic <unk> , ECG abnormalities , decreased reflex response ; and in severe cases , respiratory paralysis , alkalosis , and cardiac arrhythmia . 
 = = = = Control mechanisms = = = = 
 Potassium content in the plasma is tightly controlled by four basic mechanisms , which have various names and classifications . The four are 1 ) a reactive negative @-@ feedback system , 2 ) a reactive feed @-@ forward system , 3 ) a predictive or circadian system , and 4 ) an internal or cell membrane transport system . Collectively , the first three are sometimes termed the " external potassium homeostasis system " ; and the first two , the " reactive potassium homeostasis system " . 
 The reactive negative @-@ feedback system refers to the system that induces renal secretion of potassium in response to a rise in the plasma potassium ( potassium ingestion , shift out of cells , or intravenous infusion . ) 
 The reactive feed @-@ forward system refers to an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium . This is probably initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger <unk> afferent signals to the pituitary gland . 
 The predictive or circadian system increases renal secretion of potassium during mealtime hours ( e.g. daytime for humans , nighttime for rodents ) independent of the presence , amount , or absence of potassium ingestion . It is mediated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain ( central clock ) , which causes the kidney ( peripheral clock ) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion . 
 The ion transport system moves potassium across the cell membrane using two mechanisms . One is active and pumps sodium out of , and potassium into , the cell . The other is passive and allows potassium to leak out of the cell . Potassium and sodium cations influence fluid distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments by osmotic forces . The movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the Na + / K + -ATPase pump . This ion pump uses ATP to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell , creating an electrochemical gradient and electromotive force across the cell membrane . The highly selective potassium ion channels ( which are tetramers ) are crucial for hyperpolarization inside neurons after an action potential is triggered , to cite one example . The most recently discovered potassium ion channel is <unk> , which makes a total of five potassium ion channels ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) with a determined structure . All five are from prokaryotic species . 
 = = = = Renal filtration , reabsorption , and excretion = = = = 
 Renal handling of potassium is closely connected to sodium handling . Potassium is the major cation ( positive ion ) inside animal cells [ 150 mmol / L , ( 4 @.@ 8 g ) ] , while sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid [ 150 mmol / L , ( 3 @.@ 345 g ) ] . In the kidneys , about 180 liters of plasma is filtered through the glomeruli and into the renal tubules per day . This filtering involves about about 600 g of sodium and 33 g of potassium . Since only 1 – 10 g of sodium and 1 – 4 g of potassium are likely to be replaced by diet , renal filtering must efficiently reabsorb the remainder from the plasma . 
 Sodium is reabsorbed to maintain extracellular volume , osmotic pressure , and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits ; potassium is reabsorbed to maintain serum potassium concentration within narrow limits . Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium . Potassium must be conserved also , but , because the amount of potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large , the situation is not so critical for potassium . Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium in response to an apparent ( but not actual ) Donnan equilibrium , the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water at the end of the processing . Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules . At that point , urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma . At the end of the processing , potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high . 
 With no potassium intake , it is excreted at about 200 mg per day until , in about a week , potassium in the serum declines to a mildly deficient level of 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 5 mmol / L. If potassium is still withheld , the concentration continues to fall until a severe deficiency causes eventual death . 
 The potassium moves passively through pores in the cell membrane . When ions move through pumps there is a gate in the pumps on either side of the cell membrane and only one gate can be open at once . As a result , approximately 100 ions are forced through per second . Pores have only one gate , and there only one kind of ion can stream through , at 10 million to 100 million ions per second . The pores require calcium to open although it is thought that the calcium works in reverse by blocking at least one of the pores . <unk> groups inside the pore on the amino acids mimic the water hydration that takes place in water solution by the nature of the electrostatic charges on four carbonyl groups inside the pore .

 = = = = Detection by taste buds = = = = 
 Potassium can be detected by taste because it triggers three of the five types of taste sensations , according to concentration . Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet , allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices , while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter / alkaline , and finally also salty to the taste . The combined bitterness and saltiness of high @-@ potassium solutions makes high @-@ dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge .

 Adequate potassium intake is achieved by eating a variety of foods . Potassium is present in all fruits , vegetables , meat and fish .

Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food . Many processed foods contain no potassium .

 Epidemiological studies indicate that diets high in potassium can reduce the risk of hypertension and possibly stroke ( by a mechanism independent of blood pressure ) . The 2004 guidelines of the Institute of Medicine specify a Dietary Reference Intake ( DRI ] ) of 4 @,@ 700 mg of potassium ( 100 mEq ) ; most Americans consume only half that amount per day . Likewise , in the European Union , in particular in Germany and Italy , insufficient potassium intake is somewhat common . A meta @-@ analysis concluded that a 1640 mg increase in the daily intake of potassium was associated with a 21 % lower risk of stroke . 
 = = = = Deficient intake = = = = 
 Diets low in potassium can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia . 
 = = = = Supplementation = = = = 
 Supplements of potassium are most widely used in conjunction with diuretics that block reabsorption of sodium and water upstream from the distal tubule ( thiazides and loop diuretics ) , because this promotes increased distal tubular potassium secretion , with resultant increased potassium excretion . A variety of prescription and over @-@ the counter supplements are available . Potassium chloride may be dissolved in water , but the salty / bitter taste make liquid supplements unpalatable . Typical doses range from 10 mmol ( 400 mg ) , to 20 mmol ( 800 mg ) . Potassium is also available in tablets or capsules , which are formulated to allow potassium to leach slowly out of a matrix , since very high concentrations of potassium ion that occur adjacent to a solid tablet can injure the gastric or intestinal mucosa . For this reason , non @-@ prescription potassium pills are limited by law in the US to a maximum of 99 mg of potassium . 
 Since the kidneys are the site of potassium excretion , individuals with impaired kidney function are at risk for hyperkalemia if dietary potassium and supplements are not restricted . The more severe the impairment , the more severe is the restriction necessary to avoid hyperkalemia .

 This reaction is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen in the presence of oxygen , possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide , which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns . Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature . The bulk metal ignites in air if heated . Because its density is 0 @.@ 89 g / cm3 , burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen . Many common fire extinguishing agents , including water , either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse . Nitrogen , argon , sodium chloride ( table salt ) , sodium carbonate ( soda ash ) , and silicon dioxide ( sand ) are effective if they are dry . Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective . These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal . 
 Potassium reacts violently with halogens and detonates in the presence of bromine . It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid . During combustion , potassium forms peroxides and superoxides . These peroxides may react violently with organic compounds such as oils . Both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium . 
 Because potassium reacts with water vapor in the air , it is usually stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene . Unlike lithium and sodium , however , potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months , unless in an inert ( oxygen free ) atmosphere , or under vacuum . After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock @-@ sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container , and can detonate upon opening . 
 Because of the highly reactive nature of potassium metal , it must be handled with great care , with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion @-@ resistant barrier between the user and the metal . Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system . Potassium chloride is used in the United States for lethal injection executions . 
 = Espantito = 
 Espantito ( Spanish for " Little Terror " or " Little Scare " ; born April 24 , 1968 ) is the ring name of a Mexican luchador enmascarado , or masked professional wrestler working in the Mini @-@ Estrella ( " Mini @-@ Star " ) division . Working in the Mini @-@ Estrella division does not automatically mean that <unk> has Dwarfism as several wrestlers who are just shorter in stature work in the " Mini " division . Espantito 's real name is not a matter of public record , as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans . 
 Espantito made his professional wrestling debut in 1993 and was allowed to use a version of the Espanto mask and name with permission of the only surviving Espanto , Espanto III . He has worked primarily on the Mexican independent circuit but has also worked for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) , one of Mexico 's largest professional wrestling promotions .

 The man only known as " Espantito " ( Spanish for " Little Terror " or " Little Scare " ) was born on April 25 , 1968 in Torreón , Coahuila , Mexico . Growing up in Torreón he became a wrestling fan at a young age , often watching local wrestlers Espanto II and Espanto III wrestle in his home town . In a 1999 interview he remarked that while his friends would cheer the técnicos ( the faces , those that portray the " good guys " ) while he personally always favored the <unk> ( those that portray the bad guys , also known as " Heels " ) . While he wanted to become a luchador , it was hard for him to find a trainer willing to train someone of his diminutive stature , standing only 151 cm ( 4 ft 11 in ) in his teens .

 While the wrestler known as Espantito is known as a Mini @-@ Estrella ( " Mini @-@ Star ) it does not indicate that Espantito has Dwarfism . Unlike Midget professional wrestling where all competitors are under the height of 147 cm ( 4 ft 10 in ) , Mini @-@ Estrellas are often wrestlers of shorter stature such as Espantito at 160 cm ( 5 ft 3 in ) , but not true Little People in a medical sense . 
 = = Professional wrestling career = = 
 Due to the secretive culture around masked wrestlers in Lucha libre Espantito 's real name is not a matter of common knowledge , nor has it been revealed if he worked under a different ring name before he made his in @-@ ring debut as Espantito . It has been confirmed that Espantito trained in his native Torreón , Coahuila under the tutelage of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz , better known as Espanto II and also received further training from Indio <unk> . In the early 1990s the Mini @-@ Estrella concept was introduced in Mexico , featuring not just Midget professional wrestling but also wrestlers who were short in stature . A lot of these new Mini @-@ Estrellas used the same ring character as regular sized wrestlers such as Octagoncito being a smaller version of Octagón . Due to his short stature , 160 cm ( 5 ft 3 in ) , the future Espantito became a natural fit in the Mini @-@ Estrellas division and was given permission by his trainer to start working as a smaller version of Los <unk> ( " The <unk> " ) and became known as El Espantito , wearing the signature black mask with a white cross on it popularized by Espanto I , Espanto II and Espanto III as well as the same black @-@ and @-@ white ring gear of the originals . As Espantito he was one of the first competitors in the newly created Asistencia Asesoría y Administración 's ( AAA ) Mini @-@ Estrella division . Most of AAA 's Mini @-@ Estrella division consisted of <unk> that had followed AAA founder Antonio Peña from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) , where some of the Mini @-@ Estrellas changed their name and mask due to the larger version of the character not jumping to AAA at the time . One example was Super <unk> , who was working as " <unk> Azteca " in CMLL , but had to change his name as Ángel Azteca did not <unk> CMLL . It has not been revealed if <unk> also worked in the CMLL Mini @-@ Estrella division at the time of the AAA <unk> . 
 For a short while Espantito was teamed up with a wrestler working as " Espantito II " , but Espantito II was only used for a few matches in 1993 . Despite working for AAA for several years he never made an appearance on one of their major shows , despite the Mini @-@ Estrella division being featured on several , even headlined some shows . In 1999 Espantito once again briefly teamed up with a wrestler working as " Espantito II " , although it is unclear if it was the same worker under the mask than six years prior . By the late 1990s Espantito left AAA and began working primarily on the Mexican Independent circuit , often touring with a troupe of Mini @-@ Estrellas such as Octagoncito , <unk> Morgan and <unk> . The group toured the U.S. , working for various National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) promotions as well as showcasing lucha libre and the Mini @-@ Estrella style throughout the south @-@ west . On September 20 , 2009 Espantito wrestled Octagoncito for the vacant NWA World Midget 's Championship on a Pro Wrestling Revolution ( PWR ) show , which saw Octagoncito win the match and the championship . The troupe of Mini @-@ Estrellas would continue to ue the NWA World Midget 's Championship as part of their shows , promoting matches where Octagoncito would defend the championship against Espantito . Later on when Pro Wrestling Revolution split from the NWA the championship was re @-@ branded the PWR World Midget 's Championship , with Octagoncito defending it on occasion against <unk> in various southern states of the United States .

 While several wrestlers have used the " Espanto " name of the years , El Hijo del Espanto I claims to currently have full rights to the use of the name " Espanto " in Lucha Libre , though his claim to the name does not seem all @-@ inclusive as CMLL has Espanto Jr. on their roster . It is unclear if Espantito legally owns the name , or if that was what prevented the " Espantito II " name from being used more than once or twice .

 Tracy William Thorne @-@ Begland ( born October 3 , 1966 ) is an American judge on the General District Court of Richmond , Virginia , appointed in 2012 . He was the first openly gay jurist elected by the Virginia General Assembly . 
 After graduation from university , Thorne @-@ Begland served in a jet combat squadron of the United States Navy . During the 1992 presidential campaign , he appeared on the television news program Nightline to criticize the Navy 's policy of excluding homosexuals , identified himself as gay , and was honorably discharged from the service . As a result of the appeal processes , Thorne @-@ Begland became interested in the law and obtained a law degree . 
 After serving twelve years as a prosecutor , Thorne @-@ Begland was nominated for an open seat on the General District Court of Richmond in 2012 , but the Virginia House of delegates rejected him for the position for his perceived advocacy on homosexual issues . The Richmond Circuit Court judges granted him a temporary appointment to the post on June 14 , 2012 . On January 15 , 2013 , he was confirmed in the position by both houses of the Virginia General Assembly . 
 = = Early life and military career = = 
 Tracy W. Thorne was born c . 1967 and grew up in a well @-@ off family in West Palm Beach , Florida . Following his graduation from Vanderbilt University , he entered the US Navy in 1988 , inspired by reading Stephen <unk> ' novel Flight of the Intruder about naval aviators in the Vietnam War . He was first in his flight training class , and served in Attack Squadron 65 , the " Fighting Tigers " , at Oceana Naval Air Station flying the A @-@ 6 Intruder . Initially denying his homosexuality , Thorne accepted it in 1990 when he visited a gay bar for the first time on New Year 's Eve . 
 In 1992 , Thorne came out to his <unk> , who he later stated were supportive : " It was a complete non @-@ issue " . In April he spoke with an aide of Colorado congresswoman Pat Schroeder , who encouraged him to go public with his story to build popular support for a bill to overturn the ban on gay service members . Thorne agreed to do so , and completed the process of coming out to family members , including his father and brother . On May 19 , 1992 , during a presidential campaign in which Democratic candidate Bill Clinton was proposing an end to the military 's exclusion of homosexuals , Thorne openly identified as homosexual during an interview with Ted Koppel on the ABC television news program Nightline . Thorne later appeared on NBC 's Today Show and CNN 's Sonya Live . 
 Within days , the Navy began discharge proceedings against him , though he was not formally discharged until 1995 . By the time of his first discharge hearing in August 1992 , Thorne had reached the rank of lieutenant . On May 11 , 1993 , he testified before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee , which was surveying the opinions of service members on the question of service by open homosexuals . He told the senators that his discussion with his peers following his television disclosure was " a <unk> " and called the policy banning service by homosexuals " Government @-@ sanctioned discrimination . " During the committee session , South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond advised Thorne to seek psychiatric help . 
 In 1994 , President Clinton instituted " don 't ask , don 't tell " ( DADT ) , a policy which barred open homosexuals from military service but forbade officers to investigate the sexuality of service members . Thorne 's previous assertion became a test of this new policy , and proceedings against him continued . While Thorne 's discharge proceedings were under way , he was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal for " superb leadership , exceptional professionalism and total devotion to duty " . In 1994 , a Navy board of inquiry recommended that Thorne be honorably discharged , though the discharge was not official until May 6 , 1995 . 
 Thorne then brought suit in federal court to overturn the discharge ; the court ordered his reinstatement while the case proceeded . After he lost his challenge to DADT in both U.S. District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals , the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal on October 19 , 1998 , and he was again discharged . 
 Thorne 's various cases left him with a new interest in the law . He pursued a degree at the University of Richmond School of Law , graduating in 1997 . 
 = = Judicial nomination = = 
 Thorne @-@ Begland went on to serve 12 years as a prosecutor and became chief deputy commonwealth 's attorney for Richmond . In 2012 , he was nominated to fill a vacancy on the state 's 13th General District Court , which serves Richmond , Virginia . Before the vote , the conservative advocacy group Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied heavily against his nomination due to his homosexuality and past activism . He had served for a time on the board of Equality Virginia , a gay rights advocacy organization . If his nomination had succeeded , he would have become the first openly gay judge in the state . 
 On May 14 , the day of the scheduled vote on Thorne @-@ Begland 's appointment , Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate 's sexuality should not be an issue : " All I can tell you is what I 've always said about judges , and that is that these ought to be merit @-@ based selections solely based on a person 's skill , ability , fairness , judicial temperament " . Thorne @-@ Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to " neutrally apply the laws " and avoid political advocacy . 
 Some House Republicans were critical of Thorne @-@ Begland 's lying to the Navy about his homosexuality , stating that his violation of the military 's code of conduct made him unfit for a judgeship . Delegates also stated that they felt Thorne @-@ Begland 's homosexuality and previous history of activism would influence his rulings on the bench . 
 Following a lengthy discussion , the vote on Thorne @-@ Begland 's nomination was held shortly after 1 am on May 15 . The vote split largely along party lines , with 21 Democrats and 8 Republicans supporting him and 31 Republicans opposing him , well short of the 51 @-@ vote majority needed . Following the vote , the House of Delegates adjourned for the year .

 Thorne @-@ Begland 's supporters described the opposition to his appointment as " discrimination " and " bigotry " , while his opponents described it as a necessary measure against his " aggressive activist homosexual agenda " . Virginia Republican Bob Marshall noted on CNN that " Sodomy is not a civil right " , and stated that Thorne @-@ Begland 's homosexuality would make it impossible for him to judge cases impartially : " if you have a bar room fight between a homosexual and heterosexual , I 'm concerned about possible bias . " Republican senate candidate and former senator George Allen expressed disagreement with the vote , stating that judges should be appointed based on judicial qualifications rather than sexual orientation . Stephanie Cutter of US President Barack Obama 's re @-@ election campaign described Thorne @-@ Begland as " overly @-@ qualified " for the post , stating " He is a well @-@ known successful prosecutor ... That is how the legislature should be making these decisions . Not based on someone 's own sexual orientation . " The campaign of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declined to comment . 
 The New York Times accused the House of " clear and shameful " bias . The Washington Post stated that " no matter how they dressed it up , the Republicans ' opposition boiled down to old @-@ fashioned prejudice . " Dahlia Lithwick of Slate wrote that if Thorne @-@ Begland 's previous advocacy for gay rights disqualified him from the bench , Thurgood Marshall 's advocacy with the NAACP and Ruth Bader Ginsburg 's advocacy for women 's rights would have disqualified them from the U.S. Supreme Court . The New Jersey Star @-@ Ledger described the decision as " stunning in its blatant prejudice . "

 Thorne @-@ Begland commented that he was " looking forward to continuing to serve the citizens of the city of Richmond and the great commonwealth of Virginia " in his role as a prosecutor . A month later , on June 14 , the Richmond Circuit Court judges appointed him to the position for which he was rejected by the legislature . The temporary appointment began July 1 , 2012 , to expire 30 days after the date the next legislative session began . Governor McDonnell 's spokesman congratulated Thorne @-@ Begland on the appointment , stating , " the Governor believes Mr. Thorne @-@ Begland is well @-@ qualified to serve on the bench " . Marshall called the move " highly imprudent and arrogant " of the judges : " They 're contesting the authority of the General Assembly . . . . This is an act of defiance on their part .

" Thorne @-@ Begland stated that " I look forward to serving the citizens of the City of Richmond as a jurist , and over the coming months , I hope that my service provides comfort to all Virginians that I remain committed to the faithful application of the laws and Constitutions of Virginia and the United States of America . " 
 On January 15 , 2013 , the House of Delegates elected Thorne @-@ Begland to a full six @-@ year term with a vote of 66 – 28 , with one abstention .

 = New York State Route 210 = 
 New York State Route 210 ( NY 210 ) is a state highway in Orange County , New York , in the United States . It runs north from the New Jersey state line — where it continues south as Passaic County Route 511 ( CR 511 ) — along the west shore of Greenwood Lake to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake , where it ends at a junction with NY 17A . It was once much longer , as it originally extended east along NY 17A and CR 106 in Orange and Rockland counties to Stony Point when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The route was truncated to its current length in 1982 . Prior to becoming NY 210 in 1930 , the road alongside Greenwood Lake was part of NY 55 , a route connecting New Jersey to Goshen , in the 1920s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 210 commences at the New York – New Jersey state line in the town of Warwick , where it connects to CR 511 in Passaic County , New Jersey . Like CR 511 in New Jersey , NY 210 is the primary lakeside roadway along Greenwood Lake , an interstate lake located roughly equally in New Jersey and New York . NY 210 heads north from the state line along the western edge of the base of a deep valley surrounding the lake to a community known as Indian Park , entirely situated on the steep incline leading away from the lake . The route continues on to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake , located at the northern tip of the lake . 
 NY 210 enters the village center from the west on Jersey Avenue . It follows the village street for four blocks to Windermere Avenue , where it turns to follow that street to the northeast . The route terminates nine blocks later upon intersecting NY 17A north of the village center .

 From 1930 to 1982 , NY 210 extended eastward into Rockland County . This 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) extension was primarily made up of several highways that were previously part of a privately maintained road . On March 10 , 1824 , the New York State Legislature passed a law incorporating the Monroe and Haverstraw Road Company . The new company was tasked with building a turnpike from the hamlet of Monroe ( now Southfields ) east to the town of Haverstraw , where it ended at a fork in the road somewhere in the town . The turnpike company ceased to exist on April 28 , 1870 , when the legislature passed a law repealing the 1824 document that created the turnpike company . The highway was subsequently sold off in order to pay off the debts of the company and to finance repairs to bridges along the road . 
 When Harriman State Park opened in 1910 , the Monroe – Haverstraw highway was renamed Southfields Road . Three years later , a portion of the route became part of Seven Lakes Drive , a major highway built to traverse the park . In 1916 , Rockland County numbered its highways for the first time . The Rockland County section of the former Monroe and Haverstraw Road was designated as CR 416 at this time . From 1919 to 1920 , the highway was reconstructed and rebuilt to state standards . 
 = = = Designation = = = 
 In the late 1920s , what is now NY 210 was originally designated as part of NY 55 , a connector between NY 17 in Goshen and the New Jersey state line south of the village of Greenwood Lake . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 55 was incorporated into two longer routes : NY 210 from New Jersey to Greenwood Lake and NY 17A from Greenwood Lake to Goshen . Initially , NY 17A ended in Greenwood Lake while NY 210 continued east to U.S. Route 9W ( US 9W ) on the banks of the Hudson River in West Haverstraw . From Greenwood Lake to Southfields , NY 210 was routed on modern NY 17A . The route continued east from there along Southfields Road to the eastern fringe of Harriman State Park , at which point it headed to West Haverstraw via Willow Grove and Letchworth Village roads , Suffern Lane , and Railroad Avenue . 
 By 1933 , NY 17A was extended eastward along NY 210 to Southfields , completing the alternate loop of NY 17 , while NY 210 was realigned on its east end by 1938 to end at US 9W in Stony Point . Instead of following Willow Point Road , the highway remained on modern Gate Hill Road to the vicinity of Stony Point , where it entered the hamlet on Main Street . It was rerouted again between 1968 and 1973 to bypass Main Street to the south on Central Drive . 
 On April 1 , 1980 , ownership and maintenance of the portion of NY 210 from NY 17 to the Orange – Rockland county line was transferred from the state of New York to Orange County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . Two years later , the portion of the route within Rockland County was turned over from the state to the county . As a result , NY 210 was truncated to the former western terminus of its overlap with NY 17A in Greenwood Lake . The former routing of NY 210 is now designated as CR 106 in both Orange and Rockland counties .

 Over the years , at least two fatal accidents have occurred on the portion of NY 210 that runs alongside Greenwood Lake . On July 15 , 1940 , a Brooklyn couple was killed when their car struck a stone ledge near the lake . Two others were injured in the accident . On December 1 , 1968 , three were killed and one person was injured when two cars had a head @-@ on collision just north of the New Jersey state line .

 M @-@ 115 is a state trunkline highway in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . The highway takes a generally southeast @-@ to @-@ northwest direction between Frankfort on Lake Michigan and Clare in the central part of the state . The northwestern end is at M @-@ 22 next to Betsie Lake ; the southeastern end in downtown Clare is at an intersection with Business US Highway 127 ( Bus . US 127 ) and Bus . US 10 . In between , the trunkline runs about 96 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 155 @.@ 3 km ) through woodlands , including areas that are a part of either the Manistee National Forest or the Pere Marquette State Forest . The highway also passes agricultural areas , several lakes in the region and a state park near Cadillac . 
 M @-@ 115 was first designated in the 1920s on the northwestern end near Frankfort . Additional , disconnected sections were designed as part of the trunkline in the 1930s near Cadillac , Farwell and Mesick . All but one of these gaps ( Cadillac – Mesick ) was eliminated by the end of that decade . The remaining segment was built in the 1950s to unite M @-@ 115 into a single highway . The last change came in 1989 when the highway was extended into Clare to its current southern terminus . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 115 starts in downtown Clare at a four @-@ way intersection with the two business loops , Bus . US 127 and Bus . US 10 , in town . From this junction , M @-@ 115 runs west following the former routing of US 10 along Ludington Drive to Farwell . In the middle of town , M @-@ 115 turns northwesterly to meet the end of the US 10 freeway near Surrey Lake . The highway continues northwest through forest lands and lake country . The trunkline passes into northern Osceola County near its crossing of the Muskegon River . There are intersections with both M @-@ 66 and M @-@ 61 south of Marion near rural farms . The roadway subsequently crosses into southern Wexford County . Near Stone Lake south of Cadillac , M @-@ 115 meets US 131 and M @-@ 55 . M @-@ 55 leaves the US 131 freeway and joins M @-@ 115 , and the two run concurrently along the western end of Lake Cadillac . They separate near Lake Mitchell , and M @-@ 115 turns northwesterly between the two lakes passing Mitchell State Park and the eastern shore of the latter lake . 
 Past the Cadillac area , M @-@ 115 runs through the northeastern corner of the Manistee National Forest . The highway continues through woodlands , passing several small lakes in the area as it approaches the community of Mesick . There it turns due west and joins M @-@ 37 through town . After M @-@ 37 separates to the south , M @-@ 115 crosses the Manistee River and continues its northwestern course . The highway crosses the northeastern corner of Manistee County and runs through the community of Copemish on the way to Benzonia . The landscape here turns more agricultural as the highway skirts southwest of Thompsonville crossing the Betsie River . 
 After the river crossing , the highway enters Benzie County and runs through the Pere Marquette State Forest . South of Benzonia , M @-@ 115 runs concurrently with US 31 into town . The highways separate in the center of town where M @-@ 115 turns westward to run along the south shore of Crystal Lake past Frankfort Dow Memorial Field , the local airport near Frankfort . M @-@ 115 follows Forest Avenue , and the highway designation ends at the intersection in town with M @-@ 22 near Betsie Lake . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 115 like all other trunkline highways in the state under its jurisdiction . As a part of these responsibilities , the department tracks traffic volumes along its roadways until a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This number is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year . In 2009 , MDOT determined that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 115 were the 12 @,@ 079 vehicles daily along the section of highway near lakes Mitchell and Cadillac . The lowest AADT was the 2 @,@ 236 vehicles near Copemish . The trunkline between the US 10 and M @-@ 37 junctions has been listed on the National Highway <unk> a network of roads important to the country 's defense , economy and mobility .

 In 1929 , the first stretch of M @-@ 115 was designated from Frankfort to Benzonia . Beginning in the mid @-@ 1930s , construction of M @-@ 115 began from central to northwestern Lower Michigan . In 1936 , an earthen highway was opened between the south side of Cadillac to M @-@ 66 , with additional sections west of Mesick and northwest of US 10 . By the end of the year , the state was paving the earthen section , completed a gravel highway near Mesick and opened an earthen section in Clare County . The section from Copemish to northwest of Mesick was opened as an earthen highway the next year . Construction started in early 1938 to connect Benzonia to Copemish , and before the year was out , the Michigan State Highway Department started work to fill in the gap between M @-@ 66 and the highway north of US 10 in Clare County . These two sections were completed as earth @-@ graded highway in 1939 . Both discontinuous sections were fully paved by 1945 . 
 In 1953 , a county road was built along the path of the future M @-@ 115 between Mesick and Cadillac . This road was designated as a state highway by 1957 , with a connection along Boon Road north of Cadillac and a concurrency along US 131 to close the gap in 1957 . The Boon Road segment was removed the next year when the routing near Lake Mitchell opened . The southern end of M @-@ 115 was truncated slightly when the US 10 freeway bypass of Clare was opened in 1975 . M @-@ 115 has since been rerouted in 1989 along the two @-@ lane Old US 10 from its original southeastern ending point near the US 10 overpass through Farwell to Clare . A roundabout was built for the intersection with northbound M @-@ 37 east of Mesick and was opened in September 2013 .

 John Benbow ( 10 March 1653 – 4 November 1702 ) was an English officer in the Royal Navy . He joined the navy aged 25 years , seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned . 
 Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War ( 1688 – 97 ) , serving on and later commanding several English vessels and taking part in the battles of Beachy Head , Barfleur and La Hogue in 1690 and 1692 . He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against Salé and Moor pirates ; laying siege to Saint @-@ Malo ; and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession ( 1701 – 1714 ) . 
 Benbow 's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral . He was then involved in an incident during the Action of August 1702 , where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships . Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved , though he did not live to see these results . These events contributed to his notoriety , and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture . 
 = = Family and early years = = 
 Benbow was born the son of William and Martha Benbow . The astrologer John Partridge recorded the exact time and date of his birth as being at noon on 10 March 1653 , and this is the date used by the National Museum of the Royal Navy , the Encyclopædia Britannica , and the local historical accounts of Joseph Nightingale published in 1818 . A biography within an 1819 publication of The Gentleman 's Magazine , however , records in a short biography entitled Life and Exploits of Admiral Benbow by D. Parkes that he was born in 1650 , as does the 1861 Sea kings and naval heroes by John George Edgar . Edgar records that Benbow 's father died when Benbow was very young , while Parkes ' account describes his father as being in the service of the Army under Charles I and not dying until Benbow was in his teens . Encyclopædia Britannica writes that Benbow 's father was in fact a tanner . Meanwhile , his uncle , Thomas , was executed by Charles I. Both Parkes and the National Museum of the Royal Navy concur that Benbow was born in Coton Hill in Shrewsbury , Shropshire , and Nightingale asserts that the death of both uncle and father , and the family 's association with Charles I in the years following his execution , ensured that the " family were brought very low . " Benbow 's lack of possessions , Nightingale writes , turned him to a career at sea .

During this period the English fleet was often in action against the Barbary pirates of North Africa that were actively preying upon European shipping . The Rupert herself captured an Algerine warship in 1678 , which was later commissioned in the Royal Navy as the HMS Tiger Prize . Benbow distinguished himself well in a number of actions against the Algerine vessels , and won Herbert 's approval . On Narborough 's return to England , Herbert was appointed acting commander @-@ in @-@ chief , and made Benbow master aboard HMS Nonsuch on 15 June 1679 . The Nonsuch would remain at Tangiers and off the African coast and had a number of successive captains who would go on to achieve flag rank , including George Rooke , Cloudesley Shovell and Francis <unk> . All were impressed by Benbow , and would afterwards help to advance his career . 
 The Nonsuch was next in action on 8 August 1681 , this time against the Algerine warship , the Golden Horse . The Golden Horse had been engaged by HMS Adventure , under the command of Captain William Booth , and when the Nonsuch arrived on the scene the Golden Horse surrendered . A dispute then arose over the question of the prize money and how it should be shared out , and comments were made amongst the Nonsuch 's crew against those of the Adventure . Benbow 's repetition of these eventually came to Booth 's knowledge , and the captain brought a court @-@ martial against Benbow , however this revealed that Benbow had only been repeating these words rather than being their originator . Benbow was ordered to forfeit three months ' pay , amounting to £ 12 15s . , to the Adventure 's crew , and to " ask Captain Booth 's pardon on board His Majesty 's ship Bristol , declaring that he had no malicious intent in speaking those words ; all the commanders being present , and a boat 's crew of each ship 's company " . 
 = = = Merchant trading = = = 
 The Nonsuch then returned to England and was paid off on 9 November 1681 . Benbow left the Navy and entered the merchant service , sailing a merchant vessel from London and Bristol to ports in Italy and Spain . By 1686 he was a " tough merchant seaman " and the owner and commander of a frigate named the Benbow , trading with the Levant . In May 1687 he commanded a merchant vessel , the Malaga Merchant , and was aboard her when she was attacked by a Salé pirate . He mounted a successful defence and beat off the attack . It was claimed afterwards that he cut off and salted the heads of thirteen Moors who were slain aboard his ship , and then took them into Cadiz to claim a reward from the magistrates . A Moorish skull @-@ cap , " coated with varnish and set in silver " and bearing the inscription " First adventure of Captain John Benbow , and gift to Richard Ridley , 1687 " is referred to in 1844 by Charles Dickens in Bentley 's Miscellany where he speaks of Shrewsbury 's history , and the 1885 Dictionary of National Biography also relates the story . 
 = = = Return to the Navy = = = 
 Benbow only returned to the Navy after the Glorious Revolution in 1688 . His first recorded commission was to the post of third lieutenant of HMS Elizabeth on 1 June 1689 , under the command of Captain David Mitchell . His first command came on 20 September of that year , when he was appointed captain of HMS York . He was transferred to HMS Bonaventure on 26 October and then to HMS Britannia on 12 November . 
 Benbow 's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard . He then moved to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690 , a post he intermittently held for the next six years . He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690 , under his old commander Arthur Herbert , now Lord Torrington . He was assigned to act as master of the fleet , and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head . After the defeat , a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it . Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage , and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron , Torrington . He did not however testify during Torrington 's court @-@ martial in December that year . 
 Benbow continued aboard the Sovereign throughout 1691 , and by the summer of 1692 , was again master of the fleet , this time under Admiral Edward Russell , then aboard the Britannia . Benbow worked closely with his old colleague David Mitchell , then serving as Russell 's first captain , and Josiah Burchett , Russell 's clerk . Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs , where they linked up with the Dutch forces . Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue . After the battles , Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant , spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet . He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant , he was now to be paid as a master , in addition to his master attendant 's wage , presumably as an acknowledgement of his special services . 
 = = = With the bomb flotillas = = = 
 Benbow returned to active naval service in September 1693 , joining Thomas Phillips , the second engineer of the ordnance , in jointly commanding a flotilla of bomb vessels to attack Saint @-@ Malo . Benbow went aboard the 48 @-@ gun HMS Norwich and began the bombardment on 16 November . It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour . An attempt was made to bring her alongside the town walls , but she ran aground , was set on fire , and exploded . Despite the failure of the initial plan , considerable damage was done , and Benbow 's forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disabled it , carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey . Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court @-@ martial against Captain Henry Tourville , accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship in closer . There was no conviction though , as the mortars were proved to be defective . 
 Benbow 's experience led to him being promoted to a similar flotilla , this time to be deployed against Dunkirk under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral Shovell . A number of converted merchant vessels , rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn , were assigned to support the expedition . Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694 , and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance , Willem <unk> . Benbow 's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell 's fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September . However , the French were able to block the entrance to the port , preventing Benbow 's squadron from entering , and a storm further disrupted operations . Benbow drew back from Dunkirk , and instead sailed around to Calais , where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September . He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard . He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz . 
 = = = Rise to admiral = = = 
 Benbow was soon at sea again in March 1695 , being appointed commander @-@ in @-@ chief of His Majesty 's ships which were then off the coast of France . His squadron was highly successful , taking a number of French merchants in early April and bringing them to England as prizes . Benbow was recommended by Lord Berkeley , who had served with Benbow at Saint @-@ Malo , to be promoted to rear @-@ admiral at the next opportunity , and in the meantime he was appointed to the command of the 70 @-@ gun HMS Northumberland . He was soon joined by a volunteer – his then fourteen @-@ year @-@ old son – also named John Benbow . Benbow then sailed with Berkeley and the Dutch lieutenant @-@ admiral Philips van Almonde to Saint @-@ Malo , intending to operate against privateering operations being conducted from the area . Benbow moved to command HMS Charles Galley , to direct the inshore operations of ten English and Dutch warships , nine English bomb vessels , and seventeen small boats and vessels . They began operations on their arrival off Saint @-@ Malo on 4 July , remaining in action until evening the next day when they withdrew , without having achieved any decisive result . Several houses had been destroyed for the damage and loss of a few of the bomb vessels . Benbow was given eight bomb vessels and seven or eight frigates and was dispatched down the coast . He attacked Granville on 8 July , shelling it with over 900 bombs over several hours , and departed having set the town ablaze . 
 = = = Public and private reception = = = 
 The outcome of the operations had left Benbow in a tense relationship with his immediate superiors . Berkeley had been accused of excessive timidity in his actions , which it was believed had led to the failure of the attack on Dunkirk . Benbow on the other hand was widely lauded for his fearless inshore attacks with his bomb vessels . Berkeley wrote on 28 July : 
 As to Captain Benbow , I know of no difference between him and me , nor have we had any . He has no small obligation to me , but being called in some of the foolish printed papers ‘ the famous Captain Benbow ’ , I suppose has put him a little out of himself , and has made him play the fool , as I guess , in some of his letters . I will not farther now <unk> this business , but time will show I have not been in the wrong , unless being too kind to an ungrateful man . 
 However the Admiralty approved of Benbow 's conduct and ordered him " to be paid as Rear @-@ Admiral during the time he has been employed this summer on the coast of France ... as a reward for his good service . " Benbow was then appointed to the grand committee of sixty men to oversee the plans for Greenwich Hospital in December 1695 , but the issue dragged on until 1 May 1696 . The Admiralty again stepped in and Benbow was finally promoted and appointed commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the squadron before Dunkirk as " Rear @-@ Admiral of the Blue for the duration of this present expedition " and moved aboard the 70 @-@ gun HMS Suffolk . His orders were to protect English and Dutch shipping , especially from the squadron of the privateer Jean Bart. Bart was mostly successful in evading pursuit however , usually escaping into Dunkirk when Benbow 's force drew near . 
 Benbow was appointed to command a squadron in the Soundings in December 1696 . He carried out a number of cruises between March and August 1697 , protecting allied trade and escorting the West Indian and Virginian merchant fleets into port . These activities marked the last English naval expedition of the war . He also carried out reconnaissance activities on the French fleet in port in Brest in July , before resuming patrol operations off Dunkirk , this time in concert with a number of Dutch ships under Rear @-@ Admiral Philips van der Goes , until the end of the war in September 1697 . 
 = = = Appointment to the West Indies = = = 
 Benbow was made commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the King 's ships in the West Indies on 9 March 1698 and instructed to tackle the issue of piracy . He sailed in November , the first leg taking him from Portsmouth to Madeira . Sailing under his protection from the Salé pirates was the Paramore , under Edmond Halley , then sailing to the North Atlantic to carry out experiments to observe magnetic variations . Benbow finally reached Barbados in February 1699 , and moved to the Spanish Main aboard his flagship , the 60 @-@ gun HMS Gloucester . He threatened the governor of Cartagena with a blockade , and so compelled him to restore two English merchant ships that he had detained . These ships had been intended to take part in an expedition against the Scottish Darién scheme . Without the ships , this became impossible and the colonists were saved for the time being . This was counter to the English government 's desire to see the end of the Scottish colonising efforts , and in June Benbow and the other West Indies governors received orders " not to assist the Scotch colony in Darien . " 
 Benbow then sailed as far north as Newfoundland in order to drive the pirates away , but they evaded capture . Benbow returned to England in the summer of 1700 , and was appointed to the command of a fleet in the Downs . Benbow served there until summer 1701 , under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke . He was promoted to rear @-@ admiral of the red on 14 April , followed by vice @-@ admiral of the blue on 30 June . He then flew his flag in the 70 @-@ gun HMS Breda . 
 = = = Spanish treasure fleet , West Indies , the Action of 1702 = = = 
 With the peace becoming increasingly uneasy , the English government became concerned over the possible fate of the Spanish silver fleet , due to arrive in European waters from America . They were worried that the French would intercept the ships and use the treasure for war preparations . Benbow was issued secret instructions to find the fleet , and then " to seize and bring them to England , taking care that no embezzlement be made " . Benbow 's squadron was detached on 2 September and sailed for the West Indies , arriving on 14 November , and was at the Jamaica station in mid @-@ December . He remained there for several months , being joined on 8 May 1702 by several vessels under Captain William Whetstone . Whetstone was made Rear @-@ Admiral under Benbow , who had been promoted to Vice @-@ Admiral of the White on 19 January 1702 
 By now , the War of the Spanish Succession had broken out , and news of its declaration reached Benbow on 7 July . He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse , which he believed would call at the port on his voyage to Cartagena , and from there he might raid English and Dutch shipping . After Whetstone had left , Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena , anticipating that either he or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle . 
 By the time that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola , Du Casse had already departed . Benbow 's force subsequently sighted the French on 19 August , sailing off Cape Santa Marta . The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns , while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns . The English forces were heavily scattered , and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup . They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon , after which a partial engagement was fought , lasting about two hours , until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off . 
 The action quickly revealed a breakdown in discipline amongst Benbow 's captains . He had intended that the 64 @-@ gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle , but Kirkby was not maintaining his station . Benbow decided to take the lead himself , and the Breda pulled ahead , followed by the 50 @-@ gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton . The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night , but the other five ships refused to close . The chase ensued until 24 August , with only Benbow , Walton , and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle . At times , they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron . The Ruby was disabled on 23 August , and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal . The French resumed the action at two in the morning on 24 August , the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her . Benbow himself was hit by a chain @-@ shot that broke his leg and he was carried below . 
 Benbow was determined to continue the pursuit , despite his wounds and despite Captain Kirkby 's arrival on board , attempting to persuade Benbow to abandon the pursuit . Benbow summoned a council of war , and the other captains agreed , signing a paper drafted by Kirkby which declared that they believed " that after six days of battle the squadron lacked enough men to continue and that there was little chance of a decisive action , since the men were exhausted , there was a general lack of ammunition , the ships ' rigging and masts were badly damaged , and the winds were generally variable and <unk> . " They recommended breaking off the action and following the French to see if the situation improved . Benbow had " seen the cowardly behaviour of some of them before , [ and ] had reason to believe that they either had a design against him or to be traitors to their country if an opportunity happened that the French could have destroyed the Admiral " . He , therefore , ordered the squadron to return to Jamaica . On their arrival , he ordered the captains to be imprisoned , awaiting a trial by court @-@ martial . 
 Benbow received a letter from du Casse after the engagement : 
 Sir , 
 I had little hopes on Monday last but to have <unk> in your cabin : but it pleased God to order it otherwise . I am thankful for it . As for those cowardly captains who deserted you , hang them up , for by God they deserve it . 
 Yours , 
 Du Casse . 
 = = = Trial of the captains = = = 
 Acting Rear @-@ Admiral Whetstone returned to Port Royal , having spent 62 days cruising off Hispaniola , and preparations were made for the trial . Before it could begin , Captain Thomas Hudson died , who had commanded HMS Pendennis . The remaining captains appeared at the court @-@ martial which convened on the Breda , held between 19 and 23 October . Due to his injuries , Benbow passed to Whetstone the role of presiding over the court , but he was present at the trial . The court found Captain Kirkby of the HMS Defiance and Cooper Wade of the Greenwich guilty of breach of orders , neglect of duty , and the " ill signed paper and consultation ... which obliged the Admiral ... to give over the chase and fight " , and condemned them to be shot . 
 John Constable of HMS Windsor was found guilty of breach of orders and drunkenness and was cashiered . Samuel Vincent of the Falmouth and Christopher Fogg of the Breda were initially sentenced to be cashiered for signing the six captains ' resolution , but Benbow personally declared that they had fought bravely , and their sentences were remitted by the Lord High Admiral . The sentences were deferred so that Queen Anne could have a chance to examine the proceedings . After her consideration in January 1703 , she allowed the sentences to proceed and Constable , Kirkby , and Wade were returned to England as prisoners . Constable was imprisoned until 1704 , when the Queen pardoned him . Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard HMS Bristol on 16 April 1703 while she was anchored in Plymouth Sound under Captain Edward Acton . Controversy slowly began to develop over the events of August 1702 . Supporters of the disgraced Kirkby and Wade sought to discredit Benbow by publishing their own account of the action . 
 = = Death and burial = = 
 Benbow died at Port Royal , Kingston , Jamaica on 4 November 1702 . Whetstone reported that the cause of death was " the wound of his leg which he received in battle with Monsieur Du Casse , it never being set to perfection , which malady being aggravated by the discontent of his mind , threw him into a sort of melancholy which ended his life as before . " He was buried on 16 November in the chancel of St Andrew 's Church , Kingston . A marble slab was later laid over the grave , emblazoned with a coat of arms and inscribed : 
 Here lyeth the Body of John Benbow , Esq . , Admiral of the White , a true pattern of English Courage , who lost his life in Defence of his Queene & Country , November the 4th , 1702 , In the 52nd year of his age , by a wound in his Legg .

 Secretary of State Lord Nottingham wrote to Benbow in January 1703 , before news of his death had reached London , to inform him that the queen was " extremely well pleased with your conduct and much offended with the baseness of those officers who deserted and betrayed you . " Meanwhile , the cabinet was preparing to promote him to vice @-@ admiral of the white and to dispatch him to transport troops to Newfoundland .

 Benbow married a woman named Martha ( died 1722 ) after his return to England in 1681 . The couple had at least seven children , including daughter Martha and sons Richard and John . Another son Solomon was baptised in 1686 but died in infancy . There are also records of two more sons named Richard who were born in Kent , and another daughter named Katherine . Son John went on to serve in the Royal Navy . The family lived in the parish of St Dunstan and All Saints , Stepney . In 1709 , Katherine married Paul Calton of Milton , Berkshire , where Benbow is said to have stayed in the 1690s .

 Benbow signed a three @-@ year lease on Sayes Court in June 1696 , a house belonging to diarist John Evelyn . Six months later , Evelyn wrote to a friend complaining , " I have let my house to Captain Benbow , and have the mortification of seeing everyday much of my former labours and expenses there impairing for want of a more polite tenant . " In January 1698 , Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship . He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III . The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country . Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury , in order to be able to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses . He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house , with " much of the furniture broke , lost or destroyed " . Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it " entirely ruined " . Benbow lost " twenty fine paintings " and " several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea " from his personal property . The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £ 350 9s . 6d. in compensation . 
 = = = " Brave Benbow " = = = 
 Benbow 's fame led to his name entering popular culture . A monument by sculptor John Evan Thomas was erected in 1843 by public subscription in St Mary 's Church , Shrewsbury commemorating Benbow as " a skillful and daring seaman whose heroic exploits long rendered him the boast of the British Navy and still point him out as the Nelson of his times . " A 74 @-@ gun ship of the line and two battleships were named HMS Benbow . 
 Robert Louis Stevenson named a tavern the " Admiral Benbow " , where Jim Hawkins and his mother live , in his romantic adventure novel Treasure Island . He also titled the first chapter " The Old Sea Dog at the Admiral Benbow " . There are a number of real life Admiral Benbow public houses around the world , and other institutions have also borne his name . 
 The incident of August 1702 also took hold on the popular imagination , and was celebrated in an alehouse song : 
 Its musical theme forms one of the three arrangements on which English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams based his Sea Songs , originally arranged for military band in 1923 as the second movement of his English Folk Song Suite , and subsequently re @-@ arranged for full orchestra in 1942 by the composer . 
 Another song has survived from the period with different air and rhythm but also known as Admiral Benbow , and it is often sung by folksingers . It begins We sailed from Virginia and thence to Fayal .

 Captain Benbow is prominently mentioned in " Down by the Sea " , the last song on Business as Usual , the 1981 album by Australian rock group Men at Work . 
 The pub in the novel Treasure Island by R.L. Stevenson is named after him .

 Ruby Laffoon ( January 15 , 1869 – March 1 , 1941 ) was an American politician who served as the 43rd Governor of Kentucky from 1931 to 1935 . A Kentucky native , at age 17 Laffoon moved to Washington , D.C. , to live with his uncle , U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon . He developed an interest in politics and returned to Kentucky , where he compiled a mixed record of victories and defeats in elections at the county and state levels . In 1931 , he was chosen as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by a nominating convention , not a primary , making him the only Kentucky gubernatorial candidate to be chosen by a convention after 1903 . In the general election , he defeated Republican William B. Harrison by what was then the largest margin of victory in Kentucky gubernatorial history . 
 Dubbed " the terrible Turk from Madisonville , " Laffoon was confronted with the economic difficulties of the Great Depression . To raise additional revenue for the state treasury , he advocated the enactment of the state 's first sales tax . This issue dominated most of his term in office and split the state Democratic Party and Laffoon 's own administration . The lieutenant governor , A. B. " Happy " Chandler , led the fight against the tax in the legislature . After the tax was defeated in two regular legislative sessions and one specially called legislative session , Laffoon forged a bipartisan alliance to get the tax passed in a special session in 1934 . 
 Laffoon 's feud with Lieutenant Governor Chandler continued throughout his term and affected the 1935 gubernatorial race . ( At the time , the lieutenant governor was elected independently from the governor . ) Term @-@ limited by the state constitution , Laffoon supported political boss Tom Rhea to succeed him as governor , and convinced the Democrats to again hold a nominating convention to choose their gubernatorial nominee . This would have greatly improved Laffoon 's chances of hand @-@ picking his successor . While Laffoon was on a visit to Washington , D.C. , Chandler was left as acting governor under the provisions of the Kentucky Constitution . Chandler issued a call for a special legislative session to consider a mandatory primary election bill . Laffoon rushed back to the state to invalidate the call , but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional , and the primary law was passed . Chandler defeated Rhea in the primary , and went on to succeed Laffoon as governor . Following his term in office , Laffoon returned to his native Madisonville , where he died of a stroke in 1941 . Among his gubernatorial legacies was appointing a record number of Kentucky colonels , including Harland Sanders , who used the title " Colonel " when he opened his chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ruby Laffoon was born on January 15 , 1869 , in a log cabin in Madisonville , Kentucky . He was the third child and only son of John Bledsoe Laffoon , Jr. and Martha Henrietta ( née Earle ) Laffoon . According to Laffoon biographer Vernon Gipson , his parents could not decide on a name for their new child , and for several years , referred to him only as " Bud " . When he was a young child , Laffoon chose the name " Ruby " after John Edwin Ruby , a local businessman whose grocery store he frequently visited . 
 The <unk> were primarily farmers but also had some experience in politics . Ruby Laffoon 's grandfather , John Bledsoe Laffoon , Sr. , migrated to Kentucky from South Carolina in 1815 and served one term in the Kentucky House of Representatives . Ruby 's father , John , Jr . , served several terms as a deputy sheriff in Hopkins County and one term as county assessor . Ruby 's uncle , Polk Laffoon , served two terms in the United States House of Representatives . 
 Laffoon 's early education was obtained in the public schools of Madisonville . While there , one of his teachers was his sister , Susan Isabella Laffoon , who was only 16 years old . At age 15 , while plowing a field , Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule , requiring a six @-@ week stay in a Nashville hospital . In the winter of the same year , he slipped on some ice and re @-@ injured the hip . As a result of these injuries , his right leg was one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half inches shorter than his left leg , requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp for the rest of his life . After his injury , Laffoon 's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O 'Bryan . By age 17 , he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County . 
 = = Legal and early political career = = 
 In 1886 , Laffoon moved to Washington , D.C. to live with his uncle , U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon . There he served as a messenger in the office of Judge C. R. Faulkner , director of the pension office . In September 1887 , he enrolled at Columbia Law School ( asserted by Vernon Gipson to have been a prior designation for George Washington University Law School ) . On October 17 , 1888 , he matriculated to Washington and Lee University , where he earned a law degree in 1890 . He returned to Madisonville , was admitted to the bar , and began practicing in the office of Judge William H. Yost . He became active in the Democratic Party and served as a county election officer . In 1892 , he was elected city attorney of Madisonville over Ward Headley . In 1894 , he ran for the office of county attorney for Hopkins County , but lost to Roy Salmon by seventeen votes . 
 Laffoon married Mary " May " Bryant Nisbet on January 31 , 1894 at , the Lucille Hotel in Madisonville . The couple had three daughters . Besides supporting her husband 's political endeavors , May Laffoon was also active in politics . She was a delegate @-@ at @-@ large to every Democratic National Convention between 1932 and 1960 , and actively campaigned for Franklin D. Roosevelt during his first run for the presidency . To supplement the family 's income , Ruby Laffoon became a partner in the Madisonville branch of the Phoenix Insurance Company in 1897 . He sold his interest in the company in 1901 , the same year he made a second bid to become county attorney . He won the election over Thomas E. Finley by a vote of 3 @,@ 335 to 2 @,@ 910 . In 1905 , he was re @-@ elected to his post , marking the first time in the history of Hopkins County that the county attorney had been re @-@ elected . 
 In 1907 , Laffoon sought the office of state treasurer . He faced no opposition in the Democratic primary , but the entire Democratic ticket was defeated in the general election . In 1911 , he ran for state auditor , but lost in the primary to Henry Bosworth . That same year , he was elected as one of Hopkins County 's delegates to the state Democratic convention . A bill passed in the state legislature in 1912 created a State Insurance Rating Board under the office of state auditor , and Bosworth appointed Laffoon chairman of the board due to his experience in the insurance field and as a reward for his loyalty to the party . In 1915 , Laffoon sought the post of Commonwealth 's Attorney for the Fourth Judicial District , which comprised Hopkins , Caldwell , Crittenden , and Livingston counties . He lost in the primary to J. Elliott Baker , but the Republican candidate , Charles Ferguson , won the general election . 
 In September 1918 , Laffoon moved to San Antonio , Texas , where he opened a law practice and managed a citrus fruit business near Galveston . Though he had intended this to be a permanent relocation , while on a visit to family a few months later , friends urged him to return to Kentucky , and he obliged after only three months in Texas . In 1921 , he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court . In the primary , he defeated Trice Bennett , a candidate from Princeton , and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion . In the general election on November 8 , 1921 , Laffoon defeated Henderson , carrying every county in the district . In his first term , only 7 percent of his decisions were reversed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals , which was a record for the Fourth District at the time . He was re @-@ elected for a second six @-@ year term in 1927 . 
 = = Governor of Kentucky = = 
 In 1931 , Laffoon sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination . As a result of factional infighting within the Democratic party , the Democrats opted for a nominating convention instead of a primary to choose their nominee for governor . It was the first nominating convention held by the Democrats since the Music Hall Convention that nominated William Goebel in 1899 , and it was the only one held after 1903 . The convention was held in Lexington on May 12 , 1931 . Laffoon gained the support of several important leaders within the party , including Ben Johnson , Thomas Rhea , M. M. Logan , Allie Young , and William J. Fields . He was selected in a landslide over a myriad of candidates , including sitting lieutenant governor James Breathitt , Jr. and Centre College football hero James " Red " Roberts . 
 Despite his physical disability , Laffoon waged a vigorous campaign across the state . During campaign stops , he interspersed political commentary with passages from the Bible . The Louisville Courier @-@ Journal objected to his campaign style and gave a tentative endorsement to the Republican William B. Harrison , the mayor of Louisville . Dubbed " the terrible Turk from Madisonville " by former Republican governor Edwin P. Morrow , Laffoon promised that , if elected , he would remove all of the Republican officials appointed by sitting governor Flem D. Sampson from state government . He cited the failed administration of Governor Sampson and the problem @-@ filled presidency of Herbert Hoover as reasons to elect a Democrat . In the general election , Laffoon defeated Harrison by a margin of just over 72 @,@ 000 votes , the largest margin of victory for any Kentucky governor at the time . 
 Shortly after taking office , Laffoon organized the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels , a charitable organization of people who had been commissioned as honorary Kentucky colonels . During his term as governor , Laffoon commissioned 2 @,@ 368 honorary colonels , the most ever by a Kentucky governor . His best known commission was to Harland Sanders , who used the title " Colonel " when he opened his chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants . Other colonels commissioned by Laffoon included Mae West , Shirley Temple , Clark Gable , Bing Crosby , Will Rogers , Fred Astaire , Jean Harlow , Mary Pickford , Charlie Chaplin , Jack Dempsey and W. C. Fields .

 Laffoon 's administration was confronted by the economic difficulties of the Great Depression . While he proposed a number of improvements , money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans . In his first full year in office , he cut $ 11 @.@ 5 million from the state budget , but it remained out @-@ of @-@ balance . The state issued additional interest @-@ bearing warrants to cover its debts . In 1931 , these warrants accounted for 24 @.@ 2 percent of the state 's receipts ; by 1932 , that number had climbed to 40 @.@ 2 percent . In order to raise more funds , Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932 . The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens , and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly . On March 2 , 1932 , a mob of 100 anti @-@ tax protesters stormed the governor 's mansion , damaging some items inside . In an attempt to get the tax passed , Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax . The proposal passed the House , but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote . 
 The sales tax proposal caused a rift in the Democratic party generally and in Laffoon 's administration specifically . As presiding officer of the Senate , Lieutenant Governor A. B. " Happy " Chandler had led opposition to the tax in the legislature . Highway Commissioner Ben Johnson sided with Chandler , as did former Laffoon supporters Allie Young and J. Dan Talbott . In retaliation , Laffoon vetoed $ 7 million in appropriations and a measure to cut property taxes at the end of the legislative session . Among the few pieces of legislation that passed during the session were bills reorganizing the highway department , making the state Board of Charities a partisan entity , and further removing the Fish and Game Commission from the control of sportsmen . A redistricting bill was hastily passed at the end of the session , reducing the number of congressional districts from 11 to 9 , per the most recent census results , but charges of gerrymandering kept the bill tied up in the courts , preventing it from taking effect in time for the 1932 congressional elections . Consequently , all of Kentucky 's representatives that year were elected at @-@ large . The Louisville Courier @-@ Journal called the 1932 legislative session " about the worst legislative session in Kentucky 's history " . 
 Laffoon responded to the economic crisis by declaring a four @-@ day banking holiday to begin on March 1 , 1933 . He twice extended the holiday , which finally ended on March 18 . Responding to complaints of low prices by farmers , he closed burley tobacco markets in December of that year . At the end of the 1932 fiscal year , figures showed that the state incurred a $ 2 million deficit . Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds . 
 Though Laffoon was determined to pass a state sales tax , he vowed not to call a special legislative session to consider the issue . However , in August 1933 , he did call a special session to debate a " gross receipts tax " , which was essentially a sales tax by another name . Johnson and Chandler again led the opposition to Laffoon 's plan ; Laffoon called them , along with Allie Young and U.S. Representative John Y. Brown , Sr. , " the most insidious lobby that ever infected the Capitol " . He reportedly further charged that opposition to his tax program was financed by " a bunch of New York Jews " . Despite Laffoon 's rhetoric , the sales tax was again defeated . 
 The General Assembly was split three ways when it convened in 1934 . Approximately one @-@ third of the Assembly was Republican , one @-@ third was pro @-@ Laffoon Democrats , and one third was anti @-@ Laffoon Democrats . Using the promise of new roads in Republican districts as leverage , Laffoon and political boss Tom Rhea formed an alliance with the Republicans . The bipartisan alliance succeeded in enacting several measures to benefit education , including establishing a Council on Public Higher Education , extending the school year to six " or more " months , and mandating school attendance until age sixteen . Additional revenue was generated by increasing the tax on whiskey from 2 cents to 5 cents per gallon . Laffoon 's bipartisan alliance also passed a governmental reorganization bill that reduced the number of state commissions and departments from 69 to 24 , cutting several jobs from the state payroll . The real target of the bill , however , was Laffoon 's political enemies . The bill curbed the powers of the lieutenant governor and state auditor , both Laffoon opponents . The lieutenant governor was removed from his post as president of the Kentucky Senate . The bill also empowered the governor to remove any appointed state official . 
 Having neutralized opponents of the sales tax , Laffoon encouraged legislators to lower the state income and automobile taxes , which he believed would leave no alternative source of revenue except a sales tax . The General Assembly passed the requested cuts , and in July 1934 , Laffoon called another special session to consider the sales tax . Pro @-@ administration officials organized parades and demonstrations in favor of the tax . By contrast , a group of 100 unemployed men marched on Frankfort demanding financial relief . Some of them made death threats against Laffoon , and the Kentucky National Guard surrounded the governor 's mansion to protect him . Although anti @-@ sales @-@ tax forces used parliamentary procedures that stalled a vote for weeks , a three percent sales tax was approved by the end of the session . The tax was derided in a children 's chant that said " <unk> @-@ hop to the toy shop to buy a red balloon . A penny for you , a penny for me , a penny for Ruby Laffoon . " Following the special session , Laffoon was admitted to a sanatorium , where he was treated for exhaustion .

 As his term neared expiration , Laffoon removed Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner , replacing him with Tom Rhea . This move was made in order to groom Rhea to be the next governor . Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea , the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate . Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations , a convention would favor Laffoon 's choice of gubernatorial nominee . The convention was scheduled for May 14 , 1935 in Lexington . 
 On January 5 , 1935 , Laffoon traveled to Washington , D.C. to meet with President Roosevelt . Although Laffoon said the purpose of his trip was to discuss further federal aid for Kentucky , his opponents maintained he had gone to explain the lack of a primary to the president . ( Roosevelt had written a letter to the state Democratic Central Committee encouraging them to adopt a primary . ) Due to Laffoon 's absence from the state , Lieutenant Governor Chandler was left as acting governor under the provisions of the Kentucky Constitution . On February 6 , Chandler issued a proclamation calling a special session of the legislature on February 8 to consider a bill requiring a primary election to select nominees for all state offices . Laffoon rushed back to the state , arriving in Ashland on February 7 , and immediately issued a proclamation revoking Chandler 's call . Franklin County legislator John Gatewood obtained an injunction against Laffoon 's order , and pro @-@ primary legislators gathered in Frankfort on February 8 . These members failed to achieve a quorum on February 8 , 9 , and 11 . On February 11 , six legislators sought a declaratory judgment to see if Laffoon 's revocation was legal . The Franklin County Circuit Court upheld Chandler 's call and invalidated Laffoon 's revocation , and the Kentucky Court of Appeals , then the court of last resort in the state , upheld this decision by a 4 – 3 majority . 
 On February 13 , the Kentucky House achieved a quorum , and the Senate did so the following day . Having lost the battle against the special session , Laffoon proposed a primary with a run @-@ off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot . Some , including Chandler , believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham , who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination . They believed that a double primary would be too much for the aging Beckham to endure . Supporters of a single primary found they did not have the votes in the legislature to pass it , so they agreed to a double primary , which Laffoon signed into law on February 27 , 1935 . 
 Seven candidates declared their candidacy for the Democratic nomination , including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler . Former governor Beckham was not a candidate ; his only son had died in late 1934 , devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign . Near the end of the primary campaign , Laffoon suffered an attack of appendicitis and required an appendectomy , leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea . Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election . 
 On the day of the primary , Adjutant General Denhardt took National Guard troops into Harlan County , which was known for its history of election violence . The troops questioned voters , examined ballot boxes , and made several arrests . These actions were in direct violation of a restraining order issued by circuit court judge James M. Gilbert , but Denhardt claimed to be acting on orders from Laffoon . Denhardt later reported that " We stopped the most stupendous , well @-@ planned election steal ever attempted in Kentucky . Chandler would have gotten 15 @,@ 000 votes had we not been here . " Denhardt was later arrested and charged with contempt of court for violating the restraining order . 
 In the primary , Rhea achieved a plurality of the votes , but not a majority . Chandler had the next highest vote total , and the two faced each other in a run @-@ off on September 7 , 1935 . In the run @-@ off , Chandler defeated Rhea , securing the nomination for governor . President Roosevelt , not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election , attempted to bring together the Laffoon and Chandler factions , but to little avail . Laffoon and Rhea , along with most of Laffoon 's administration , bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope . Despite losing the support of his predecessor , Chandler went on to win the general election . In his last days in office , Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others charged in connection with the National Guard 's interference with the primary in Harlan County . These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon , most of which were to relieve prison crowding .

 During his gubernatorial campaign , Laffoon had promised not to seek higher office if elected governor . Term @-@ limited by the state constitution , he returned to private life following his four years in office . On the day of Chandler 's inauguration , Laffoon said " I 'm going to Madisonville right after the inauguration , and I hope to get some clients at my law office by Wednesday morning . " 
 Shortly after Chandler 's inauguration , attorney general Beverly M. Vincent opined that Kentucky Colonel commissions expired at the end of the commissioning governor 's term . Laffoon vigorously defended the commissions he had issued and those issued by his predecessors . On April 27 , 1936 , when both Governor Chandler and Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson attended a baseball game in Cincinnati , President Pro Tem of the Senate James Eugene Wise was left as acting governor and recommissioned all 17 @,@ 000 existing colonels . 
 Laffoon was a member of the Democratic National Committee in 1936 , but decided not to attend the national convention . He chose Urey Woodson to serve as his proxy , but Woodson declined to attend as well and turned the proxy over to Fred M. Vinson . Laffoon also backed Senator M. M. Logan 's re @-@ election bid in 1936 . He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940 , and despite his differences with President Roosevelt during his gubernatorial term , he supported Roosevelt 's re @-@ election . 
 Defying a doctor 's order not to work for two weeks due to high blood pressure , Laffoon presided for three days as a special judge in the Union County Circuit Court in February 1941 . On February 17 , 1941 , he returned home early from his law office due to a bout of dizziness . It was reported that he had suffered a stroke , and after a mild improvement , his condition worsened again and he died on March 1 , 1941 , at 2 : 50 am . He was buried in Grapevine Cemetery in Madisonville . 
 = Eurovision Song Contest 2013 = 
 The Eurovision Song Contest 2013 was the 58th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest . It took place in Malmö , Sweden , following Loreen 's win at the 2012 contest in Baku , Azerbaijan with the song " Euphoria " . It was the fifth time that Sweden had hosted the contest , the last time being in 2000 . Sveriges Television ( SVT ) chose Malmö Arena as the venue following the consideration of several venues in Sweden . The host for the contest was Petra Mede . Thirty @-@ nine countries participated , including Armenia , which was last represented in 2011 . Bosnia and Herzegovina , Portugal , Slovakia and Turkey announced their withdrawal from the 2013 Contest . 
 The design of the contest was built around the theme " We Are One " – highlighting equality and unity of all the participating countries alongside the cultural diversity and influence of each participant . Compared to many of the previous contests in the history of Eurovision , rather than focusing on promoting its own country , Sweden chose to lay focus on the artists and their respective countries . The postcards presented before every song which have often been used to show the host country 's nature , culture and social life , were changed to show the typical everyday life of each individual artist in their home countries scattered around Europe . 
 The winner for 2013 was Denmark with the song " Only Teardrops " sung by Emmelie de Forest , which scored 281 points , beating Azerbaijan with a margin of 47 points . This makes it the second time that Denmark won on Swedish soil . Ukraine finished in third place and Norway in fourth , while Russia finished in fifth place . Out of the countries with the ' Big Five ' status , only Italy managed to finish in the top ten , coming seventh with 126 points , exactly double of remaining ones ' sum . The Netherlands finished ninth in their first participation in a final since 2004 . 170 million viewers watched the semifinals and final of the 2013 edition . For the first time since 1985 , no country of the former Yugoslav federation participated in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest . 
 This year was the first time adult Eurovision displayed the " Parade of Nations " , which already existed in Junior Eurovision since 2004 , an idea introduced by Sweden to become a new Eurovision tradition . The concept sees all countries performing in the Grand Final present themselves with their national flags before the contest begins . This year , the contestants entered the main stage by walking across a bridge over the audience . The idea was continued the following years by Denmark and Austria , the hosts of Eurovision 2014 and 2015 respectively .
