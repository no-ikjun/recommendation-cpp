 Though the film did bad business in the box office and gained negative reviews from critics , it garnered critical acclaim by viewers years after its release . By the next few years , it had a cult fan base . People started to appreciate the fact that it was the first Tamil movie to show Chola Dynasty 's history in motion picture . Even though the movie had not @-@ so @-@ nice graphics , it was started to be applauded for its epic storyline , screenplay and message . For the late acclaim , it was also compared to the Kamal Hassan classic Anbe Sivam .

 The film was launched in 2007 with Selvaraghavan 's regular music director , Yuvan Shankar Raja , following five successive successful albums together . However , Yuvan Shankar Raja was ousted from the project in March 2008 due to ' differences of opinion ' . Subsequently , G. V. Prakash Kumar was signed on for his biggest project to date and work for the soundtrack began again from scratch . The number <unk> , composed by Yuvan Shankar was removed from the album after his departure , and was replaced by the similarly sounding Un Mela <unk> , composed by Prakash Kumar . 
 The soundtrack to Aayirathil Oruvan was released on 14 June 2009 at a University Auditorium in Chennai , in a critically praised event . Prominent film personalities across the South Indian film industry attended the launch , which became one of the first films to play live music at the audio launch . The launch featured live performances from G. V. Prakash Kumar and Andrea Jeremiah for several songs , as well as songs from Selvaraghavan 's brother , Dhanush , and his wife , Aishwarya Dhanush . Furthermore , the night featured a fashion show from Erum Ali , a Kalari performance , <unk> <unk> by women from Kerala , a classical dance performance by actress <unk> and choreographed by <unk> . 
 The album features ten tunes ; six songs , two alternate versions and another two theme songs . The album featured vocals from singers Karthik , Vijay Yesudas , Bombay <unk> , <unk> Mahadevan and P. B. <unk> , who made a comeback to playback singing with his song . Moreover , husband @-@ wife personality , Dhanush and Aishwarya Dhanush , sung for the album along with the composer , Prakash Kumar and lead actress , Andrea Jeremiah . Lyrics for the songs were written by Vairamuthu , Veturi Sundararama Murthy , Selvaraghavan and Andrea Jeremiah . For a song set in the thirteenth century , research was carried out to find instruments used during that period . A <unk> , a melodic instrument used in the Sangam Period , and a horn , a brass instrument made from animal horns from Bhutan , were used . The soundtrack garnered critical acclaim and was considered Prakash Kumar 's finest work to date . Furthermore , shortly after the music release , an album success meet was held . 
 In the film , only five songs from the album are used in their entirety . Moreover , one song in the film , not included in the soundtrack , is the original version of <unk> Andha Paravai Pola from the 1965 film Aayirathil Oruvan , which was bought from the original copyright holders of the song in December 2007 . The film 's picturisation of the three exploring the ruins of the fallen kingdom in the song , were praised .

 = Moustache ( dog ) = 
 Moustache , sometimes abbreviated to <unk> , ( September 1799 â€“ 11 March 1812 ) was a French poodle who is reputed to have played a part in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars . His story is recounted in many publications but may be partly fictionalised . Moustache is said to have been born in Falaise , Normandy , France in 1799 and to have joined a grenadier regiment at Caen . He followed the regiment through the Italian Campaign of the Revolutionary Wars and is said to have alerted the regiment to a surprise night attack by Austrian forces . He is reported to have been present at the Battle of Marengo , during which he lost an ear , and with a cuirassier regiment at the Battle of Austerlitz . 
 At Austerlitz Moustache was apparently responsible for the discovery of an Austrian spy , and the recovery of the regiment 's standard from the Austrians . As a result of wounds taken at Austerlitz Moustache had a leg amputated and was reportedly rewarded with a medal by Marshal Jean Lannes . He is later said to have followed a unit of dragoons to Spain where he fought in several actions of the Peninsular War . Seeing action in the Sierra Morena and later , with a gunboat unit , at the Battle of Badajoz , where he was killed by a cannonball . Moustache was interred beneath a gravestone on the battlefield but his memorial is said to have been smashed and his bones burned after the war . 
 = = Historical sources = = 
 One of the earliest written accounts of Moustache 's life is that written by Arna Cano and published in The Kaleidoscope magazine of Liverpool in January 1826 . This , published twenty years after the dog 's death , may be partially fictionalised . A similar story is recounted in a detailed French @-@ language account written by Alain de Fivas and published in 1864 . Moustache is mentioned in at least eleven English , French and German publications . The story presented here is drawn largely from the Cano and de Fivas accounts and notes any disagreement with the other accounts . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Moustache , a black poodle , was born in Falaise in Normandy , France in approximately September 1799 . At the age of six months Cano states that he was sent to Caen to live with a grocer and whilst there encountered a group of grenadiers on parade . He goes on to say that Moustache followed behind the regiment , which had no other dogs , as it left the town and , on the approval of the drum major , was allowed to accompany the unit on campaign . The regiment was headed to Italy as part of the Italian Campaign fought by France against Austria during the French Revolutionary Wars . 
 Though Moustache was not a trained military dog , he apparently took to military life well , comfortably crossing the Great St Bernard Pass through the Alps with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte 's army in spring 1800 . It is during this stage that one of Moustache 's most famous actions is reputed to have taken place . Whilst the regiment was encamped near <unk> the Austrians are said to have mounted a surprise night attack on the camp in stormy weather conditions . It is claimed that Moustache noticed the approaching Austrian troops and barked to alert the grenadiers , who stood to , and repulsed the attack . 
 Other sources place this event as occurring in Alexandria , Egypt during the Egyptian campaign against the Ottoman Empire . This variant may have been inspired by Napoleon 's letter to General Auguste de Marmont just prior to the 1799 Battle of Abukir when Marmont was in Alexandria . It urged Marmont to provide an attack warning system by securing " a large quantity of dogs which can be made use of by posting them in front of your fortifications " . After this event , the Colonel of the grenadier regiment is said to have formally placed Moustache on the roll as a grenadier and gave him a collar bearing the regiment 's name . Additionally , he ordered that Moustache receive the field rations entitled to a grenadier and that he be combed by the unit 's barber once per week .

 = = = Battle of Marengo = = = 
 Both Cano and de Fivas say that whilst en route to <unk> Marengo Moustache took part in a small engagement between a company of his regiment and some Austrians . He was standing at the front of the company when he received a bayonet wound to his left shoulder . Moustache spent several days recovering in the hospital of the regimental surgeon . Though he was not fully recovered from the wound , still having a limp , Moustache is said to have taken to the field with the regiment on 14 June 1800 at the Battle of Marengo . During the battle he persistently barked at the Austrian forces and was only dissuaded from attacking them by their fixed bayonets . 
 Moustache did engage in close combat with one opponent - a pointer owned by an Austrian corporal that approached the French lines . De Fivas says that Moustache quickly pounced on the larger , stronger dog and fought with him for some time before a musket shot killed the pointer . Cano states that Moustache was also wounded by the shot , losing an ear . Moustache deserted the grenadiers shortly after the French victory at Marengo , apparently because one of them attempted to chain him to a sentry box , and instead joined a company of mounted cuirassiers . 
 = = = Battle of Austerlitz = = = 
 According to de Fivas , Moustache was responsible for the discovery of an Austrian spy in the French camp just prior to the Battle of Austerlitz . The dog is alleged to have leapt to his feet and barked at the Austrian to alert French soldiers . Some sources state that this event occurred around the time of the earlier battles of Marengo or Abukir . 
 Moustache 's greatest achievement is said to have taken place at Austerlitz . De Fivas states that Moustache went into battle with the cuirassiers and was present when the regimental standard bearer was surrounded by Austrian soldiers . The standard bearer apparently killed three Austrians before he was himself cut down , wrapping the flag around him as he fell to prevent its capture . It is at this point that de Fivas alleges that Moustache confronted the five or six remaining Austrians and was about to be bayoneted when the group was hit by a blast of artillery grapeshot . Moustache , wounded in the leg , is reputed to have torn the flag off the body of the standard bearer and returned it to the French camp . 
 In recognition of this action Marshal Jean Lannes is reported to have ordered that Moustache 's old collar be replaced with a copper medal on a piece of red ribbon . De Fivas states that this medal was engraved with the words " II <unk> une jambe Ã  la bataille d 'Austerlitz , et <unk> le <unk> de son rÃ©giment " on the front , and " Moustache , chien franÃ§ais : qu 'il soit <unk> <unk> et <unk> comme un brave " on the reverse , which translates to " He lost a leg at the Battle of Austerlitz and saved the regimental flag " and " Moustache , A French dog : Everywhere respected and cherished as a hero " respectively . At least one other source says instead that the medal was silver and had a tricolore collar . 
 Moustache later had to have his wounded leg amputated . Other rewards he is said to have received for this event include an order being issued that whichever regiment he presented himself at would have to feed him the rations of a serving soldier and that he was placed on the regimental books and was to receive the pay and rations of a soldier . A further legend says that Moustache was presented to Napoleon himself and demonstrated to have performed a trick whereby he would cock his leg whenever France 's enemies were mentioned . 
 = = = Battle of Essling = = = 
 At the Battle of Essling , Moustache was supposed to have found a mate . Upon joining the front lines , a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy . During the course of the battle , the two met and the female Poodle accompanied Moustache back to the French camp . This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp . 
 = = Spanish campaign = = 
 Moustache is said to have left the cuirassiers after he was struck by a cavalryman with the flat of his sword . De Fivas says that he attached himself to a unit of dragoons which he followed to Spain , taking part in two campaigns with them during which he would walk ahead of their column and bark warnings whenever he heard a noise . During a battle in the Sierra Morena mountain range in southern Spain Moustache is alleged to have led back to camp the horses of dragoons killed on the battlefield . Shortly after this he is said to have been secretly taken by a Colonel who wished to own him . After spending seventeen days in captivity the dog apparently escaped by an open window and joined with a gunboat crew . Afterwards he participated in the Battle of Badajoz where he was struck by a cannonball and killed on 11 March 1812 , at the age of twelve years . 
 Moustache was reputedly buried on the battlefield alongside his medal and ribbon with a gravestone engraved with the words " Ici repose le brave Moustache " ( " Here lies the brave Moustache " ) . Though he was wounded many times in his life it is said that all of his wounds were to his front . After the allied victory over the French in the Peninsular War , it is alleged that the Spanish destroyed his gravestone and the Inquisition ordered his bones to be dug up and burned .

 = Russian battleship Navarin = 
 Navarin ( Russian : <unk> ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1880s and early 1890s . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and spent the early part of her career deployed in the Mediterranean and in the Far East . She participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 before returning to the Baltic Fleet in 1901 . Several months after the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in February 1904 , she was assigned to the 2nd Pacific Squadron to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur . During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 , she was sunk by Japanese destroyers which spread twenty @-@ four linked mines across her path during the night . Navarin struck two of these mines and capsized with the loss of most of her crew . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Navarin was a low @-@ freeboard turret ship modeled on the British Trafalgar @-@ class battleships . The original requirement had been for a much smaller ship , but the Navy changed its mind and required a larger ship capable of operating " in all European seas and [ even be ] able by its coal capacity to reach the Far East . " Changes were made to the design after the ship was ordered that included the replacement of the main armament by more powerful guns of the same caliber and the increase in the secondary armament from six guns to eight . 
 The ship was 347 feet 6 inches ( 105 @.@ 9 m ) long at the waterline and 351 feet ( 107 @.@ 0 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 67 feet ( 20 @.@ 4 m ) and a draught of 27 feet 7 inches ( 8 @.@ 4 m ) . She displaced 10 @,@ 206 long tons ( 10 @,@ 370 t ) , almost 800 long tons ( 810 t ) more than her designed displacement of 9 @,@ 476 long tons ( 9 @,@ 628 t ) . Navarin 's crew consisted of 24 officers and 417 enlisted men . 
 She had two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft . They had a total designed output of 9 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 700 kW ) using steam provided by 12 cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers at a pressure of 9 @.@ 4 atm ( 952 kPa ; 138 psi ) . The four boiler rooms were arranged in two pairs abreast , each of which had its own funnel . This unusual arrangement gave the ship her odd nickname of Factory ( Zavod ) . Trials of the first batch of boilers in May 1891 showed that they could not maintain the designed steam pressure due to flaws in their construction . The Navy demanded that the Franco @-@ Russian Works replace them with new boilers at its own expense , but tests of the new boilers in August 1893 showed that their production of steam was inadequate . The factory asked for a year 's time to rectify the problems which the Navy granted since the construction of the ship was behind schedule anyway . On her final set of sea trials in November 1895 she reached a top speed of 15 @.@ 85 knots ( 29 @.@ 35 km / h ; 18 @.@ 24 mph ) . Navarin carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 200 t ) of coal at full load that provided a range of 3 @,@ 050 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 650 km ; 3 @,@ 510 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of two pairs of 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Obukhov Model 1886 35 @-@ caliber guns mounted in hydraulically powered twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft . The forward turret had a firing arc of 243 Â° while the rear turret could traverse 214 Â° . The guns had a rate of fire of two minutes 22 seconds between rounds . They fired a 731 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 331 @.@ 7 kg ) " light " shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 090 ft / s ( 640 m / s ) to a range of 6 @,@ 600 yards ( 6 @,@ 000 m ) at an elevation of 6 Â° . 80 rounds per gun were carried . All eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Pattern 1877 35 @-@ caliber guns of the secondary armament were mounted in casemates in the superstructure . Their " light " shells weighed 91 @.@ 5 lb ( 41 @.@ 5 kg ) and had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 329 ft / s ( 710 m / s ) . They had a maximum range of 8 @,@ 170 yards ( 7 @,@ 470 m ) when fired at an elevation of 12 Â° . Each gun was provided with 200 rounds of ammunition . 
 The anti @-@ torpedo boat armament included fourteen 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns were carried in the superstructure . They fired a 3 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 476 ft / s ( 450 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 2 @,@ 020 yards ( 1 @,@ 850 m ) . A total of eight 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the fighting top , the other four guns may have been used to arm the ship 's boats . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 450 ft / s ( 440 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 3 @,@ 038 yards ( 2 @,@ 778 m ) . 
 Navarin carried six above water 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one each in the bow and stern and two pairs of broadside tubes . The ship carried a total of 12 torpedoes . The Type L torpedo carried a 141 @-@ pound ( 64 kg ) warhead of TNT . It had two speed settings which gave it a maximum range of 980 yards ( 900 m ) at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) or 660 yards ( 600 m ) at 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) . 
 The ship used compound armor for all armored vertical surfaces except for the gun turrets which were made from nickel steel . The maximum thickness of the waterline armor belt was 16 inches ( 406 mm ) which reduced to 12 â€“ 14 inches ( 305 â€“ 356 mm ) abreast the magazines . It covered 228 feet ( 69 @.@ 5 m ) of the ship 's length and was 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high , and tapered down to a thickness of 8 inches ( 203 mm ) at the bottom edge . The upper 18 inches ( 457 @.@ 2 mm ) of the belt was intended to be above the waterline , but the ship was significantly overweight and much of the belt was submerged . The belt terminated in 14 â€“ 16 @-@ inch ( 356 â€“ 406 mm ) transverse bulkheads . 
 The lower casemate was above the belt , 218 feet ( 66 @.@ 4 m ) long and 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high , and was intended to protect the bases of the turrets . It had 16 @-@ inch sides and was closed off by 16 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft . The upper casemate protected the six @-@ inch guns and was 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick on all sides . The sides of the turrets were 16 inches ( 406 mm ) thick and the conning tower 's sides were 12 inches ( 305 mm ) in thickness . The armor deck was 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick over the lower casemate , but 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick forward and aft of the main armor belt to the bow and stern . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Navarin , named after the Battle of Navarino , was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco @-@ Russian Works and construction began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard . The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891 . She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out , but did not enter service until June 1896 at a cost of over nine million rubles . Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of armor plates , the gun mountings , and other components , compounded by inefficiencies in building . One example of such was that the Russian armor plate company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness , but the builder somehow lost track of this fact and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond . 
 Navarin was assigned to the Baltic fleet and began a cruise to the Mediterranean Sea in August 1896 . She visited the Greek port of Piraeus on 1 October . Together with the battleship Sissoi Veliky , the ship was ordered to the Far East in early 1898 and arrived at Port Arthur on 28 March . She took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion two years later . Navarin and Sissoi Veliky , together with a number of cruisers , sailed for the Baltic on 25 December 1901 and arrived at the port of Libau in early May 1902 . She began a refit the following September that was interrupted by the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in February 1904 . During this refit , Navarin received 4 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) Barr & Stroud rangefinders , telescopic gun sights and Telefunken radio equipment . Her light armament was increased by four 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns that displaced an equal number of 47 @-@ millimeter guns on top of the superstructure ; one of the displaced guns was mounted on each of the turret roofs . 
 On 15 October 1904 , she set sail for Port Arthur from Libau along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron , under the command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky . When his ships reached the port of Tangier , Morocco , on 28 October , Rozhestvensky split his forces and ordered his older ships , including Navarin and Sissoi Veliky , to proceed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to rendezvous with him in Madagascar as previously planned . Under the command of Rear Admiral Dmitry von FÃ¶lkersam , they departed that night and reached Souda Bay , Crete , a week later and Port Said , Egypt two weeks after that . The two forces reunited at the island of Nosy Be on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements . The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May . 
 Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships into three divisions ; the first consisted of the four new Borodino @-@ class battleships commanded by himself , von FÃ¶lkersam commanded the second division of the battleships Oslyabya , Navarin , Sissoi Veliky and the armored cruiser Admiral Nakhimov , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the third division . Von FÃ¶lkersam , ill with cancer , died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet in order to keep morale up . The captain of Oslyabya became the commander of the 2nd Division while Nebogatov had no idea that he was now the squadron 's <unk> second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 Very little is known of Navarin 's actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27 â€“ 28 May as there were very few survivors from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle . The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during the early part of the battle , but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle . She was hit four times by large @-@ caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft . Her quarterdeck was awash up to her rear 12 @-@ inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced to stop for repairs . Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits . Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly enough that she sank later that night . Around 0200 on 28 May , the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her . These consisted of four mines linked together with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship . Two of these mines struck Navarin , which quickly capsized and sank . Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank , but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later . One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship . The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost . The rescued men had said that when they called out for help , they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats . 
 = Mu Arae = 
 Mu Arae ( abbreviated Î¼ Arae , Î¼ Ara ) , often designated HD <unk> , also named Cervantes , is a main sequence G @-@ type star approximately 50 light @-@ years away from the Sun in the constellation of Ara . The star has a planetary system with four known extrasolar planets ( designated Mu Arae b , c , d and e ; later named Quijote , Dulcinea , Rocinante and Sancho , respectively ) , three of them with masses comparable to that of Jupiter . The system 's innermost planet was the first ' hot Neptune ' or ' super @-@ Earth ' to be discovered . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 Mu Arae is the Bayer designation . HD <unk> is the entry in the Henry Draper Catalogue . 
 The established convention for extrasolar planets is that the planets receive designations consisting of the star 's name followed by lower @-@ case Roman letters starting from " b " , in order of discovery . This system was used by a team led by Krzysztof <unk> . On the other hand , a team led by Francesco Pepe proposed a modification of the designation system , where the planets are designated in order of characterization . Since the parameters of the outermost planet were poorly constrained before the introduction of the 4 @-@ planet model of the system , this results in a different order of designations for the planets in the Mu Arae system . Both systems agree on the designation of the 640 @-@ day planet as " b " . The old system designates the 9 @-@ day planet as " d " , the 310 @-@ day planet as " e " and the outer planet as " c " . Since the International Astronomical Union has not defined an official system for designations of extrasolar planets , the issue of which convention is ' correct ' remains open , however subsequent scientific publications about this system appear to have adopted the Pepe et al. system , as has the system 's entry in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning names were Cervantes for this star and Quijote , Dulcinea , Rocinante and Sancho , for its planets ( b , c , d , and e , respectively ; the IAU used the Pepe et al system ) . 
 The winning names were those submitted by the <unk> de Pamplona , Spain . Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ( 1547 @-@ 1616 ) was a famous Spanish writer and author of El <unk> Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha . The planets are named after characters of that novel : Quijote was the lead character ; Dulcinea his love interest ; Rocinante his horse , and Sancho his squire . 
 = = Stellar characteristics = = 
 According to measurements made by the Hipparcos astrometric satellite , Mu Arae exhibits a parallax of 64 @.@ 47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun . When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun , this means the star is located at a distance of 50 @.@ 6 light years ( 15 @.@ 51 parsecs ) . Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of + 5 @.@ 12 and is visible to the naked eye . 
 <unk> analysis of the star reveals it is approximately 10 % more massive than the Sun and significantly older , at around 6 @.@ 34 billion years . The radius of the star is 36 % greater than that of the Sun and it is 90 % more luminous . The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of our Sun and is therefore described as metal @-@ rich . Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium . 
 Mu Arae has a listed spectral type of <unk> â€“ V. The G3 part means the star is similar to our Sun ( a G2V star ) . The star may be entering the subgiant stage of its evolution as it starts to run out of hydrogen in its core . This is reflected in its uncertain luminosity class , between IV ( the <unk> ) and V ( main sequence dwarf star stars like the Sun ) .

 = = = Discovery = = = 
 In 2001 , an extrasolar planet was announced by the Anglo @-@ Australian Planet Search team , together with the planet orbiting Epsilon Reticuli . The planet , designated Mu Arae b , was thought to be in a highly eccentric orbit of around 743 days . The discovery was made by analysing variations in the star 's radial velocity ( measured by observing the Doppler shift of the star 's spectral lines ) as a result of being pulled around by the planet 's gravity . Further observations revealed the presence of a second object in the system ( now designated as Mu Arae e ) , which was published in 2004 . At the time , the parameters of this planet were poorly constrained and it was thought to be in an orbit of around 8 @.@ 2 years with a high eccentricity . Later in 2004 , a small inner planet designated Mu Arae c was announced with a mass comparable to that of Uranus in a 9 @-@ day orbit . This was the first of the class of planets known as " hot Neptunes " to be discovered . The discovery was made by making high @-@ precision radial velocity measurements with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher ( HARPS ) spectrograph . 
 In 2006 , two teams , one led by Krzysztof <unk> and the other by Francesco Pepe independently announced four @-@ planet models for the radial velocity measurements of the star , with a new planet ( Mu Arae d ) in a near @-@ circular orbit lasting approximately 311 days . The new model gives revised parameters for the previously known planets , with lower eccentricity orbits than in the previous model and including a more robust characterization of the orbit of Mu Arae e . The discovery of the fourth planet made Mu Arae the second known four @-@ planet extrasolar system , after 55 Cancri . 
 = = = System architecture and habitability = = = 
 The Mu Arae system consists of an inner Uranus @-@ mass planet in a tight 9 @-@ day orbit and three massive planets , probably gas giants , on wide , near @-@ circular orbits , which contrasts with the high @-@ eccentricity orbits typically observed for long @-@ period extrasolar planets . The Uranus @-@ mass planet may be a chthonian planet , the core of a gas giant which has had its outer layers stripped away by stellar radiation . Alternatively it may have formed in the inner regions of the Mu Arae system as a rocky " super @-@ Earth " . The inner gas giants " d " and " b " are located close to the 2 : 1 orbital resonance which causes them to undergo strong interactions . The best @-@ fit solution to the system is actually unstable : simulations suggest the system is destroyed after 78 million years , which is significantly shorter than the estimated age of the star system . More stable solutions , including ones in which the two planets are actually in the resonance ( similar to the situation in the Gliese 876 system ) can be found which give only a slightly worse fit to the data . Searches for circumstellar discs show no evidence for a debris disc similar to the Kuiper belt around Mu Arae . If Mu Arae does have a Kuiper belt , it is too faint to be detected with current instruments . 
 The gas giant planet " b " is located in the liquid water habitable zone of Mu Arae . This would prevent an Earth @-@ like planet from forming in the habitable zone , however large moons of the gas giant could potentially support liquid water . On the other hand , it is unclear whether such massive moons could actually form around a gas giant planet , thanks to an apparent scaling law between the mass of the planet and its satellite system . In addition , measurements of the star 's ultraviolet flux suggest that any potentially habitable planets or moons may not receive enough ultraviolet to trigger the formation of biomolecules . Planet " d " would receive a similar amount of ultraviolet to the Earth and thus lies in the ultraviolet habitable zone , however , it would be too hot for any moons to support surface liquid water .

 The Silkie ( sometimes spelled Silky ) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage , which is said to feel like silk , and satin . The breed has several other unusual qualities , such as black skin and bones , blue earlobes , and five toes on each foot , whereas most chickens only have four . They are often exhibited in poultry shows , and appear in various colors . In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics , Silkies are well known for their calm , friendly temperament . It is among the most docile of poultry . Hens are also exceptionally broody , and care for young well . Though they are fair layers themselves , laying only about three eggs a week , they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature . 
 = = History = = 
 It is unknown exactly where or when fowl with their singular combination of attributes first appeared , but the most well documented point of origin is ancient China ( hence another occasionally encountered name for the bird , Chinese silk chicken ) . Other places in Southeast Asia have been named as possibilities , such as India and Java . The earliest surviving written account of Silkies comes from Marco Polo , who wrote of a " furry chicken " in the 13th century during his travels in Asia . In 1598 , Ulisse Aldrovandi , a writer and naturalist at the University of Bologna , Italy , published a comprehensive treatise on chickens which is still read and admired today . In it , he spoke on " wool @-@ bearing chickens " and ones " clothed with hair like that of a black cat " . 
 Silkies most likely made their way to the West via the Silk Route and maritime trade . The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874 . Once Silkies became more common in the West , many myths were perpetuated about them . Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits , while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur . 
 In the 21st century , Silkies are one of the most popular and ubiquitous ornamental breeds of chicken . They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers , and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like ducks and geese and game birds such as quail and pheasants . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Silkies are considered a bantam breed in some countries , but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl ; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time . Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam @-@ sized , but in Europe the standard @-@ sized is the original version . However , even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens , with the males weighing only four pounds ( 1 @.@ 8 kg ) , and females weighing three pounds ( 1 @.@ 36 kg ) . The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 ounces ( 1 kg ) , and females that are 32 ounces ( 910 grams ) . 
 Silkie plumage was once unique among chicken breeds , however in recent years <unk> feathering has been developed in several breeds , mostly notably the <unk> , where it is now standardised in Britain and the Netherlands . It has been compared to silk , and to fur . The overall result is a soft , fluffy appearance . Their feathers lack functioning barbicels , and are thus similar to down on other birds . This characteristic leaves Silkies unable to fly . 
 Silkies appear in two distinct varieties : bearded and non @-@ bearded . Bearded Silkies have an extra muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes . They also are separated according to color . Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black , blue , buff , grey , partridge , and white . Alternative hues , such as cuckoo , lavender , red , and splash also exist . The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut @-@ colored comb , dark wattles , and turquoise @-@ blue earlobes . In addition to these defining characteristics , Silkies have five toes on each foot . Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking , <unk> , and Sultan . 
 All Silkies have black skin , bones and grayish @-@ black meat ; their Chinese language name is wu gu ji ( <unk> ) , meaning ' black @-@ boned chicken ' . Melanism which extends beyond the skin into an animal 's connective tissue is a rare trait , and in chickens it is caused by <unk> , which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia . The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation . Disregarding color , the breed does not generally produce as much as the more common meat breeds of chicken . 
 Silkies lay a fair number of eggs , of a cream color , but production is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody ; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year . Their capacity for incubation , which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production , is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds . In addition to being good mothers , Silkies are universally renowned for their calm , friendly temperament . They do well in confinement , and interact very well with children . This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks . 
 = = = Bantams = = = 
 In the American Standard of Perfection , the standard male weight for the bantam Silkie is 1 kg ( 36 oz ) and for the female , 907 g ( 32 oz ) . The Australian Poultry Standard and British Poultry Standard call for Silkie bantams much smaller ; in the Australian , the standard weights are 680 g ( 25 oz ) for males and 570 g ( 20 oz ) for females . The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g ( 22 oz ) for males , and 500 g for females ( 18 oz ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Silkies are also known for their polydactyly , usually manifesting as an additional 1 @-@ 2 digits in the foot . The genetic cause of this extra digit formation has been shown to be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene , called the <unk> Regulatory Sequence ( <unk> ) . This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud , leading to increased tissue growth and digits . Interestingly , while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly , the wings have the standard <unk> ( three digit ) arrangement . The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo , but these are lost prior to hatching . The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed , which is due to ectopic <unk> expression in the AER , with ectopic SHH a secondary effect . 
 = = In cuisine = = 
 The black meat of a Silkie is generally considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines . In contrast , several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food . Chinese cuisine especially values the breed , but it is also a common ingredient in some Japanese , Cambodian , Vietnamese and Korean dishes . Areas where Chinese cuisine has been a strong influence , such as Malaysia , may also cook Silkie . As early as the 7th century , traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food . The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make broth , braising , and in curries . Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as <unk> , <unk> <unk> ( mountain yam ) , orange peel , and fresh ginger . A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine , such as in confit . 
 = Bulk carrier = 
 A bulk carrier , bulk freighter , or bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport <unk> bulk cargo , such as grains , coal , ore , and cement in its cargo holds . Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852 , economic forces have fuelled the development of these ships , causing them to grow in size and sophistication . Today 's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity , safety , efficiency , and durability . 
 Today , bulkers make up 15 % - 17 % of the world 's merchant fleets and range in size from single @-@ hold mini @-@ bulkers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400 @,@ 000 metric tons of deadweight ( DWT ) . A number of specialized designs exist : some can unload their own cargo , some depend on port facilities for unloading , and some even package the cargo as it is loaded . Over half of all bulkers have Greek , Japanese , or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama . South Korea is the largest single builder of bulkers , and 82 % of these ships were built in Asia . 
 A bulk carrier 's crew participates in the loading and unloading of cargo , navigating the ship , and keeping its machinery and equipment properly maintained . Loading and unloading the cargo is difficult , dangerous , and can take up to 120 hours on larger ships . Crews can range in size from three people on the smallest ships to over 30 on the largest . 
 Bulk cargo can be very dense , corrosive , or abrasive . This can present safety problems : cargo shifting , spontaneous combustion , and cargo saturation can threaten a ship . The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems has been linked to a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s , as have the bulker 's large hatchways , important for efficient cargo handling . New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection , and to streamline the process of abandoning ship . 
 = = Definition = = 
 There are various ways to define the term bulk carrier . As of 1999 , the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as " a ship constructed with a single deck , top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk ; an ore carrier ; or a combination carrier . " However , most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry <unk> goods . <unk> cargo ships can carry bulk cargo , but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage . The term " dry bulk carrier " is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil , chemical , or liquefied petroleum gas carriers . Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships , and they are often classified based more on the ship 's use than its design . 
 A number of abbreviations are used to describe bulkers . " OBO " describes a bulker which carries a combination of ore , bulk , and oil , and " O / O " is used for combination oil and ore carriers . The terms " <unk> , " " <unk> , " " <unk> , " and " <unk> " for very large and ultra large ore and bulk carriers were adapted from the supertanker designations very large crude carrier and ultra large crude carrier . 
 = = History = = 
 Before specialized bulk carriers existed , shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship . In the first method , longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks , stacked the sacks onto pallets , and put the pallets into the cargo hold with a crane . The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend time and money to build plywood bins into the holds . Then , to guide the cargo through the small hatches , wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed . These methods were slow and labor @-@ intensive . As with the container ship , the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier . 
 Specialized bulk carriers began to appear as steam @-@ powered ships became more popular . The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852 . She featured a metal hull , a steam engine , and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags . These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market . The first self @-@ <unk> was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes . This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo . The first bulkers with diesel propulsion began to appear in 1911 . 
 Before World War II , the international shipping demand for bulk products was low â€” about 25 million tons for metal ores â€” and most of this trade was coastal . However , on the Great Lakes , bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills . In 1929 , 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes , and an almost equal amount of coal , limestone , and other products were also moved . Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging : the double bottom , which was adopted in 1890 , and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks , which was introduced in 1905 . After World War II , an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations , particularly between the European countries , the United States and Japan . Due to the economics of this trade , ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized . In this period , Great Lakes freighters increased in size , to maximize economies of scale , and self @-@ <unk> became more common to cut turnaround time . The thousand @-@ footers of the Great Lakes fleets , built in the 1970s , were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979 , a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes . 
 = = Categories = = 
 = = = Size categories = = = 
 Bulkers are segregated into six major size categories : small , <unk> , <unk> , panamax , capesize , and very large . Very large bulk and ore carriers fall into the capesize category but are often considered separately . 
 = = = = Categories as per Regions = = = = 
 Categories occur in regional trade , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> also appear in regional trade . 
 " <unk> " : Maximum length overall 229 meters refers to a new type of ships , larger than panamax , that are suitable for berthing at the Port of <unk> ( Republic of Guinea ) , where the major loading terminal of bauxite is restricted to vessels not more than 229 meters . 
 " <unk> " : Maximum beam 50 meters , and maximum length overall of 300 meters Refers to the largest vessel able to enter the port of Newcastle , Australia at about 185 @,@ 000 DWT 
 " <unk> " : About 203 @,@ 000 DWT , being the largest vessels able to navigate the <unk> Sea , Japan 
 " <unk> " : LOA 226 m max / 7 @.@ 92 m draft . Refers to the largest vessel that can pass through the canal locks of the St Lawrence Seaway ( Great lakes , Canada ) 
 " <unk> " : LOA 330 m / 20 m draft / 300 @,@ 000 DWT , Refers to the largest vessel that can pass through the Straits of Malacca . 
 " <unk> " : Maximum allowable beam = 45 m / LOA 289 m. max ( 175 @,@ 000 DWT approx ) for the eastern harbour lock in the Port of Dunkirk ( France ) 
 Mini @-@ bulkers are prevalent in the category of small vessels with a capacity of under 10 @,@ 000 DWT . Mini @-@ bulkers carry from 500 to 2 @,@ 500 tons , have a single hold , and are designed for river transport . They are often built to be able to pass under bridges and have small crews of three to eight people . 
 Handysize and Handymax ships are general purpose in nature . These two segments represent 71 % of all bulk carriers over 10 @,@ 000 DWT and also have the highest rate of growth . This is partly due to new regulations coming into effect which put greater constraints on the building of larger vessels . Handymax ships are typically 150 â€“ 200 m in length and 52 @,@ 000 â€“ 58 @,@ 000 DWT with five cargo holds and four cranes . These ships are also general purpose in nature . 
 The size of a Panamax vessel is limited by the Panama canal 's lock chambers , which can accommodate ships with a beam of up to 32 @.@ 31 m , a length overall of up to 294 @.@ 13 m , and a draft of up to 12 @.@ 04 m . 
 Capesize ships are too large to traverse the Panama canal and must round Cape Horn to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans . Earlier , capesize ships could not traverse the Suez and needed to go around the Cape of Good Hope . Recent deepening of the Suez canal to 66 ft ( 20 m ) permits most capesize ships to pass through it . 
 Capesize bulkers are specialized : 93 % of their cargo is iron ore and coal . Some ships on the Great Lakes Waterway exceed Panamax dimensions but they are limited to use on the Great Lakes as they cannot pass through the smaller St. Lawrence Seaway to the ocean . Very large ore carriers and very large bulk carriers are a subset of the capesize category reserved for vessels over 200 @,@ 000 DWT . Carriers of this size are almost always designed to carry iron ore .

 The world 's bulk transport has reached immense proportions : in 2005 , 1 @.@ 7 billion metric tons of coal , iron ore , grain , bauxite , and phosphate was transported by ship . Today , the world 's bulker fleet includes 6 @,@ 225 ships of over 10 @,@ 000 DWT , and represent 40 % of all ships in terms of tonnage and 39 @.@ 4 % in terms of vessels . Including smaller ships , bulkers have a total combined capacity of almost 346 million DWT . Combined carriers are a very small portion of the fleet , representing less than 3 % of this capacity . The lake freighters of the Great Lakes , with 98 ships of 3 @.@ 2 million total DWT , despite forming a small fraction of the total fleet by tonnage and only operating 10 months a year , carried a tenth of the world 's bulk cargo because of the short trip distance and fast turnarounds . 
 As of 2005 , the average bulker was just over 13 years old . About 41 % of all bulkers were less than ten years old , 33 % were over twenty years old , and the remaining 26 % were between ten and twenty years of age . All of the 98 bulkers registered in the Great Lakes trade are over 20 years old and the oldest still sailing in 2009 was 106 years old .

 As of 2005 , the United States Maritime Administration counted 6 @,@ 225 bulkers of 10 @,@ 000 DWT or greater worldwide . More bulkers are registered in Panama , with 1 @,@ 703 ships , than any four other flag states combined . In terms of the number of bulk carriers registered , the top five flag states also include Hong Kong with 492 ships , Malta ( 435 ) , Cyprus ( 373 ) , and China ( 371 ) . Panama also dominates bulker registration in terms of deadweight tonnage . Positions two through five are held by Hong Kong , Greece , Malta , and Cyprus .

 Greece , Japan , and China are the top three owners of bulk carriers , with 1 @,@ 326 , 1 @,@ 041 , and 979 vessels respectively . These three nations account for over 53 % of the world 's fleet . 
 Several companies have large private bulker fleets . The multinational company <unk> Holding Ltd. has over 70 bulkers . The <unk> Group in Canada operates a fleet of over 80 bulkers , including two designed to work in Arctic ice . Croatia 's <unk> <unk> d.d. has a fleet of 14 bulkers . The H. <unk> Group in Hamburg , Germany operates a fleet of 19 bulkers . <unk> in Portugal , owns 10 bulkers . <unk> <unk> in Denmark and Elcano in Spain also own notable bulker fleets . Other companies specialize in mini @-@ bulker operations : England 's Stephenson Clarke Shipping Limited owns a fleet of eight mini @-@ bulkers and five small Handysize bulkers , and <unk> Management and Agency Inc. in Turkey owns a fleet of seven mini @-@ bulkers .

The People 's Republic of China , with large shipyards such as Dalian , <unk> , and Shanghai <unk> , ranked third , with 509 ships . Taiwan , with shipyards such as China Shipbuilding Corporation , ranked fourth , accounting for 129 ships . Shipyards in these top four countries built over 82 % of the bulkers afloat . 
 = = = Freight charges = = = 
 Several factors affect the cost to move a bulk cargo by ship . The bulk freight market is very volatile , and it fluctuates , along with the type of cargo , the ship 's size , and the route traveled all affect the final price . Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $ 15 to $ 25 per ton in 2005 . Hauling a panamax @-@ sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $ 40 per ton to as much as $ 70 per ton . 
 Some shippers choose instead to charter a ship , paying a daily rate instead of a set price per ton . In 2005 , the average daily rate for a Handymax ship varied between $ 18 @,@ 000 â€“ $ 30 @,@ 000 . A Panamax ship could be chartered for $ 20 @,@ 000 â€“ $ 50 @,@ 000 per day , and a Capesize for $ 40 @,@ 000 â€“ $ 70 @,@ 000 per day . 
 = = = Ship breaking = = = 
 Generally , ships are removed from the fleet go through a process known as ship breaking or scrapping . Ship @-@ owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship 's empty weight ( called light ton displacement or LDT ) and prices in the scrap metal market . In 1998 , almost 700 ships were scrapped in places like Alang , India and Chittagong , Bangladesh . This is often done by ' beaching ' the ship on open sand , then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches , a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities , as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos , lead , and various chemicals . Half a million deadweight tons of worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004 , accounting for 4 @.@ 7 % of the year 's scrapping . That year , bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices , between $ 340 and $ 350 per LDT . 
 = = Operation = = 
 = = = Crew = = = 
 The crew on a bulker typically consists of 20 to 30 people , though smaller ships can be handled by 8 . The crew includes the captain or master , the deck department , the engineering department , and the steward 's department . The practice of taking passengers aboard cargo ships , once almost universal , is very rare today and almost non @-@ existent on bulkers . 
 During the 1990s , bulkers were involved in an alarming number of shipwrecks . This led ship @-@ owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew 's effectiveness and competence . The study showed that crew performance aboard bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied . Among bulker crews , the best performance was found aboard younger and larger ships . Crews on better @-@ maintained ships performed better , as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken . 
 Fewer deck officers are employed on bulkers than on similarly sized ships of other types . A mini @-@ bulker carries two to three deck officers , while larger Handysize and Capesize bulkers carry four . Liquid natural gas tankers of the same size have an additional deck officer and unlicensed mariner . 
 = = = Voyages = = = 
 A bulker 's voyages are determined by market forces ; routes and cargoes often vary . A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route . Aboard a coastal carrier in the tramp trade , the crew will often not know the next port of call until the cargo is fully loaded . 
 Because bulk cargo is so difficult to discharge , bulkers spend more time in port than other ships . A study of mini @-@ bulkers found that it takes , on average , twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it . A mini @-@ bulker spends 55 hours at a time in port , compared to 35 hours for a lumber carrier of similar size . This time in port increases to 74 hours for Handymax and 120 hours for Panamax vessels . Compared with the 12 @-@ hour turnarounds common for container ships , 15 @-@ hour turnarounds for car carriers , and 26 @-@ hour turnarounds for large tankers , bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore . 
 = = = Loading and unloading = = = 
 Loading and unloading a bulker is time @-@ consuming and dangerous . The process is planned by the ship 's chief mate under the direct and continued supervision of ship 's captain . International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin . Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations . Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier . 
 The loading method used depends on both the cargo and the equipment available on the ship and on the dock . In the least advanced ports , cargo can be loaded with shovels or bags poured from the hatch cover . This system is being replaced with faster , less labor @-@ intensive methods . Double @-@ articulation cranes , which can load at a rate of 1 @,@ 000 tons per hour , represent a widely used method , and the use of shore @-@ based gantry cranes , reaching 2 @,@ 000 tons per hour , is growing . A crane 's discharge rate is limited by the bucket 's capacity ( from 6 to 40 tons ) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load , deposit it at the terminal , and to return to take the next . For modern gantry cranes , the total time of the grab @-@ deposit @-@ return cycle is about 50 seconds . 
 Conveyor belts offer a very efficient method of loading , with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700 tons per hour , although the most advanced ports can offer rates of 16 @,@ 000 tons per hour . Start @-@ up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts , though , are complicated and require time to carry out . Self @-@ discharging ships use conveyor belts with load rates of around 1 @,@ 000 tons per hour . 
 Once the cargo is discharged , the crew begins to clean the holds . This is particularly important if the next cargo is of a different type . The immense size of cargo holds and the tendency of cargoes to be physically irritating add to the difficulty of cleaning the holds . When the holds are clean , the process of loading begins . 
 It is crucial to keep the cargo level during loading in order to maintain stability . As the hold is filled , machines such as excavators and bulldozers are often used to keep the cargo in check . Leveling is particularly important when the hold is only partly full , since cargo is more likely to shift . Extra precautions are taken , such as adding longitudinal divisions and securing wood atop the cargo . If a hold is full , a technique called <unk> is used , which involves digging out a 6 feet ( 2 m ) hole below the hatch cover and filling it with bagged cargo or weights . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 A bulk carrier 's design is largely defined by the cargo it will carry . The cargo 's density , also known as its stowage factor , is the key factor . Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0 @.@ 6 tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3 tons per cubic meter for iron ore . 
 The overall cargo weight is the limiting factor in the design of an ore carrier , since the cargo is so dense . Coal carriers , on the other hand , are limited by overall volume , since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft . 
 For a given tonnage , the second factor which governs the ship 's dimensions is the size of the ports and waterways it will travel to . For example , a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft . For most designs , the ratio of length @-@ to @-@ width ranges between 5 and 7 , with an average of 6 @.@ 2 . The ratio of length @-@ to @-@ height will be between 11 and 12 . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The engine room on a bulker is usually near the stern , under the superstructure . Larger bulkers , from Handymax up , usually have a single two @-@ stroke low @-@ speed <unk> diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed @-@ pitch propeller . Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and / or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft . On the smaller bulkers , one or two four @-@ stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable @-@ pitch propeller via a reduction gearbox , which may also incorporate an output for an alternator . The average design ship speed for bulkers of Handysize and above is 13 @.@ 5 â€“ 15 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 â€“ 27 @.@ 8 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 â€“ 17 @.@ 3 mph ) . The propeller speed is relatively low , at about 90 revolutions per minute , although it depends on the size of the propeller . 
 As a result of the 1973 oil crisis , the 1979 energy crisis , and the resulting rise in oil prices , experimental designs using coal to fuel ships were tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s . The Australian National Lines ( <unk> ) constructed two 74 @,@ 700 @-@ ton coal @-@ burner ships called the River Boyne and River <unk> along with two constructed by TNT called TNT <unk> and TNT <unk> and renamed Fitzroy River and Endeavor River . These ships were financially effective for the duration of their lives , and their steam engines were able to generate a shaft @-@ power of 19 @,@ 000 horsepower ( 14 @,@ 000 kW ) . This strategy gave an interesting advantage to carriers of bauxite and similar fuel cargoes , but suffered from poor engine yield compared to higher maintenance cost and efficient modern diesels , maintenance problems due to the supply of ungraded coal , and high initial costs . 
 = = = Hatches = = = 
 A hatch or hatchway is the opening at the top of a cargo hold . The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch covers . In general , hatch covers are between 45 % and 60 % of the ship 's breadth , or beam , and 57 % to 67 % of the length of the holds . To efficiently load and unload cargo , hatches must be large , but large hatches present structural problems . Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches , and these areas must be reinforced . Often , hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners . Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship . 
 As recently as the 1950s , hatches had wooden covers that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand , rather than opened and closed . Newer vessels have hydraulic @-@ operated metal hatch covers that can often be operated by one person . Hatch covers can slide forwards , backwards , or to the side , lift up or fold up . It is essential that the hatch covers be watertight : unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding , which has caused many bulkers to sink . 
 Regulations regarding hatch covers have evolved since the investigation following the loss of the MV Derbyshire . The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that hatch covers be able to withstand load of 1 @.@ 74 tons / m2 due to sea water , and a minimum scantling of 6 mm for the tops of the hatch covers . The International Association of Classification Societies then increased this strength standard by creating its Unified Requirement S21 in 1998 . This standard requires that the pressure due to sea water be calculated as a function of freeboard and speed , especially for hatch covers located on the forward portion of the ship . 
 = = = Hull = = = 
 Bulkers are designed to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently . To facilitate construction , bulkers are built with a single hull curvature . Also , while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water , designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships . Full hulls , with large block coefficients , are almost universal , and as a result , bulkers are inherently slow . This is offset by their efficiency . Comparing a ship 's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency . A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight . In larger designs , this efficiency is even more pronounced : Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight . 
 Bulkers have a cross @-@ section typical of most merchant ships . The upper and lower corners of the hold are used as ballast tanks , as is the double bottom area . The corner tanks are reinforced and serve another purpose besides controlling the ship 's trim . Designers choose the angle of the corner tanks to be less than that of the angle of repose of the anticipated cargoes . This greatly reduces side @-@ to @-@ side movement , or " shifting , " of cargo which can endanger the ship . 
 The double bottoms are also subject to design constraints . The primary concern is that they be high enough to allow the passage of pipes and cables . These areas must also be roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance . On the other hand , concerns of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces . 
 <unk> hulls are made of steel , usually mild steel . Some manufacturers have preferred high @-@ tensile steel recently in order to reduce the tare weight . However , the use of high @-@ tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull 's rigidity and resistance to corrosion . Forged steel is used for some ship parts , such as the propeller shaft support . Transverse partitions are made of corrugated iron , reinforced at the bottom and at connections . The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete @-@ steel sandwich has been investigated . 
 Double hulls have become popular in the past ten years . Designing a vessel with double sides adds primarily to its breadth , since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms . One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides , removing them from the holds . This increases the volume of the holds , and simplifies their structure which helps in loading , unloading , and cleaning . Double sides also improve a ship 's capacity for ballasting , which is useful when carrying light goods : the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons , which is done by adding ballast water . 
 A recent design , called Hy @-@ Con , seeks to combine the strengths of single @-@ hull and double @-@ hull construction . Short for Hybrid Configuration , this design doubles the forward @-@ most and rear @-@ most holds and leaves the others single @-@ hulled . This approach increases the ship 's solidity at key points , while reducing the overall tare weight . 
 Since the adoption of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision , some argue that double @-@ sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion . In spite of opposition , double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005 . 
 Freighters are in continual danger of " breaking their backs " and thus longitudinal strength is a primary architectural concern . A naval architect uses the correlation between longitudinal strength and a set of hull thicknesses called scantlings to manage problems of longitudinal strength and stresses . A ship 's hull is composed of individual parts called members . The set of dimensions of these members is called the ship 's scantlings . Naval architects calculate the stresses a ship can be expected to be subjected to , add in safety factors , and then can calculate the required scantlings . 
 These analyses are conducted when traveling empty , loading and unloading , when partially and fully loaded , and under conditions of temporary overloading . Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully , such as hold @-@ bottoms , hatch @-@ covers , bulkheads between holds , and the bottoms of ballast tanks . Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing , or developing resonance with the waves , which can cause fatigue fractures . 
 Since 1 April 2006 , the International Association of Classification Societies has adopted the Common Structural Rules . The rules apply to bulkers more than 90 meters in length and require that scantlings ' calculations take into account items such as the effect of corrosion , the harsh conditions often found in the North Atlantic , and dynamic stresses during loading . The rules also establish margins for corrosion , from 0 @.@ 5 to 0 @.@ 9 mm . 
 = = Safety = = 
 The 1980s and 1990s were a very unsafe time for bulk carriers . Many bulkers sank during this time , 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone . Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick , making it impossible for the crew to escape : more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period . Due partly to the sinking of the MV Derbyshire , a series of international safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s . 
 = = = Stability problems = = = 
 Cargo shifting poses a great danger for bulkers . The problem is even more pronounced with grain cargoes , since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between the top of the cargo and the top of the hold . Cargo is then free to move from one side of the ship to the other as the ship rolls . This can cause the ship to list , which , in turn , causes more cargo to shift . This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly . 
 The 1960 SOLAS Convention sought to control this sort of problem . These regulations required the upper ballast tanks designed in a manner to prevent shifting . They also required cargoes to be leveled , or trimmed , using excavators in the holds . The practice of trimming reduces the amount of the cargo 's surface area in contact with air which has a useful side @-@ effect : reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal , iron , and metal shavings . 
 Another sort of risk that can affect dry cargoes , is absorption of ambient moisture . When very fine <unk> and aggregates mix with water , the mud created at the bottom of the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect . The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water . 
 = = = Structural problems = = = 
 In 1990 alone , 20 bulk carriers sank , taking with them 94 crewmen . In 1991 , 24 bulkers sank , killing 154 . This level of loss focused attention on the safety aspects of bulk carriers , and a great deal was learned . The American Bureau of Shipping concluded that the losses were " directly traceable to failure of the cargo hold structure " and Lloyd 's Register of Shipping added that the hull sides could not withstand " the combination of local corrosion , fatigue cracking and operational damage . " 
 The accident studies showed a clear pattern : 
 Sea water enters the forward hatch , due to a large wave , a poor seal , corrosion , etc . 
 The extra water weight in hold number one compromises the partition to hold number two , 
 Water enters hold number two and alters the trim so much that more water enters the holds 
 With two holds rapidly filling with water , the bow submerges and the ship quickly sinks , leaving little time for the crew to react . 
 Previous practices had required ships to withstand the flooding of a single forward hold , but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood . The case where two after ( rear ) holds are flooded is no better , because the engine room is quickly flooded , leaving the ship without propulsion . If two holds in the middle of the ship are flooded , the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two . 
 Other contributing factors were identified : 
 Most shipwrecks involved ships over 20 years in age . A glut of ships of this age occurred in the 1980s , caused by an overestimate of the growth of international trade . Rather than replace them prematurely , shipping companies were compelled on cost grounds to keep their aging vessels in service . 
 Corrosion , due to a lack of maintenance , affected the seals of the hatch covers and the strength of the bulkheads which separate holds . The corrosion is difficult to detect due to the immense size of the surfaces involved . 
 Advanced methods of loading were not foreseen when the ships were designed . While the new processes are more efficient , loading is more difficult to control ( it can take over an hour just to halt the operation ) , occasionally resulting in overloading the ship . These unexpected shocks , over time , can damage the hull 's structural integrity . 
 Recent use of high @-@ tensile steel allows building a structure with less material and weight while retaining similar strength . However , because it is thinner than regular steel , HT steel can corrode more easily , plus it can develop metal fatigue in choppy seas . 
 According to Lloyd 's Register , a principal cause of sinkings was the attitude of ship @-@ owners , who sent ships with known problems to sea . 
 The new rules adopted in the 1997 annexes to the SOLAS convention focused on problems such as reinforcing bulkheads and the longitudinal frame , more stringent inspections ( with a particular focus on corrosion ) and routine in @-@ port inspections . The 1997 additions also required bulkers with restrictions ( for instance , forbidden from carrying certain types of cargoes ) to mark their hulls with large , easy @-@ to @-@ see triangles . 
 = = = Crew safety = = = 
 Since December 2004 , Panamax and Capesize bulkers have been required to carry free @-@ fall lifeboats located on the stern , behind the deckhouse . This arrangement allows the crew to abandon ship quickly in case of a catastrophic emergency . One argument against the use of free @-@ fall lifeboats is that the evacuees require " some degree of physical mobility , even fitness " to enter and launch the boat . Also , injuries have occurred during launches , for example , in the case of incorrectly secured safety belts . 
 In December 2002 , Chapter XII of the SOLAS convention was amended to require the installation of high @-@ level water alarms and monitoring systems on all bulkers . This safety measure quickly alerts watch standers on the bridge and in the engine room in case of flooding in the holds . In cases of catastrophic flooding , these detectors could speed the process of abandoning ship . 
 = Citadel of Damascus = 
 The Citadel of Damascus ( Arabic : Ù‚Ù„Ø¹Ø© <unk> : Qala 'at Dimashq ) is a large medieval fortified palace and citadel in Damascus , Syria . It is part of the Ancient City of Damascus , which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 . 
 The location of the current citadel was first fortified in 1076 by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak , although it is possible but not proven that a citadel stood on this place in the Hellenistic and Roman periods . After the assassination of Atsiz bin Uvak , the project was finished by the Seljuq ruler Tutush I. The emirs of the subsequent Burid and Zengid dynasties carried out modifications and added new structures to it . During this period , the citadel and the city were besieged several times by Crusader and Muslim armies . In 1174 , the citadel was captured by Saladin , the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt , who made it his residence and had the defences and residential buildings modified . 
 Saladin 's brother Al @-@ Adil rebuilt the citadel completely between 1203 and 1216 in response to the development of the counterweight trebuchet . After his death , power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although Damascus switched hands several times , the citadel was taken by force only once , in 1239 . The citadel remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured Damascus in 1260 , thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria . After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in the citadel , the Mongols had most of it dismantled . After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks , who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt , Damascus came under Mamluk rule . Except for brief periods in 1300 and 1401 , when the Mongols conquered Damascus , the Mamluks controlled the citadel until 1516 . In that year , Syria fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire . Damascus surrendered without a fight and from the 17th century onward the citadel functioned as barracks for the <unk> â€” Ottoman infantry units . The citadel started to fall into disrepair in the 19th century and its last military use was in 1925 , when French soldiers shelled the old city from the citadel in response to the Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate of Syria . The citadel continued to serve as a barracks and prison until 1986 , when excavations and restorations started . As of 2011 , excavation and restoration efforts are still ongoing . 
 The citadel is located in the northwest corner of the city walls , between the Bab al @-@ Faradis and the Bab al @-@ Jabiyah . The citadel consists of a more or less rectangular curtain wall enclosing an area of 230 by 150 metres ( 750 by 490 ft ) . The walls were originally protected by 14 massive towers , but today only 12 remain . The citadel has gates on its northern , western and eastern flanks . The current citadel dates primarily to the Ayyubid period while incorporating parts of the older Seljuq fortress . Extensive repairs in response to sieges and earthquakes were carried out in the Mamluk and Ottoman periods . 
 = = Before the citadel = = 
 It is uncertain whether a building stood on the site of the citadel before the 11th century AD . The Ghouta , the wider area in which Damascus is located , has been occupied since at least 9000 BC , but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC . The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement . The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period is uncertain . Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period , but whether it was located on the site of the present citadel is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate .

 In 1076 , Damascus was conquered by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak , who established himself as the ruler of the city and began the construction of the citadel . He then tried to invade the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt but was defeated in 1077 . The Fatimids subsequently built on their victory over Atsiz and besieged Damascus in 1077 and again in 1078 , but both attempts to take the city were unsuccessful . The siege of 1078 was eventually lifted by Tutush I , brother of the Seljuq sultan Malik Shah I , to whom Atsiz had appealed for help . After the Fatimid besiegers had left , Tutush I took over the city and , distrusting Atsiz , had him assassinated in 1078 . The construction of the citadel was finished under Tutush I. 
 = = = From Seljuqs to Zengids = = = 
 After the death of Tutush I in 1095 , Syria was divided between his sons Abu Nasr Shams al @-@ Muluk Duqaq and Fakhr al @-@ Mulk Radwan . Duqaq took control of Damascus while Radwan established himself as ruler of Aleppo . During Duqaq 's reign ( 1095 â€“ 1104 ) , additional work was carried out on the citadel . In 1096 , Radwan besieged the citadel but failed to capture it . 
 During the rule of the Burid dynasty ( 1104 â€“ 1154 ) , work was carried out on the citadel in response to multiple attacks on Damascus by Crusader and Muslim armies . In 1126 , a Crusader army approached Damascus , but their advance was stopped 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from the city . A second attempt by Crusaders in 1129 advanced to within 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) of the city before they had to retreat . Zengi , the atabeg of Aleppo and Mosul , attacked Damascus in 1135 and again in 1140 . Zengi 's second attack was thwarted because Damascus forged a coalition with the Crusader states to the south , arguing that if Damascus were conquered , these states would fall as well . Crusader armies attacked Damascus a third time in 1148 during the Second Crusade . This siege of Damascus ended within a week when an army led by Nur ad @-@ Din Zangi , ruler of Aleppo and the son of Zengi , threatened the besieging Crusaders , forcing them to withdraw . After unsuccessful attacks in 1150 and 1151 , Nur ad @-@ Din finally captured Damascus in 1154 . The citadel was only surrendered to Nur ad @-@ Din after Mujir ad @-@ Din Abaq , the last Burid ruler , had been given safe passage and lordship over the city of Homs . 
 Nur ad @-@ Din ruled as Zengid emir of Damascus from 1154 until his death in 1174 . He took up residence in the citadel and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures . After an earthquake hit Damascus in 1170 , Nur ad @-@ Din built a wooden house for sleeping and prayer next to the original stone residence of the citadel . In addition , he built a mosque and a fountain in the citadel . Between 1165 and 1174 , Nur ad @-@ Din re @-@ fortified Damascus with a concentric wall , and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of the citadel . Nur ad @-@ Din died of an illness in the citadel on 15 May 1174 and was buried there ; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad @-@ Din Madrasah in Damascus . 
 = = = Saladin to Al @-@ Adil = = = 
 Immediately following Nur ad @-@ Din 's death in 1174 , Damascus was seized by Saladin , the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt . In that year , Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to Damascus with only 700 horsemen . The city opened its gates to Saladin without resistance , except for the citadel , which surrendered to him later that year . Saladin added a tower to the citadel and refurbished the residential buildings . Like his predecessor Nur ad @-@ Din , Saladin died of an illness in the citadel on 4 March 1193 . He was initially buried inside the citadel , but later reburied in a mausoleum near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus . 
 At Saladin 's death in 1193 , rival Ayyubid factions led by Saladin 's sons established themselves in Egypt , Aleppo , Damascus , and Iraq . Al @-@ Afdal , Saladin 's eldest son and emir of Damascus , was initially recognized by the younger sons as their overlord . However , hostilities broke out in 1194 between Al @-@ Afdal and Al @-@ Aziz Uthman , Saladin 's second @-@ oldest son and Ayyubid sultan of Egypt . In 1196 , Al @-@ Aziz and Saladin 's brother Al @-@ Adil captured Damascus , except for the citadel , where Al @-@ Afdal had taken refuge . After negotiations , Al @-@ Afdal surrendered the citadel and his titles to Al @-@ Aziz and was exiled to Salkhad in the Hauran . Al @-@ Adil recognized the overlordship of Al @-@ Aziz and became ruler of Damascus . At the death of Al @-@ Aziz in 1198 , several members of Saladin 's family , including Al @-@ Afdal and Az @-@ Zahir Ghazi , ruler of Aleppo , allied themselves against Al @-@ Adil and marched on Damascus . Al @-@ Afdal and Az @-@ Zahir besieged Damascus in 1200 and 1201 , but both attempts were unsuccessful . Al @-@ Adil eventually negotiated a peace with Al @-@ Afdal and Az @-@ Zahir , who recognized Al @-@ Adil 's suzerainty as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus . 
 = = New citadel = = 
 = = = Construction by Al @-@ Adil and dismantling by the Mongols = = = 
 After his position as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus was secured , Al @-@ Adil started an extensive rebuilding programme of the citadel . Between 1203 and 1216 , the old fortifications were razed and a larger castle was built at the same location , incorporating parts of the old Seljuq citadel . The lower Ayyubid princes were each required to finance and build one of the large towers of the citadel . Several of Al @-@ Adil 's Ayyubid successors rebuilt many of the administrative and domestic structures inside the citadel , including residences , palaces , and a pool . As @-@ Salih Ayyub was the only successor who also modified the defences . 
 Possible motivations for this complete rebuilding by Al @-@ Adil include the damage the old citadel may have sustained from earthquakes in 1200 and 1201 and the threat that other Ayyubid princes continued to pose toward Al @-@ Adil . The most likely motivation is that the defences of the old citadel became obsolete due to the introduction in the 12th century of the counterweight trebuchet , a siege engine easily capable of reducing thick stone walls to rubble . The new citadel introduced a number of important changes to the defensive system , including higher and thicker walls , a wide moat surrounding the citadel , and numerous closely spaced , high , massive towers . Unlike the older towers , these were square rather than round in design . The towers contained platforms on which trebuchets could be placed . Due to their high position , these trebuchets could outrange enemy artillery and thereby prevent them from breaching the walls . 
 After Al @-@ Adil 's death in 1218 , intense power struggles broke out among his sons and other Ayyubid princes . Between 1229 and 1246 , Damascus switched hands regularly and was attacked five times by different Ayyubid armies . During this period , the citadel was only once taken by force â€” through mining of one of its walls â€” in 1239 . This occurred when the citadel 's garrison had been reduced to below the number needed to defend a castle of that size . Following the murder in 1250 of Al @-@ Muazzam <unk> , the last Ayyubid sultan of Egypt , Damascus was seized by the Ayyubid ruler of Aleppo , An @-@ Nasir Yusuf . He was in control of most of Syria until the arrival of the Mongols . 
 When the Mongols invaded Syria and threatened Damascus after conquering Aleppo in 1260 , An @-@ Nasir fled from Damascus , leaving the city virtually undefended . The notables of Damascus started negotiations with the Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan ; the city was handed over to his general Kitbuqa in 1260 . When the Mongol army left Damascus to quell rebellions in the countryside , the Ayyubid garrison of the citadel revolted , as they had been instructed to do by An @-@ Nasir . In response , the Mongols besieged the citadel in 1260 . The garrison surrendered after heavy bombardments and without hope of being relieved by An @-@ Nasir . The defences of the citadel were then largely dismantled . 
 = = = Mamluk period = = = 
 The new Mamluk sultan of Egypt , Qutuz , defeated the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 . Damascus now came under Mamluk influence . In the same year , Qutuz was assassinated by his commander Baibars , who succeeded Qutuz as sultan of Egypt ( 1260 â€“ 1277 ) . During Baibars ' reign , the citadel was rebuilt and the northern wall was moved 10 metres ( 33 ft ) to the north . More rebuilding was completed during the reigns of the sultan Qalawun ( 1279 â€“ 1290 ) and Al @-@ Ashraf Khalil . The latter had a structure called the Blue Dome built in the citadel . It was the first dome in Syria that was decorated with coloured tiles on the outer surface , a tradition imported from Iran . Following the Mamluk defeat in the Battle of Wadi al @-@ Khazandar , Damascus , except for the citadel , changed hands to the Mongols in 1300 . The Mongols besieged the citadel and set up a trebuchet in the court of the Umayyad Mosque , but they withdrew from Damascus before the citadel could be taken . In the following decades , extensive reconstruction work took place on the citadel . The damage done to the citadel during the siege , primarily on its east side , was repaired . The mosque was reconstructed and enlarged , the towers were repaired , and the Blue Dome was covered with lead plates as the tiles themselves had been destroyed . 
 During the last two decades of the 14th century , a civil war raged in the Mamluk sultanate between Sultan Barquq , who had established the Burji dynasty in Cairo , on one side and on the other side Saif al @-@ Din Yalbugha , governor of Aleppo , and <unk> , governor of Malatya . The city and the citadel were besieged several times during this period . During these sieges , both sides made use of siege towers , trebuchets , rockets and cannons . After Yalbugha switched sides and teamed up with Barquq , <unk> was killed in 1393 , leaving Damascus and its city under the control of Barquq . Also during this time , the <unk> Revolt , a conspiracy to overthrow Barquq , was discovered at the Citadel . 
 = = = Siege by Timur and its aftermath = = = 
 In 1400 , the Mongol army under Timur , better known as Tamerlane , swept down on Syria and arrived at Damascus after having subdued Aleppo , Homs , and Baalbek . A Mamluk army from Egypt under Sultan Faraj ibn Barquq , the son of Barquq , failed to lift the siege . In 1401 , the city surrendered to Timur , except for the citadel , which Timur besieged . Towers with trebuchets were set up around the citadel and in the Umayyad Mosque . The garrison surrendered after the northwestern tower was brought down through mining . The defenders were slaughtered and a heavy tribute was imposed on the citizens of Damascus . When they failed to deliver , the city was sacked and the Umayyad Mosque was burned . 
 The damage to the citadel , especially to its northern and western walls , was only repaired in 1407 . In 1414 , governor of Damascus <unk> al @-@ <unk> , sought refuge in the citadel against the army of Sultan Al @-@ Mu 'ayyad Shaykh . The citadel was bombarded by trebuchet and cannon . The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed . In 1461 , the southwest tower collapsed in a fire when missiles were fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city . This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries , indicating that the repairs of 1407 had been carried out in haste . 
 = = = Ottoman period = = = 
 After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 , Damascus and the citadel surrendered peacefully to the Ottomans . Damascus was given to <unk> al @-@ Ghazali , a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520 , al @-@ Ghazali revolted and took the citadel . He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm , but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed in the vicinity of Damascus in 1521 . Damascus again changed hands , to the Ottomans . From 1658 onward , the citadel was controlled by the Janissaries â€” Ottoman infantry units . In 1738 and in 1746 , they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus ; the Janissaries temporarily lost control of the citadel in 1746 . The north gate of the citadel collapsed in 1752 , and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759 . According to contemporary accounts , both the western and southern walls collapsed , but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761 . 
 When Ali Bey of Egypt , who opposed Ottoman overlordship , invaded Syria in 1771 , the city of Damascus surrendered to him without a fight , except for the citadel . Ali Bey withdrew after a short siege . Two further sieges took place in 1787 and 1812 , both successful and both initiated because the citadel 's garrison had revolted against the governor of Damascus . The last siege of the citadel took place in 1831 . In that year , the citizens of Damascus and the local garrison of Janissaries revolted against governor Mehmed Selim Pasha , who took refuge in the citadel . He was promised safe passage after a siege lasting 40 days but was murdered before he could leave the city . In 1860 , Christian refugees from the Druze @-@ Maronite conflict in Lebanon spilled into Damascus , resulting in tensions with the Muslim population . There was a massacre of the Christian population , many of whom sought refuge in the citadel and eventually fled the city with the help of the Algerian â€“ Damascene notable Abd al @-@ Qadir al @-@ Jaza 'iri . Descriptions and photographs of the citadel by nineteenth @-@ century European travellers indicate that the defences remained in relatively good shape until 1895 , but that the structures inside the walls were reduced to complete ruins . In 1895 , substantial damage was done to the citadel because it was quarried for stone to build barracks .

 When the British and Arab forces marched on Damascus in the final year of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I , the Ottoman authorities fled and left Damascus in the control of a committee of citizens .

These riots only stopped with the entrance into the city of the Australian Light Horse troops on 1 October 1918 . 
 French military forces occupied the citadel during the French Mandate period in Syria ( 1920 â€“ 1946 ) . During the Great Syrian Revolt in 1925 , the French shelled Al @-@ <unk> , the area immediately south of the citadel â€” where Syrian rebels were supposed to be present â€” from positions in the hills to the north of the city , and from the citadel itself . This bombardment resulted in widespread destruction . After the French Mandate period , the citadel continued to serve as a prison and barracks until 1986 . 
 = = = Restoration and research = = = 
 The Ancient City of Damascus , including the citadel , was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 . Since 1986 restoration works have been carried out by various Syrian and foreign missions with the aim of opening the citadel to the public . Until 1999 , the restorations were carried out by the Syrian Directorate @-@ General of Antiquities and Museums ( DGAM ) . In 1999 a joint French @-@ Syrian mission was initiated under the supervision of the DGAM and the Institut franÃ§ais du <unk> @-@ Orient ( <unk> ) . Between 2000 and 2006 , this mission carried out extensive archaeological and art @-@ historical research in the citadel , as well as further restoration works . In celebration of these restorations , a ceremony was held on 1 July 2006 which was attended by Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad . 
 In 2004 an agreement was signed between the DGAM and the Italian General Direction for Development Cooperation for a joint mission to renovate and reorganize the citadel and the National Museum of Damascus . This mission started working in the citadel in 2007 . Much attention will be given to the reinforcement of damaged or structurally weak parts in the architecture . It is expected by the Syrian â€“ Italian mission that , once renovations are finished , the citadel will be used for cultural and social events and activities . 
 = = Citadel today = = 
 = = = Location and layout = = = 
 The citadel is located in the northwest corner of the old walled city of Damascus , between the Bab al @-@ Faradis and the Bab al @-@ Jabiyah . Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops , the citadel of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level as the rest of the city , a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra . The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River , which flows north of the citadel . The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the citadel . The Nahr <unk> , a canal branching off the Barada , flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection . The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams . Another branch of the Barada , the Nahr Banyas , entered the city under the citadel . Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al @-@ Adil . The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus , with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners . 
 The citadel erected under the Seljuqs occupied an area measuring 210 by 130 metres ( 690 by 430 ft ) . Parts of the Seljuq walls were integrated in the rebuilding undertaken by Al @-@ Adil . In this way , a second inner ring of defence was provided , as Al @-@ Adil 's walls enclosed a slightly larger area . The Ayyubid citadel encloses an uneven rectangular area of 230 by 150 metres ( 750 by 490 ft ) . The outer walls , constructed by Al @-@ Adil , were pierced by three gates and originally protected by 14 towers , although only 12 of these remain . Except for the western part of the curtain wall , the defensive works of the citadel that are still standing are primarily of Ayyubid date , with extensive Mamluk restorations . The walls are partly obscured from sight by the urban fabric of Damascus , which has encroached upon the citadel during the 19th and 20th centuries . The shops along the north side of the Al @-@ Hamidiyah Souq are built against the citadel 's southern faÃ§ade , while parts of the eastern defences are also obscured by buildings . The buildings that stood against the western and northern walls were cleared in the 1980s . 
 The walls and towers of the citadel are constructed from carbonate rocks and basalt that were quarried in the vicinity of Damascus . 
 = = = Towers = = = 
 Today , the citadel has 12 towers . There is one tower on each corner , three in between along the north and south walls and two facing east . Originally , the citadel had two more towers on the western wall , as reported by European travellers until 1759 . The earthquake that hit Damascus in that year led to the collapse of the western defences of the citadel , with the western towers not being rebuilt afterwards . The central northern tower , which once housed the north gate of the citadel , and the southwest corner tower have also largely disappeared . Of the former , only the west wall remains while of the southwest tower only parts of the basement can still be seen . The other 10 towers have been preserved up to their original height , which ranges between 15 and 25 metres ( 49 and 82 ft ) . The northern corner towers are square while the southern ones are L @-@ shaped . All the other towers are rectangular with their broad sides parallel to the walls of the citadel . All towers are crowned by a double parapet equipped with machicolations and numerous arrowslits . These parapets surrounded and thereby protected the large platforms from which trebuchets were operated . 
 = = = Curtain walls = = = 
 The curtain walls of the citadel connect the towers with each other . Given that during the design of the citadel so much emphasis was placed on the massive towers , the curtain walls are relatively short . They range between 10 metres ( 33 ft ) in length for the curtain wall that connects the two central towers of the east wall to 43 metres ( 141 ft ) for the curtain wall connecting the northwest corner tower with the next tower east of it . Where the walls are preserved up to their original height , which is on the south side of the citadel , they measure 11 @.@ 5 metres ( 38 ft ) , while their thickness ranges between 3 @.@ 65 â€“ 4 @.@ 90 metres ( 12 @.@ 0 â€“ 16 @.@ 1 ft ) . Along the inside of the curtain walls ran vaulted galleries that allowed quick access to all parts of the citadel . These galleries had arrowslits from which an approaching enemy could be shot . The walls were crowned by a walkway that was protected by crenellations . 
 = = = Gates = = = 
 The citadel 's three gates are located on the north , east and west sides of the citadel . The first two are the work of Al @-@ Adil , although the northern gate has been repaired in the Mamluk period , while the current west gate is of later date . The northern gate was primarily reserved for military matters ; the eastern gate was in civic use . During the Mamluk period , the eastern gate was one of two locations , the other being the Umayyad Mosque , where official decrees were posted , and this is reflected in a number of inscriptions that have been found here . 
 The northern gate , or Bab al @-@ Hadid ( " Iron Gate " ) , was built with a primary emphasis on military matters . It originally consisted of arched entrances in the east and west walls of a tower in the middle of the northern curtain wall . These entrances led to a central vaulted room and from there through a long vaulted passage before reaching the courtyard . This large gate complex also incorporated the gate structures of the old Seljuq citadel . Based on stylistic evidence and inscriptions found in the citadel , the original construction of the Ayyubid gate can be dated to the period between 1210 and 1212 . Most of the outer gate tower has disappeared and a street now runs through the western arch that still survives , while the vaulted passage that led into the citadel is now used as a mosque . The east and north gate complexes were connected through a 68 metres ( 223 ft ) long vaulted passage that can also be dated to the reign of Al @-@ Adil . 
 The eastern gate , constructed between 1213 and 1215 , is the only one that opens toward the area enclosed by the city walls of Damascus . It is located in one of the citadel 's square towers and protected by another tower immediately south of the gate tower and a <unk> running between these towers . It is a bent @-@ axis gate running through vaulted passages before reaching the courtyard . Behind it is a square hall in which four columns support a central unusually shaped dome . It incorporates a gate tower from the old Seljuq citadel . The gate lacks defensive structures like murder @-@ holes and is more decorated than the northern gate , which must be related to the fact that the gate faces the city . The gate is decorated with a superb muqarnas canopy that is now hidden because the outer door is blocked . 
 The western gate was originally protected by two square towers that were probably built during the reign of Baibars . After the 1759 earthquake , which led to the collapse of the western defences of the citadel , these towers were not rebuilt . Unlike the other two gates , this gate has a straight passage . 
 = = = Southwest building = = = 
 In the southwest corner of the courtyard , built parallel to the southern wall , is a two @-@ storey building measuring 90 by 10 metres ( 295 by 33 ft ) and reaching a height of 16 metres ( 52 ft ) . The date of this building has long been unclear , but based on the archaeological and architectural analysis carried out between 2002 and 2006 , it has been shown that it predates Al @-@ Adil 's refortification of the citadel and must have been an addition to the defences of the Seljuq citadel . The function of this building after it was incorporated into Al @-@ Adil 's new walls , and thus after losing its defensive function , remains unclear as the archaeological analysis did not reveal any in situ material from which the building 's use could be reconstructed . 
 = One Rincon Hill = 
 One Rincon Hill is an upscale residential complex on the apex of Rincon Hill in San Francisco , California , United States . The complex , designed by Solomon , Cordwell , Buenz and Associates and developed by Urban West Associates , consists of two skyscrapers that share a common townhouse podium . 
 The taller tower , One Rincon Hill South Tower , was completed in 2008 and stands 60 stories and 641 feet ( 195 m ) tall . The shorter tower , marketed as Tower Two at One Rincon Hill , was completed in 2014 and reaches a height of 541 feet ( 165 m ) with 50 stories . The South Tower contains high @-@ speed elevators with special features for moving residents effectively , and a large water tank designed to help the skyscraper withstand strong winds and earthquakes . Both skyscrapers and the townhomes contain a total of 709 residential units . 
 The building site , located right next to the western approach of the San Francisco â€“ Oakland Bay Bridge , formerly contained a clock tower . The clock tower was demolished shortly after the city approved the One Rincon Hill project . Construction of the townhomes and the South Tower lasted from 2005 to 2008 , but was stopped for brief periods of time due to seismic concerns and a construction accident . As the South Tower neared completion , it generated controversy concerning view encroachment , high pricing , and architectural style .

 = = = Location = = = 
 The complex is on a 1 @.@ 3 acres ( 0 @.@ 53 ha ) parcel on the apex of the Rincon Hill neighborhood . The site is bounded by Harrison Street to the west , the Fremont Street exit ramp to the north , the approach to the Bay Bridge ( Interstate 80 ) on the east , and the 1st Street entrance ramp to the south . 
 = = = Developer and architect = = = 
 Solomon , Cordwell , Buenz and Associates , a Chicago architectural firm , designed the complex . The developer of this complex is Urban West Associates , headed by Mike <unk> . The developer 's headquarters are in San Diego , although all its highrise projects over 14 stories are in the San Francisco Bay Area . The Rincon Hill complex is the developer 's second project in San Francisco , with the first being ONE Embarcadero South , a residential complex near One Rincon Hill and across from AT & T Park . According to the developer the total cost of the Rincon Hill project was US $ 290 million , rising to over US $ 310 million in 2009 . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The complex consists of two buildings joined together at the base by a row of townhomes . The South Tower and North Tower rise 641 ft ( 195 m ) and 541 ft ( 165 m ) above the corner of Fremont and Harrison streets , respectively . The North Tower has 50 floors , while the South Tower has 60 . Because of the sloped Rincon Hill site , the South Tower 's lobby floor or the 1st Street entrance is on the sixth floor , and the first floor is five levels underground from the 1st Street entrance . It is also one of the tallest all @-@ residential towers west of the Mississippi River . Its location near the apex of Rincon Hill , at an elevation of over 100 feet ( 30 m ) , gives it an apparent height of well over 700 feet ( 210 m ) , making it one of the biggest additions to the San Francisco skyline in over 30 years . 
 Both the north tower and the south tower of the Rincon Hill complex bear a resemblance to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago , a building of a similar height to the south tower also designed by Solomon , Cordwell , Buenz and Associates . The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late @-@ modernist . The three sides of the South Tower facing southeast , northeast , and northwest have a linear glass <unk> . The North Tower has a similar design , except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northeast . Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval @-@ shaped crown housing mechanical equipment . 
 The crown of the South Tower contains a band of 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night . Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40 @,@ 000 hours . These lights are used to signal the weather , just like the lights on the John Hancock Tower in Boston . The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast . A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon . Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain . Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged . This is the San Francisco Bay Area 's first weather beacon . The crown began lighting up on December 8 , 2008 . 
 = = = Earthquake engineering = = = 
 To support the 60 story condo tower , One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive 12 foot ( 4 m ) thick pile @-@ raft foundation embedded deep into serpentine rock . Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion , there are massive structures , such as the Golden Gate Bridge , that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine . Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large , tall columns of steel @-@ reinforced concrete called outriggers . The core is attached to the outrigger columns by diagonal , steel buckling @-@ restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled <unk> behavior . This type of advanced seismic system performs in a manner similar to that of shock absorbers . The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss . Also of note is the controlled @-@ rocking system which features vertical post @-@ tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced @-@ concrete shear @-@ wall core . Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States .

 At the top of the building is a large tuned sloshing damper which holds up to 50 @,@ 000 gallons ( 189 @,@ 250 litres ) of water and weighs 416 @,@ 500 pounds ( 185 @,@ 440 kg ) . A similar 50 @,@ 000 gallon ( 189 @,@ 250 liter ) tank is located in the basement for firefighting purposes . There are two liquid damper screens in each tank to control the flow of the water to counter the sway from the powerful Pacific winds , which can reach hurricane @-@ force .

 The South Tower has one freight and three passenger elevators . The elevators are the second fastest in the city of San Francisco , second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street . The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor ( the mechanical level ) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow . This means the elevators can travel about 1 @,@ 200 vertical feet ( 366 m ) in a minute . The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly . The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside . 
 = = = Residences = = = 
 The entire project will provide 695 condos in the highrises and 14 townhomes at the foot of the towers for a total of 709 units . 376 of those condo units are located in the South Tower and the North Tower contains the other 319 units . Because of their height , both towers will offer spectacular vistas of the surrounding landscapes . There are 26 different floor plans for the 695 condos which are financially beyond the reach of many citizens residing in San Francisco . The units vary greatly in price from US $ 500 @,@ 000 to US $ 2 @.@ 5 million depending on view and the size of the unit that range from 600 to 2 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 56 to 186 m2 ) . The project opened up a sales office on June 16 , 2006 and even before the opening , condo @-@ buyers placed deposits for 130 of the South Tower 's 376 condo units in a selling spree . The Sales Center is rumored to have cost US $ 2 million to build . The condo units in One Rincon Hill South Tower sold well for an unfinished building at that time . The first residents began moving into the South Tower in February 2008 .

 The 183 ft ( 56 m ) triangle @-@ section clock tower , owned by Union 76 and then Bank of America , was built on the site circa 1955 . After the Transbay Plan the city changed the zoning in the Rincon Hill neighborhood and raised height limits . A second version of One Rincon Hill was proposed in response to these zoning changes , in which the height was increased to 60 stories . The second version project was approved by the city on August 4 , 2005 . Before construction of One Rincon Hill , the clock tower was razed to make way for the construction of the towers .

After March , the developer said construction was going to start in May 2008 . However , following the worldwide financial crisis of the late summer and fall of 2008 , the project 's developers announced that construction of the second tower was indefinitely on hold . With improving economic conditions in the city , construction started on this tower on October 2012 ; its first residents moved in August 2014 . The north tower was later renamed The Harrison .

 JÃ³zef ÅšwiatÅ‚o born Izaak <unk> ( 1 January 1915 â€“ 2 September 1994 ) was a high @-@ ranking official of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland employed as deputy director of the 10th Department run by Anatol Fejgin . Known for supervising the torture of inmates , he was nicknamed the " Butcher " by the MBP prisoners . After the death of Stalin and the arrest of Lavrentiy Beria in 1953 , ÅšwiatÅ‚o travelled to East Germany on an official business trip . While on the Berlin subway with Fejgin , passing through the West Berlin sector of the city , he " slipped away " and defected to the West . 
 After his defection on 5 December in Berlin , he worked for the CIA and the Radio Free Europe ( RFE ) . ÅšwiatÅ‚o 's written and broadcast <unk> shook the Polish United Workers ' Party , and ultimately contributed to the reform of the Polish security apparatus at the end of the Stalinist period , as one of the factors leading to the political liberalisation of the socialist Polish October revolution . 
 = = Biography = = 
 JÃ³zef ÅšwiatÅ‚o was born on 1 January 1915 as Izaak <unk> ( also <unk> , Licht , or <unk> , sources vary ) , into a Jewish family in <unk> village near Zbarazh ( now Ukraine ) . In the Second Polish Republic he was first a Zionist and later , a communist activist . He was arrested twice for his illegal activities . Conscripted in 1939 , he served in the Polish Army ( Polish 6th Infantry Division ) during the Polish September Campaign that year . Taken prisoner by the Germans , he escaped , only to be taken prisoner by the Red Army , which invaded East Poland where his family lived and deported east along with hundred thousands of others . It was also in that period that , on 26 April 1943 , he married Justyna ÅšwiatÅ‚o , taking her more Polish @-@ sounding surname . He eventually joined the Polish Forces in the East ( Polish 1st Tadeusz KoÅ›ciuszko Infantry Division , Berling 's Army ) , becoming a political officer ; he was also promoted to junior lieutenant ( podporucznik ) and became involved in organising state administration in areas taken from the Germans . 
 In 1945 he was transferred to the newly formed Ministry of Public Security of Poland ( MBP ) . In his work , ÅšwiatÅ‚o , like many other communist secret police agents , used torture and forgery . He was involved in arresting hundreds of members of Polish underground organization , Armia Krajowa , its leadership ( the Trial of the Sixteen ) and falsifying of the 1946 Polish referendum . In time he was promoted to Lieutenant colonel ( <unk> ) and served in various offices and departments , eventually in 1951 ending up in the 10th Department , where he was one of the leading officers . The 10th Department was responsible for handling the Party members themselves . He received orders personally from the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers ' Party BolesÅ‚aw Bierut , and arrested such notable people as politicians WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw GomuÅ‚ka and Marian <unk> , General MichaÅ‚ Rola @-@ <unk> and Cardinal Stefan WyszyÅ„ski . He had access - sometimes unique - to many secret documents . He interrogated Noel Field on 27 August 1949 in Budapest as well as his brother , Herman Field ( a US citizen who went to Poland to look for his brother ) . Herman would be secretly imprisoned for five years , until the information on him was revealed - by ÅšwiatÅ‚o himself . 
 = = = Defection to the West = = = 
 In November 1953 , the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers ' Party BolesÅ‚aw Bierut asked Politburo member Jakub Berman to send MBP Lieutenant Colonel JÃ³zef ÅšwiatÅ‚o on an important mission to East Berlin . ÅšwiatÅ‚o , deputy head of MBP Department X , together with Colonel Anatol Fejgin , were asked to consult with Stasi chief Erich Mielke about eliminating pl : Wanda <unk> . ÅšwiatÅ‚o , however , after the death of Stalin in March 1953 and arrest of Lavrentiy Beria in June that year , became afraid for his own life . He suspected that Bierut in Poland might turn on him and other members of the Ministry , attempting to make them into scapegoats . 
 The two officers traveled to Berlin and spoke with Mielke . On 5 December 1953 , the day after meeting the Stasi chief , ÅšwiatÅ‚o defected to the U.S. military mission in West Berlin . He left family - wife and two children - in Poland . The next day , American military authorities transported ÅšwiatÅ‚o to Frankfurt and by Christmas ÅšwiatÅ‚o had been flown to Washington , D.C. , where he underwent an extensive debriefing . It has been reported that his interrogations were compiled into about fifty long reports . The United States gave him political asylum with the full knowledge that " he would have to be protected for the rest of his life because the number of his victims and relatives of victims sworn to exact retribution was so great . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 ÅšwiatÅ‚o 's defection was revealed in Poland by the Polish Press Agency on 25 October 1954 , with ÅšwiatÅ‚o labelled a traitor and provocateur . It was , however , widely publicised in the United States and Europe by the US authorities , as well as in Poland via Radio Free Europe , embarrassing the Communist authorities in Warsaw - the first international press conference with ÅšwiatÅ‚o took place on 28 September 1954 . ÅšwiatÅ‚o had intimate knowledge of the internal politics of the Polish government , especially the activities of the various secret services . Over the course of the following months , US newspapers and Radio Free Europe ( in the " Behind the scenes of the secret service and the party " cycle ) reported extensively on political repression in Poland based on ÅšwiatÅ‚o 's revelations . 
 Capitalising on them , in what was known as " Operation Spotlight " , RFE broadcast some 140 interviews by ÅšwiatÅ‚o , and 30 programs on him . ÅšwiatÅ‚o 's RFE broadcasts were not only serialized but even distributed over Poland by special balloons . ÅšwiatÅ‚o detailed the torture of prisoners under interrogation and politically motivated executions and struggles inside the Polish United Workers ' Party . None of the Polish Communists intelligence , counterintelligence and public security agencies escaped unscathed and without some of their secrets being revealed . 
 The highly publicised defection of Colonel ÅšwiatÅ‚o , not to mention the general hatred of the Ministry of Public Security among Poles , led to changes in late 1954 , as first the 10th Department and soon afterwards , the entire Ministry , was broken up and reorganised ; many officials were arrested . ÅšwiatÅ‚o 's scandal contributed to the events of political liberalisation in Poland , known as the Polish October . For a long time , it was uncertain if ÅšwiatÅ‚o was dead or still alive . Information on him was protected by the US witness protection program ; there were rumours that he died in late 1960s , 1975 or 1985 . In 2010 , United States government stated that he had died on 2 September 1994 . Documents relating to him are still classified in the United States and not available to researchers . 
 = Barnard Castle School = 
 Barnard Castle School ( colloquially Barney School or locally the County School ) is a co @-@ educational independent day and boarding school in the market town of Barnard Castle , County Durham , in the North East of England . It is a member of The Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference ( HMC ) . It was founded in 1883 with funding from a 13th @-@ century endowment of John I de Balliol and the bequest of the local industrialist Benjamin Flounders . The ambition was to create a school of the quality of the ancient public schools at a more reasonable cost , whilst accepting pupils regardless of their faith . 
 Originally the North Eastern County School , the name was changed in 1924 , but is still generally known locally as the " County School " . The school is set in its own 50 @-@ acre ( 20 ha ) grounds in Teesdale , within the North Pennines , an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . An on @-@ site prep school caters for pupils aged 4 to 11 , while the senior school caters for pupils aged 11 to 18 . The school was previously funded by direct grant . Founded as an all @-@ boys school , it has been fully co @-@ educational since 1993 . There are around 725 pupils and some 195 members of staff . 
 Since the 1980s , the school has been one of Britain 's most successful at producing top class rugby union players . During this period it schooled England international players Rob Andrew and Tony and Rory Underwood . The school has also produced Mathew Tait , Lee Dickson and Tim Visser , and appeared in three finals of the inter @-@ school Daily Mail Cup . Former pupils in other fields include Edward Mellanby ( the discoverer of Vitamin D ) ; industrialist Percy Mills , The Lord Mills ; fashion designer Giles Deacon and poet Craig Raine . 
 = = History = = 
 The school can trace its origins to an endowment made by John I de Balliol , then Lord of Barnard Castle , in 1229 . The school itself was established in 1883 when it occupied temporary premises in Middleton One Row , County Durham , whilst construction of the school was undertaken in Barnard Castle . Initially there were 25 boarders and 10 @-@ day pupils , but by the end of 1884 , there were 76 boarders . Originally known as the North Eastern County School , the main school building was completed on 2 February 1886 and initially housed 116 boarders and 12 @-@ day pupils . The Bishop of Durham presided over the foundation ceremony . The building was designed by Clark & <unk> of Darlington in the Jacobean style , and is a Grade II listed building built with local Yorkstone and Lakeland slate . The school was built for the trustees of Benjamin Flounders and the trustees of St. John 's Hospital , Barnard Castle , who managed the <unk> endowment , and was overseen by a University of Durham committee . Flounders was a Quaker industrialist who had helped to fund the Stockton and Darlington Railway . The Flounders trustees financed the entirety of the construction of the school with a donation of Â£ 31 @,@ 000 . A further Â£ 20 @,@ 000 was raised by subscription to cover initial running costs , Â£ 10 @,@ 000 of which came from St John 's Hospital . The gift from St John 's was conditional on the school being situated in Barnard Castle , and this determined its location . 
 The school 's governance was inspired by the county school movement of Joseph Lloyd Brereton , who was largely inspired in turn by the example of Thomas Arnold , the headmaster of Rugby School . The object of the school was to provide a liberal education , with fees a fraction of those charged by public schools . Tolerance of non @-@ conformist denominations such as Methodism and Roman Catholicism informed the school 's ethos , and the school has always remained independent of the Church of England . Brereton 's son became the first headmaster of the school . In contrast to the largely classical education offered by many of the public schools of the time , the school always maintained a focus on scientific and technological education . A strong sporting programme was believed to build character . Extensions over the next few years included a sanatorium in 1890 ( now the music school ) and a swimming @-@ bath block in 1896 . In 1900 a Â£ 4 @,@ 000 ( Â£ 400 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) science block was opened by Lord Barnard with the Bishop of Durham in attendance . The building is now inhabited by Tees and Dale houses . 
 The school name was changed to Barnard Castle School in 1924 , and it was by this time one of the largest public schools in the North of England . When Harold Birkbeck was appointed headmaster in 1935 there were 193 pupils . In 1942 the school was elected to the Headmaster 's Conference , making it an " official " public school . Following the introduction of the Education Act 1944 , from 1945 the school became a direct grant grammar school and the number of pupils enrolled at the school increased substantially . In April 1961 a Â£ 65 @,@ 000 ( Â£ 1 @.@ 1 million in 2010 ) appeal was launched for funding to build new science blocks and a library building . By this time there were 470 boys at the school , more than half of whom progressed to universities or higher education . Birkbeck introduced squash to the school , and made it one of the best @-@ known schools for the sport in the country in the 1960s and 1970s . The novelist Will Cohu described the school in 1974 as " a rugged Victorian establishment in a brooding Jacobean @-@ style building overlooking the Tees ... The school was popular with parents who were in the armed forces . It was cheap , did not have any reputation for abuse , and was strong on games " . The direct @-@ grant revenue stream was abolished in 1975 , making the school reliant upon independent funding . An appeal was launched that year to ensure the school 's survival , with Â£ 109 @,@ 000 ( Â£ 750 @,@ 000 in 2011 ) raised within nine months . The school 's first computer was installed in January 1978 . 
 Frank Macnamara became headmaster in 1980 , described as " an affable enthusiast " in The Guardian . Under his tenure the school would develop its reputation for fostering world @-@ class rugby talent . For the duration of its existence ( 1980 â€“ 1997 ) the school took part in the Assisted Places Scheme . Girls were first admitted to the Sixth Form in 1981 , and the school has been fully co @-@ educational since 1993 . By 1992 there were around 610 pupils with an approximately 50 : 50 split between boarding and day pupils . From 1993 , as the result of a HMC initiative , Eastern European children were awarded scholarships to study at the school ; by 1995 , 8 per cent of the school 's intake came from overseas . Michael Featherstone , a former England hockey international , was appointed headmaster in 1997 , and the school enjoyed considerable academic success during his tenure .

 One of the North East 's most famous schools , Barnard Castle is set in its own 50 @-@ acre grounds on the edge of town . It is located in Teesdale , and is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . Giles Deacon has said of the location that " you could just walk out and you were in the middle of the Pennines " . The Bowes Museum is situated next to the school . The school caters for pupils aged 4 to 18 , with pupils younger than 11 being taught in a separate on @-@ site preparatory school ( Prep School ) . The original building is now used mainly for accommodation and administration and is described as " stately " by The Independent . The school spire is known colloquially as " The <unk> " .

 The school 's chapel was completed in 1911 . It was designed by W. D. Caroe , and Nikolaus Pevsner described it as " impressive " both internally and externally . Somewhat unusually , it is oriented in a North / South direction . A large proportion of the funding to build the chapel was provided by Lord Barnard , the local nobleman and a leading freemason ( with the remainder made up from public subscription ) , and accordingly the foundation ceremony was performed in full masonic regalia . The Grade II * listed building contains a painting by Ary Scheffer and a Father Willis organ . It has stained glass windows commemorating John Balliol and Benjamin Flounders , the two founders of the school . A roll of honour in the chapel commemorates the 141 former pupils and 4 Masters who died in the First World War , the 55 former pupils who died in the Second World War and one who died in the Falklands War . There is a roll of honour in the main school building for the former pupils who lost their lives in the Second Boer War .

 The Prep School has access to all of the facilities of the senior school . It is situated in a separate area of the school grounds with its own organisation , staff and buildings . The school is sited around a main building called Westwick Lodge , " a sprawling Victorian villa with the modern dormitories and classroom block hidden at the rear . It [ has ] a long , sloping front lawn , thickly planted with shrubberies ... Round the back [ is ] a playground and a muddy hill with a few trees " . Members of the Prep School are referred to throughout the school as " <unk> " . 
 The school was founded in 1914 and was originally a girl 's school , and independent from the County School . In 1989 there were just 65 pupils , all of them boys . By 2009 there were over 200 pupils , equally split between girls and boys . School on Saturdays was abolished at the Prep School in 1999 .

 = = = Intake = = = 
 40 per cent of senior school intake comes from the state sector , and over 50 per cent come from the on site Prep School . 25 per cent of Sixth Form pupil intake is from state schools . Day pupils commute from a geographically large catchment area that is predominantly rural in nature . These settlements are as far afield as Hurworth and Stanhope as well as larger settlements such as Kirkby Stephen , Durham , Bishop Auckland , Richmond and Darlington . Pupils are from a wide range of professional , managerial and farming backgrounds . There are 200 boarding pupils , significant numbers of whom have parents who are members of HM Forces , and many families are linked to Catterick Garrison , Europe 's largest military base , which is situated nearby . 15 per cent of boarders have parents living overseas , particularly Hong Kong . An Open Day is held annually when the school welcomes prospective students and their families to tour the school . It is held on a Saturday morning in early October . 
 = = = Academic and routine = = = 
 Every weekday ( except for Wednesday ) begins with a chapel service . School is held on Saturday mornings , with many sporting fixtures taking place on Saturday afternoons . There is an <unk> weekend every term when pupils get respite from Saturday school . The Sunday chapel service is compulsory for boarding pupils . Homework , which is always referred to as " prep " , ( short for preparatory work ) is set for every day with the exception of Sunday . During weekdays there is a mid @-@ morning coffee break for all pupils when refreshments are provided , a tradition from when many day pupils would arrive at that time from outlying settlements . The school uniform is traditional , including a black blazer and a tie . Merits are given as rewards for outstanding work . Punishments include weekday afternoon detention and Saturday afternoon detention . Corporal punishment had to be phased out by 1987 in line with state schools , as it received public funding . The headmaster is aided in his running of the school by the monitor ( prefect ) system . As well as the standard subjects , Latin , Classics , Ancient History , Greek , German and Spanish are taught . The school has a strong reputation for sciences . In 2011 the Independent Schools Inspectorate described the school 's ethos as " traditionally unpretentious " . 
 = = = Pastoral = = = 
 Pastoral care is provided through the house system . Each pupil is assigned to a house . Each house has its own accommodation in the school and its own set of tutors to look after members of the house . There are eight vertically integrated houses in total , each with its own colour and heraldic @-@ like shield : The two boys ' boarding houses are York ( red ) and Northumberland ( pale blue ) . The three day boys ' houses are Tees ( dark green ) and Dale ( burgundy ) , both formed by splitting Teesdale House , the first day boys ' house , and finally Durham ( gold ) , which was converted from boarding to day when the school expanded in the 1990s . The boarding girls belong to the original Sixth Form girls ' house , <unk> ( dark pink ) , and the new houses formed for day girls when the school became co @-@ educational are Marwood ( purple ) and more recently Bowes ( pale green ) . The school considered abolishing its boarding facilities when , like many boarding schools , it suffered a significant drop in numbers during the 1990s . However , numbers unexpectedly improved around the turn of the millennium , and this turnaround has often been attributed to the positive image that boarding received from the Harry Potter series . The school is interdenominational , whilst maintaining its foundation in Christian principles and values . 
 = = = Governance = = = 
 The school is a charitable trust governed by twelve foundation and seven nominated governors , the latter with links to Durham and Newcastle Universities , Durham County Council , Barnard Castle Town Council and the Old <unk> Association . The school aims to offer the best independent education to children from the North East of England . According to information provided to the Charities Commission , the income of the school was Â£ 8 @.@ 6 million in the 2011 â€“ 12 @-@ year , with the vast majority of the revenue coming from school fees . It has been a member of The Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference since 1944 . 
 = = Extracurricular activities = = 
 The houses form the basis for much competition within the school . The first competition in the school year is the House Singing Competition in which every member of the school takes part . Thereafter , throughout the school year , the houses compete against each other in a variety of academic , artistic , and sporting events . An extensive range of almost 100 after @-@ school activities are offered throughout the year , such as The Duke of Edinburgh 's Award scheme up to Gold level . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 Rugby for boys and hockey for girls are the major sports during the Autumn term . In the Spring Term the boys play football , hockey and squash whilst the girls play netball and lacrosse . Both boys and girls take part in cross country running and swimming . During the Summer term , cricket is the most important sport for boys . Teams have toured Majorca and the Caribbean in recent years . Members of the 1st XI often gain representative honours for their counties and the North of England . The school was described by The Daily Telegraph as " one of the premier cricketing schools of the north " . Girls focus on rounders in the summer whilst both girls and boys partake in tennis and athletics . Sports Day is a major fixture in the school calendar . 
 = = = Barnard Run = = = 
 The Barnard Run is a school competition , consisting of a cross @-@ country trial over a hilly course . It is the most important sporting event in the school year . The course has varied considerably over the years . It dates back to 1892 when Lord Barnard donated and presented the trophy . The race takes place annually at the end of the first half of the Spring Term . The girls ' and younger boys ' race is 2 Â¾ miles while the senior boys ' is 4 miles . 
 Historically the Barnard Run was a seven @-@ mile course which began at Towler Hill Farm , ran to <unk> suspension bridge , with an undetermined route back to the school . In 1898 a 4 @-@ mile junior Barnard Run was created for 11- to 14 @-@ year @-@ olds . In 1904 it was decided that it would be easier for training purposes if the run began at the school , and a new course was developed . 
 = = = CCF = = = 
 The Junior Officers ' Training Corps was established at the school in 1909 following an invitation from Lord Haldane , then Secretary of State for War . By 1911 it had 103 cadets and 3 staff . In 1948 all <unk> were superseded by the Combined Cadet Force ( CCF ) . As of 2012 it had almost 200 cadets and 10 staff , making it one of the largest contingents in the country . Facilities associated with the CCF include an armoury and an indoor shooting range . In 2012 the contingent won the Colts Canter competition , which saw it named the best force in the North of England . 
 = = Rugby union = = 
 The school has produced 37 U19 international rugby players , leading The Times to comment that it has " a happy knack of producing some of England 's finest rugby talents . " The Observer commented on the rugby success in 2008 , " Someone should analyse what they put in the food " . The most prominent are Rob Andrew , brothers Rory Underwood and Tony Underwood , and Mathew Tait who have all played for England at international level . Former headmaster David Ewart explained the school 's rugby ethos : " We believe the game breeds important life skills in those who play it . It 's a civilising game and you need to be a gentlemen on the pitch , as well as off . " During the period 1970 to 1995 no other British school produced as many England international players . In 2012 Tim Visser described his former school 's rugby programme as " brilliant " . 
 The school is a prominent feeder institution for the Newcastle Falcons , with signings over the last decade including Lee Dickson , Tim Visser , Alex Tait , Ed Williamson and Rory Clegg . Recent signings to other premiership clubs include Calum Clark , Alex Gray and Ross Batty . Many <unk> represent junior international sides , as well as the North of England , several northern county sides ( such as Durham , Cumbria , Yorkshire and Cheshire ) and the Independent Schools ' Barbarians . The 1st VII have appeared in the final of the North of England Sevens and National Schools Sevens . 
 The School 's 1st XV team reached the final of the national Daily Mail Cup for U18s three times in five seasons between 2002 / 03 and 2006 / 07 . Nicknamed the Barney Army , the team lost to Oakham School , Colston 's School and Warwick School respectively in the 2002 , 2003 and 2007 finals . In 2007 / 2008 , the 1st XV were beaten in the semi @-@ finals 19 @-@ 16 by St Benedict 's School . The school reached the finals of the National Schools Sevens in 2002 and 2005 .

 = Sir Lucious Left Foot : The Son of Chico Dusty = 
 Sir Lucious Left Foot : The Son of Chico Dusty is the debut studio album by American rapper Big Boi , released on July 5 , 2010 , by Purple Ribbon Records and Def Jam Recordings . It is his first solo album as a member of hip hop duo OutKast . Production for the album took place primarily at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta during 2007 to 2010 and was handled by several record producers , including Organized Noize , Scott Storch , Salaam Remi , Mr. DJ , and AndrÃ© 3000 , among others . 
 The album 's development was impeded by a dispute between Big Boi and his former label , Jive Records , over creative and commercial differences . Rooted in Southern hip hop , Sir Lucious Left Foot has been noted by music writers for its bounce and bass @-@ heavy sound , layered production , and assorted musical elements . Its lyrics deal with boasting , sex , social commentary , and club themes , featuring Big Boi 's clever wordplay and versatile flow . 
 Following a heavily delayed release , the album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 , selling 62 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , and spent 13 weeks on the chart . It also charted internationally and produced two singles , including the UK top @-@ 40 hit " Shutterbugg " . Sir Lucious Left Foot received rave reviews from music critics , who praised its varied sound and Big Boi 's lyricism , and was included in numerous year @-@ end top albums lists . Big Boi promoted the album with an international tour in 2010 . As of September 2010 , it has sold 175 @,@ 000 copies in the United States .

 Released in August 2006 , OutKast 's sixth album Idlewild and the duo 's musical film of the same name were met with a lukewarm reception from critics and audiences . Amid break @-@ up rumors , Big Boi and AndrÃ© 3000 announced their hiatus as a duo and plans for individual career endeavours . Unlike their fifth album Speakerboxxx / The Love Below , which included a solo album by each member , his album and AndrÃ© 3000 â€™ s own solo album will be sold separately . They intend to continue work as a duo after each of their solo albums are released . Prior to working on his solo effort , Big Boi had occupied himself with managing his Purple Ribbon imprint label and several acting roles , including a supporting role as a drug dealer in the well @-@ received , coming @-@ of @-@ age film ATL and the lead role as a rap mogul in the critically panned comedy film Who 's Your Caddy ? . In an interview with Vibe , he said that due to the Writers ' Strike at the time his further work in film would be on hold and expressed plans for new music . 
 After being approached by artistic director John McFall in 2007 , Big Boi collaborated with the Atlanta Ballet company on a production entitled big . As creative director , Big Boi recruited bandmembers , developed a story line , and worked with choreographer Lauri Stallings to put the project together . The production received good buzz and ran for six performances in April 2010 at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta . It featured him in a starring role as himself , a live band of musicians from the Purple Ribbon label , performances by Sleepy Brown and Janelle MonÃ¡e , and syncopated dance sequences set to OutKast hits and tracks intended for Big Boi 's solo album . In 2008 , he ended his three @-@ year " beef " with rapper and former Purple Ribbon artist Killer Mike . 
 The album 's title is derived from Big Boi 's long @-@ time moniker " Sir Lucious Left Foot " . In several interviews , he has explained part of it as a reference to the Southern slang phrase " gettin â€™ out on the good foot " , while describing the entire moniker as an indication of maturity , noting it as " my real grown @-@ man persona " and " like my Luke @-@ Skywalker @-@ becoming @-@ a @-@ Jedi persona . Like , I 'm just really serious about my craft , I 've mastered it , and I 'm very skilled at it , and I take pride in making this music " . He incorporated the nickname " Chico Dusty " to the album 's title as a dedication to his late father , Tony Kearse , who gained it while serving as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force and Marines . The spelling of luscious in the album 's title , Big Boi 's moniker , is intended to reflect on its distinctive pronunciation " loo @-@ <unk> " , which according to Big Boi , is not " the girl name ; you call a girl luscious , along the lines of voluptuous " . 
 = = = Record label = = = 
 In 2004 , OutKast 's original record label Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group . During their hiatus , Big Boi and AndrÃ© 3000 were pressured by Jive to produce an OutKast album instead of focusing on their solo work . In July 2009 , Big Boi left Jive Records , following creative differences and the label 's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album . According to Big Boi , Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere . In an interview for GQ , he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne 's " Lollipop " , stating " They told me to go in and make my version of Lil Wayne 's Lollipop ! I love that song ... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style ? ... That 's the highest form of disrespect ever . So that 's when I wanted to get off Jive . And the only honorable thing they 've done is allow me to do that " . Big Boi expressed that Jive viewed its intended singles as not " radio @-@ friendly " and the album as " a piece of art , and they didn 't know what to do with it " . 
 In an interview for MTV upon the album 's release , Big Boi explained that most of its material had been finished while at Jive , stating " It 's basically the same album . I could have been done , like , a year ago . But being that we were having creative differences â€” you know , every time they rejected what I was doing , I would go back in the studio and work on more stuff . The last two songs , ' You Ain 't No DJ ' and ' Be Still , ' were the last two records , but everything else was already on there " . Despite his individual release , OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive . After leaving Jive , Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO / chairman L.A. Reid , who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992 . He played Reid a track from the album , " Fo Yo Sorrows " , which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi . Following two months of negotiations , Big Boi signed a three @-@ album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010 . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Sir Lucious Left Foot was recorded over a period of three years , beginning on Martin Luther King , Jr . Day in 2007 . Big Boi has said that he " always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day . It 's a good luck charm " . The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta , Georgia , the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums . Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios , The <unk> Dreamhouse , and King of Crunk in Atlanta , Dungeon East Studios in Decatur , Georgia , Instrumental Zoo in Miami , Florida , and Kush Studios in Palm Island , Florida . Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio 's environment in an interview for The Guardian , calling it " comfortable but gritty enough to get you in a state of mind of being raw and ready to kill stuff " , while noting that the sessions were accompanied by " some candles , a little red light , maybe some crunk juice and a cigar ; every now and then perhaps a little ' purple ' " . While searching for a new record label , he completed recording for the album . The album was mastered on May 27 , 2010 . 
 In an August interview , Big Boi said that he planned to co @-@ produce each of the album 's tracks , with production also being handled by Organized Noize , Boom Boom Room Productions , Scott Storch , and Lil Jon . Noted for using synthesizers , electric pianos , samplers , and drum machines in his music , musician and frequent OutKast @-@ collaborator Sleepy Brown contributed with production as a member of Organized Noize and with vocals to several tracks . Big Boi has said that he incorporated various musical elements to the album , with " something from every genre , every funk , beat , loop , horn , whistle . We got it all on the record " . He has described Sir Lucious Left Foot as " a funk @-@ filled extravaganza ! You know , layers and layers of funk with raw lyrics and a lotta honesty " . 
 Big Boi also worked with other guest artists , including Jamie Foxx , T.I. , and B.o.B. AndrÃ© 3000 was to appear on three tracks , and produce a track for Yelawolf . Big Boi was introduced to Yelawolf 's music through his younger brother and invited him to record after seeing him perform . The track " Follow Us " features Vonnegutt , an act from Big Boi 's Purple Ribbon label . He originally proposed a rock @-@ influenced track for Yelawolf , but was persuaded by him to send the instrumental for " You Ain 't No DJ " . According to Yelawolf , he " wrote like 64 bars and turned in the huge verse " , which was edited down to 16 and eight @-@ bar parts of his original verse for the finished song . Big Boi also attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate with singer @-@ songwriter Kate Bush , and managed to work with funk music pioneer George Clinton on " Fo Yo Sorrows " , an experience he related to " Dorothy going to see the Wizard of Oz . He is the grandfather of funk ; when George speaks , you listen . He 's gonna give you that extraterrestrial funk ; you gotta be thankful for the way he beams it down to you " . In an interview for Blues & Soul , he discussed working with the beat for " Shutterbugg " after producer Scott Storch had presented it , stating " [ I ] brought my band in â€“ my guitar players , keyboard players , the <unk> â€“ and we just pissed on it ! You know , we put the P @-@ Funk on it , and just commenced to lyrically destroy the track " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Sir Lucious Left Foot features a layered and voluminous production , which Big Boi has described as " like someone 's pushing you around the room " . Rooted in Southern hip hop , it contains a bounce and bass @-@ heavy sound with dense TR 808 @-@ driven basslines , live instrumentation , and backing vocalists . Music writer Greg Kot calls it " a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art Southern @-@ fried party @-@ funk album " and notes its bass @-@ heavy sound as " full of surface charm , the type of music that is designed to sound big in a club , the soundtrack for a night of excess . But there â€™ s very little conventional about these beats " . 
 The album 's sound also incorporates diverse musical elements from various genres such as funk , soul , rock , dubstep , and electro music . Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a " new take on the traditional Southern rap sound . It 's slow and fast , wonky and flimsy , lyrical and hook @-@ driven " . Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives " 1980s synth @-@ funk " as its predominant musical element , but also finds each track musically varied , stating " New melodic elements flit in and out of tracks just as you start to notice them , and there 's a lot going on at any given moment " . Big Boi has called the music " basically what you been getting from Outkast . Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay your ears on . " 
 Big Boi 's lyrics are playful and irreverent , with clever wordplay and boasts , while incorporating non @-@ sequiturs , pop @-@ culture references , and tongue @-@ twisters . His rhymes are delivered through a fast , versatile flow and dexterous cadence . Rolling Stone 's Christian Hoard describes his flow as " inimitably slick and speedy " . Amos Barshad of New York notes his lyrics as " playful , but his flow is stern and unpredictable " . Sasha Frere @-@ Jones of The New Yorker describes the album 's mood as " decidedly upbeat " and writes of Big Boi 's rapping , " The musical DNA of ' Sir Lucious ' lies in a simple strategy that Big Boi has used for years : he often raps in double time , no matter what the tempo of the song is . This means that even the slower songs [ ... ] don â€™ t drag â€” Big Boi uses the space in the beat to provide another rhythm with his words " . Frere @-@ Jones describes him as " simultaneously forceful and careful " with his lyrics and compares his rapping technique to " the clatter of a machine , like a lawnmower , where secondary rhythms whisper underneath the main beat [ ... ] Big Boi is never laid @-@ back when he raps : he defines wide @-@ awake " . 
 Thematically , the album 's subject matter mostly concerns self @-@ aggrandisement , sex , social commentary , and " the club " . Music writer Omar Burgess comments that the album finds Big Boi " vacillating between a shit @-@ talking B @-@ boy , social commentary spitting vet and a ladies man with a wandering eye " . Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe notes " lissome rhyming about things frivolous and fraught " by Big Boi . NPR writer Andrew Noz views that his " spiral of internal rhyme schemes and stop @-@ and @-@ go cadences [ ... ] values style over substance but doesn 't neglect writing , whether battling imaginary rap foes or offering advice on fiscal responsibility " .

 " Turns Me On " has a comical beat and multiple vocals , including 1950s @-@ styled vocals during a break in the song . " Follow Us " features fractured , Afrobeat guitar phrases , sleazy synthesizer , and a pop refrain by Vonnegutt . " Shutterbugg " has a robotic stutter , falsetto refrain , female whispers and described by The Guardian 's Hattie Collins as " a futuristic , brain @-@ crunching slice of jittery electro hop " . " Tangerine " features blunt lyrics concerning strip club themes and a lascivious guest rap by T.I. The song incorporates various musical elements , including exotic Afro @-@ polyrhythms , psychedelic instrumental effects , booming bass , tribal beats , synthesizer vamps , and slow , <unk> grunge rock guitar . Tom Breihan notes that the song " somehow simultaneously sounds like strip @-@ club ass @-@ shake material and Funkadelic covering Morricone " , while music journalist Alexis Petridis writes that it " improbably burst [ s ] into something that most closely resembles a P @-@ Funk take on the mid @-@ 60s Batman theme . The lyrics , meanwhile , come in a breathless blur of druggy non @-@ sequiturs and pop @-@ culture references , some of it frankly baffling " . " Fo Yo Sorrows " features funk musician George Clinton performing the hook and has been described as " a seamless blur of old school Atlanta bass , current @-@ day glitch @-@ hop and Funkadelic @-@ style psychedelia " . 
 Several tracks on Sir Lucious Left Foot contain humorous skits with dialogue from additional vocalists , including Chris <unk> , Dax " Dirty Dr. " <unk> , Big Rube , Henry Welch , and Keisha Atwater . Welch and <unk> are featured in a skit at the beginning of " Be Still " , in which they make a reference to " tea bagging " . Dax <unk> concludes " General Patton " with a skit about a sex maneuver called " the David Blaine " , which according to the skit is " when you â€™ re making love to someone from behind , then have a friend take over and you run to a window and wave at your partner " . In an interview for Time Out Chicago , Big Boi was asked whether he " [ is ] taking credit for this , or is this something people do ? " , to which he responded " Yeah , man ! You know , man , they do it now ! " .

 Before his departure from Jive , Big Boi planned to release the album in 2008 . In January 2010 , he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account . In April , its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States . However , in June , Jive attempted to block its release , claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and AndrÃ© 3000 , as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label . In a June 7 interview for GQ , Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with AndrÃ© 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot , stating " Au <unk> ! They cannot block it . Au <unk> . Either they 're going to do it the right way , or they 're going to do it my way ... The fans ' thirst will be quenched . You know , I 'm no stranger to that Internet , baby . So you already know what time it is . The thirst of the fans will be quenched " . On June 10 , his website released the album 's track listing , which excluded tracks featuring AndrÃ© 3000 . Of his songs with AndrÃ© 3000 , he told GQ , " We 're gonna keep one of them for the next OutKast record " . 
 The album was made available for streaming at Big Boi 's MySpace page . Following leaks of several of its tracks , the album also leaked in its entirety to the Internet on June 29 . Prior to its official release , anti @-@ piracy companies had estimated that his tracks were being downloaded approximately 45 @,@ 000 times a day . On July 1 , Big Boi self @-@ released his mixtape Mixtape for Dummies : Guide to Global Greatness as a free download through his website , featuring tracks compiled by DJ X @-@ Rated and DJ <unk> from Big Boi 's solo recordings and work with OutKast . Sir Lucious Left Foot : The Son of Chico Dusty was released by Big Boi 's imprint Purple Ribbons label and Def Jam Recordings on July 5 in the United Kingdom and on July 6 in the US . A deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously in the US , with the inclusion of two bonus tracks and a second DVD of music videos for several songs . Big Boi 's official website store offered limited edition releases of the album , including the deluxe edition 's two discs , ivory white vinyl LPs , a limited edition T @-@ shirt , and a custom <unk> chain . In promotion of the album 's release , Converse produced a special limited edition run of Chuck Taylor All @-@ Stars shoes in August 2010 . The shoes were designed by Big Boi himself and feature the album title printed around the outer sides of the shoe 's heel . On the collaboration , Big Boi said in a statement " as long as I can remember music and Converse have gone hand in hand , so partnering up with them was a no @-@ brainer " .

 = New York State Route 348 = 
 New York State Route 348 ( NY 348 ) was a state highway located within the town of Chazy in Clinton County , New York , in the United States . It stretched for 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 10 @.@ 0 km ) from NY 22 in the hamlet of West Chazy to U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) in the hamlet of Chazy and passed under the Adirondack Northway ( Interstate 87 or I @-@ 87 ) . NY 348 did not intersect any state routes or pass through any communities other than those at each of its termini . 
 When NY 348 was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , it began in West Chazy and ended in the village of Champlain . The route was extended northeastward to Rouses Point by 1931 , then truncated to the hamlet of Chazy in the early 1960s . NY 348 ceased to exist entirely in 1980 , at which time its former routing became County Route 24 ( CR 24 ) . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 348 began at an intersection with NY 22 and West Church Street in the hamlet of West Chazy ( within the town of Chazy ) , located 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Flat Rock State Forest . NY 348 proceeded east along East Church Street , crossing over tracks once used by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad , reaching a junction with CR 25 ( Stratton Hill Road ) . At this junction , NY 348 turned northeast along Fiske Road , crossing over the Little Chazy River and nearby <unk> Brook . Bending further northeast through the town of Chazy , the route paralleled the Delaware and Hudson until reaching a crossing with the Adirondack Northway ( I @-@ 87 ) . 
 NY 348 and the Northway did not connect , as NY 348 crossed under the four lane expressway , crossing the alignment of a railroad spur and soon reached the hamlet of Chazy . In Chazy , the route crossed over the Little Chazy River once again then intersected with US 9 . This junction with US 9 marked the northern terminus of NY 348 . 
 = = History = = 
 The alignment that would become NY 348 between the hamlet of West Chazy and the town of Chazy was taken over by the state of New York and improved to state highway standards in 1907 â€“ 1908 . The 6 @.@ 34 miles ( 10 @.@ 20 km ) alignment was 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide and to be constructed with stones approved by the state with sand and limestone filler . The state engineer estimated that the improvement of the road would cost $ 58 @,@ 250 ( 1907 USD ) , and a contract was let on September 19 , 1907 to Jeremiah T. Finch , who commenced work on the new roadway in October of that year . The work was completed 11 months later ( September 1908 ) at the cost of $ 54 @,@ 111 @.@ 94 . 
 NY 348 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . At the time , it began at NY 22 in West Chazy and ended at US 11 in the village of Champlain . NY 348 had an overlap with US 9 from Chazy to what is now NY 9B in the town of Champlain . Here , US 9 forked to the east and followed the length of modern NY 9B to Rouses Point . NY 348 was extended east to Rouses Point along US 11 and what is now NY 276 by the following year . 
 In the mid @-@ 1940s , US 9 was rerouted to follow its modern alignment through Champlain , creating a lengthy overlap between NY 348 and US 9 from Chazy hamlet to Champlain village . The overlaps with both US 9 and US 11 were eliminated in the early 1960s after NY 348 was truncated on its northern end to its junction with US 9 in Chazy . 
 NY 348 was removed from the state highway system in 1980 . The designation officially ceased to exist on January 7 , 1980 , and ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Clinton County on April 1 , 1980 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The former routing of NY 348 was redesignated as CR 24 .

 York Castle in the city of York , England , is a fortified complex comprising , over the last nine centuries , a sequence of castles , prisons , law courts and other buildings on the south side of the River Foss . The now @-@ ruinous keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford 's Tower . Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of York , the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences . After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable , York Castle continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929 . 
 The first motte and bailey castle on the site was built in 1068 following the Norman conquest of York . After the destruction of the castle by rebels and a Viking army in 1069 , York Castle was rebuilt and reinforced with extensive water defences , including a moat and an artificial lake . York Castle formed an important royal fortification in the north of England . 
 In 1190 , 150 local Jews were killed in a pogrom in the castle keep , most of them committed suicide in order not to fall to the hands of the mob . Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone in the middle of the 13th century , creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design , supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse . During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338 , York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England , as well as an important military base of operations . 
 York Castle fell into disrepair by the 15th and 16th centuries , becoming used increasingly as a jail for both local felons and political prisoners . By the time of Elizabeth I the castle was estimated to have lost all of its military value but was maintained as a centre of royal authority in York . The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 saw York Castle being repaired and refortified , playing a part in the Royalist defence of York in 1644 against Parliamentary forces . York Castle continued to be garrisoned until 1684 , when an explosion destroyed the interior of Clifford 's Tower . The castle bailey was redeveloped in a neoclassical style in the 18th century as a centre for county administration in Yorkshire , and was used as a jail and debtors ' prison . Prison reform in the 19th century led to the creation of a new prison built in a Tudor Gothic style on the castle site in 1825 ; used first as a county and then as a military prison , this facility was demolished in 1935 . By the 20th century the ruin of Clifford 's Tower had become a well @-@ known tourist destination and national monument ; today the site is owned by English Heritage and open to the public . The other remaining buildings serve as the York Castle Museum and the Crown Court .

 York was a Viking capital in the 10th century , and continued as an important northern city in the 11th century . In 1068 , on William the Conqueror 's first northern expedition after the Norman Conquest , he built a number of castles across the north @-@ east of England , including one at York . This first castle at York was a basic wooden motte and bailey castle built between the rivers Ouse and Foss on the site of the present @-@ day York Castle . It was built in haste ; contemporary accounts imply it was constructed in only eight days , although this assertion has been challenged . The motte was originally around 200 feet ( 61 metres ) wide at the base . As it was built in an urban environment , hundreds of houses had to be destroyed to make way for the development . William Malet , the sheriff of Yorkshire , was placed in charge of the castle and successfully defended it against an immediate uprising by the local population . 
 In response to the worsening security situation , William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069 . He built another castle in York , on what is now Baile Hill on the west bank of the Ouse opposite the first castle , in an effort to improve his control over the city . This second castle was also a motte and bailey design , with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte . Later that year , a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse , and attacked both castles with the assistance of <unk> of Northumbria and a number of local rebels . The Normans , attempting to drive the rebels back , set fire to some of the city 's houses . The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and , some argue , the castles as well . The castles were captured and partially dismantled , and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes . 
 William conducted a widespread sequence of punitive operations across the north of England in the aftermath of the attacks in 1069 and 1070 . This " Harrying of the North " restored sufficient order to allow the rebuilding of the two castles , again in wood . The bailey at York Castle was enlarged slightly in the process ; buildings believed to have been inside the bailey at this time include " halls , kitchens , a chapel , barracks , stores , stables , forges [ and ] workshops " . By the time Domesday Book was written in 1086 , York Castle was also surrounded by a water @-@ filled moat and a large artificial lake called the King 's Pool , fed from the river Foss by a dam built for the purpose . More property , including two watermills , had to be destroyed to make way for the water defences . Over time the Baile Hill site was abandoned in favour of the first castle site , leaving only the motte , which still exists . 
 = = = 12th century = = = 
 Henry II visited York Castle four times during his reign . The royal chambers at the time were inside the keep for safety , and Henry paid Â£ 15 for repairs to the keep . During his 1175 visit , Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland . Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison , and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid @-@ 12th century . The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers and had to be repeatedly repaired . 
 In 1190 , York Castle was the location of one of the worst pogroms in England during the medieval period . The Normans had introduced the first Jewish communities into England , where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders , an essential but otherwise banned activity . English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population . Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown , reverting to the king on a Jew 's death . 
 Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and announced his intention to join the Crusades ; this inflamed anti @-@ Jewish sentiment . Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked . In York , tensions broke out into violence the following year . Richard de <unk> , who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln , exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York . Josce of York , the leader of the Jewish community , led the local Jewish families into the royal castle , where they took refuge in the wooden keep . The mob surrounded the castle , and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation , the Jews , fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over to the sheriff , refused to allow him back in . The constable appealed to the sheriff , who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep . The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews ' position became untenable . Their religious leader , Rabbi <unk> , proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob , and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths . Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob . A few Jews did surrender , promising to convert to Christianity , but they were killed by the angry crowd . Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre . The keep was rebuilt , again in wood , on the motte , which was raised in height by 13 feet ( 4 metres ) at a cost of Â£ 207 . 
 = = = 13th and 14th centuries = = = 
 King John used York Castle extensively during his reign , using the keep as his personal quarters for his own security . The castle was kept in good repair during that time . During this period , the first records of the use of the castle as a jail appeared , with references to prisoners taken during John 's Irish campaigns being held at York Castle . By the 13th century there was a well @-@ established system of castle @-@ guards in place , under which various lands around York were granted in return for the provision of knights and crossbowmen to assist in protecting the castle . 
 Henry III also made extensive use of the castle , but during his visit at Christmas 1228 a gale destroyed the wooden keep on the motte . The keep was apparently not repaired , and a building for the king 's use was built in the bailey instead . In 1244 , when the Scots threatened to invade England , King Henry III visited the castle and ordered it to be rebuilt in white limestone , at a cost of about Â£ 2 @,@ 600 . The work was carried out between 1245 and 1270 , and included the construction of a towered curtain wall , a gatehouse of considerable size with two large towers , two smaller gatehouses , a small watergate , a small gateway into the city , a chapel , and a new stone keep , first known as the King 's , later Clifford 's , Tower . 
 Clifford 's Tower is of an unusual design . The two @-@ storey tower has a quatrefoil plan with four circular lobes . Each lobe measures 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 5 metres ) across , with walls 9 feet 6 inches ( 3 metres ) thick ; at its widest , the tower is 79 feet ( 24 metres ) across . A square gatehouse , 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 5 metres ) wide , protected the entrance on the south side between two of the lobes . There are defensive turrets between the other lobes . Large corbels and a central pier supported the huge weight of stone and the first floor . Loopholes of a design unique to York Castle provided firing points . A chapel was built over the entrance , measuring 15 feet by 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 5 metres by 4 @.@ 2 metres ) , doubling as a portcullis chamber as at Harlech and Chepstow Castles . The tower is believed to be an experiment in improving flanking fire by making more ground visible from the summit of the keep . Although unique to England , the design of the tower closely resembles that at Ã‰tampes in France , and may have influenced the design of the future keep of Pontefract Castle . Henry employed master mason Henry de Rayns and chief carpenter Simon of Northampton for the project , and the cost of the tower accounted for the majority of the overall expenditure on the castle during this period of work . 
 The new castle needed constant investment to maintain its quality as a military fortification . Winter floods in 1315 â€“ 16 damaged the soil at the base of the motte , requiring immediate repairs . Around 1358 â€“ 60 , the heavy stone keep again suffered from subsidence and the south @-@ eastern lobe cracked from top to bottom . Royal officials recommended that the keep be completely rebuilt , but , instead , the lobe was repaired at a cost of Â£ 200 . 
 Edward I gave wide @-@ reaching powers to the sheriff of Yorkshire for enforcing law and order in the city of York , and the sheriffs established their headquarters in Clifford 's Tower . During the wars against the Scots under both Edward and his son , York Castle also formed the centre of royal administration in England for almost half the years between 1298 and 1338 . Many Westminster institutions followed the king north to York , basing themselves in the castle compound . The existing castle buildings were insufficient to house all the administrative institutions ; a temporary building inside the castle was built for the Court of Common Pleas at the beginning of the period , and rebuilt on a larger scale during 1319 â€“ 20 . The Exchequer took over Clifford 's Tower . Other buildings around the city had to be commandeered to absorb the overflow from the castle itself . As a result of the extended use of the castle for these purposes , the law courts at York Castle began to compete with those in London , a pattern that lasted into the 1360s . The castle eventually acquired its own mint in 1344 , when Edward III decided to create a permanent mint in York Castle to produce gold and silver coins to serve the needs of the north of England . European coiners were brought to York to establish the facility . 
 Henry III extended the castle 's role as a jail for holding a wide range of prisoners . The sheriff was responsible for the jail at this time , and his deputy usually took the role of a full @-@ time jailer . Up to three hundred and ten prisoners were held in the castle at any one time . The conditions in which prisoners were held were " appalling " , and led to the widespread loss of life amongst detainees . Prison escapes were relatively common , and many of them , such as the break @-@ out by 28 prisoners in 1298 , were successful . When the Military Order of the Knights Templar was dissolved in England in 1307 , York Castle was used to hold many of the arrested knights . The castle mills , as former Templar property , returned to royal control at the same time . Edward II also used the castle as a jail in his campaign against his rebellious barons in 1322 , and after the battle of Boroughbridge many of the defeated rebel leaders were executed at York Castle . 
 By the end of the 14th century , the castle bailey was primarily occupied by the local county administration . It was used extensively as a jail , with prisoners being kept in the various towers around the bailey . The old castle @-@ guard system for securing the castle had changed into a system whereby the crown used rents from local royal lands to hire local guards for the castle . Increasingly , royalty preferred to stay at the Franciscan friary , between the Castle and King 's <unk> on the Ouse , while their staff resided at St Mary 's Abbey and St Andrew 's Priory in the Fishergate area .

 In the 15th century , York Castle , along with Nottingham Castle , was considered a key security asset in the north of England , but investment even in these castles diminished . Repairs to York Castle grew infrequent from 1400 onwards , and it fell into increasing disrepair . Richard III recognised the issue and in 1483 had some of the most decrepit structures removed , but he died at the battle of Bosworth before replacement work could commence . By the reign of Henry VIII , the antiquary John Leland reported that the castle was in considerable disrepair ; nonetheless the water defences remained intact , unlike those of many other castles of the period . As a result of the deterioration , Henry had to be advised that the king 's councillors no longer had any official residence in which to stay and work when they were in York . The castle mint was shut down after the death of Edward VI in 1553 , and the castle mills were given to a local charitable hospital in 1464 . The hospital was then closed during the Reformation , and the mills passed into private ownership once again . 
 The castle continued to be used as a jail , increasingly for local felons , and a location for political executions . By the 16th century it had become traditional to execute traitors by hanging them from the top of Clifford 's Tower , rather than killing them at Micklegate Bar , the usual previous location for capital punishment in York . In 1536 , for example , the political leader Robert Aske was executed at York Castle on the orders of Henry VIII , following the failure of Aske 's Pilgrimage of Grace protest against the Dissolution of the Monasteries . For most of the period the sheriffs of Yorkshire remained in control of the castle , although there were some notable exceptions such as the appointment of the royal favourite Sir Robert <unk> by Edward IV in 1478 . At the end of the 16th century , however , the Clifford family ( Earls of Cumberland ) , became the hereditary constables of the castle , and Clifford 's Tower took its name from the family at around this time . 
 The deterioration of the castle continued into the reign of Elizabeth I , who was advised that it no longer had any military utility . Robert Redhead , the tower keeper , became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit . Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this , Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop . Proposals were made to pull down Clifford 's Tower altogether in 1596 , but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling .

 Maintaining the castle was becoming increasingly expensive , and in 1614 King James sold the lease on Clifford 's Tower and the surrounding land to John Babington and Edmund Duffield , a pair of property speculators . In turn , Babington and Duffield sold Clifford 's Tower to a York merchant family . In 1642 , however , the English Civil War broke out between the rival factions of the Royalists and Parliament . Forces loyal to Charles I , under the command of Henry Clifford , garrisoned York Castle and the surrounding city in 1643 . York effectively became the " northern capital " for the Royalist cause . Clifford repaired the castle and strengthened the walls to permit them to support cannon , placing his arms alongside those of the king above the entrance . Clifford 's Tower 's gatehouse was substantially remodelled , losing its original medieval appearance . Baile Hill , on the other side of the river , became a gun emplacement . The castle mint was reopened to supply the king 's forces with coins . 
 The war turned against the Royalist factions , and on 23 April 1644 Parliamentary forces commenced the siege of York . A Scottish army under Alexander Leslie came from the south , while a Parliamentary force under Ferdinando Fairfax came from the east . Six weeks later , Edward Montagu brought a third contingent to York , bringing the number of forces besieging the city to over 30 @,@ 000 men . William Cavendish commanded the city during the siege , while Colonel Sir Francis Cobb was appointed the governor of the castle . Despite bombardment , attempts to undermine the walls and attacks on the gates , the city held out through May and June . Prince Rupert , sent to relieve York , approached with reinforcements , and through clever manoeuvring was able to force the besiegers to withdraw , lifting the siege on 1 July . The next day , Parliamentary forces defeated Rupert at the Battle of Marston Moor , six miles west of York , making the surrender of York and the castle inevitable . On 14 July the city and castle surrendered to the Parliamentary forces , who permitted the Royalists to march out with full honours . 
 Parliament then appointed Thomas Dickenson , the local mayor , as the governor of Clifford 's Tower . Control of the castle rested with the post of mayor until the Restoration . Efforts were made to separate the structures of Clifford 's Tower , which Parliament used as a garrison , from the buildings of the bailey , which continued to be used as a prison . Oliver Cromwell visited Clifford 's Tower in 1650 , and received a salute from the guns stationed on top of it . The cost of the garrison was levied on the city of York . 
 After the Restoration of Charles II , the pre @-@ war owners of the property laid claim to Clifford 's Tower , eventually being granted ownership . A garrison continued to be stationed there , however , which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property . Repairs were made to the tower , and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot . Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat , which had become badly silted . Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period , including George Fox , the founder of the Society of Friends . 
 The county facilities in the bailey were expanded during these years , with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall , but by the 1680s the role of the military garrison at York Castle was being called into question . Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682 ; he argued that it would cost at least Â£ 30 @,@ 000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification , producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require . This work was never carried out . Meanwhile , the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York , who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority . 
 On St George 's Day in 1684 at around 10 pm , an explosion in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford 's Tower entirely . The official explanation was that the celebratory salute from the guns on the roof had set fire to parts of the woodwork , which later ignited the magazine . Most historians , however , believe the explosion was not accidental . At the time , it was common in the city to toast the potential demolition of the " Minced Pie " , as the castle was known to locals ; suspiciously , some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion , and no @-@ one from the garrison was injured by the event . The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current , slightly pink , colour . The now @-@ ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership , eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud . 
 = = = 18th century = = = 
 By 1701 , the conditions of the county jail had become scandalous and the decision was taken to redevelop the area occupied by the old bailey . A local tax helped to fund the development , and the king agreed for the ruins of St Mary 's Abbey to be cannibalised for building stone . Three new buildings were erected to the south of Clifford 's Tower . A new county jail , built between 1701 and 1705 by William Wakefield , was placed on the south side , closely resembling the fashionable work of John Vanbrugh . The local architect John Carr then built the Assize Courts on the site of the old Jury House between 1773 and 1777 on the west side , and oversaw the replacement of the Sessions House and Common Hall by the Female Prison between 1780 and 1783 on the east side . The Female Prison and county jail were later combined to become the Debtors ' Prison . Both of Carr 's buildings were designed in a distinctive neoclassical style ; the Assize Court building was particularly praised at the time as being " a superb building of the Ionic order " . The castle courtyard was grassed over to form a circle in 1777 and became known as the " Eye of the Ridings " because it was used for the election of members of parliament for York . 
 Visits by the prison reformer John Howard as part of the research for his book The State of the Prisons found these prisons flawed , but in relatively good condition compared to others at the time . The Debtors ' Prison as a whole was an " honour to the county " of York , with " airy and healthy " rooms , but the felons ' wing of the prison attracted some criticism . The felons ' wing was " too small " and had " no water " for the inmates ; felons were forced to sleep on piles of straw on the floor . Indeed , conditions were so bad in the felons ' wing that nine prisoners suffocated in one night during 1739 . 
 Just outside the main walls , the castle mills had become increasingly ineffective from the 16th century onwards because of a reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water @-@ wheels . As a result , in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam engine to drive the machinery ; this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise . 
 = = = 19th and 20th centuries = = = 
 Criticism of the castle prison increased at the end of the 18th century . The facilities were felt to be inadequate and the crowds of spectators who gathered outside the prison to see inmates being taken into York for execution unseemly . Attempts were made to improve the way executions were carried out from 1803 onwards : the former castle courtyard , the Eye of the Ridings , was used for this purpose instead , although crowds still gathered outside the bailey to watch the slow deaths of the prisoners . By 1813 the execution process had been sped up by the introduction of the " short drop " method of hanging , allowing the unusually rapid execution of fourteen Luddite agitators at the castle in 1814 . Overcrowding in the jail was now also a problem , with up to 114 prisoners being held at any one time ; occasionally , around forty prisoners awaiting trial had to be kept in the jail yard for lack of space elsewhere . 
 The suitability of the prison was finally brought to a head at the 1821 assizes in York , when an official complaint was made and an investigation begun . The decision was taken to purchase Clifford 's Tower and the Waud house , with the aim of demolishing them both to make room for a new , more modern prison . Sydney Smith , the famous wit , writer and vicar of Foston @-@ le @-@ Clay , successfully led a campaign to save Clifford 's Tower , emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city . An alternative proposal , put forward by architect Robert Wallace , would have seen the conversion of Clifford 's Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design , but this was turned down . 
 In 1825 , Clifford 's Tower and the Waud house were purchased by the county of Yorkshire at the cost of Â£ 8 @,@ 800 ( Â£ 665 @,@ 000 at 2009 prices ) . The new prison buildings , designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews , were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style , including a gatehouse 35 feet ( 11 metres ) high and a radial prison block , protected by a long , high stone wall . The prison , considered to be the strongest such building in England , was built entirely of stone to be both secure and fireproof . Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance , although the prison itself was considered healthy and well ventilated . Clifford 's Tower played no part in the formal design of the prison , although the talus , or sloping edge of the motte , was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow more space for the new prison building . The backyard of the Female Prison , concealed from public view by the new wall , was used for hangings from 1868 onwards . The Prison Act , 1877 , reformed the English prison system , and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year . It was used as the county prison until 1900 , when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison , and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead . 
 By the early 19th century , dredging and other improvements to the river Foss had made it possible to import flour into York by river , reducing the economic significance of the castle mills . In 1856 , the castle mills were finally demolished as part of a further sequence of improvements to this part of the river . The King 's Pool that formed part of the castle 's water defences was drained . With the construction of several new bridges near the castle , the site became " surrounded by roads instead of moats " . 
 In 1890 the Prison Commissioners agreed to declare Clifford 's Tower a national monument and to conserve it as a historic location . In 1902 Clifford 's Tower was given to Yorkshire County Council , together with a grant of Â£ 3 @,@ 000 ( Â£ 242 @,@ 000 at 2009 prices ) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs . The removal of the talus and the damage to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte , causing a recurrence of the 14th century subsidence . Sir Basil Mott , a leading Victorian engineer , installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse . By the early 20th century , Clifford 's Tower was regularly open to visitors , and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument . 
 = = Today = = 
 York Prison finally closed in 1929 , and the Tudor Gothic Victorian prison buildings were demolished in 1935 . The Assize Courts building now houses the York Crown Court , while the former Debtors ' Prison and Female Prison , together with a modern entrance area , are now the Castle Museum . The circular grassed area between these buildings that was once known as the " Eyes of the Ridings " is now known as Castle Green , or the " Eye of York " . Clifford 's Tower is the most prominent surviving part of the original medieval fortification , although the stone steps up the side of the motte are modern . Fragments of the bailey wall , parts of the south gatehouse and one of the corner towers also survive . 
 The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled monument . The site , managed by English Heritage , is open to the public . Until the 1970s , the pogrom of 1190 was often underplayed by official histories of the castle ; early official guides to the castle made no reference to it . In 1978 , however , the first memorial tablet to the victims was laid at the base of Clifford 's Tower , and in 1990 the 800th anniversary of the killings was commemorated at the tower . Recently , commercial interests have sought to introduce retail development to the area surrounding it . Citizens , visitors , academics , environmentalists , local businesspeople and Jewish groups have opposed the development with some success , winning a lengthy and bitter public inquiry in 2003 . 
 = Jarlshof = 
 Jarlshof ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is the best known prehistoric archaeological site in Shetland , Scotland . It lies near the southern tip of the Shetland Mainland and has been described as " one of the most remarkable archaeological sites ever excavated in the British Isles " . It contains remains dating from 2500 BC up to the 17th century AD . 
 The Bronze Age settlers left evidence of several small oval houses with thick stone walls and various artefacts including a decorated bone object . The Iron Age ruins include several different types of structure including a broch and a defensive wall around the site . The Pictish period provides various works of art including a painted pebble and a symbol stone . The Viking age ruins make up the largest such site visible anywhere in Britain and include a longhouse ; excavations provided numerous tools and a detailed insight into life in Shetland at this time . The most visible structures on the site are the walls of the Scottish period fortified manor house , which inspired the name " Jarlshof " that first appears in an 1821 novel by Walter Scott . 
 The site is in the care of Historic Scotland and is open from April to September . In 2010 " The Crucible of Iron Age Shetland " including Mousa , Old Scatness and Jarlshof was added to those seeking to be on the " tentative list " of World Heritage Sites . 
 = = Location and etymology = = 
 Jarlshof lies near the southern tip of the Shetland Mainland , close to the settlements of Sumburgh and <unk> and to the south end of Sumburgh Airport . The site overlooks an arm of the sea called the West Voe of Sumburgh and the nearby freshwater springs and building materials available on the beach will have added to the location 's attraction as a settlement . The south Mainland also provides a favourable location for arable cultivation in a Shetland context and there is a high density of prehistoric settlement in the surrounding area . Jarlshof is only one mile from Scatness where the remains of another broch and other ruins of a similar longevity were discovered in 1975 . There is a small visitor centre at Jarlshof with displays and a collection of artefacts . 
 The name Jarlshof meaning " Earl 's Mansion " is a coinage of Walter Scott , who visited the site in 1814 and based it on the Scottish period name of " the laird 's house " . It was more than a century later before excavations proved that there had actually been Viking Age settlement on the site , although there is no evidence that a Norse jarl ever lived there . 
 = = History = = 
 The remains at Jarlshof represent thousands of years of human occupation , and can be seen as a microcosm of Shetland history . Other than the Old House of Sumburgh ( see below ) the site remained largely hidden until a storm in the late 19th century washed away part of the shore , and revealed evidence of these ancient buildings . Formal archaeological excavation started in 1925 and Jarlshof was one of two broch sites which were the first to be excavated using modern scientific techniques between 1949 â€“ 52 . Although the deposits within the broch had been badly disturbed by earlier attempts , this work revealed a complex sequence of construction from different periods . Buildings on the site include the remains of a Bronze Age smithy , an Iron Age broch and roundhouses , a complex of Pictish wheelhouses , a Viking longhouse , and a mediaeval farmhouse . No further excavations have been undertaken since the early 1950s and no radiocarbon dating has been attempted . 
 = = = Neolithic = = = 
 The earliest finds are pottery from the Neolithic era , although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age ( see below ) . A site nearby has been dated to 3200 BC . 
 = = = Bronze Age = = = 
 The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2000 BC to 800 BC . The oldest known remains on the Jarlshof site date from this period , although there is evidence of inhabitation as far back as 2500 BC . The remains of several small oval houses with thick stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures show some similarity to Skara Brae on Mainland , Orkney , but are smaller and of a later date . These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation , a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation . 
 There is also evidence of a cattle stall with a waste channel leading to a tank in a courtyard and a whale vertebra set into a wall that may have been used as a tethering post . Broken moulds from the smithy indicate that axes , knives , swords and pins were produced there and a bronze dagger was found at the site . The objects indicate the smith was trained in the Irish style of working . Bone pins and awls also survive and an extraordinary bone " plaque " . This latter object is 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long , has three holes bored into the ends and is decorated with various linear patterns . Its function is unknown . The Bronze Age structures are overlain with sterile sand , suggesting a break in occupation prior to the next phase of building . 
 = = = Iron Age and Pictish period = = = 
 The inhabitants of the Iron Age built part of their settlement on top of the Bronze Age one . The structures include a complex roundhouse , replaced at a later stage by an " aisled roundhouse " . Neither have been dated although artefacts found at this level include querns that suggest the latter may have been constructed prior to 200 BC . 
 It is in this period that the broch was built . Part of the structure has been lost to coastal erosion , and modern sea defences have been erected . The tower was probably originally 13 metres ( 40 feet ) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas . During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind , and Jarlshof is no exception . An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial ( although rather poorly constructed ) house and byre at one time . This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse in the lee of the broch . 
 The earliest part of the wheelhouse complex has been dated to 200 BC , although other parts were built later , post @-@ dating the 1st century BC â€“ 2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries . Construction used the stones of the broch itself and two of the four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type . Three successive periods of construction were undertaken , and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays . One structure was built as a circular building and the radial piers were inserted afterwards . This may have been an earlier , less stable design . In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V @-@ shaped , in another all are to the latter design , again suggesting a developing style . Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built into the earth , the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards . 
 Amongst the artefacts dated to the later Pictish period is a bone pin with a rounded head probably used as a hair or dress pin . It has been dated to AD 500 â€“ 800 . " Painted pebbles " are associated with more than two dozen Pictish sites and one such stone was unearthed at Jarlshof . This rectangular slate fragment had a cross painted onto it and two small " S " shaped scrolls suggesting an association with Christian beliefs . One of only two Pictish symbol stones found in Shetland was found here , exhibiting a double disc shape and a Z @-@ rod . Pottery finds include buff ware from the period after AD 10 , including bowls with flat rims . The quality of the pots appears to decline in the period prior to Viking settlement , becoming thinner @-@ walled and generally more crude in design . 
 = = = Norse period = = = 
 Remains from this era used to cover most of the site , and it is believed the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries . Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle found the first confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities . Sheep , cattle , pigs and ponies were kept , Atlantic cod , <unk> and ling were eaten , and whale and seal bones have also been found along with the remains of a single dog . Chicken bones are rare in the Norse levels . 
 There are seven Norse @-@ era houses at Jarlshof , although no more than two were in use at one time . There were several outbuildings , including a small square structure with a large hearth that may have been a sauna and which was later replaced by two separate outhouses . The largest house from this period is a 20 metres ( 66 ft ) by 5 metres ( 16 ft ) rectangular chamber with opposing doors , timber benches along the long sides , and a hearth in the centre . Unlike the earlier structures that had conical thatched roofs , those of the Norse buildings had ridged timber frames . At a later period this large structure was also used to shelter domesticated animals ( at which stage it had a paved centre and animal stalls along the sides ) and later still may have become an outbuilding . The door to the byre puzzled archaeologists as it appeared to be too narrow to admit a cow . The mystery was solved when a byre door was excavated at <unk> on Unst which had a narrow base similar to Jarlshof 's but which widened out to become cow @-@ shaped . Another outbuilding has been interpreted as a corn @-@ drying room . Later houses were built at 90 degrees to the longhouse and these are of a type and size that is similar to croft houses that were common in Shetland until the mid @-@ 19th century . 
 One hundred and fifty loom weights were found suggesting wool was an important aspect of Norse @-@ era life . Line weights from the later Norse period and associated evidence from elsewhere in Shetland indicates that deep @-@ water fishing was also a regular undertaking . The Jarlshof site also produced ample evidence of the use of iron tools such as shears , scissors , sickles , and a fish @-@ hook and knife . The ore was locally obtained bog iron . Hazel , birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber . 
 Drawings scratched on slate have been found of dragon @-@ prowed ships , portraits of an old man and of a young , bearded man and of a four @-@ legged animal . The drawings were found in the Viking levels but are Pictish in style and may either pre @-@ date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next . Similarly , although the rectangular shape of the Norse @-@ era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style , the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way . The Viking @-@ style loom weights , spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design . A bronze â€“ gilt harness mounting made in Ireland in the 8th or 9th centuries has also been found and many items from this period are in the Shetland Museum . Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain . 
 = = = Old House of Sumburgh = = = 
 The castle , now known as Jarlshof House , was built during the Scottish period . Originally a medieval stone farmhouse , it was converted into a fortified house during the 16th century , by Robert Stewart , 1st Earl of Orkney after Scotland annexed Shetland . The building was named " New Hall " at this time . It was further modernised in the early 17th century by his son Patrick Stewart , 2nd Earl of Orkney who renamed it the " Old House of Sumburgh " but it was abandoned in the late 17th century . The structure was also formerly known as " The laird 's house " and " Stewart Mansion " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Walter Scott set part of his 1821 novel The Pirate in the Old House of Sumburgh during the 17th century , which he named Jarlshof . 
 " Man , however , had in former days considered this as a remote or unlikely event ; for a Norwegian chief of other times , or , as other accounts said , and as the name of Jarlshof seemed to imply an ancient Earl of the Orkneys had elected this neck of land as the place for establishing a mansion @-@ house . It has been long entirely deserted , and the vestiges only can be discerned with difficulty ; for the loose sand , borne on the <unk> gales of those stormy regions , has overblown , and almost buried , the ruins of the buildings ; but in the end of the seventeenth century , a part of the Earl 's mansion was still entire and habitable . It was a rude building of rough stone , with nothing about it to gratify the eye , or to excite the imagination ; a large old @-@ fashioned narrow house , with a very steep roof , covered with flags composed of grey sandstone , would perhaps convey the best of idea of the place to a modern reader . The windows were few , very small in size , and distributed up and down the building with utter contempt of regularity . Against the main structure had rested , in former times , certain smaller compartments of the mansion @-@ house , containing offices , or subordinate apartments , necessary for the Earl 's retainers and <unk> . But these had become ruinous ; and the rafters had been taken down for fire @-@ wood , or for other purposes ; the walls had given way in many places ; and , to complete the devastation , the sand had already drifted amongst the ruins , and filled up what had been once the chambers the contained , to the depth of two or three feet . 
 " Amid this desolation , the inhabitants of Jarlshof had contrived , by constant labour and attention , to keep in order a few roods of land , which had been enclosed as a garden , and which , sheltered by the walls of the house itself , from the relentless sea @-@ blast , produced such vegetables as the climate could bring forth , or rather as the sea @-@ gale would permit to grow ; for these islands experience even less of the rigour of cold than is encountered on the mainland of Scotland ; but , unsheltered by a wall of some sort of other , it is scarce possible to raise even the most ordinary culinary vegetables ; and as for shrubs or trees , they are entirely out of the question , such is the force of the sweeping sea @-@ blast .

 = Poedjangga Baroe = 
 Poedjangga Baroe ( pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Perfected spelling : <unk> Baru , also known by the intermediate spelling Pudjangga Baru ) was an Indonesian avant @-@ garde literary magazine published from July 1933 to February 1942 . It was founded by Armijn Pane , Amir Hamzah , and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana . 
 From the turn of the 20th century , the native people of the Dutch East Indies began to hold a greater degree of nationalism , evidenced in part by the establishment of several nationalist publications . Armijn , Hamzah , and Alisjahbana , three writers from Sumatra , laid the foundation for their magazine in September 1932 . They sent letters to forty contributors to the literary section of the newspaper Pandji Poestaka requesting submissions , as well as support from ten sultanates . When a deal with Dutch @-@ owned publishing house Kolff & Co. fell through , the founders agreed to self @-@ publish . The resulting magazine , Poedjangga Baroe , was first published in July 1933 . During its publishing run , the magazine took a wider scope and saw greater involvement from politically inclined persons . After the Japanese occupation of the Indies in 1942 , the magazine ceased publication . Another magazine under the Pudjangga Baru banner was published from 1948 until 1954 . 
 Ideologically , Poedjangga Baroe supported a modern , united nation with one language , Indonesian . However , the different cultural and political views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings . To maintain a neutral political position , the magazine published writings that covered numerous aspects of the political spectrum . In cultural discourse , the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country 's development . 
 During its nine @-@ year initial publication run , Poedjangga Baroe published ninety issues , including over three hundred pieces of poetry , five plays , three poetry anthologies , a novel , numerous essays , and several short stories . The publication , which never had more than 150 paying subscribers , received mixed responses . Young writers praised it for reflecting the period , while Malay traditionalists decried its perceived corruption of the Malay language . Although most of its published works are now forgotten , the shared themes and styles from 1933 to 1942 have led critics to deem the period the " Poedjangga Baroe generation " of Indonesian literature . 
 = = Title = = 
 The title Poedjangga Baru literally translates to " New Writer " . However , the term " Poedjangga " ( after the 1972 spelling reform , spelled " <unk> " ) has further connotations . The Old Javanese word " <unk> " , from which " <unk> " is derived , is rooted in a Sanskrit word associated with religious learning . As such , the title implies noble intentions .

 At the beginning of the twentieth century , the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies â€“ modern day Indonesia â€“ began to feel a sense of national unity , as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge . These native groups founded political parties to further their goals and represent their political ideologies , including the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian National Party . 
 This sense of unity was represented in new media . Dutch @-@ language magazines for educated native youth , such as the Jong Java ( 1915 ) and Jong <unk> Bond ( 1917 ) , advocated a modern national identity without the traditional feudal system . Nationalist views were advocated through magazines for adults , including Pandji Poestaka ( first published 1930 ) and Timboel ( first published 1932 ) ; these were short @-@ lived publications and only included literature as a supplement . There were also unsuccessful attempts to found Malay @-@ language literary publications , such as Malaya ( announced in 1921 ) . 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana , editor of " Memadjoekan Sastera " ( " Advancing Literature " , the literary section of Pandji Poestaka ) since its creation in March 1932 , met Armijn Pane when the latter began submitting poems . A vocal activist for literary renewal , in a September 1932 letter Alisjahbana called for new literary critics ( <unk> ) and asked Armijn to invite poet Amir Hamzah to help them form a group . After a long period of exchanging letters , they decided to publish a magazine together . The magazine , later given the name Poedjangga Baroe , was meant to advocate modernity and nationalism through literature , which had never been done in the Indies . The founders , all originating from Sumatra , also noted a lack of interaction between the increasing number of poets and writers . To avoid the creative limitations of the Dutch East Indies ' state @-@ owned publisher Balai Pustaka , they agreed that the magazine should be independent . 
 To gain support for Poedjangga Baroe , in October 1932 Hamzah was tasked with writing letters to solicit submissions ; a total of fifty letters were sent to noted writers , including forty sent to contributors to " Memadjoekan Sastera " . In January 1933 , Armijn went to meet Alisjahbana and Hamzah in Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) . The three discussed Armijn 's proposed budget and stated goal of promoting a national language . After the meeting , Armijn sent follow @-@ up letters to the previously contacted writers and reached an agreement with Dutch publishing house Kolff & Co . 
 In February 1933 , the group issued a prospectus that contained publication data and guaranteed that the magazine would have no fewer than sixty @-@ four pages per issue . Other writers , including Armijn 's elder brother Sanusi Pane and poet Muhammad Yamin , were called to serve on the editorial board . Worried that there would not be enough subscribers to support the magazine and hoping to ensure a good reception from traditional groups , the founders sent letters to leaders of ten sultanates in the archipelago asking that they subscribe to the magazine ; however , only Syarif Muhammad <unk> , the sultan of Pontianak , agreed to subscribe . 
 = = = Publication = = = 
 In the prospectus , Poedjangga Baroe 's founders stated their intention to publish in May 1933 . However , the initial publication was later delayed until July for two reasons . Firstly , Armijn intended to move to Batavia to help with the magazine and needed time to do so . Secondly , a conflict arose between the founders and Kolff & Co. about printing costs , eventually leading the founders to opt for self @-@ publication . This first edition included a foreword by educators Ki <unk> Dewantara and <unk> <unk> , eleven poems from solicited writers , and two essays , one by Armijn and one by Alisjahbana . The magazine continued to be primarily written in Indonesian ; indeed , the magazine was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors . 
 The nascent magazine , under the editorial control of Armijn and Alisjahbana , was initially poorly received by political parties and actors ; they considered the magazine , which was generally non @-@ political , liable to weaken the nationalist movement by diverting it into less important areas . To guarantee better support , people who were not writers or literary critics were accepted onto the editorial board . The first , <unk> , was accepted in 1935 . Other politicians involved during the end of the 1930s included Amir Sjarifuddin , Mohamad <unk> , and <unk> . During this period the magazine began to have a wider scope . 
 = = = Closure = = = 
 Poedjangga Baroe was closed with the fall of the Dutch East Indies government after the Japanese invaded the Indies in February 1942 ; the last issue published covered the period of December 1941 to February 1942 . The editors wrote in that issue that they intended to continue publication as long as feasible ; this did not happen , although later writers used a similar style . Until its closing , the original run of Poedjangga Baroe published about ninety issues . 
 After the Japanese surrender and towards the end of the Indonesian National Revolution , a second series was published under the same title by <unk> with new contributors , including Chairil Anwar , Achdiat Karta Mihardja , and Asrul Sani . The first edition of this new series , dated March 1948 but released in May , included a heated condemnation of the Indonesian leadership for perceived unwillingness to deal with the suffering which occurred during the occupation . This new publication , which Jassin described as unoriginal , ceased in 1954 . It was later replaced by Konfrontasi , led by Alisjahbana , which published bi @-@ monthly from 1954 until 1962 . 
 Poedjangga Baroe 's paid subscribers were always fewer than 150 . According to historian Heather Sutherland , this low circulation was rooted in several cultural factors . Firstly , the native populace at the time had limited literacy and education . Secondly , native intellectuals mainly spoke Dutch during formal discourse , while others kept to local languages ; this led to comprehension issues for the Indonesian @-@ language Poedjangga Baroe . 
 Throughout its publication , Poedjangga Baroe had more than 125 employees or contributors . Most were of Sumatran origin , with a high school or greater education in Westernized schools , and a good command of Dutch . They were modernists , and most were around the age of twenty five when they first contributed . According to Armijn , they were united by a view of life and not a shared literary style . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Poedjangga Baroe 's original stated mission , to advocate a new style of literature and language that reflected the Indonesian National Awakening , lasted until April 1934 . The scope was slowly extended to culture , art , and social issues in 1935 . After 1936 , the mission statement was that the magazine was intended to be a " guide to the new , dynamic enthusiasm to form a new culture , Indonesian culture " . According to Sutherland , however , the writers dealt mainly with the needs and opinions of modernist , pro @-@ Westernization intellectuals ; discussions of the socio @-@ political needs of the masses were few . 
 According to the 1933 press release , from the beginning Poedjangga Baroe was meant to include various types of literary works , including fictional prose , poetry ( in both modern and traditional forms ) , non @-@ fiction literary reviews and critiques , research , and opinion pieces on language and literature . The original run of Poedjangga Baroe published more than 300 poems and , in special editions , several poetry anthologies ; although prose was less prominent , Poedjangga Baroe published five dramas , one novel , and several short stories . Along with individual scholarly articles , the magazine also published special editions dedicated to collections of essays on the Indonesian emancipation figure Kartini and the Bengali literary figure Rabindranath Tagore ; the latter was published on the occasion of Tagore 's death .

 Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share a united political view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral . This stance was adopted to ensure the magazine did not fall afoul of the colonial government 's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government . However , writings falling under various parts the political spectrum were published , including works by cultural nationalists , a sonnet dedicated to Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg , and notes on fascism . 
 = = = Culture = = = 
 Although Poedjangga Baroe 's writers were united by nationalism , they had different views on traditional culture . Some , such as Armijn and Alisjahbana , considered an understanding of Western culture and history key to development . Others , such Sanusi , emphasized the need for Eastern values , though they accepted some aspects of Western culture . Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views . Main contributors , including the founders , came from religious backgrounds ranging from near @-@ secularism to orthodox Islam . Stemming from these conflicting cultural views , between September 1935 and June 1939 , numerous polemics were published in the magazine , discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 As opposed to the Balai Pustaka , which published works in regional languages and Dutch , Poedjangga Baroe was almost exclusively in Indonesian and worked to promote the language 's growth . Indonesian , declared to be the language of unity in the 1928 Youth Pledge , was further extolled by Armijn as having been long in development . This was expanded by <unk> , who wrote that the language had seen greater growth and deviation from old Malay since the advent of the Dutch Ethical Policy and foundation of Dutch schools for native Indonesians ( <unk> @-@ Inlandsche School ) ; the entirety of the November 1933 issue was dedicated to Alisjahbana 's writings on the language . Poedjangga Baroe held the first seminar on the Indonesian language in Surakarta in June 1938 ; the seminar featured papers by Sjarifuddin , Alisjahbana , Djamaluddin Adinegoro , <unk> <unk> , and Sanusi . 
 = = Styles and themes = = 
 Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were influenced by the Tachtigers , a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s . Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society . As opposed to earlier works published by Balai Pustaka such as Marah Rusli 's Sitti Nurbaya ( 1922 ) , which emphasized regional cultural values , prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity , and writers included areas that they had never visited . Old themes , such as forced marriage , were abandoned . According to Sutherland , most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in their works . Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago , these nationalist writers embraced Western culture ; Sutherland writes that some of the most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized . 
 Keith Foulcher , an Australian professor of Indonesian literature and language , writes that the poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms with an emphasis on aesthetic diction ; thematically , he writes , the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in the midst of natural beauty . According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin , the poems , though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction , retained Malay rhythms . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The release of Poedjangga Baroe was well received by young writers and intellectuals , who saw it as a way to express themselves and their nationalist ideas . Traditionalists , however , complained about Poedjangga Baroe 's modernization of Malay ; Marah Sutan , chairman of the Malay @-@ language Teachers Board , stated that it betrayed the " purity of High Malay and its traditional poetic forms " . Traditionalists also decried the introduction of loanwords to Malay from regional and foreign languages to increase the Indonesian lexicon and the deviation from traditional pantuns and syairs . Other Malay figures against the publication included Agus Salim , S.M. Latif , and Sutan Mohamad Zain . 
 The Indonesian literature published between 1933 and 1942 is sometimes described as from the " Poedjangga Baroe generation " , a reference to the publication 's dominance . Translator and literary critic Burton Raffel described the magazine as a " midwife to a literary revolution " , noting that the political revolution in the 1940s was likely influenced by the magazine . However , the aesthetic qualities of works published in Poedjangga Baroe have received mixed reception in the years after the magazine stopped publication . Indonesian poet and literary critic Muhammad Balfas argued in 1976 that most poetry published in Poedjangga Baroe suffered from over @-@ sentimentality and flowery rhetoric , which he blamed on the writers being influenced by the Tachtigers . Many of the works have since been forgotten . 
 Leftist literary critic Bakri Siregar condemned Poedjangga Baroe 's neutral political stance , arguing that its inability to objectively understand the needs of the people made it unfit to truly reflect the struggle for independence .

 Gregory James " Greg " LeMond ( born June 26 , 1961 ) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice ( 1983 and 1989 ) and the Tour de France three times ( 1986 , 1989 and 1990 ) . He is also an entrepreneur and anti @-@ doping advocate . LeMond was born in Lakewood , California , and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range , near Reno . He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy , with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations . 
 In 1986 , LeMond became the first non @-@ European professional cyclist to win the Tour de France , and he remains the only official winner from the United States . LeMond was accidentally shot with multiple pellets while hunting in 1987 and missed the next two Tours . He returned to the 1989 Tour , completing an improbable comeback by winning in dramatic fashion on the race 's final stage . He successfully defended his title the following year , claiming his third and final Tour victory in 1990 , which made LeMond one of only seven riders who have won three or more Tours . He retired from competition in December 1994 . He was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1996 . 
 LeMond was the first American to win the elite Road World Championship , the first professional cyclist to sign a million @-@ dollar contract , and the first cyclist to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated when the magazine named him as its Sportsman of the Year in 1989 . During his career , LeMond championed several technological advancements in pro cycling , including the introduction of aerodynamic " triathlon " handlebars and carbon fiber bicycle frames , which he later marketed through his company LeMond Bicycles . His other business interests have included restaurants , real estate , and consumer fitness equipment . 
 LeMond is a vocal opponent of performance @-@ enhancing drug use , and at times his commercial ventures have suffered for his anti @-@ doping stance â€” as in 2001 , when he first accused Lance Armstrong of doping and sparked a conflict that led eventually to the dissolution of his <unk> Bikes brand in 2008 , which was licensed by Armstrong 's primary sponsor Trek Bicycles . As the lone American winner of cycling 's most prestigious race , LeMond has not enjoyed the public stature that might be expected of such a figure , but he continues to campaign publicly against doping and ineffective leadership by the UCI , the International Federation for Cycling . In December 2012 , LeMond even articulated a willingness to replace the UCI president on an interim basis if called to do so . In December 2013 , the LeMond brand was revived , manufactured in partnership with TIME Sport International . 
 = = Early life and amateur career = = 
 Greg LeMond was born in Lakewood , California , and raised in Washoe Valley which is ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range , two miles north of Carson City and 18 miles south of Reno . His parents are Bob LeMond and Bertha ( d . 2006 ) , and he has two sisters , Kathy and Karen . He attended Earl Wooster High School in Reno , NV . Greg frequently rode his bike to high school , sometimes cutting class to get home early . He would then ride a loop west over Mt . Rose , south along Lake Tahoe , then east on Hwy 28 to Carson City . Then Greg would follow Carson Street over the hill to Washoe Valley and his home . 
 LeMond 's introduction to cycling came in 1975 thanks to freestyle skiing pioneer Wayne Wong , who recommended the bike as an ideal off @-@ season training aid . LeMond started competing in 1976 , and after dominating the Intermediate category ( 13 â€“ 15 ) and winning the first 11 races he entered , he received permission to ride against older , more seasoned competitors in the Junior ( 16 â€“ 19 ) category . 
 In 1977 , while still only 15 , LeMond finished second in the Tour of Fresno to John Howard , then United States 's top road cyclist and the 1971 Pan American Games champion . LeMond caught the attention of Eddie <unk> , the US Cycling Federation 's national team coach , who described LeMond as " a diamond , a clear diamond . " LeMond represented the United States at the 1978 Junior World Championships in Washington , D.C. , where he finished ninth in the road race , and again in the 1979 Junior World Championships in Argentina , where he won gold , silver and bronze medals â€” the highlight being his victory in the road race . At age 18 , LeMond was selected for the 1980 U.S. Olympic cycling team , the youngest ever to make the U.S. team ; however , the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow prevented him from competing there . 
 <unk> , whom LeMond described as his " first real coach , " wanted to retain his protÃ©gÃ© through the next Olympic cycle and discouraged him from turning pro , but LeMond was determined . Nevertheless , while he was the reigning Junior World Road Champion in 1980 , LeMond received no professional offers , and so in the spring 1980 , he joined the U.S. National cycling team for a 6 @-@ week European racing campaign . There , he finished third overall in the Circuit des Ardennes before winning the 1980 Circuit de la Sarthe stage race in France , thereby becoming the first American and youngest rider of any nationality " in the history of the sport to win a major pro @-@ am cycling event [ in Europe ] . " That victory , and the subsequent press coverage , raised LeMond 's profile in Europe and he was scouted at his next event ( the <unk> <unk> Breton stage race ) by French cycling coach and Renault @-@ Elf @-@ Gitane directeur sportif Cyrille Guimard . Guimard said he was impressed with LeMond 's spirit , and told him , " You have the fire to be a great champion , " before offering him a professional contract for 1981 with Renault . After he returned to the United States , LeMond won the 1980 Nevada City Classic , considered to be one of the most historic and challenging professional cycling races in United States . Despite eventually receiving several other offers to turn professional besides Guimard 's , LeMond did not consider them seriously , and he signed with Renault in Paris on the day the 1980 Tour de France finished . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 LeMond was a standout amateur rider " of superlative quality " and " exceptionally gifted , " who quickly established himself as one of the most talented cyclists on the professional circuit . Respected cycling journalist John <unk> , who reported the Tour de France for more than 40 years , described LeMond as a rider who was <unk> . 
 = = = 1981 â€“ 1983 : Early years = = = 
 LeMond 's first professional victory came three months into his 1981 debut when he won a stage of the French Tour de l 'Oise . He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States , finishing ahead of Sergei <unk> , the 1980 Olympic road champion . The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the DauphinÃ© LibÃ©rÃ© stage race where LeMond placed third . The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault . LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault , as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him . Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10 @-@ minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping . LeMond considered the race to have been a " major <unk> " in his career . Said LeMond : " It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races . " LeMond won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981 . 
 LeMond broke his collarbone on April 11 , 1982 while racing the cycling classic LiÃ¨ge â€“ Bastogne â€“ LiÃ¨ge . The injury forced LeMond to ride a reduced schedule before entering the World Championships , which were in Goodwood , England that year . In the men 's road race competition LeMond broke for the line but was out @-@ sprinted by Italian Giuseppe Saronni . Following the race LeMond 's American teammate Jacques Boyer accused LeMond of chasing him down in the final 800 meters . Saronni was very strong at the end of the race and flew past Boyer and LeMond , winning by 5 seconds over LeMond , with another 5 seconds back to Kelly . Boyer placed tenth . Bronze medalist Sean Kelly , a favorite to win the race , was with Saronni when he caught LeMond with about 200 meters to go , but he could not hold his wheel . Said Kelly : " I don 't think that Boyer was fading ... He got quite a good gap . Nobody wanted to go after him ... Yes , LeMond chased down Boyer . Boyer was the only man up the road . " 
 LeMond was supported by his teammate George Mount , who observed , " What 's LeMond going to do ? Throw his bike down in front of everybody because Boyer is such a good buddy of everyone ? ... Hell no â€” he 's going to start sprinting because it 's less than 200 meters to go and the sprint 's already been going for a couple hundred meters . LeMond made a good move and a good sprint ... Boyer was not going to win that race . The best he could have got was fifth or sixth place . " 
 LeMond did not apologize . The U.S. team was not set up as the European teams , and did not have an independent race to determine the national champion . Instead the highest finisher at the World 's was considered the national champion . LeMond had argued for the team to compete as the European teams did , but team management and Boyer voted against him . Thus unlike the other teams at the world championship , the US riders were competing against each other . Aged 21 , LeMond was the first American pro to win a medal at the World 's since Frank Kramer took silver in 1912 . Said LeMond : " I 'm racing for Renault and I 'm racing for myself . It 's a business and it 's my living . To me , that second place was almost as good as winning , especially at my age . " 
 Two weeks later , on September 20 , 1982 , LeMond won the mountainous 12 @-@ day , 837 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 347 km ) Tour de l 'Avenir by a world @-@ record 10 minutes , 18 seconds . The victory , and the time advantage LeMond held at the end , stunned Europe and provided broad confirmation that LeMond was indeed <unk> . 
 The following year , 1983 , LeMond won the World Championship outright , becoming the first American rider to do so . LeMond 's cycling talent â€” his overall strength , climbing ability , ability to ride a fast time trial and his capacity to recover quickly â€” all suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the most demanding Grand Tours . 
 = = = 1984 â€“ 1986 : Grand Tours = = = 
 LeMond rode his first Tour de France in 1984 , finishing third in support of team leader Laurent Fignon , and winning the white jersey of the young rider classification . The following year he was brought across to La Vie Claire to ride in support of team captain Bernard Hinault who had regained his form and was attempting to win his fifth Tour . French businessman and team owner Bernard <unk> signed LeMond with a $ 1 million contract over three years . In the race Hinault led through the early mountain stages , but suffered a crash and came into difficulty . At this point it was clear that LeMond was an elite rider capable of winning the Tour in his own right . LeMond possessed a natural talent for riding the Grand Tours , and got stronger over the course of a three @-@ week race . The injured Hinault was vulnerable , and his competitors knew it . Stage 17 included three major climbs in the Pyrenees . On the second , the Col du Tourmalet , LeMond followed Stephen Roche in an attack , but was not given permission to help build on the gap over the field . The managers of his La Vie Claire team ordered the 24 @-@ year @-@ old LeMond not to ride with Roche , but to sit on his wheel , a tactic to use the rider in front as cover for wind resistance so the following rider uses less energy . The pace Roche could put out by himself eventually slowed , and other riders came up to join the two men . Hinault recovered as well , though he did not regain the lead group . At the end of the stage LeMond was frustrated to the point of tears . He later revealed that team management and his own coach Paul <unk> had misled him as to how far back Hinault had dropped during the crucial Stage 17 mountain stage . Hinault won the 1985 Tour , with LeMond finishing second , 1 : 42 behind . LeMond had ridden as the dutiful lieutenant , and his support enabled Hinault to win his fifth Tour . In repayment for his sacrifice Hinault promised to help LeMond win the Tour the following year . 
 For the 1986 Tour , LeMond was a co @-@ leader of the La Vie Claire team alongside Hinault . Hinault 's support seemed less certain the closer the race approached . An unspoken condition was that his help would be contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider . Hinault was in superb form , and had the chance to win an unprecedented sixth Tour . Hinault chose to let the Stage 9 individual time trial be the decider for which rider would receive the full support of team La Vie Claire . Hinault won the Stage 9 time trial , finishing 44 seconds in front of LeMond . LeMond had bad luck during the stage , having suffered a punctured tire requiring a wheel change , and later in the stage a bicycle change was required when he broke a wheel . He was frustrated with the outcome and the impact it would have on how the team would function for the remainder of the race . In Stage 12 , the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees , Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead . By the end of Stage 12 , Hinault had a five @-@ minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders . He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond 's rivals , but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond . He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented . LeMond was never placed in difficulty , except by his own teammate . The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13 , allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes . The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps . On Stage 17 LeMond and Urs Zimmermann dropped Hinault from the leading group , and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the yellow jersey of race leader , the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States . The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb , but he was pulled back . Attempting an escape on the descent , he was unable to separate himself from LeMond . The La Vie Claire team leaders were both excellent descenders . As they ascended up the next col they continued to pull away from the field , and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb , the vaunted Alpe d 'Huez . They pressed on through the crowd , ascending the twenty @-@ one switchbacks of Alpe d 'Huez and reaching the summit together . LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity , but the infighting was not over . Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates Andy Hampsten and Steve Bauer . Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20 , LeMond offered the following with a wry smile : " He 's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France . He 's never helped me once , and I don 't feel confident at all with him . " 
 LeMond had to keep his eye on his teammate and rival throughout the race . Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked , and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable . LeMond would keep the yellow jersey to the end of the race and win his first Tour , but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership . LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career . 
 = = = 1987 â€“ 1988 : Shooting accident and recovery = = = 
 LeMond had planned to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire , but he was unable to participate . Earlier that year , while riding in the Tirreno â€“ Adriatico spring tune @-@ up race , LeMond fell and fractured his left wrist . He returned to the United States to recover from the injury . The week before returning to Europe , he went turkey hunting on a ranch co @-@ owned by his father in Lincoln , California â€“ in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada . LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades , his uncle and brother @-@ in @-@ law . The trio had become separated when Blades , who heard movement behind him , turned and fired through a bush . The movement had come from LeMond , who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2 @-@ sized pellets . LeMond 's injuries were life @-@ threatening , but fortunately , a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15 @-@ minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California @-@ Davis . LeMond was taken for emergency surgery . He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding , having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume . A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death . The operation saved his life , but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting . He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions . Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery , LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time . He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed , but the rest of the story was left somewhat vague . The events effectively ended his 1987 season , and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February , with the Dutch PDM team .
