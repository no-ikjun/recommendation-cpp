 The previous season , Delaware finished as the Division I FCS championship runners @-@ up and scored more than 40 points in seven of 15 games . However , their star quarterback , Joe Flacco , and running back , Omar Cuff , both graduated and went on to the NFL . Later in the season , the Blue Hens finished 2008 with eight losses for the first time in school history . 
 Delaware kicked off to start the game , and wide receiver Torrey Smith returned the ball 23 yards to the Maryland 32 @-@ yard line . Quarterback Jordan Steffy then led a Maryland drive , but the series ended when placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 48 @-@ yard field goal attempt . On the next Maryland possession , Egekeze missed another field goal attempt , this time of 45 yards . The teams then exchanged several punts before Maryland took over on the Delaware 48 @-@ yard line . Steffy completed a 36 @-@ yard pass to Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey , which set up a 12 @-@ yard touchdown rush also by Heyward @-@ Bey . Delaware drove 44 yards , but then missed their own 46 @-@ yard field goal attempt . With 3 : 33 left in the half , Steffy engineered a 47 @-@ yard drive to set up a 41 @-@ yard field goal attempt , which Egekeze missed for the third time . On the first play of the second half , Delaware quarterback Rob Schoenhoft threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes , who returned it 10 yards to the Delaware 46 @-@ yard line . On the next play , Steffy threw an interception to Erik Johnson , who returned it to the Maryland 49 @-@ yard line . The Terrapins ' next possession ended when , fourth and 18 , Steffy threw another interception at the Delaware one @-@ yard line . Incidentally , this put the Blue Hens in worse field position than if the Terrapins had turned over on downs . Soon after , Delaware punted the ball away . Running back Da 'Rel Scott then rushed for a 30 @-@ yard gain , which set up a 14 @-@ yard touchdown run by running back Davin Meggett . Chris Turner took over as Maryland 's quarterback on the second series of the fourth quarter after Steffy fractured his right thumb . On Delaware 's subsequent possession , Schoenhoft engineered an 80 @-@ yard drive , which culminated with a one @-@ yard touchdown rush by running back Johnathan Smith . With 3 : 20 on the clock , Schoenhoft threw an interception to safety Terrell Skinner . Turner then scrambled for a first down , and Scott converted for a second first down , which allowed Maryland to run out the game clock . Maryland won , with a final score of 14 – 7 . 
 In his first career start , Scott ran for 157 yards , but Friedgen thought he could have done better . Friedgen said , " He was a little tired from camp ... Normally , he would break some of those runs . I don 't think he quite had his third gear today . " Steffy played a solid first half , but in the second , threw two interceptions before suffering a season @-@ ending thumb fracture . He was replaced by back @-@ up Chris Turner who started for the remainder of the season . Regarding their loss , Delaware head coach K.C. Keeler said , " This is not like a moral victory . I don 't believe in moral victories ... This was not a payday for us ... We play a home game , we make more money than playing this game down here . When we scheduled this game , I thought our program would possibly be in a position to beat a solid ACC school . "

 Maryland traveled to Clemson to play in " Death Valley " , traditionally one of the most difficult ACC venues for opponents to play . Clemson firmly held the momentum of the game for the first half , and their running backs exploited holes in the Maryland defensive line . During that time , Clemson recorded two touchdowns and a field goal . Despite gaining excellent field position through recovering a fumbled punt on the Clemson 19 @-@ yard line and a recovered fumble on the Clemson 30 @-@ yard line , Maryland was able to produce just two field goals from those turnovers . The Terrapins drives were also blunted by penalties for two false starts and a holding call . 
 In the first possession of the second half , the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss , a false start penalty , and two incomplete passes . The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson drive . On the first play of their second series , wide receiver Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey executed a reverse to gain 76 yards before being stopped at the Clemson four @-@ yard line . This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith , and shifted the game 's momentum in favor of Maryland .

 Virginia went into the game with a 1 – 3 record and at the bottom of the ACC . They mustered only 36 points ( and just 20 points against Division I FBS teams ) in the previous four games , while allowing their opponents 128 points . Their last game had been a 31 – 3 defeat at the hands of Duke , which finally broke the Blue Devils ' 25 @-@ game ACC losing streak . 
 The Maryland offense had difficulty converting third downs , and managed only four on 13 attempts , while their defense allowed 226 passing yards and 201 rushing yards . Late in the first quarter , Virginia quarterback Marc Verica completed a pass to receiver Kevin Ogletree for a 51 @-@ yard touchdown , the Cavs ' first passing score of the season . Virginia was able to score twice more before half , to put the Terrapins into a 21 – 0 deficit . With seconds left in the second quarter , in a desperate gambit to recoup some points , quarterback Chris Turner attempted a hook and ladder play with a pass to Isaiah Williams who then lateraled to Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey , who in turn lateraled to Da 'Rel Scott . The maneuver picked up 45 yards before Scott was shoved out of bounds , and a flag was thrown for a late hit by Virginia . Since a half cannot end on a defensive penalty , time would have been added to the clock , but it was ruled that the foul occurred after time had expired . Therefore , the penalty was assessed after the kick @-@ off , and the Terrapins ' trick play was for naught . 
 In the third quarter , things got worse for Maryland as the Cavaliers added a field goal and another touchdown . In a final drive for 46 yards , Maryland attempted to avert a shutout . The effort fell short when a Turner pass was intercepted . The final result was 31 – 0 . 
 It was the first time Maryland was shut out since 2004 , when they were similarly defeated by Virginia in Charlottesville , 16 – 0 . It was Maryland 's worst shutout loss since losing to Virginia in 1997 , 45 – 0 , and the largest margin of loss since losing to Virginia Tech in 2004 , 55 – 6 .

 Ralph Friedgen stated that " We finally put a full game together . I think by far it 's the best we 've played all year . " It was Maryland 's fifth consecutive defeat of a ranked opponent , and the third of the season , making them 3 – 0 against ranked opponents , but just 2 – 2 against all others . The game also marked the first time that Wake Forest had been held scoreless in 124 games when it lost to Air Force in 1998 , and it was the first time since 1957 that the Terrapins had bounced back to shut out an opponent following a shutout of their own . The last Maryland shutout of a ranked opponent was in 1955 against UCLA .

 The results of that weekend 's games improved the clarity of the ACC Championship Game picture , but did not decide it . Maryland improved their ACC record to 4 – 2 and took the uncontested lead of the Atlantic Division . Florida State lost to Boston College that same day , which meant four teams were still able to secure the division title : Boston College , Florida State , Maryland , and Wake Forest . 
 Boston College ( ACC : 3 – 3 ) could travel to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland . Boston College eventually did just that , and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game . Florida State ( ACC : 4 – 3 ) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland , Maryland beat Boston College , and Boston College beat Wake Forest . Under those circumstances , Florida State would have finished with a 5 – 3 record , tied with Maryland . Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head @-@ to @-@ head . As it happened , Maryland lost to Boston College , which relegated Florida State to a second @-@ place finish in the division . Wake Forest ( ACC : 4 – 3 ) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College , and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland . In that case , Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records ( ACC : 5 – 3 ) , and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season . 
 Maryland ( ACC : 4 – 2 ) would have won the division title if they had either : ( 1 ) beaten both Florida State and Boston College ; ( 2 ) beaten Florida State , while Boston College lost to Wake Forest ; or ( 3 ) beaten Boston College , while Boston College lost to Wake Forest . That last scenario would have caused a three @-@ way tie between Maryland , Florida State , and Wake Forest . All would have possessed a 5 – 3 conference record , and no head @-@ to @-@ head tiebreaker would have been possible . In that case , the winner would have been decided by divisional record , of which the Terrapins would have had the best ( ACC Atlantic : 4 – 1 ) .

Steve Aponavicius 's extra point brought it to 28 – 14 . With 1 : 42 left , Turner completed eight passes including an 8 @-@ yard touchdown toss to Torrey Smith . With 0 : 14 remaining in the game , Maryland attempted an onside kick , but it bounced out of bounds . Boston College took possession and ran out the clock to end the game , 28 – 21 . 
 Boston College ended Maryland 's six @-@ game winning streak against ranked opponents . With a 7 – 5 record , the Terrapins ' postseason bowl game options were also limited . The Eagles secured the ACC Atlantic Division title and , with it , a trip to Tampa for the ACC Championship Game to face Virginia Tech for the second @-@ straight season . Boston College held the Maryland run to − 6 yards , forcing reliance on Chris Turner 's passing ability . It was the second game of the season the Terrapins were held to negative rushing yards ( this had also occurred against Virginia Tech ) . Turner , however , was able to throw for 360 yards , bettering Boston College 's total offensive yardage of 318 yards .

 Maryland achieved bowl eligibility through its sixth win against NC State . The Terrapins finished the regular season with a 7 – 5 overall record and 4 – 4 record against ACC opponents . Maryland 's conference record was identical to four other ACC teams , and the league fielded an NCAA record of ten bowl @-@ eligible teams . For the 2008 season , there were eight non @-@ Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) bowl games with ACC tie @-@ ins : the Gator Bowl , the Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , the Champs Sports Bowl , the Music City Bowl , the Humanitarian Bowl , the Emerald Bowl , the Meineke Car Care Bowl , and the EagleBank Bowl . 
 After Maryland suffered a fifth loss in the season closer against Boston College , it was very unlikely that the team 's preferred postseason game , the Meineke Car Care Bowl , would extend an invitation . The game 's selection committee in Charlotte , North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina ( 8 – 4 ) . Meanwhile , the EagleBank Bowl , hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington , D.C. , not far from the Maryland campus , secured in @-@ state rival Navy , but the game date conflicted with Maryland 's final exams . Soon after Maryland 's regular season finale , sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise , Idaho , was the most likely postseason destination . Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team , Boise State , and Ball State of the Mid @-@ American Conference . However , Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State 's homefield as unacceptable . 
 On December 7 , 2008 , Maryland accepted a bid to play in the <unk> 's Humanitarian Bowl against Nevada . The Western Athletic Conference ( WAC ) team likewise finished with a 7 – 5 record . Nevada was ranked the number @-@ five total offense and number @-@ two rushing offense in the nation with 510 @.@ 6 total yards per game . In 2008 , running back Vai Taua ran for 1 @,@ 420 and quarterback Colin Kaepernick for 1 @,@ 115 yards , and the latter threw for an additional 2 @,@ 479 yards . The Humanitarian Bowl executive director , Kevin McDonald , said , " We look forward to welcoming a Maryland [ team ] that defeated four Top 25 opponents and spent three weeks ranked ... Nevada comes in having played two teams , Texas Tech and Missouri , that were then ranked nationally in the top ten . They also gave ninth @-@ ranked Boise State their toughest [ WAC ] game . "

 Prior to the game , Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed a partial @-@ game suspension on seven players who violated the team 's pre @-@ bowl curfew , including leading rusher , Da 'Rel Scott , and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo . Consequently , a much younger line @-@ up initially started for Maryland during the early part of the game , including , according to Friedgen , some who probably would not have seen playing time otherwise . 
 The game started with Maryland receiving the kick @-@ off and on the first series , quarterback Chris Turner linked up with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59 @-@ yard touchdown . However , placekicker Obi Egekeze missed the extra point . Nevada quarterback and Western Athletic Conference offensive player of the year , Colin Kaepernick , responded with a drive which included a 68 @-@ yard pass to the Maryland 3 @-@ yard line . The Terrapin defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua , but a short pass was good for the score , and with the extra point , Nevada took the lead 6 – 7 . The Wolf Pack then kicked a 69 @-@ yard kick @-@ off to Torrey Smith , who returned it 99 yards for a second Maryland touchdown . Egekeze made good the extra point and Maryland regained the lead , 13 – 7 . On the next kick @-@ off , Egekeze attempted to kick the ball as it fell off the tee , resulting in a short squib , which was returned to the Terrapins ' 9 @-@ yard line . Kaepernick threw into the endzone where it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate for a touchback , but the Terrapins were soon forced to punt . Kaepernick advanced the ball downfield before a Taua 17 @-@ yard touchdown run . In the next series , Maryland sophomore Morgan Green rushed for three yards and then a 53 @-@ yard touchdown breakaway . Later , Turner converted on third down with a 16 @-@ yard toss to Ronnie Tyler and threw again to Tyler for a 14 @-@ yard touchdown . Turner tallied a two @-@ point conversion with a throw to Davin Meggett , and Maryland led at halftime 28 – 14 . 
 Wolf Pack running back Taua was able to capitalize after a Turner @-@ thrown pick and narrow their deficit , 28 – 21 . A sack against Turner knocked the ball loose , was recovered by Nevada , fumbled again , and finally recovered by the Terrapins ' Scott Burley . Turner then connected with Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey for an 11 @-@ yard first down and a fresh Da 'Rel Scott made his first touch of the game for another first down on the Nevada 23 . Turner was again sacked and fumbled , and Nevada recovered . Kaepernick then completed 38 @-@ yard and 21 @-@ yard passes to even the score , 28 – 28 . Turner converted on third down with a 26 @-@ yard toss to Torrey Smith . Scott was soon able to break open down the middle for a 49 @-@ yard touchdown run . On the next Maryland series , Da 'Rel Scott was handed the ball four times in succession and scored his second touchdown . With 4 : 01 remaining , Kaepernick led a drive starting from the Nevada 23 , before a scramble for a touchdown made it a one @-@ possession game with 2 : 19 remaining . Jaekle attempted an on @-@ side kick , but it was recovered by Maryland . Scott picking up a first down and clinched a 42 – 35 Maryland victory . 
 Maryland freshman wide receiver Torrey Smith , with his 99 @-@ yard kickoff return touchdown , broke the all @-@ time ACC record for single @-@ season kickoff returns with 1 @,@ 089 yards . Maryland running back Da 'Rel Scott rushed for 174 yards , earning Most Valuable Player honors alongside Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick who threw for 370 yards . Scott set the University of Maryland 's record for rushing yards in a bowl game , in what was just one @-@ and @-@ half quarters of playing time due to his curfew suspension . He also broke the 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard per season barrier , making him one of just seven players in school history to do so . Four Maryland back @-@ ups who saw significant play due to the curfew suspensions also scored touchdowns : second @-@ string X @-@ receiver Torrey Smith , second @-@ string slot receiver Ronnie Tyler , third @-@ string slot receiver Adrian Cannon , and third @-@ string running back Morgan Green .

 In Week 9 , after defeating Wake Forest to improve to a 6 – 1 record , Maryland was ranked 25th by both the Associated Press and the Coaches ' Polls . It was the first time the team was ranked since Week 11 in 2006 . Maryland would rise in the polls , and enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC State the following week . However , after the loss to Virginia Tech , the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether .

 At the end of the regular season , but before the postseason bowl game , Maryland lost two members of its coaching staff . On December 5 , 2008 , the school announced that defensive coordinator Chris Cosh would return to Kansas State to take over as assistant coach and co @-@ defensive coordinator . He joined the staff of the recently re @-@ hired Bill Snyder , who was Kansas State 's head coach from 1996 to 2005 . Cosh previously served under Snyder as his linebackers coach from 2004 to 2005 . For the bowl game , Maryland appointed outside linebackers coach Al <unk> as the interim defensive coordinator . Maryland also lost its special teams and tight ends coach , Danny Pearman , who was hired by new Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney . Pearman was a Clemson alumnus and played there as a tight end from 1984 to 1987 . At Alabama , he coached special teams and the offensive and defensive tackles from 1990 to 1997 , during which time Swinney played there as a wide receiver . For Maryland 's bowl game , third @-@ year intern Brian White acted as interim tight ends coach , and he assisted head coach Ralph Friedgen in directing the special teams . 
 After the bowl game , in February 2009 , the athletic department named offensive coordinator James Franklin the " head coach @-@ in @-@ waiting " , meaning that he would be the eventual successor to Ralph Friedgen . Upon the expiration of Friedgen 's contract in January 2012 , Franklin will be offered the position or paid a US $ 1 million contractual buyout . In June 2009 , Friedgen said he might like to stay an additional two years past his current contract , but athletic director Deborah Yow responded that the school could not afford the buyout . She said that any extension would have to be worked out between Friedgen and Franklin .

 = Colin Windon = 
 Colin " Col " Windon , ( 8 November 1921 – 3 December 2003 ) was a rugby union player and soldier who captained Australia – the Wallabies – in two Test matches in 1951 . By age 18 Windon was playing at flanker for his club Randwick in Sydney 's Shute Shield . After serving with the Second Australian Imperial Force in the Pacific Theatre during the Second World War , Windon resumed his rugby career in 1946 . He was first selected for Australia for their tour of New Zealand that year . Despite the Wallabies losing both their Tests on tour , Windon impressed with his play . 
 In 1947 Windon was selected for Australia 's tour of Europe and North America where he played 27 of his side 's 36 matches . He played all five Tests on tour , against Scotland , Ireland , Wales , England and France . In the match against England , which Australia won 11 – 0 after a dominant display from Windon that included two tries . He was appointed vice @-@ captain for the Wallabies 1949 tour of New Zealand , where Australia won both Test matches to win the Bledisloe Cup in New Zealand for the first time . 
 He captained his country in two matches against the touring New Zealanders in 1951 . Windon 's career ended after an injury interrupted tour to South Africa in 1953 . His eleven Test tries was the most by an Australian until the 1980s , and he was named in Australian rugby 's team of the century in 1999 . In 2005 he was honoured as one of the inaugural five inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame , and in 2013 was named as an inaugural inductee in Inside Rugby 's Invincibles . 
 = = Early life and sporting family = = 
 Windon attended Randwick Public School before Sydney Grammar where was a mediocre rugby player , and never progressed beyond the lower grades . He showed promise as a young cricketer and from Grammar was selected in a Combined Schoolboys representative cricket side . 
 Colin 's father Stan was a foundation member of the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club and played rugby with the Randwick club in Sydney . Both Colin and his brother Keith inherited their father 's love of rugby ; Keith played as a flanker for Australia between 1936 and 1946 , with his career interrupted by the Second World War . According to author Max Howell , Keith was a " football genius " , and was a star during the 1937 South African tour of Australia . It was after watching his brother play for Australia in 1937 that Colin decided he too wanted to play for Australia ; at the time Colin was struggling in school rugby , and his father said to him " Son , I don 't think you will ever play for Australia " . Keith was on the ill @-@ fated 1939 Wallaby tour to England ; the team docked at Plymouth , but the next day war was declared and they returned to Australia without playing a game . Keith did manage to briefly resume his career after the war , touring to New Zealand with the 1946 Wallabies , but he was diagnosed with gout while on tour and was forced to retire . 
 = = Club rugby and playing style = = 
 Col Windon joined Randwick in 1938 at the age of 17 , and started playing in the fourth grade . He had progressed to first grade when aged 18 , and went on to play 98 first grade matches with the club . Windon played at flanker or " breakaway " , and earned the knick @-@ name " Breeze " because , according to former Wallaby Max Howell " he ran like the wind " . 
 In an obituary of Windon , he was described as " not only a rugged , hard @-@ tackling breakaway , he was a speedy , elusive runner with a gift for scoring tries " . According to Max Howell – a fellow Wallaby – Windon claimed his best coach was his brother Keith . In order to analyse opponents , he would look up from the scrum before the ball was fed . 
 = = War service = = 
 Enlisting in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 18 December 1941 after basic training in Dubbo , Windon was posted to the 2 / 3 Infantry Battalion , 6th Division , He saw service in the Owen Stanley Ranges in Papua New Guinea where he contracted malaria , and after convalescence in the Atherton Tablelands he returned to New Guinea . He recovered to see action Aitape @-@ Wewak campaign in 1945 . Windon was a runner , and would weave and " zig @-@ zag " to avoid enemy fire . He was discharged from the Army on 13 August 1946 .

 Col Windon made his debut for Australia on their 1946 tour of New Zealand . His brother Keith was in the side ( the only player in the squad that had toured New Zealand previously ) which was captained by Bill McLean . Col Windon played nine of Australia 's twelve matches on tour , and played both test matches against New Zealand . The first test was played in Dunedin , where New Zealand won 31 – 8 . Despite the loss , the New Zealand Rugby Almanack described Windon as " the outstanding forward on either side " . The second test was a much tighter affair ; played at Auckland , New Zealand scored only one try to win 14 – 10 , but according to rugby writer Winston McCarthy , it was " only [ New Zealand fullback ] Bob Scott 's boot that prevented them [ Australia ] from winning " . 
 The following year New Zealand reciprocated and toured Australia . Windon played twice for the New South Wales Waratahs against the touring All Blacks , and in one of the two test matches . The tour was treated as a trial for Australia 's 1947 – 48 tour of Europe and North America that commenced later that year . Windon played 27 matches on the 36 @-@ match tour , and in all five test matches : against Scotland , Ireland , Wales , England and France . The Wallabies did not concede a try in any of their four Home Nations matches . 
 Windon scored eight tries to be the fourth highest try scorer on tour behind three @-@ quarters John MacBride , Charlie <unk> and Trevor Allan . He debuted as Australian captain in tour matches against Aberdeen and Leicester . In the Test against England at Twickenham he dominated the match – journalist Phil <unk> said : " I saw him [ Windon ] single @-@ handedly destroy England " . Windon scored two tries in the first half , with the second coming after England fly @-@ half Tommy Kemp spilled the ball which Windon collected before running 45 metres ( 148 ft ) to score . The try was converted to give Australia an unassailable lead . , and they went on to win 11 – 0 . 
 In 1949 a New Zealand Māori side toured Australia where they played three Test matches . The tour was organised by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( NZRFU ) after Māori players were excluded from the All Blacks ' 1949 tour to apartheid South Africa . Windon appeared in all three Tests , as well as playing for New South Wales against the tourists . He scored a try in all three Tests ; the first was won by the Maori , the second a draw , and the third won by Australia . 
 Later that year Windon he was selected as vice @-@ captain to Trevor Allan for a tour of New Zealand . The 12 @-@ match tour included two Tests against the All Blacks . The series against New Zealand , for the Bledisloe Cup , was considered a consolation for the Maori players after the " guilt " of the NZRFU for not selecting them for the All Black tour of South Africa that was occurring at the same time . Windon played in ten tour matches , scored eight tries , and captained his side against Manawatu @-@ Horowhenua . The Wallabies defeated the All Blacks in the two @-@ Test series , winning the first 6 – 11 and the second 9 – 16 . Windon scored in both matches , and despite the weakened opposition made history as part of the first Australian team to win the <unk> Cup on New Zealand soil . 
 Windon 's next Test was against the All Blacks when they reciprocated with a tour of Australia in 1951 . Keith Winning captained the Wallabies in the first Test of the series , but broke his jaw in an Australian XV match . He was replaced as captain by Windon for the second and third Tests – Windon 's only Tests as captain . All three Tests were lost , and New Zealand went undefeated on tour . It was during this series that Windon got engaged , and celebrated by inviting the entire New Zealand side to his house . 
 In 1952 he was selected for the domestic series against Fiji and later that year again toured New Zealand with the Wallabies . He played in nine of Australia 's ten tour matches in New Zealand . The Wallabies lost only two of their matches , a game against Southland , and their second Test against the All Blacks . In the first Test Windon harassed the New Zealand fly @-@ half with his aggressive defence , and pounced on a loose ball to score a try after the ball was dropped following a mistimed All Blacks ' back @-@ line move . The New Zealanders adjusted to Australia 's tactics to win the second Test 15 – 8 , but Windon did get the consolation of another try . 
 Windon 's last tour was to South Africa in 1953 , but he never fully recovered from an injury suffered prior to the tour , and only made six appearances . He announced his retirement immediately following the tour . Early in his retirement he coached his club Randwick from 1954 to 1957 . 
 = = Records and accolades = = 
 Following a tour of New Zealand , in 1946 he was selected by the New Zealand Rugby Almanac as one of its five players of the year . The magazine Sporting Life picked him in its All Australian team in five years 1947 , 1948 , 1949 , 1951 and 1952 . After being named in Australian rugby 's team of the century in 1999 , he was given a plaque on the Sydney Cricket Ground 's Walk of Honour . In 2005 he was honoured as one of the inaugural five inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame , and in 2013 was named as an inaugural inductee in Inside Rugby 's Invincibles . 
 For over thirty years Windon was Australia 's leading Test try @-@ scorer with 11 , until his record was overtaken by winger Brendan Moon in the 1980s . Upon his induction Australian Rugby Union President Paul McLean referred to Windon as " an electrifying talent and a try scoring machine " . His 1947 Wallaby tour teammate Sir Nicholas <unk> described him as follows : " As back @-@ row forwards go , he was the very best . A try @-@ scoring machine , a superb attacker and with the speed of a three @-@ quarter , the man they nicknamed ' Breeze ' was simply peerless in supporting play " .

Boulevard , outside the northeast corner of the Oregon Convention Center in the Rose Quarter of Portland 's Lloyd District . King is shown " stepping forward with conviction to deliver his powerful message " . He is surrounded by three allegorical figures : behind and to King 's right is a young white man with his sleeves rolled up who symbolizes the working American ; directly behind King is a woman wading ashore who represents the country 's immigration history ; and behind and to the left of King is a young girl , shown releasing King 's coattail , who represents " intergenerational respect " . 
 According to Dente , the working class man " has come to the realization and made the decision to step forward to announce his support for the universal message of equality , freedom and justice " . Dente described the girl 's release of King 's coattail as " a ' letting go ' process when one or more members of a family is called away to contribute their energy and time to a concept and struggle of greatest importance to all people of the world . " The artist dedicated the monument to King 's sacrifices , to those who believe in King 's message , and to the " ongoing march for truth and justice " .

 Paul <unk> , a local resident and entrepreneur who was described as the " unofficial mayor " of Northeast Portland , was " instrumental " in securing funding for the sculpture 's design . Cheryl Perrin and Betsy Brumm coordinated fundraising , with assistance from Charles Lewis ; before Lewis invited U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield , for whom he had worked as an intern , to speak at a breakfast fundraiser , fundraising efforts had stalled for eight years . Oregon 's Congressional delegation wrote appeals to large companies , requesting their support at the breakfast . Within six months of the campaign 's re @-@ launch , $ 300 @,@ 000 was raised , enough to create the sculpture . The Dream was dedicated by the Martin Luther King , Jr . Statue Foundation on August 28 , 1998 , the 35th anniversary of King 's " I Have a Dream " speech . It was also dedicated by Harry Belafonte and much of the Congressional delegation . John Jenkins , chairman of the foundation , said in a statement announcing the statue and its dedication : 
 Our dream began in the hearts of the students at Martin Luther King , Jr . , Elementary School nearly ten years ago . The dream was nurtured by the late state Senator Bill McCoy , and through the donations of Oregonians and some of our state 's most respected businesses ; we will have an original work of art honoring the memory and ideals of one of America 's greatest leaders . 
 Jeff Blosser , general manager of the Oregon Convention Center , said , " It is an honor for the Oregon Convention Center as well as our city , to have this significant sculpture placed here . It will be a very visible symbol for Oregonians , as well as the thousands of visitors who come to our state each year . " Dedication ceremony attendees included local educator Laverne Davis , who served as " Mistress of Ceremonies " ; Lee P. Brown and Vera Katz , mayors of Houston and Portland , respectively ; Mike Burton of the regional government Metro ; Charles Jordan , director of Portland Parks & Recreation ; Bishop A. A. Wells ; and Dente . Music was provided by the Martin Luther King Jr . Elementary School Choir , Ada Tillis , and the Accelerated Music Group . 
 In 2014 , <unk> shared with Oregon Public Broadcasting that he considers the project one of his proudest accomplishments . He said the project was a major undertaking and said that " it 's still surprising how many people don 't even know the statue is there " . 
 The memorial has been used as a place for gatherings . Charles Lewis announced his candidacy for Portland City Commissioner near the memorial in 2007 . In 2008 , a march honoring King began at the statue . In 2014 , the sculpture served as the first stop on a " Housing History Tour " of Portland , sponsored by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon , the Portland Human Rights Commission , and Race Talks . It has also been included in public art guides and walking tours . 
 = Braer Storm of January 1993 = 
 The Braer Storm of January 1993 was the most intense extratropical cyclone on record for the northern Atlantic ocean . Developing as a weak frontal wave on January 8 , 1993 , the system moved rapidly northeast . The combination of the absorption of a second low @-@ pressure area to its southeast , a stronger than normal sea surface temperature differential along its path , and the presence of a strong jet stream aloft led to a rapid strengthening of the storm , with its central pressure falling to an estimated 914 hPa ( 914 mb ; 27 @.@ 0 inHg ) on January 10 . Its strength was well predicted by forecasters in the United Kingdom , and warnings were issued before the low initially developed . 
 Gale @-@ force winds covered the far northern Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada , due to the intensity of this storm , with hurricane @-@ force winds confined near its center of circulation . After reaching its peak intensity , the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic , dissipating by January 17 . This storm caused blizzards across much of Scotland and led to the final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer , which had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand .

 A weak frontal wave , a low @-@ pressure system forming along a weather front with very strong temperature contrast , developed on the afternoon of January 8 to the southeast of Newfoundland with a central pressure of 1 @,@ 008 hPa ( 29 @.@ 8 inHg ) The system moved at a quick pace to the east @-@ northeast at around 110 km / h ( 68 mph ) , deepening slowly . As the storm tracked more northeasterly , development accelerated , and early on the morning of January 9 its central pressure had fallen to 988 hPa ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) . A new low pressure area formed along the system 's cold front to its south . By noon , the forward motion of the main cyclone accelerated to nearly 150 km / h ( 93 mph ) and its central pressure began to bomb , then down to 974 hPa ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) as it passed through the far northern Atlantic . This strengthening was enhanced by a strong jet stream with measured winds of 440 km / h ( 270 mph ) , and a stronger than normal sea surface temperature gradient along its path from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland towards Iceland . 
 The new low south of the main low strengthened quickly , and its central pressure dropped to 982 hPa ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . During the evening of January 9 , the main cyclone to the north continued to bomb out , with a central pressure down to 958 hPa ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) . Soon afterwards , it absorbed the deepening low to its south and this merger caused a period of extreme intensification . By early morning of January 10 , the pressure at the strong cyclone 's center had fallen to 926 hPa ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) northwest of Great Britain as it slowed its northeast motion . Hurricane @-@ force winds of 122 km / h ( 76 mph ) were recorded at a weather ship just to its southeast . Towards sunrise , the center of the cyclone lay 300 km ( 190 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Iceland . The system continued to slow as it turned north @-@ northeast , reaching its estimated lowest pressure of 914 hPa ( 27 @.@ 0 inHg ) later that morning . Weather buoys in the region with identifiers of <unk> and <unk> were not designed to read pressures below 925 hPa ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) , so when their pressures dropped to that reading , they stayed there until the storm moved away . 
 The system 's strongest winds were within 280 km ( 170 mi ) of its center , and the pressure difference within that region implied that sustained wind speeds of 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) were possible . Early during the afternoon of January 10 , a tremendous pressure differential existed between the center of the cyclone and a high @-@ pressure area over Spain , which had a central pressure of 1 @,@ 035 hPa ( 30 @.@ 6 inHg ) . This caused an extensive area of gale @-@ force winds which stretched from Newfoundland to Spain , and northeastward between Greenland and northern Norway . A large area of hurricane @-@ force winds existed within this area of gales . The center of the low transcribed a loop before resuming a slow northeast motion into the far northeast Atlantic . However , the system began to weaken , and by the evening of January , 10 its central pressure had risen to 920 hPa ( 27 inHg ) . By the evening of January 12 , its central pressure rose to 952 hPa ( 28 @.@ 1 inHg ) . During the evening of January 13 , its central pressure rose to 961 hPa ( 28 @.@ 4 inHg ) while located in the far northeast Atlantic . Within four days , the low dissipated west of Norway .

 The strength of this storm was well forecast by the British Met Office global weather forecast model as far as 84 hours in advance , which allowed forecasters in the United Kingdom to issue warnings related to the storm on the morning of January 8 , before the cyclone had initially developed . The sign of the North Atlantic oscillation switched from positive to weakly negative during the lifetime of this storm , which caused colder conditions to prevail in the Eastern United States and Western Europe by the time the system was dissipating . The British Isles saw their pressures fall as low as 957 hPa ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) during the mid @-@ afternoon of January 11 in Lerwick . Winds gusted to 194 km / h ( 121 mph ) at two locations : the weather ship Cumulus and North Rona , north of Scotland . Wind gusts of over 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) were measured across northwest Scotland . The highest precipitation amount recorded with this system across Great Britain was 37 @.@ 2 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) at Cilfynydd in South Wales . 
 Periods of rain impacted the British Isles early in the morning of January 10 , progressing from west to east . Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day , with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain . Within the area of wintry mix , the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland . Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours . Thunderstorms were observed despite the near @-@ freezing temperature readings . Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer , which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand . The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84 @,@ 500 tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands . The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks .

 This cyclone was slightly stronger than an intense low pressure area which moved near Greenland on December 14 – 15 , 1986 , which was the strongest extratropical cyclone known to occur across the northern Atlantic ocean at that time . Only three prior extratropical storms across the north Atlantic , and two since , have attained central pressures below 930 hPa ( 27 @.@ 46 inHg ) . 
 = Horton Hatches the Egg = 
 Horton Hatches the Egg is a children 's book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House . The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant , who is tricked into sitting on a bird 's egg while its mother , Mayzie , takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach . Horton endures a number of hardships but persists , often stating , " I meant what I said , and I said what I meant . An elephant 's faithful , one hundred per cent ! " Ultimately , the egg hatches , revealing an elephant @-@ bird , a creature with a blend of Mayzie 's and Horton 's features . 
 According to Geisel 's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan , the story was born in early 1940 , when Geisel left a window open in his studio , and the wind fortuitously blew a sketch of an elephant on top of a sketch of a tree . However , according to later biographer Charles Cohen , this account is probably apocryphal . He found elements of Horton in earlier Dr. Seuss works , most notably the 1938 short story " Matilda , the Elephant with a Mother Complex " . 
 Horton Hatches the Egg was published to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained popular with the general public . The book has also been used as the basis for academic articles on a variety of topics , including economics , Christianity , feminism , and adoption . Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who ! These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The book centers on Horton , a genial African elephant , who is convinced by Mayzie , a lazy , irresponsible bird , to sit on her egg while she takes a short " break " , which turns into her permanent relocation to Palm Beach . 
 Naturally , the absurd sight of an elephant sitting atop a tree makes quite a scene - Horton is exposed to the elements , laughed at by his jungle friends , captured by hunters , forced to endure a terrible sea voyage , and finally placed in a traveling circus . However , despite his hardships and Mayzie 's clear intent not to return , Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word , often repeating , " I meant what I said , and I said what I meant . An elephant 's faithful , one hundred per cent ! " 
 The traveling circus ends up visiting near Mayzie 's new Palm Beach residence . She visits the circus just as the egg is due to hatch ( after 51 weeks in Palm Beach ) and demands that Horton should return it , without offering him a reward . However , when the egg hatches , the creature that emerges is nothing more than an " elephant @-@ bird " , a cross between Horton and Mayzie , and Horton and the baby are returned happily to the jungle , rewarding Horton for his persistence , while Mayzie is punished for her laziness by ending up with nothing . 
 = = Background = = 
 According to Geisel 's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan , Horton Hatches the Egg was born in 1940 , the day after New Year 's , when he took a break from drawing in his Park Avenue apartment and went for a walk . When he returned , he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another , making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree . This account was based on interviews with Geisel , who had told similar stories about the book 's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957 . The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree . 
 Charles Cohen , on the other hand , found traces of Horton Hatches the Egg in early Dr. Seuss works . In an early installment of Geisel 's cartoon feature " <unk> and the <unk> " , which began in Judge magazine in 1927 , he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant . A few weeks later , he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a catalpa tree . In a 1959 cartoon for Life magazine , he depicted a dachshund who sits on eggs for storks . In 1961 , he drew an illustration for Judge that showed a walrus sitting in a tree , trying to hatch the eggs in a bird nest . Some of his earlier work also featured elephant @-@ bird hybrids , which prefigured the elephant @-@ bird that hatches at the end of Horton Hatches the Egg . 
 In 1938 , two years before Horton Hatches the Egg , Judge published perhaps the most obvious precursor to Horton , " Matilda , the Elephant with a Mother Complex " , a short story by Geisel about an " old maid elephant " who sits on a chickadee egg until it hatches , only to have the newborn chickadee fly away from her . In 1939 , Geisel created an advertisement for NBC featuring a sympathetic @-@ looking elephant lashed with ropes and contained in a cage made of sticks , similar to Horton 's situation when the hunters capture him in Horton Hatches the Egg . 
 In early drafts , the elephant 's name changed from <unk> to Bosco to Humphrey . The final choice , Horton , was apparently after Horton Conrad , one of Geisel 's classmates at Dartmouth College . The bird 's name changed from Bessie to <unk> and finally Mayzie . In the first draft , the elephant character volunteered to sit on the eggs for the bird , who was very reluctant . 
 = = Publication and reception = = 
 Horton Hatches the Egg was published by Random House in fall 1940 to immediate success . It received primarily positive notice from critics . Kirkus Reviews called it " sheer nonsense , but good fun . " The reviewer for The New York Times Book Review wrote , " A moral is a new thing to find in a Dr. Seuss book , but it doesn 't much interfere with the hilarity with which he juggles an elephant up a tree . To an adult the tale seems a little forced compared to his first grand yarns , less inevitable in its nonsense , but neither young nor old are going to quibble with the fantastic comedy of his pictures . " 
 The book also found early success with book buyers and the general public . It sold 6 @,@ 000 copies in its first year and 1 @,@ 600 in its second . Frances Chrystie , the juvenile buyer for FAO Schwarz , wrote to Bennett Cerf , Geisel 's publisher , " I 've been sitting alone in my apartment reading Horton aloud to myself over and over again ... It 's the funniest book I 've ever seen ... [ Our ] merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store , and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week . " Mary <unk> of James Book Store in Cincinnati , Ohio , noted the book 's popularity with adults as well as children . Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores , and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book . However , the book was less well received in England , where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it , to modest success , in 1947 . This mirrored a general trend , as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England . 
 Horton Hatches the Egg has remained popular in the United States . In 2001 , Publishers Weekly reported that the book had sold 987 @,@ 996 to that point , placing it at 138 in the magazine 's list of the best @-@ selling children 's books of all time . It was included in Six by Seuss : A Treasury of Dr. Seuss Classics , which was the main selection for the Book @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Month Club in June 1991 . In 1992 , less than a year after Geisel 's death , Horton 's refrain was included in the 16th edition of Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations . In 2007 , the National Education Association named the book one of its " Teachers ' Top 100 Books for Children " , based on an online poll . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Horton Hatches the Egg has been used in discussions on a wide variety of topics e.g. , economics , Christianity , feminism , and adoption . James Kemp , a retired United Methodist pastor , compared Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed . Like those early Christians , Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions , but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded , as evidenced by the elephant @-@ bird that hatches at the end of the book . 
 Richard B. Freeman , writing in 2011 about the contemporaneous economic situation in the United States , called Horton Hatches the Egg a tale of investment . Freeman argued that " economic growth requires long @-@ term investments " , as embodied by Horton 's sitting on the egg , and that " trust is important in a well @-@ functioning economy " , as embodied by Horton 's repeated maxim , " I meant what I said , / and I said what I meant . " 
 Alison Lurie , in a 1990 article about Dr. Seuss from a feminist perspective , criticized Horton Hatches the Egg as a statement for fetal rights and for its negative treatment of Mayzie . Lurie pointed out the almost complete lack of strong female protagonists in Dr. Seuss books and argued that Mayzie , who is obviously an antagonist and is depicted as lazy and irresponsible , is " the most memorable female character in [ Dr Seuss 's ] entire oeuvre " . Geisel responded to Lurie 's criticism , by way of his biographers near the end of his life , by remarking that most of his characters are animals , noting , " if she can identify their sex , I 'll remember her in my will . " 
 Jill Deans , in a 2000 article , used the book in a discussion of adoption , surrogacy , and particularly , embryo donation . She noted that it is " a classic tale of surrogacy " and that it " evokes the intricacies of the nature / nurture debate " . She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers , in the form of Horton , but vilifies birth mothers , in the form of Mayzie . Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book 's real @-@ life implications for Geisel and his wife . Deans draws a connection between the elephant @-@ bird in Horton and the <unk> , a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like . Nel , meanwhile , connected the book to the short story " Matilda the Elephant " . Noting that the <unk> could not have children , Nel argued that " Matilda " , and by extension Horton , may have been manifestations of the <unk> ' longing for children . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 The book was adapted into a ten @-@ minute animated short film by Leon Schlesinger Productions and released in 1942 as part of Warner Bros. ' Merrie Melodies series . The short was directed by Bob Clampett and marked the first time a Dr. Seuss work was adapted for the screen and also the only time WB animated short was licensed to be based on pre @-@ existing work still under copyright . 
 In 1966 , Soyuzmultfilm released an 18 @-@ minute Russian film adaptation called I Am Waiting for a Nestling . It was directed by Nikolai <unk> and won the Silver Medal for Best Children 's Film at Tours in 1967 . 
 In 1992 , Random House released " Horton Hatches the Egg " in its series of Dr. Seuss videos , narrated by Billy Crystal and directed by Mark Reeder . " If I Ran the Circus " is second in the double feature video . 
 Horton appeared again in Horton Hears a Who , published in 1954 . The plot of the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical , a retelling of a number of Dr. Seuss books , borrows heavily from both Horton books . 
 = Robert Bloet = 
 Robert Bloet ( sometimes Robert <unk> ; died 1123 ) was Bishop of Lincoln 1093 @-@ 1123 and Chancellor of England . Born into a noble Norman family , he became a royal clerk under King William I. Under William I 's son and successor King William II , Bloet was first named chancellor then appointed to the See of Lincoln . Continuing to serve the king while bishop , Bloet remained a close royal councillor to William II 's successor , King Henry I. He did much to embellish Lincoln Cathedral , and gave generously to his cathedral and other religious houses . He educated a number of noblemen , including illegitimate children of Henry I. He also was the patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon , and was an early patron of Gilbert of Sempringham , the founder of the Gilbertine monastic order . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bloet was a member of the Norman noble family that held Ivry in Normandy . Bloet was related in some manner to Hugh , the Bishop of Bayeux from 1015 to 1049 , and Hugh 's brother John , who was Bishop of Avranches from 1060 – 1067 . Another relative was Richard Bloet , Abbot of St Albans Abbey . 
 = = Chancellor and bishop = = 
 Bloet was a royal clerk in the household of King William I of England . He accompanied William I 's son , William Rufus , when Rufus traveled to England to claim the throne after William I 's death . Rufus named Bloet as chancellor by January 1091 , but then named Bloet to the See of Lincoln in March 1093 after the death of Remigius de Fécamp . Bloet was appointed at the same time that Anselm was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury , during a severe illness when Rufus feared he was dying . Bloet was consecrated at Hastings not long before 22 February 1094 , probably on 12 February the day after the dedication of the church at Battle Abbey . By 19 March 1094 he had been replaced as chancellor by William Giffard . 
 Prior to Bloet 's consecration , the Archbishop of York , Thomas of Bayeux , who had previously had a claim to supervise the see of Lincoln , tried to prevent the Archbishop Anselm 's consecrating Bloet . Thomas argued that the area of Lindsey , which was within the diocese of Lincoln , really belonged to the archdiocese of York . The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter alleged that Bloet gave Rufus £ 3 @,@ 000 to intervene on Bloet 's side when Thomas attempted to assert York 's claim to Lindsey , but another medieval chronicler , Henry of Huntingdon , who knew Bloet well , said that the sum was £ 5 @,@ 000 . This payment secured Rufus ' support in the dispute between York and Lincoln , which was settled in Lincoln 's favour . The sum of £ 5 @,@ 000 was extremely large , eight times what Domesday Book records as the bishop of Lincoln 's annual income . The king gave York the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald , Gloucester in return for the settlement in favour of Lincoln . Bloet also refused to profess obedience to Anselm , but when King William intervened on Anselm 's side , Bloet made the profession to Anselm . 
 Bloet was one of the chief administrative officers of the kingdom under William II , often associated with Ranulf Flambard , Urse d 'Abetot , and Haimo the dapifer . As a bishop , he moved the newly founded monastery of Stow to Eynsham instead . This church was considered a proprietary church and the bishops of Lincoln retained the right to appoint the abbot and installing the abbot in office . The monks of Stow had been established by his predecessor . Bloet also gave the manor of <unk> to the priory of Bermondsey , which became a Cluniac priory during Rufus ' reign . 
 Even after becoming a bishop , Bloet continued to witness royal writs , witnessing six of Rufus ' writs while bishop , to add to his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship . Bloet was one of the bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy . When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go , the king ordered him to leave the kingdom , with the support of most of the bishops and nobility . 
 = = Under Henry I = = 
 Bloet continued to be an advisor to the king even after Rufus was succeeded by King Henry I , and was a supporter of Henry during the rebellion of 1102 . During the rebellion , Bloet was sent by King Henry to besiege Tickhill Castle , which surrendered when the king joined Bloet with a larger army . When the king and Anselm clashed over investiture , the king persuaded Bloet to consecrate a number of the king 's abbatial appointments in 1102 and 1103 . Throughout Henry 's reign , Bloet continued to be a trusted councillor , and was often trusted with advising the queen when the king was absent from England . Bloet is only recorded as accompanying the king outside England once , in 1114 . He served as a royal justice often , being named by Henry of Huntingdon as one of the justices who were not restricted to one or a few counties but who served throughout England . During Henry 's reign , Bloet witnessed 155 royal documents . 
 When the new see at Ely was established in 1109 in a former abbey , it was carved out of Bloet 's diocese who was compensated for the loss by a grant of land . This grant included the town of <unk> in Huntingdonshire . He was one of the councillors who urged Henry to appoint William of Corbeil to the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1123 , although Bloet died before Corbeil was selected . Bloet was opposed to the other candidates , as they were monks , and he wanted a non @-@ monk appointed at Canterbury . In 1114 , when <unk> was vacant , he had also opposed the appointment of a monk to Canterbury . During the reign of Henry , Bloet accepted the supervision of St Albans abbey , ruled by his relative Richard , when Richard objected to the harshness of the archbishop of Canterbury and switched the abbey 's obedience to Lincoln instead . Bloet continued to be a benefactor to Albans throughout his episcopate . He doubled the number of canons in the cathedral chapter at Lincoln Cathedral during his episcopate . He also embellished the newly built Lincoln Cathedral and gave the cathedral many gifts of objects and lands . Most of his surviving episcopal documents concern the consecration of churches in his diocese or the confirmation of donations to religious houses . He also founded a hospital in Lincoln dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre . 
 Henry of Huntingdon , the medieval chronicler , wrote a letter entitled De <unk> mundi where he related a story from right before Bloet 's death that Bloet felt he had fallen from King Henry 's favour . Bloet allegedly told Huntingdon that the bishop had lost two lawsuits . However , the whole letter is concerned with setting out examples of prominent men who suffered a fall from grace , so possible bias on Huntingdon 's part must be kept in mind . There are also records of two legal proceedings involving Bloet at the end of Bloet 's life , and although Bloet lost both cases , neither was a loss of much income or prestige . In one , he was allowed to continue to hold the property , although instead of it being judged as his land alone , the settlement was that Bloet held it of St Augustine 's Abbey in Canterbury . The other lawsuit involved Bloet 's attempt to hold a manor free of dues owed to Westminster Abbey , which was settled in the Abbey 's favour , although Bloet continued to hold the land . Nor is there any lessening of the rate of Bloet 's witnessing to royal documents . It appears that Bloet 's lost lawsuits were decided by other royal justices , and while he may have lost some favour with the king , he did not fall completely out of favour either . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Bloet was a married bishop , and he appointed his son Simon as Dean of Lincoln . It was in Bloet 's household that the medieval historian Henry of Huntingdon was brought up . He died on 10 January 1123 at Woodstock , Oxfordshire and was buried at Lincoln . He had a sudden fit while out riding with King Henry and Roger of Salisbury , the Bishop of Salisbury , and collapsed in the king 's arms before dying shortly thereafter without absolution , which combined with his style of living led many contemporaries to conclude he was condemned to Hell . His last words were " Lord king , I am dying " which he uttered right before collapsing into Henry 's arms . His entrails were buried at Eynsham , but the rest of his body was buried in Lincoln Cathedral near the southern entrance in front of St. Mary 's altar . 
 Henry of Huntingdon records that noblemen sent their children to be educated at Bloet 's household , whether or not they were destined for a career in the church . King Henry 's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet 's care . Another illegitimate son of Henry 's , Richard of Lincoln , was also in Bloet 's household for an education . Gilbert of Sempringham , who founded the Gilbertine Order , was also educated in Bloet 's household , entering it before Bloet 's death and continuing there under Bloet 's successor Alexander of Lincoln . Besides educating laymen , Bloet educated his own household clergy , including sending some of them to study under Ivo , Bishop of Chartres . He was known for his ostentatious manner of living , and served personally in war when needed . The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks . Henry of Huntingdon , however , remembered him as handsome , cheerful and affable . Earlier in his episcopate , Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate 's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry , at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry , which she refused to do . It was only after Bloet 's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey . 
 = Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series = 
 Guitar Hero is a series of rhythm video games published by Activision in which players use guitar @-@ shaped controllers to mimic the playing of numerous popular rock music songs in a score attack gameplay ; later games in the series have included support for both drums and vocals and playing as a full band . With over $ 2 billion in total sales worldwide , the game series has made a significant cultural impact , becoming a " cultural phenomenon " and recognizable in the popular culture . The series has been found to influence younger players into learning real instruments , and has found application within the health care industry to help recovering patients . 
 Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band , a similar series of games developed by Harmonix ( who originally developed Guitar Hero ) , have altered the video game and music industries . For video games , the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games to become one of the industries ' largest growing markets . The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller . Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music , and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience these classics . Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game . This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games . The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers to re @-@ evaluate their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry . 
 = = In entertainment = = 
 The series ' titles became very popular party games , which led them to be played in a variety of locales . Several bars in the United States & Canada are offering " Guitar Hero nights " as an alternative to karaoke ; one New York City bar experienced triple the business on such nights . Many concert tours , including the Family Values Tour feature Guitar Hero booths and contests between sets . Guitar Hero is responsible for introducing people to rock music and inspiring them to learn how to play guitar . A study by Youth Music found that 2 @.@ 5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as Guitar Hero ; the group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs . Activision has teamed with the United Service Organizations to provide monetary support and copies of Guitar Hero III to the United States armed forces around the world .

 Guitar Hero has proven to be a useful tool in the development of children and as recovery for various injuries . Salon.com states that the games helped an 8 @-@ year @-@ old guitarist learn sensitivity to rhythm , as well as develop the dexterity and independent hand usage necessary to play the instrument . Guitar Hero has been used alongside physical therapy to help recovering stroke patients as the games help with multiple limb coordination between fingering and stroking . Blondie drummer Clem Burke has worked with researchers at the University of Chichester and the University of Gloucestershire to determine how games like Guitar Hero can address issues of " child and adult obesity , autism , stroke patients and health and mental well @-@ being in the workplace " . Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have used Guitar Hero III and its controller to help amputee patients and to develop new prosthetic limbs for these patients . Researchers at Nevada Reno University have been able to modify a haptic feedback glove to work with the Guitar Hero freeware clone , Frets on Fire , to create Blind Hero , a music game that works on touch and audio only to appeal the game to visually impaired players . Guitar Hero was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study which showed that players generally were better on replaying a song they had just been introduced to twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep .

 Activision stated on January 21 , 2008 that North American sales from all of the Guitar Hero franchise have exceeded one billion dollars with over 16 million units sold , excluding downloadable content . Over 20 million songs have been sold as downloadable content as of July 2008 , and 34 million by May 2009 . As of October 9 , 2008 , the series has sold 23 million units with sales of US $ 1 @.@ 6 billion , and as of May 2009 has earned US $ 2 billion at retail . Activision claims that Guitar Hero is the third largest video game franchise after the Mario and Madden NFL series , and is present in over 15 million households . Guitar Hero : World Tour along with other music games such as Rock Band 2 have surged the video game market in 2008 ; NPD Group reports cited that music video games made up 19 % of the overall software industry sales in July 2008 , and 16 % through November 2008 , and contributing to a 32 % year @-@ to @-@ date sector growth through July 2008 . Total sales of music games doubled in 2008 , with total sales of US $ 1 @.@ 9 billion . Guitar Hero represented about half of that figure , with a total of $ <unk> of retail sales in 2008 , and was the highest selling brand of the year . At the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show , Activision CEO Mike Griffith stated that Guitar Hero III is the first video game to exceed one billion dollars in total sales . Activision reported that the Guitar Hero franchise had 55 % of the United States and European markets during the first quarter of 2009 . Analysts expect 2009 to be a critical year to determine the future direction of music games , whether the sector will continue to grow or will remain stagnant . Early analysis of the first half of 2009 showed that sales of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchise games were down by half from the same period in 2008 , likely due to fewer purchases of the more expensive game bundles that include one or more controllers , as well as large discounts on the prices of older games . Viacom , parent company of MTV Games , reported a 32 % drop in 2009 second quarter profits , partially driven by weak sales of Rock Band amid the poor economy of the period . 
 The series has created a market for products outside of the video games . McFarlane Toys has developed a series of six @-@ inch @-@ tall figurines based on the characters from the game . Brett Ratner , director for Rush Hour and X @-@ Men : The Last Stand , has stated that he wishes to bring a movie based on Guitar Hero to theaters . However , Activision , the publisher of the series , did not approve the idea of a film adaptation . 
 The popularity of the Guitar Hero series has led to the development of several commercial and independent clones . Besides Harmonix ' Rock Band series , Konami released Rock Revolution in 2008 which features drums and guitar ( the game does not include vocals ) similar to Guitar Hero World Tour . <unk> Guitar for the PlayStation 2 and Wii systems , developed by XS Games , features gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero series , but features pop music , as opposed to rock and metal . Digital Praise released a Christian rock @-@ themed guitar @-@ based game called Guitar Praise also in 2008 . Guitar Rising , to be published for personal computers by Game Tank by 2009 , is based on using a real guitar in order to perfect one 's skills . We Rock : Drum King is a game promoted by Rolling Stone for the Wii that uses two Wii remotes as virtual drumsticks .

 = = On the music industry = = 
 Guitar Hero and Rock Band have been considered a boon to the music industry in a manner similar to music videos in the 1980s . Both licensed and indie bands whose works have been included in the Guitar Hero games have gained further popularity from this inclusion . Both record companies and retailers have experienced increases of 200 % to 300 % in sales of songs after their inclusion in the series . Every Guitar Hero III song tracked by Nielsen SoundScan ( 62 of 70 ) saw an increase in digital download sales the week ending December 30 , 2007 , when many who got the game as a gift were playing it , and every song included in Guitar Hero III and Rock Band saw downloaded sales increase during 2007 between 15 % to 843 % . A survey conducted by Brown University 's Kiri Miller found that 76 % of the players of Guitar Hero bought the music they heard in the game . Indie group Bang Camaro 's recognition increased after their song " Push Push ( Lady Lightning ) " appeared in Guitar Hero II . The band DragonForce , whose song " Through the Fire and Flames " is featured as a bonus song in Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , saw a 126 % increase in CD sales in the week after the release of the game , and downloads of the song , selling fewer than 2 @,@ 000 weekly , rose to more than 10 @,@ 000 after Guitar Hero III 's release and approached 40 @,@ 000 the week ending 2007 @-@ 12 @-@ 30 . Even older , established groups such as Aerosmith saw an increase in sales at the same time Guitar Hero games containing their songs were released , such as a modest increase in download sales for its " Same Old Song and Dance " , which rose to 2 @,@ 041 from 374 copies the previous week ; a 40 % increase in the band 's catalog was seen in the weeks following the release of Guitar Hero : Aerosmith . According to Activision CEO Bobby Kotick , Guitar Hero : Aerosmith has made more money for Aerosmith than any of their previous albums . Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band are seen as new methods of music distribution ; an analysis for market research company NPD Group states that " As the video games industry grows , it 's becoming an ever @-@ more attractive promotional outlet for all kinds of industries . " The games have also been seen as a way to introduce younger generations to music of the past ; bands such as Living Colour , Warrant , The Grateful Dead , Poison , and Ratt have seen interest in their music rise due to the inclusion of their songs in the Guitar Hero or Rock Band , as well as other music video games . Joel <unk> , president and CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , attributes surges in attendance to the museum in 2008 @-@ 2009 , particularly in families with young children , in part to the success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band . The popularity of downloadable content for music games has led the UK Official Download Chart to consider including these sales in their compilation of sales performance data . 
 Bands or those that control the copyrights on bands ' works have been in talks with the makers and distributions of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band as methods of achieving more exposure for the band . Following the announcement of Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , Martin N. " Marty " Bandier , executive for Sony / ATV which owns the copyrights on The Beatles compositions , stated he was very interested in helping Activision bring a Beatles @-@ themed Guitar Hero title to the market in a similar fashion . Both Activision and MTV Games were in talks with representatives of the Beatles to create a Beatles @-@ themed game , until MTV Games secured an exclusive license with Apple Corps , Ltd. to produce The Beatles : Rock Band . Groups such as Van Halen , The Eagles , Steely Dan and Guns N ' Roses have working deals with these companies to include their songs within future games . Other artists , having playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band , may approach the game developers to ask for inclusion of songs specifically for their adaptability into playable tracks . However , not all bands are comfortable with this : Led Zeppelin has turned down offers from both games to include their music due to concerns that Jimmy Page and other members of the band have with releasing the master recordings of their music . There are also cases where bands want to be included , but the master recordings have been lost or are unusable . Some bands such as the Sex Pistols , Living Colour , and Aerosmith have rerecorded these songs , while other bands have been able to provide concert " live " master recordings . However , some larger artists are unable to do so . Neversoft director Brian Bright states that they do not expect to acquire songs from Pink Floyd and Prince due to such reasons . With the pending release of The Beatles : Rock Band , Pink Floyd is also in active discussions to include its music in either Guitar Hero or Rock Band , according to representatives for EMI . 
 Guitar Hero and other rock music @-@ based games work with record companies to license each song for its use , costing a per @-@ song average of $ 25 @,@ 000 for the rights to use a master recording and $ 10 @,@ 000 for the rights to make a cover . The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games . The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances , such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica 's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks . However , some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games . Edgar Bronfman Jr . , chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group , stated that " The amount being paid to the industry , even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control , is far too small . " Tim Riley , vice president of music affairs at Activision , believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people , including musicians and music labels , to want to be part of the success : " The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game . " Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated , in response to the record company 's claims , that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they " should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse . " Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes , and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights . Michael Pachter , an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan , noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label , as there is nearly a 2000 @-@ year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases , and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti @-@ trust measures . <unk> also contrasted Bronfman 's view , stating that users are not buying the games for the songs , but for the game , with each song providing its own challenge . However , analysis believe that Activision 's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps , Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles ' music to MTV Games , who were more flexible in their negotiations . 
 Some musicians have been critical of Guitar Hero 's impact on the industry . Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works , while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts . Similarly , Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the series , stating that he felt that it was " more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar " .

 = Further Adventures of Lad = 
 Further Adventures of Lad , also known as Dog Stories Every Child Should Know , is a 1922 American novel written by Albert Payson Terhune and published by George H. Doran . A follow @-@ up to Lad : A Dog , it contains an additional eleven short stories featuring a fictional version of Terhune 's real @-@ life rough collie Lad , including the stories of Lad 's initial arrival at the " Place " , the death of his mate , and the day of his own death . Most of the stories were originally published in various magazines , and touch on themes of justice and the concepts of right and wrong . Terhune notes that he decided to publish the novel due to numerous letters received in response to the first novel , and the thousands of visitors who came to Sunnybank to visit the real @-@ life Lad 's grave . Though he initially intended for Further Adventures of Lad to be the final book of Lad stories , he would eventually publish one more book of stories , Lad of Sunnybank in 1929 . 
 The novel was a bestseller and well received by fans of the first novel , as well as new readers . Critics praised the stories as " charming " and " entertaining " , finding Lad a " delightful " and desirable dog . A critic for the New York Tribune , however , criticized Terhune 's writing style and felt Lad was an unbelievable character , while also still noting that book lovers would enjoy it . It was listed among H.W. Wilson Company 's 1922 list of 10 @,@ 000 books they deemed the " most useful " . Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for Lad : A Dog , Further Adventures of Lad , and Lad of Sunnybank , intending to produce a series of films and possibly a television series . The first film , Lad : A Dog , was released in June 1962 but it was unsuccessful in the box office and the project was dropped . The novel is now a public domain work .

 = = Development and publication = = 
 In 1915 , Albert Payson Terhune penned his first canine short story , " His Mate " , basing the main canine character on his real @-@ life rough collie Lad . After the short story 's publication in the January 1916 issue of Red Book Magazine , Terhune began writing additional short stories . The Lad Stories were published in the Saturday Evening Post , Ladies ' Home Journal , Hartford Courant , and the Atlantic Monthly , though Red Book remained the most consistent purchaser of the stories . Terhune collected twenty of the stories into a novel form , publishing it as Lad : A Dog in 1919 , the year after the real Lad died . The novel was well received by critics and readers , becoming a best seller . 
 Available evidence indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902 , and that unlike his fictional counterpart , Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers . After living five years with a heart tumor , the dog died on September 3 , 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi @-@ page spread of the September 14 , 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine . Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad , and that over 1 @,@ 700 people visit Lad 's grave at Sunnybank . In 1922 , he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel ; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies ' Home Journal , with some new stories and some from other magazines . The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong , abuse of authority , and justice . Intending it to be the last book he would write about his late collie , Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel . The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad . Seven years and twenty other novels later , he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel , Lad of Sunnybank , which was published by HarperCollins . 
 After the initial publication , Further Adventures of Lad was re @-@ released in the same year by Grosset & Dunlap . In 1941 , it was republished by Doubleday as Dog Stories Every Child Should Know , and has since entered the public domain . It has released online by Project Gutenberg , in print @-@ on @-@ demand form by Echo Library , and as a downloadable eBook by <unk> . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Further Adventures of Lad quickly became a best @-@ seller and was praised by both new readers and existing fans . Critics , however , gave it more mixed reviews . The Literary Digest called the stories " delightful sketches " that invoked a feeling of " privilege [ at being ] admitted to the friendship and to obtain the devotion of an animal like Lad . " The reviewer for the Springfield Republican found it as " entertaining " as the previous novel , and felt it was " written with the same understanding of dog nature which made the other stories universally read . " A reviewer for the Olympia Daily Recorder considered it a " charming story " and a " worth while " book , calling Lad both " delightful " and a " great hero " . However , Isabel Paterson , of the New York Tribune , considered Lad to be an unbelievable and undesirable dog and felt that Terhune wrote in a " rather hysterical style " whose " incessant piling up of the agony and adjectives [ was ] wearing . " Despite these failings , she did note that dog lovers would likely enjoy the book . 
 The H.W. Wilson Company listed it in its 1922 Standard Catalog <unk> , a selection of " 10 @,@ 000 titles of the most useful books covering all classes of literature . " In the 1960s , Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from the late Terhune 's wife Anice Terhune , hoping to produce a sequel and possible television series as a follow @-@ up to Lad : A Dog , the film adaptation of the first novel it released in June 1962 . However , the film was not as successfully as the studio hoped , and plans for follow @-@ ups were dropped . 
 = Anne Boleyn = 
 Anne Boleyn ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) ( c . 1501 – 19 May 1536 ) was Queen of England from 1533 to 1536 as the second wife of King Henry VIII , and Marquess of Pembroke in her own right . Henry 's marriage to Anne , and her subsequent execution by beheading , made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the English Reformation . 
 Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn , 1st Earl of Wiltshire , and his wife , Lady Elizabeth Howard , and was educated in the Netherlands and France , largely as a maid of honour to Claude of France . She returned to England in early 1522 , to marry her Irish cousin James Butler , 9th Earl of Ormond ; the marriage plans were broken up by Cardinal Wolsey , and instead she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII 's wife , Catherine of Aragon . 
 Early in 1523 Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy , son of the 5th Earl of Northumberland , but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle . In February / March 1526 , Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne . She resisted his attempts to seduce her , refusing to become his mistress – which her sister Mary had been . It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry 's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he would be free to marry Anne . When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage , the breaking of the power of the Catholic Church in England began . In 1532 , Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke . 
 Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533 , after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 . On 23 May 1533 , newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine 's marriage null and void ; five days later , he declared Henry and Anne 's marriage valid . Shortly afterwards , the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer . As a result of this marriage and these excommunications , the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King 's control . Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533 . On 7 September , she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth . Anne subsequently had three miscarriages , and by March 1536 , Henry was courting Jane Seymour . 
 Henry had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536 . On 2 May she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London , where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy , her former betrothed , and her own uncle , Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May . She was beheaded four days later . Modern historians view the charges against her , which included adultery , incest , and plotting to kill the king , as unconvincing . Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge . 
 Following the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth as queen , Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation , particularly through the works of John Foxe . Over the centuries , she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works . As a result , she has retained her hold on the popular imagination . Anne has been called " the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had " , since she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , and declare his independence from Rome . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn , later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond , and his wife , Lady Elizabeth Howard , daughter of Thomas Howard , 2nd Duke of Norfolk . Thomas Boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages ; he was also a favourite of King Henry VII , who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad . Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent . However , the siblings were born in Norfolk at the Boleyn home at Blickling . A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne 's date of birth . Contemporary evidence is contradictory , with several dates having been put forward by various historians . An Italian , writing in 1600 , suggested that she had been born in 1499 , while Sir Thomas More 's son @-@ in @-@ law , William Roper , indicated a much later date of 1512 . Her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507 . As with Anne herself , it is uncertain when her two siblings were born , but it seems clear that her sister Mary was older than Anne . Mary 's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister . Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499 . Mary 's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter , which Elizabeth I accepted . Their brother George was born around 1504 . 
 The academic debate about Anne 's birth date focuses on two key dates : 1501 and 1507 . Eric Ives , a British historian and legal expert , advocates the 1501 date , while Retha Warnicke , an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne , prefers 1507 . The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514 . She wrote it in French to her father , who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen , in the Burgundian Netherlands , now Belgium . Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen at the time of its composition , while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child . In Ives 's view , this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour , as Anne was to the regent , Margaret of Austria . This is supported by claims by a chronicler from the late 16th century , who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France . These findings are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles , and the evidence does not conclusively support either date . 
 There are two independent contemporary sources for the 1507 date . Author Gareth Russell wrote a summary of the evidence and relates that Jane Dormer , Duchess of Feria , wrote her memoirs shortly before her death in 1612 ; in it the former lady @-@ in @-@ waiting and confidante to Queen Mary I wrote of Anne Boleyn : " She was convicted and condemned and was not yet twenty @-@ nine years of age . " William Camden wrote a history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and was granted access to the private papers of Lord Burghley and to the state archives . In that history , in the chapter dealing with Elizabeth 's early life , he records in the margin that Anne was born in <unk> ( 1507 ) . 
 Anne 's great great great @-@ grandparents included a Lord Mayor of London , a duke , an earl , two aristocratic ladies , and a knight . One of them , Geoffrey Boleyn , had been a mercer and wool merchant before becoming Lord Mayor . The Boleyn family originally came from Blickling in Norfolk , fifteen miles ( 24 kilometres ) north of Norwich . At the time of Anne 's birth , the Boleyn family was considered one of the most respected in the English aristocracy . Among her relatives , she numbered the Howards , one of the preeminent families in the land ; and one of her ancestors included King Edward I of England . According to Eric Ives , she was certainly of more noble birth than Jane Seymour , Catherine Howard , and Catherine Parr , Henry VIII 's three other English wives . The spelling of the Boleyn name was variable , as common at the time . Sometimes it was written as Bullen , hence the bull heads which formed part of her family arms . At the court of Margaret of Austria in the Netherlands , Anne is listed as <unk> . From there she signed the letter to her father as Anna de <unk> . She is also referred to as " Anna <unk> " ; this Latinised form is used in most portraits of her . 
 Anne 's early education was typical for women of her class . In 1513 , Anne was invited to join the schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards . Her academic education was limited to arithmetic , her family genealogy , grammar , history , reading , spelling , and writing . She developed domestic skills such as dancing , embroidery , good manners , household management , music , needlework , and singing . Anne learned to play games , such as cards , chess , and dice . She was also taught archery , falconry , horseback riding , and hunting . 
 = = = Netherlands and France = = = 
 Anne 's father continued his diplomatic career under Henry VIII . In Europe , Thomas Boleyn 's charm won many admirers , including Margaret of Austria , daughter of Maximilian I , Holy Roman Emperor . During this period , Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles 's behalf and was so impressed with Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household . Ordinarily , a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour , but Anne may have been younger , as the Archduchess affectionately referred to her as " la petite <unk> [ sic ] " . Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and <unk> , Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young <unk> and told Sir Thomas Boleyn that his daughter was " so presentable and so pleasant , considering her youthful age , that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me , than you to me " ( E.W. Ives , <unk> ) . Anne stayed with Margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII 's sister Mary , who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514 . 
 In France , Anne was a maid of honour to Queen Mary , and then to Mary 's 15 @-@ year @-@ old stepdaughter Queen Claude , with whom she stayed nearly seven years . In the Queen 's household , she completed her study of French and developed interests in art , fashion , illuminated manuscripts , literature , music , poetry , and religious philosophy . She also acquired knowledge of French culture , dance , etiquette , literature , music , and poetry and came to gain experience in flirtation and the game of courtly love . Though all knowledge about Anne 's experiences in the French court are conjecture , even Eric Ives , in his latest edition of the biography , conjectures that she was likely to have made the acquaintance of King Francis I 's sister , Marguerite de Navarre , a patron of humanists and reformers . Marguerite de Navarre was also an author in her own right , and her works include elements of Christian mysticism and reform that verged on heresy , though she was protected by her status as the French king 's beloved sister . She or her circle may have encouraged Anne 's interest in reform , as well as in poetry and literature . Anne 's education in France proved itself in later years , inspiring many new trends among the ladies and courtiers of England , and it may have been instrumental in pressing their King toward the culture @-@ shattering contretemps with the Papacy itself . Eric Ives 's latest version of his biography hypothesises that Anne may have had evangelistic conviction and a strong spiritual inner life . William Forrest , author of a contemporary poem about Catherine of Aragon , complimented Anne 's " passing excellent " skill as a dancer . " Here " , he wrote , " was [ a ] fresh young damsel , that could trip and go . " 
 Anne had been of average height and she had a slender build with long straight and thick black or dark brown hair , dark brown eyes , a considerably strong nose , a definite wide mouth with slim lips , and an olive complexion . She was considered to be brilliant , charming , driven , elegant , forthright , and graceful with a keen wit and a lively , opinionated , and passionate personality . Anne was depicted to be " sweet and cheerful " in her youth and she enjoyed cards and dice games , drinking wine , eating French cuisine , flirting , gambling , gossiping , and hearing a good joke . She was fond of archery , falconry , hunting , and the occasional game of bowls . Yet Anne also had a sharp tongue and a terrible temper . 
 Anne exerted a powerful charm on those who met her , though opinions differed on her attractiveness . The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto , who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532 , described her as " not one of the handsomest women in the world ; she is of middling stature , swarthy complexion , long neck , wide mouth , bosom not much raised ... eyes , which are black and beautiful " . Simon <unk> wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was " young , good @-@ looking , of a rather dark complexion " . Lancelot de Carle called her " beautiful with an elegant figure " , and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that she was said to be beautiful . The most influential description of Anne , but also the least reliable , was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586 , half a century after Anne 's death : " Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature , with black hair , and an oval face of a sallow complexion , as if troubled with jaundice . It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip , and on her right hand six fingers . There was a large wen under her chin , and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat ... She was handsome to look at , with a pretty mouth " . Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII 's rejection of the Catholic Church , and writing fifty years after her death , was keen to demonise her . Sanders 's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the " monster legend " of Anne Boleyn . Though his details were fictitious , they have formed the basis for references to Anne 's appearance even in some modern textbooks . 
 Anne 's experience in France made her a devout Christian in the new tradition of Renaissance humanism . Anne knew little Latin but , trained at a French court , she was influenced by an " evangelical variety of French humanism " which led her to champion the vernacular Bible . While she would later hold the reformist position that the papacy was a corrupting influence on Christianity , her conservative tendencies could be seen in her devotion to the Virgin Mary . Anne 's European education ended in 1521 , when her father summoned her back to England . She sailed from Calais in January 1522 . 
 = = At the court of Henry VIII : 1522 – 1533 = = 
 Anne was recalled to marry her Irish cousin , James Butler , a young man who was several years older than she and who was living at the English court , in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond . The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515 , leaving his daughters , Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger , as co @-@ heiresses . In Ireland , the great @-@ great @-@ grandson of the 3rd earl , Sir Piers Butler , contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself . He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle – the ancestral seat of the earls . Sir Thomas Boleyn , being the son of the eldest daughter , felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother @-@ in @-@ law , the Duke of Norfolk , who spoke to King Henry about the matter . Henry , fearful the dispute could be the spark to ignite civil war in Ireland , sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers 's son , James , and Anne Boleyn . She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute . The plan ended in failure , perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles . Whatever the reason , the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt . James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald , daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald , 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O 'Brien . 
 Mary Boleyn , Anne Boleyn 's older sister , had earlier been recalled from France in late 1519 , ostensibly for her affairs with the French king and his courtiers . She married William Carey , a minor noble , in February 1520 , at Greenwich , with Henry VIII in attendance ; soon after , Mary Boleyn became the English King 's mistress . Historians dispute King Henry VIII 's paternity of one or both of Mary Boleyn 's children born during this marriage . Henry VIII : The King and His Court , by Alison Weir , questions the paternity of Henry Carey ; Dr. G.W. Bernard ( The King 's Reformation ) and Joanna Denny ( Anne Boleyn : A New Life of England 's Tragic Queen ) argue that Henry VIII was their father . Henry did not acknowledge either child , as he did his son Henry Fitzroy , his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount , Lady <unk> . 
 Anne made her début at the Château Vert ( Green Castle ) pageant in honour of the imperial ambassadors on 4 March 1522 , playing " Perseverance . " There she took part in an elaborate dance accompanying Henry 's younger sister Mary , several other ladies of the court , and her sister . All wore gowns of white satin embroidered with gold thread . She quickly established herself as one of the most stylish and accomplished women at the court , and soon a number of young men were competing for her . 
 The American historian Retha M. Warnicke writes that Anne was " the perfect woman courtier ... her carriage was graceful and her French clothes were pleasing and stylish ; she danced with ease , had a pleasant singing voice , played the lute and several other musical instruments well , and spoke French fluently ... A remarkable , intelligent , quick @-@ witted young noblewoman ... that first drew people into conversation with her and then amused and entertained them . In short , her energy and vitality made her the center of attention in any social gathering . " Henry VIII 's biographer J. J. Scarisbrick adds that Anne " revelled in " the attention she received from her admirers . 
 During this time , Anne was courted by Henry Percy , son of the Earl of Northumberland , and entered into a secret betrothal with the young man . Thomas Wolsey 's gentleman usher , George Cavendish , maintained the two had not been lovers . If Cavendish is to be believed , their relationship was celibate . The romance was broken off when Percy 's father refused to support their engagement . Cardinal Wolsey refused the match for several conjectured reasons . According to Cavendish , Anne was sent from court to her family 's countryside estates , but it is not known for how long . Upon her return to court , she again entered the service of Catherine of Aragon . Percy was married to Lady Mary Talbot , to whom he had been betrothed since adolescence . 
 Prior to her marriage to King Henry VIII , Anne had befriended Sir Thomas Wyatt , who was one of the greatest poets of the Tudor reign . In 1520 , Wyatt married Elizabeth Cobham , who told by many accounts , was not a wife of his choosing . Thus , in 1525 , Wyatt charged his wife with adultery and separated from her ; coincidentally , historians believe that it was also the year where his interest in Anne intensified . While Anne Boleyn was still King Henry 's mistress in 1532 , Wyatt accompanied the royal couple to Calais in France . A year later , Anne Boleyn and the King were secretly married , and Wyatt served in Anne 's coronation in June 1533 . 
 In 1526 , King Henry became enamoured with Anne and began his pursuit . Some say that Anne resisted the King 's attempts to seduce her , refusing to become his mistress , often leaving court for the seclusion of Hever Castle . But within a year , he proposed marriage to her , and she accepted . Both assumed an annulment could be obtained within a matter of months . There is no evidence to suggest that they engaged in a sexual relationship until very shortly before their marriage ; Henry 's love letters to Anne suggest that their love affair remained unconsummated for much of their seven @-@ year courtship . 
 = = = Henry 's annulment = = = 
 It is probable that the idea of annulment ( not divorce as commonly assumed ) had suggested itself to Henry much earlier than this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown . Before Henry 's father Henry VII ascended the throne , England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown and Henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession . He and Catherine had no living sons : all Catherine 's children except Mary died in infancy . Catherine of Aragon had first come to England to be bride to Henry 's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage . Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance , a dispensation was granted by Pope Julius II on the grounds that Catherine was still a virgin . The marriage of Catherine and Henry took place in 1509 , but eventually he became dubious about its validity , due to Catherine 's inability to provide an heir being seen as a sign of God 's displeasure . His feelings for Anne , and her refusals to become his mistress , probably contributed to Henry 's decision that no Pope had a right to overrule the Bible . This meant that he had been living in sin with Catherine of Aragon all these years , though Catherine hotly contested this and refused to concede that her marriage to Arthur had been consummated . It also meant that his daughter Mary was a bastard , and that the new Pope ( Clement VII ) would have to admit the previous Pope 's mistake and annul the marriage . Henry 's quest for an annulment became euphemistically known as the " King 's Great Matter . " 
 Anne saw an opportunity in Henry 's infatuation and the convenient moral quandary . She determined that she would yield to his embraces only as his acknowledged queen . She began to take her place at his side in policy and in state , but not yet in his bed . 
 Scholars and historians hold various opinions as to how deep Anne 's commitment to the Reformation was , how much she was perhaps only personally ambitious , and how much she had to do with Henry 's defiance of papal power . There is anecdotal evidence , related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady @-@ in @-@ waiting Anne <unk> , that Anne brought to Henry 's attention a heretical pamphlet , perhaps Tyndale 's " The Obedience of a Christian Man " or one by Simon Fish called " Supplication for Beggars , " which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church . She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church , and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures . According to Maria Dowling , " Anne tried to educate her waiting @-@ women in scriptural piety ” and is believed to have reproved her cousin , Mary Shelton , for “ having ' idle poesies ' written in her prayer book . ” If Cavendish is to be believed , Anne 's outrage at Wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France . Further , the most recent edition of Ives 's biography admits that Anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on , not just as catalyst but <unk> for Henry 's Reformation , though the process took a number of years . 
 In 1528 , sweating sickness broke out with great severity . In London , the mortality rate was great and the court was dispersed . Henry left London , frequently changing his residence ; Anne Boleyn retreated to the Boleyn residence at Hever Castle , but contracted the illness ; her brother @-@ in @-@ law , William Carey , died . Henry sent his own physician to Hever Castle to care for Anne , and shortly afterwards , she recovered . It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry 's desires to secure an annulment from Catherine . Henry had set his hopes upon a direct appeal to the Holy See , acting independently of Cardinal Wolsey , to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans related to Anne . In 1527 William Knight , the King 's secretary , was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine , on the grounds that the dispensing bull of Pope Julius II permitting him to marry his brother 's widow , Catherine , had been obtained under false pretences . Henry also petitioned , in the event of his becoming free , a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in the first degree of affinity , whether the affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection . This clearly referred to Anne . 
 As the Pope was , at that time , prisoner of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , as a result of the Sack of Rome in May 1527 , Knight had some difficulty obtaining access . In the end he had to return with a conditional dispensation , which Wolsey insisted was technically insufficient . Henry now had no choice but to put his great matter into Wolsey 's hands , who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry 's favour , even going so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England , with a special emissary , Lorenzo Campeggio from the Pope himself to decide the matter . But the Pope never had empowered his deputy to make any decision . The Pope was still a veritable hostage of Charles V , and Charles V was the loyal nephew of Henry 's queen , Catherine . The Pope forbade Henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in Rome , not in England . Convinced that Wolsey 's loyalties lay with the Pope , not England , Anne , as well as Wolsey 's many enemies , ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529 . George Cavendish , Wolsey 's chamberlain , records that the servants who waited on the king and Anne at dinner in 1529 in Grafton heard her say that the dishonour that Wolsey had brought upon the realm would have cost any other Englishman his head . Henry replied , " Why then I perceive ... you are not the Cardinal 's friend . " Henry finally agreed to Wolsey 's arrest on grounds of praemunire . Had it not been for his death from illness in 1530 , he might have been executed for treason . A year later in 1531 ( fully two years before Henry 's marriage to Anne ) , Queen Catherine was banished from court and her rooms were given to Anne . 
 Public support remained with Queen Catherine . One evening in the autumn of 1531 , Anne was dining at a manor house on the river Thames and was almost seized by a crowd of angry women . Anne just managed to escape by boat . 
 When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died in 1532 , the Boleyn family chaplain , Thomas Cranmer , was appointed , with papal approval . 
 In 1532 , Thomas Cromwell brought before Parliament a number of acts including the Supplication against the Ordinaries and Submission of the Clergy , which recognised royal supremacy over the church , thus finalising the break with Rome . Following these acts , Thomas More resigned as Chancellor , leaving Cromwell as Henry 's chief minister . 
 = = = <unk> role and marriage = = = 
 Even before her marriage , Anne Boleyn was able to grant petitions , receive diplomats , give patronage and had enormous influence over her future husband to plead the cause of foreign diplomats . The ambassador from Milan wrote in 1531 that it was essential to have her approval if one wanted to influence the English government , a view corroborated by an earlier French ambassador in 1529 . 
 During this period , Anne Boleyn played an important role in England 's international position by solidifying an alliance with France . She established an excellent rapport with the French ambassador , Gilles de la <unk> . Anne and Henry attended a meeting with the French king at Calais in winter 1532 , in which Henry hoped to enlist the support of Francis I of France for his intended marriage . On 1 September 1532 , Henry granted her suo jure the Marquessate of Pembroke , an appropriate peerage for a future queen ; as such she became a rich and important woman : the three dukes and two marquesses who existed in 1532 were the King 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , the King 's illegitimate son , and other descendants of royalty ; she ranked above all other peeresses . The Pembroke lands and the title of Earl of Pembroke had been held by Henry 's great @-@ uncle , and Henry performed the investiture himself . 
 Anne 's family also profited from the relationship . Her father , already Viscount Rochford , was created Earl of Wiltshire . Henry also came to an arrangement with Anne 's Irish cousin and created him Earl of Ormond . At the magnificent banquet to celebrate her father 's elevation , Anne took precedence over the Duchesses of Suffolk and Norfolk , seated in the place of honour beside the King which was usually occupied by the Queen . Thanks to Anne 's intervention , her widowed sister Mary received an annual pension of £ 100 , and Mary 's son , Henry Carey , was educated at a prestigious Cistercian monastery . 
 The conference at Calais was something of a political triumph , but even though the French government gave implicit support for Henry 's remarriage and Francis I himself held private conference with Anne , the French King maintained alliances with the Pope which he could not explicitly defy . 
 Soon after returning to Dover , Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony on November 14 , 1532 . She soon became pregnant and , to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time , there was a second wedding service , also private in accordance with The Royal Book , which took place in London on 25 January 1533 . Events now began to move at a quick pace . On 23 May 1533 , Cranmer ( who had been hastened , with the Pope 's assent , into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham ) sat in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King 's marriage to Catherine of Aragon . He thereupon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void . Five days later , on 28 May 1533 , Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid . 
 = = Queen of England : 1533 – 1536 = = 
 Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen and Anne was consequently crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey with a banquet afterwards . She was the last queen consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband . Unlike any other queen consort , Anne was crowned with St Edward 's Crown , which had previously been used to crown only a monarch . Historian Alice Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne 's pregnancy was visible by then and she was carrying the heir who was presumed to be male . On the previous day , Anne had taken part in an elaborate procession through the streets of London seated in a litter of " white cloth of gold " that rested on two palfreys clothed to the ground in white damask , while the barons of the Cinque Ports held a canopy of cloth of gold over her head . In accordance with tradition she wore white , and on her head a gold coronet beneath which her long dark hair hung down freely . The public 's response to her appearance was lukewarm . 
 Meanwhile , the House of Commons had forbidden all appeals to Rome and exacted the penalties of praemunire against all who introduced papal bulls into England . It was only then that Pope Clement at last took the step of announcing a provisional sentence of excommunication against the King and Cranmer . He condemned the marriage to Anne , and in March 1534 , he declared the marriage to Catherine legal and again ordered Henry to return to her . Henry now required his subjects to swear the oath attached to the First Succession Act , which effectively rejected papal authority in legal matters and recognised Anne Boleyn as queen . Those who refused , such as Sir Thomas More , who had resigned as Lord Chancellor , and John Fisher , Bishop of Rochester , were then placed in the Tower of London . In late 1534 parliament declared Henry " the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England " . The Church in England was now under Henry 's control , not Rome 's . On 14 May 1534 , in one of the realm 's first official acts protecting Protestant Reformers , Anne wrote a letter to Thomas Cromwell seeking his aid in ensuring that English merchant Richard Herman be reinstated a member of the merchant adventurers in Antwerp and no longer persecuted simply because he had helped in " setting forth of the New testament in English . " Before and after her coronation , Anne protected and promoted evangelicals and those wishing to study the scriptures of William Tyndale . She had a decisive role in influencing the Protestant reformer Matthew Parker to attend court as her chaplain , and prior to her death entrusted her daughter to Parker 's care . 
 = = = Struggle for a son = = = 
 After her coronation , Anne settled into a quiet routine at the King 's favourite residence , Greenwich Palace , to prepare for the birth of her baby . The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533 . Between three and four in the afternoon , Anne gave birth to a girl , who was christened Elizabeth , probably in honour of either or both Anne 's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry 's mother , Elizabeth of York . But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents , since they had confidently expected a boy . All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather . Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes [ s ] and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled . 
 Nevertheless , the infant princess was given a splendid christening , but Anne feared that Catherine 's daughter , Mary , now stripped of her title of princess and labelled a bastard , posed a threat to Elizabeth 's position . Henry soothed his wife 's fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to Hatfield House , where Princess Elizabeth would be living with her own sizeable staff of servants , and where the country air was thought better for the baby 's health . Anne frequently visited her daughter at Hatfield and other residences . 
 The new queen had a larger staff of servants than Catherine . There were more than 250 servants to tend to her personal needs , everyone from priests to stable @-@ boys , and more than 60 maids @-@ of @-@ honour who served her and accompanied her to social events . She also employed several priests who acted as her confessors , chaplains , and religious advisers . One of these was Matthew Parker , who would become one of the chief architects of Anglican thought during the reign of Anne 's daughter , Elizabeth I. 
 = = = Strife with the king = = = 
 The king and his new queen enjoyed a reasonably happy accord with periods of calm and affection . Anne Boleyn 's sharp intelligence , political acumen and forward manners , although desirable in a mistress , were , at the time , unacceptable in a wife . She was once reported to have spoken to her uncle in words that " shouldn 't be used to a dog " . After a stillbirth or miscarriage as early as Christmas 1534 , Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of divorcing her without having to return to Catherine . Nothing came of the issue as the royal couple reconciled and spent summer 1535 on progress . By October , she was again pregnant . 
 Anne Boleyn presided over a magnificent court . She spent lavish amounts of money on gowns , jewels , head @-@ dresses , ostrich @-@ feather fans , riding equipment , furniture and upholstery , maintaining the ostentatious display required by her status . Numerous palaces were renovated to suit her and Henry 's extravagant tastes . Her motto was " The most happy " , and she had chosen a white falcon as her personal device . 
 Anne was blamed for the tyranny of her husband 's government and was referred to by some of her subjects as " The king 's whore " or a " naughty <unk> [ prostitute ] " . Public opinion turned further against her following her failure to produce a son . It sank even lower after the executions of her enemies Sir Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher . 
 = = Downfall and execution : 1536 = = 
 On 8 January 1536 , news of Catherine of Aragon 's death reached the King and Anne , who were overjoyed . The following day , Henry and Anne wore yellow , the symbol of joy and celebration in England , from head to toe , and celebrated Catherine 's death with festivities . In Spain , the home country of Catherine of Aragon , yellow was the colour of mourning , in addition to black . For this reason , the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne may have been a symbol of mourning . With Mary 's mother dead , Anne attempted to make peace with her . Mary rebuffed Anne 's overtures , perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne and / or Henry . These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened . Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning , but of cancer of the heart , something which was not understood at the time . 
 The Queen , pregnant again , was aware of the dangers if she failed to give birth to a son . With Catherine dead , Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality . At this time Henry began paying court to Jane Seymour . He gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane , in the presence of Anne , began opening and shutting it . Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled . 
 Later that month , the King was unhorsed in a tournament and knocked unconscious for two hours , a worrying incident that Anne believed led to her miscarriage five days later . Another possible cause of the miscarriage was an incident in which , upon entering a room , Anne saw Jane Seymour sitting on the lap of Henry . After flying into a rage , Henry soothed her , saying " peace be sweetheart , and all will be well . " Whatever the cause , on the day that Catherine of Aragon was buried at Peterborough Abbey , Anne miscarried a baby which , according to the imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys , she had borne for about three and a half months , and which " seemed to be a male child " . Chapuys commented " She has miscarried of her saviour . " In Chapuys ' opinion , this loss was the beginning of the end of the royal marriage . 
 Given Henry 's desperate desire for a son , the sequence of Anne 's pregnancies has attracted much interest . Author Mike Ashley speculated that Anne had two stillborn children after Elizabeth 's birth and before the male child she miscarried in 1536 . Most sources attest only to the birth of Elizabeth in September 1533 , a possible miscarriage in the summer of 1534 , and the miscarriage of a male child , of almost four months gestation , in January 1536 . As Anne recovered from her miscarriage , Henry declared that he had been seduced into the marriage by means of " <unk> " — a French term indicating either " deception " or " spells " . His new mistress , Jane Seymour , was quickly moved into royal quarters . This was followed by Anne 's brother George being refused a prestigious court honour , the Order of the Garter , given instead to Sir Nicholas Carew . 
 = = = Charges of adultery , incest and treason = = = 
 Anne 's biographer Eric Ives believes that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally Thomas Cromwell . The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell thereafter indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne ; evidence of this is seen in the Spanish Chronicle and through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V. Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy . She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions ; and she favoured a French alliance . Cromwell insisted on filling the King 's depleted coffers , while taking a cut for himself , and preferred an imperial alliance . For these reasons , Ives suggests , " Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell . " Cromwell 's biographer John Schofield , on the other hand , contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that " not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne ... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case . " Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery , though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry 's case against Anne . Historian Retha Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the king in such a matter . Such a bold attempt by Cromwell , given the limited evidence , could have risked his office , even his life . Henry himself issued the crucial instructions : his officials , including Cromwell , carried them out . The result , historians agree , was a legal travesty . However modern lawyers have concluded that the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure Anne Boleyn 's conviction ; there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time , like armies , was an engine of state , not a mechanism for justice . 
 Towards the end of April a Flemish musician in Anne 's service named Mark Smeaton was arrested . He initially denied being the Queen 's lover but later confessed , perhaps tortured or promised freedom . Another courtier , Henry Norris , was arrested on May Day , but being an aristocrat , could not be tortured . Prior to his arrest , Norris was treated kindly by the King , who offered him his own horse to use on the May Day festivities . It seems likely that during the festivities , the King was notified of Smeaton 's confession and it was shortly thereafter the alleged conspirators were arrested upon his orders . Norris denied his guilt and swore that Queen Anne was innocent ; one of the most damaging pieces of evidence against Norris was an overheard conversation with Anne at the end of April , where she accused him of coming often to her chambers not to pay court to her lady @-@ in @-@ waiting Madge Shelton but to herself . Sir Francis Weston was arrested two days later on the same charge , as was William Brereton , a Groom of the King 's Privy Chamber . Sir Thomas Wyatt , a poet and friend of the <unk> who was allegedly infatuated with her before her marriage to the king , was also imprisoned for the same charge but later released , most likely due to his or his family 's friendship with Cromwell . Sir Richard Page was also accused of having a sexual relationship with the Queen , but he was acquitted of all charges after further investigation could not implicate him with Anne . The final accused was Queen Anne 's own brother , George Boleyn , arrested on charges of incest and treason . He was accused of two incidents of incest : November 1535 at Whitehall and the following month at Eltham . 
 On 2 May 1536 , Anne was arrested and taken to the Tower of London by barge . It is likely that Anne may have entered through the Court Gate in the <unk> Tower rather than the Traitors ' Gate , according to historian and author of The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn , Eric Ives . In the Tower , she collapsed , demanding to know the location of her father and " <unk> <unk> " , as well as the charges against her . 
 In what is reputed to be her last letter to King Henry , dated 6 May , she wrote : 
 " Sir , 
 Your Grace 's displeasure , and my imprisonment are things so strange unto me , as what to write , or what to excuse , I am altogether ignorant . Whereas you send unto me ( willing me to confess a truth , and so obtain your favour ) by such an one , whom you know to be my ancient professed enemy . I no sooner received this message by him , than I rightly conceived your meaning ; and if , as you say , confessing a truth indeed may procure my safety , I shall with all willingness and duty perform your demand . 
 But let not your Grace ever imagine , that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault , where not so much as a thought thereof preceded . And to speak a truth , never prince had wife more loyal in all duty , and in all true affection , than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn : with which name and place I could willingly have contented myself , if God and your Grace 's pleasure had been so pleased . Neither did I at any time so far forget myself in my exaltation or received <unk> , but that I always looked for such an alteration as I now find ; for the ground of my preferment being on no surer foundation than your Grace 's fancy , the least alteration I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other object . You have chosen me , from a low estate , to be your Queen and companion , far beyond my desert or desire . If then you found me worthy of such honour , good your Grace let not any light fancy , or bad council of mine enemies , withdraw your princely favour from me ; neither let that stain , that unworthy stain , of a disloyal heart toward your good grace , ever cast so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife , and the infant @-@ princess your daughter . Try me , good king , but let me have a lawful trial , and let not my sworn enemies sit as my accusers and judges ; yea let me receive an open trial , for my truth shall fear no open flame ; then shall you see either my innocence cleared , your suspicion and conscience satisfied , the ignominy and slander of the world stopped , or my guilt openly declared . So that whatsoever God or you may determine of me , your grace may be freed of an open censure , and mine offense being so lawfully proved , your grace is at liberty , both before God and man , not only to execute worthy punishment on me as an unlawful wife , but to follow your affection , already settled on that party , for whose sake I am now as I am , whose name I could some good while since have pointed unto , your Grace being not ignorant of my suspicion therein . But if you have already determined of me , and that not only my death , but an infamous slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness ; then I desire of God , that he will pardon your great sin therein , and likewise mine enemies , the instruments thereof , and that he will not call you to a strict account of your <unk> and cruel usage of me , at his general judgment @-@ seat , where both you and myself must shortly appear , and in whose judgment I doubt not ( whatsoever the world may think of me ) mine innocence shall be openly known , and sufficiently cleared . My last and only request shall be , that myself may only bear the burden of your Grace 's displeasure , and that it may not touch the innocent souls of those poor gentlemen , who ( as I understand ) are likewise in strait imprisonment for my sake . If ever I found favour in your sight , if ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in your ears , then let me obtain this request , and I will so leave to trouble your Grace any further , with mine earnest prayers to the Trinity to have your Grace in his good keeping , and to direct you in all your actions . From my doleful prison in the Tower , this sixth of May ; 
 Your most loyal and ever faithful wife , Anne Boleyn " 
 Four of the accused men were tried in Westminster on 12 May 1536 . Weston , Brereton , and Norris publicly maintained their innocence and only the tortured Smeaton supported the Crown by pleading guilty . Three days later , Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London , before a jury of 27 peers . She was accused of adultery , incest , and high treason . By the Treason Act of Edward III , adultery on the part of a queen was a form of treason ( because of the implications for the succession to the throne ) for which the penalty was hanging , drawing and quartering for a man and burning alive for a woman , but the accusations , and especially that of incestuous adultery , were also designed to impugn her moral character . The other form of treason alleged against her was that of plotting the king 's death , with her " lovers " , so that she might later marry Henry Norris . Henry Percy , 6th Earl of Northumberland sat on the jury that unanimously found Anne guilty . When the verdict was announced , he collapsed and had to be carried from the courtroom . He died eight months later , leaving no heirs and therefore was succeeded by his nephew . According to a 1980 legal review by Schauer and Schauer , " there is little if any evidence , apart from Smeaton 's possible torture , that the rules of the time were in any way bent in order to assure Anne Boleyn 's conviction " . 
 On 14 May , Cranmer declared Anne 's marriage to Henry null and void .

 Although the evidence against them was unconvincing , the accused were found guilty and condemned to death . George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536 . William Kingston , the Constable of the Tower , reported Anne seemed very happy and ready to be done with life . Henry commuted Anne 's sentence from burning to beheading , and rather than have a queen beheaded with the common axe , he brought an expert swordsman from Saint @-@ Omer in France , to perform the execution . On the morning of 19 May , Kingston wrote : 
 This morning she sent for me , that I might be with her at such time as she received the good Lord , to the intent I should hear her speak as touching her <unk> alway to be clear . And in the writing of this she sent for me , and at my coming she said , ' Mr. Kingston , I hear I shall not die afore noon , and I am very sorry therefore , for I thought to be dead by this time and past my pain . ' I told her it should be no pain , it was so little . And then she said , ' I heard say the executioner was very good , and I have a little neck , ' and then put her hands about it , laughing heartily . I have seen many men and also women executed , and that they have been in great sorrow , and to my knowledge this lady has much joy in death . Sir , her almoner is continually with her , and had been since two o 'clock after midnight . 
 Her impending death may have caused her great sorrow for some time during her imprisonment . The poem " Oh Death Rock Me Asleep " is generally believed to have been authored by Anne and reveals that she may have hoped death would end her suffering . 
 Shortly before dawn , she called Kingston to hear mass with her , and swore in his presence , on the eternal salvation of her soul , upon the Holy Sacraments , that she had never been unfaithful to the king . She ritually repeated this oath both immediately before and after receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist . 
 On the morning of Friday 19 May , Anne Boleyn was executed within the Tower precincts , not upon the site of the execution memorial , but rather , according to historian Eric Ives , on a scaffold erected on the north side of the White Tower , in front of what is now the Waterloo Barracks . She wore a red petticoat under a loose , dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine . Accompanied by two female attendants , Anne made her final walk from the Queen 's House to the scaffold and she showed a " devilish spirit " and looked " as gay as if she was not going to die " . Anne climbed the scaffold and made a short speech to the crowd : 
 Good Christian people , I am come hither to die , for according to the law , and by the law I am judged to die , and therefore I will speak nothing against it . I am come hither to accuse no man , nor to speak anything of that , whereof I am accused and condemned to die , but I pray God save the king and send him long to reign over you , for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never : and to me he was ever a good , a gentle and sovereign lord . And if any person will meddle of my cause , I require them to judge the best . And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all , and I heartily desire you all to pray for me . O Lord have mercy on me , to God I commend my soul . 
 This version of her speech is found in Foxe 's , Actes and Monuments and an almost identical version in Ives ( 2005 ) . In a 1 @,@ 318 line poem , written in French , two weeks after Anne 's death , Lancelot de Carle provides a moving account of her last words and their effect on the crowd : 
 She gracefully addressed the people from the scaffold with a voice somewhat overcome by weakness , but which gathered strength as she went on . She begged her hearers to forgive her if she had not used them all with becoming gentleness , and asked for their prayers . It was needless , she said , to relate why she was there , but she prayed the Judge of all the world to have compassion on those who had condemned her , and she begged them to pray for the King , in whom she had always found great kindness , fear of God , and love of his subjects . The spectators could not refrain from tears . 
 Lancelot de Carle , a secretary to the French Ambassador , Antoine de Castelnau , was in London in May 1536 , and was an eyewitness to her trial and execution . The poem , <unk> <unk> le <unk> <unk> <unk> à l <unk> de la <unk> Anne <unk> d 'Angleterre , ( A Letter Containing the Criminal Charges Laid Against Queen Anne Boleyn of England ) , provides a detailed account of Anne 's early life and the circumstances relating to her arrest , trial and execution . All the accounts are similar . It is thought that Anne avoided criticising Henry to save Elizabeth and her family from further consequences , but even under such extreme pressure Anne did not confess guilt , and indeed subtly implied her innocence , in her appeal to those who might " meddle of my cause " . 
 = = = Death and burial = = = 
 The ermine mantle was removed and Anne lifted off her headdress , tucking her hair under a coif . After a brief farewell to her weeping ladies and a request for prayers , she kneeled down and one of her ladies tied a blindfold over her eyes . She knelt upright , in the French style of executions . Her final prayer consisted of her repeating continually , " Jesu receive my soul ; O Lord God have pity on my soul . " 
 The execution consisted of a single stroke . It was witnessed by Thomas Cromwell ; Charles Brandon , 1st Duke of Suffolk ; the King 's illegitimate son , Henry Fitzroy ; the Lord Mayor of London , as well as aldermen , sheriffs , and representatives of the various craft guilds . Most of the King 's Council were also present . Cranmer , who was at Lambeth Palace , was reported to have broken down in tears after telling Alexander Ales : " She who has been the Queen of England on earth will today become a Queen in heaven . " When the charges were first brought against Anne , Cranmer had expressed his astonishment to Henry and his belief that " she should not be culpable . " Still , Cranmer felt vulnerable because of his closeness to the queen , and so on the night before the execution , he declared Henry 's marriage to Anne to have been void , like Catherine 's before her . He made no serious attempt to save Anne 's life , although some sources record that he had prepared her for death by hearing her last private confession of sins , in which she had stated her innocence before God . On the day of her death , a Scottish friend found Cranmer weeping uncontrollably in his London gardens , saying that he was sure that Anne had now gone to Heaven . 
 She was then buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula . Her skeleton was identified during renovations of the chapel in 1876 , in the reign of Queen Victoria , and Anne 's resting place is now marked in the marble floor .

 Nicholas Sander , a Catholic recusant born c . 1530 , was committed to deposing Elizabeth I and re @-@ establishing Catholicism in England . In his De <unk> ac <unk> <unk> <unk> ( The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism ) , published in 1585 , he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand . Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil , it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry 's romantic attention had she had any . Upon exhumation in 1876 , no abnormalities were discovered . Her frame was described as delicate , approximately 5 ' 3 " , with finely formed , tapering fingers . 
 Anne Boleyn was described by contemporaries as intelligent and gifted in musical arts and scholarly pursuits . She was also strong @-@ willed and proud , and often quarrelled with Henry . Biographer Eric Ives evaluates the apparent contradictions in Anne 's persona : 
 To us she appears inconsistent — religious yet aggressive , calculating yet emotional , with the light touch of the courtier yet the strong grip of the politician — but is this what she was , or merely what we strain to see through the opacity of the evidence ? As for her inner life , short of a miraculous cache of new material , we shall never really know . Yet what does come to us across the centuries is the impression of a person who is strangely appealing to the early 21st century : A woman in her own right — taken on her own terms in a man 's world ; a woman who mobilised her education , her style and her presence to outweigh the disadvantages of her sex ; of only moderate good looks , but taking a court and a king by storm . Perhaps , in the end , it is Thomas Cromwell 's assessment that comes nearest : intelligence , spirit and courage . 
 No contemporary portraits of Anne Boleyn survive . A bust of her was cast on a commemorative medallion in 1534 , believed to have been struck to celebrate her second pregnancy . 
 Following the coronation of her daughter as queen , Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation , particularly through the works of John Foxe , who argued that Anne had saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism and that God had provided proof of her innocence and virtue by making sure her daughter Elizabeth I ascended the throne . An example of Anne 's direct influence in the reformed church is what Alexander Ales described to Queen Elizabeth as the " evangelical bishops whom your holy mother appointed from among those scholars who favoured the purer doctrine " . Over the centuries , Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works . As a result , she has remained in the popular memory and has been called " the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had . "

 Many legends and fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries . One is that she was secretly buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors . Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk . Another is that her heart , at her request , was buried in <unk> ( <unk> ) Church , Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker . 
 In 18th @-@ century Sicily , the peasants of the village of <unk> believed that Anne Boleyn , for having made Henry VIII a heretic , was condemned to burn for eternity inside Mount Etna . This legend was often told for the benefit of foreign travellers . 
 A number of people have claimed to have seen Anne 's ghost at Hever Castle , Blickling Hall , Salle Church , the Tower of London , and <unk> Hall . The most famous account of her reputed sighting has been described by paranormal researcher Hans Holzer . In 1864 , Major General J.D. Dundas of the 60th Rifles regiment was quartered in the Tower of London . As he was looking out the window of his quarters , he noticed a guard below in the courtyard , in front of the lodgings where Anne had been imprisoned , behaving strangely . He appeared to challenge something , which to the General " looked like a whitish , female figure sliding towards the soldier " . The guard charged through the form with his bayonet , then fainted . Only the General 's testimony and corroboration at the court @-@ martial saved the guard from a lengthy prison sentence for having fainted while on duty . In 1960 , Canon W. S. Pakenham @-@ Walsh , vicar of Sulgrave , Northamptonshire , reported having conversations with Anne .

 = Amy Robsart = 
 Amy Dudley ( née Robsart ) ( 7 June 1532 – 8 September 1560 ) was the first wife of Lord Robert Dudley , favourite of Elizabeth I of England . She is primarily known for her death by falling down a flight of stairs , the circumstances of which have often been regarded as suspicious . Amy Robsart was the only child of a substantial Norfolk gentleman and at nearly 18 married Robert Dudley , a son of John Dudley , 1st Duke of Northumberland . In 1553 Robert Dudley was condemned to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London , where Amy Dudley was allowed to visit him . After his release the couple lived in strait financial circumstances until , with the accession of Elizabeth I in late 1558 , Dudley became Master of the Horse , an important court office . The Queen soon fell in love with him and there was talk that Amy Dudley , who did not follow her husband to court , was suffering from an illness , and that Elizabeth would perhaps marry her favourite should his wife die . The rumours grew more sinister when Elizabeth remained single against the common expectation that she would accept one of her many foreign suitors . 
 Amy Dudley lived with friends in different parts of the country , having her own household and hardly ever seeing her husband . In the morning of 8 September 1560 , at Cumnor Place near Oxford , she insisted on sending away her servants and later was found dead at the foot of a flight of stairs with a broken neck and two wounds on her head . The coroner 's jury 's finding was that she had died of a fall downstairs ; the verdict was " misfortune " , accidental death . 
 Amy Dudley 's death caused a scandal . Despite the inquest 's outcome , Robert Dudley was widely suspected to have orchestrated his wife 's demise , a view not shared by most modern historians . He remained Elizabeth 's closest favourite , but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him . A tradition that Sir Richard Verney , a follower of Robert Dudley , organized Amy Dudley 's violent death evolved early , and Leicester 's Commonwealth , a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley , by then Earl of Leicester , perpetuated this version of events . Interest in Amy Robsart 's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott 's novel , Kenilworth . The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide , although a few historians have probed murder scenarios . The medical evidence of the coroner 's report , which was found in 2008 , is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence . 
 = = Life = = 
 Amy Robsart was born in Norfolk , the heiress of a substantial gentleman @-@ farmer and grazier , Sir John Robsart of <unk> , and his wife , Elizabeth Scott . Amy Robsart grew up at her mother 's house , Stanfield Hall , and , like her future husband , in a firmly Protestant household . She received a good education and wrote in a fine hand . Three days before her 18th birthday she married Robert Dudley , a younger son of John Dudley , Earl of Warwick . Amy and Robert , who were of the same age , probably first met about ten months before their wedding . The wedding contract of May 1550 specified that Amy would inherit her father 's estate only after both her parents ' death , and after the marriage the young couple depended heavily on both their fathers ' gifts , especially Robert 's . It was most probably a love @-@ match , a " carnal marriage " , as the wedding guest William Cecil later commented disapprovingly . The marriage was celebrated on 4 June 1550 at the royal palace of Sheen , with Edward VI in attendance . 
 The Earl of Warwick and future Duke of Northumberland was the most powerful man in England , leading the government of the young King Edward VI . The match , though by no means a prize , was acceptable to him as it strengthened his influence in Norfolk . The young couple dwelt mostly at court or with Amy 's parents @-@ in @-@ law at Ely House ; in the first half of 1553 they lived at Somerset House , Robert Dudley being keeper of this great Renaissance palace . In May 1553 Lady Jane Grey became Amy Dudley 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , and after her rule of a fortnight as England 's queen , Robert Dudley was sentenced to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London . He remained there from July 1553 until October 1554 ; from September 1553 Amy was allowed to visit " and there to tarry with " him at the Tower 's Lieutenant 's pleasure . 
 After his release Robert Dudley was short of money and he and Amy were helped out financially by their families . Their lifestyle had to remain modest , though , and Lord Robert ( as he was known ) was heaping up considerable debts . Sir John Robsart died in 1554 ; his wife followed him to the grave in the spring of 1557 , which meant that the Dudleys could inherit the Robsart estate with the Queen 's permission . Lady Amy 's ancestral manor house of <unk> had been uninhabitable for many decades , and the couple were now living in <unk> , Hertfordshire , at the house of William Hyde , when not in London . In August 1557 Robert Dudley went to fight for Philip II of Spain ( who was then Mary I 's husband ) at the Battle of St. Quentin in France . From this time a business letter from Amy Dudley survives , settling some debts of her husband 's in his absence , " although I forgot to move my lord thereof before his departing , he being sore troubled with weighty affairs , and I not being altogether in quiet for his sudden departing " . 
 In the summer of 1558 Robert and Amy Dudley were looking for a suitable residence of their own in order to settle in Norfolk ; nothing came of this , however , before the death of Queen Mary I in November 1558 . Upon the accession of Elizabeth I Robert Dudley became Master of the Horse and his place was now at court at almost constant attendance on the Queen . By April 1559 Queen Elizabeth seemed to be in love with Lord Robert , and several diplomats reported that some at court already speculated that the Queen would marry him , " in case his wife should die " , as Lady Dudley was very ill in one of her breasts . Very soon court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Robert Dudley from her side . He visited his wife at <unk> for a couple of days at Easter 1559 , and Amy Dudley came to London in May 1559 for about a month . At this time , on 6 June , the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra wrote that her health had improved , but that she was careful with her food . She also made a trip to Suffolk ; by September she was residing in the house of Sir Richard Verney at Compton Verney in Warwickshire . 
 By the autumn of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen 's hand ; indignant at Elizabeth 's little serious interest in their candidate , the Spanish ambassador de Quadra and his Imperial colleague were informing each other and their superiors that Lord Robert was sending his wife poison and that Elizabeth was only fooling them , " keeping Lord Robert 's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated " . Parts of the nobility also held Dudley responsible for Elizabeth 's failure to marry , and plots to assassinate him abounded . In March 1560 de Quadra informed Philip II : " Lord Robert told somebody … that if he live another year he will be in a very different position from now . … They say that he thinks of divorcing his wife . " Lady Amy never saw her husband again after her London visit in 1559 . A projected trip of his to visit her and other family never materialized . Queen Elizabeth did not really allow her favourite a wife ; according to a contemporary court chronicle , he " was commanded to say that he did nothing with her , when he came to her , as seldom he did " . 
 From December 1559 Amy Dudley lived at Cumnor Place , near Abingdon in Berkshire ( now Oxfordshire ) . The house , an altered 14th century monastic complex , was rented by a friend of the Dudleys and possible relative of Amy 's , Sir Anthony Forster . He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen , relations of the house 's owner . Lady Dudley 's chamber was a large , sumptuous upper story apartment , the best of the house , with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it . At the house 's rear there were a terrace garden , a pond , and a deer park . Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household , which comprised about 10 servants . She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24 August 1560 show . She also received presents from her husband . 
 = = Death and inquest = = 
 On Sunday , 8 September 1560 , the day of a fair at Abingdon , Amy Robsart was found dead at the foot of a pair of stairs at Cumnor Place . Robert Dudley , at Windsor Castle with the Queen , was told of her death by a messenger on 9 September and immediately wrote to his steward Thomas Blount , who had himself just departed for Cumnor . He desperately urged him to find out what had happened and to call for an inquest ; this had already been opened when Blount arrived . He informed his master that Lady Dudley had risen early and 
 would not that day suffer one of her own sort to tarry at home , and was so earnest to have them gone to the fair , that with any of her own sort that made reason of tarrying at home she was very angry , and came to Mrs. Odingsells … who refused that day to go to the fair , and was very angry with her also . Because [ Mrs. Odingsells ] said it was no day for gentlewomen to go … Whereunto my lady answered and said that she might choose and go at her pleasure , but all hers should go ; and was very angry . They asked who should keep her company if all they went ; she said Mrs. Owen should keep her company at dinner ; the same tale doth Picto , who doth dearly love her , confirm . Certainly , my Lord , as little while as I have been here , I have heard divers tales of her that maketh me judge her to be a strange woman of mind . 
 Mrs. Picto was Lady Dudley 's maid and Thomas Blount asked whether she thought what had happened was " chance or villany " : 
 she said by her faith she doth judge very chance , and neither done by man nor by herself . For herself , she said , she was a good virtuous gentlewoman , and daily would pray upon her knees ; and divers times she saith that she hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation . Then , said I , she might have an evil toy [ suicide ] in her mind . No , good Mr. Blount , said Picto , do not judge so of my words ; if you should so gather , I am sorry I said so much . 
 Blount continued , wondering : 
 My Lord , it is most strange that this chance should fall upon you . It passeth the judgment of any man to say how it is ; but truly the tales I do hear of her maketh me to think she had a strange mind in her : as I will tell you at my coming . 
 The coroner and the 15 jurors were local gentlemen and yeomen of substance . A few days later Blount wrote that some of the jury were no friends of Anthony Forster ( a good sign that they would not " conceal any fault , if any be " ) and that they were proceeding very thoroughly : 
 they be very secret , and yet do I hear a whispering that they can find no presumptions of evil . And if I may say to your Lordship my conscience : I think some of them be sorry for it , God forgive me . … Mine own opinion is much quieted … the circumstances and as many things as I can learn doth persuade me that only misfortune hath done it , and nothing else . 
 The jury 's foreman assured Robert Dudley in a letter of his own that for all they could find out , it appeared to be an accident . Dudley , desperately seeking to avert damage from what he called " my case " , was relieved to hear the impending outcome , but thought " another substantial company of honest men " should undertake a further investigation " for more knowledge of truth " . This panel should include any available friends of Lady Amy 's and her half @-@ brothers John Appleyard and Arthur Robsart , both of whom he had ordered to <unk> immediately after Amy 's death . Nothing came of this proposal . 
 The coroner 's verdict , pronounced at the local Assizes on 1 August 1561 , was that Lady Dudley , " being alone in a certain chamber … accidentally fell precipitously down " the adjoining stairs " to the very bottom of the same " . She had sustained two head injuries — one " of the depth of a quarter of a thumb " , the other " of the depth of two thumbs " . She had also , " by reason of the accidental injury or of that fall and of Lady Amy 's own body weight falling down the aforesaid stairs " , broken her neck , " on account of which … the same Lady Amy then and there died instantly ; … and thus the jurors say on their oath that the Lady Amy … by misfortune came to her death and not otherwise , as they are able to agree at present " . 
 Amy Dudley was buried at St. Mary 's , Oxford with full pomp , which cost Dudley some £ 2 @,@ 000 . He wore mourning for about six months but , as was within custom , did not attend the funeral , where Lady Dudley 's half @-@ brothers , neighbours , as well as city and county prominence played the leading parts . The court went into mourning for over a month ; Robert Dudley retired to his house at Kew . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Amy Dudley 's death , happening amid renewed rumors about the Queen and her favourite , caused " grievous and dangerous suspicion , and muttering " in the country . Robert Dudley was shocked , dreading " the malicious talk that I know the wicked world will use " . William Cecil , the Queen 's Principal Secretary , felt himself threatened by the prospect of Dudley becoming king consort and spread rumours against the eventuality . Already knowing of her death before it was officially made public , he told the Spanish ambassador that Lord Robert and the Queen wished to marry and were about to do away with Lady Dudley by poison , " giving out that she was ill but she was not ill at all " . Likewise strongly opposed to a Dudley marriage , Nicholas Throckmorton , the English ambassador in France , went out of his way to draw attention to the scandalous gossip he heard at the French court . Although Cecil and Throckmorton made use of the scandal for their political and personal aims , they did not believe themselves that Robert Dudley had orchestrated his wife 's death . 
 In October Robert Dudley returned to court , many believed , " in great hope to marry the Queen " . Elizabeth 's affection and favour towards him was undiminished , and , importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert , she declared the inquest had shown " the matter … to be contrary to which was reported " and to " neither touch his honesty nor her honour . " However , her international reputation and even her position at home was imperilled by the scandal , which seems to have convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley . Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation , even when he first got notice of the jury 's decision : " God 's will be done ; and I wish he had made me the poorest that <unk> on the ground , so this <unk> had not happened to me . " In September 1561 , a month after the coroner 's verdict was officially passed , the Earl of Arundel , one of Dudley 's principal enemies , studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival .

 John Appleyard had profited in terms of offices and annuities from his brother @-@ in @-@ law 's rise ever since 1559 ; he was nevertheless disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley , now Earl of Leicester . In 1567 he was approached , apparently on behalf of the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex , to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £ 1 @,@ 000 in cash . He refused to cooperate in the plot , although he had , he said , in the last few years come to believe that his half @-@ sister was murdered . He had always been convinced of Dudley 's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits . He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl 's help to this effect , claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict ; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest , since a jury had found that there was no murder , by due procedure of law . Now , as Leicester became aware of a plot against him , he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation . 
 Some weeks later the Privy Council investigated the allegations about Norfolk , Sussex , and Leicester , and Appleyard found himself in the Fleet prison for about a month . <unk> by Cecil and a panel of noblemen ( among them the Earl of Arundel , but not Robert Dudley ) , he was commanded to answer in writing what had moved him to implicate " my Lord of Norfolk , the Earl of Sussex and others to stir up matter against my Lord of Leicester for the death of his wife " , and what had moved him to say that " the death of the Earl of Leicester 's wife " was " procured by any person " . Appleyard , instead of giving answers , retracted all his statements ; he had also requested to see the coroner 's report and , after studying it in his cell , wrote that it fully satisfied him and had dispelled his concerns . 
 = = = Early traditions and theories = = = 
 From the early 1560s there was a tradition involving Sir Richard Verney , a gentleman @-@ retainer of Robert Dudley from Warwickshire , in whose house Lady Dudley had stayed in 1559 . A 1563 chronicle , which is heavily biased against the House of Dudley and was probably written by the Protestant activist John Hales , describes the rumours : 
 the Lord Robert 's wife brake her neck at Forster 's house in Oxfordshire … her gentlewomen being gone forth to a fair . <unk> it was thought she was slain , for Sir <unk> Varney was there that day and <unk> the deed was doing was going over the fair and tarried there for his man , who at length came , and he said , thou knave , why <unk> thou ? He answered , should I come before I had done ? <unk> thou done ? quoth Varney . Yeah , quoth the man , I have made it sure . … Many times before it was <unk> by the Lord Robert his men that she was dead . … This Verney and divers his servants used before her death , to wish her death , which made the people to suspect the worse . 
 The first printed version of Amy Robsart 's murder appeared in the satirical libel Leicester 's Commonwealth , a notorious propaganda work against the Earl of Leicester written by Catholic exiles in 1584 . Here Sir Richard Verney goes directly to Cumnor Place , forces the servants to go to the market , and breaks Lady Amy 's neck before placing her at the foot of the stairs ; the jury 's verdict is murder , and she is buried first secretly at the <unk> parish church before being dug up and reburied at Oxford . Verney dies , communicating " that all the devils in hell " tore him in pieces ; his servant ( who was with him at the murder ) having been killed in prison by Dudley 's means before he could tell the story . 
 Enhanced by the considerable influence of Leicester 's Commonwealth , the rumours about Amy Robsart 's death developed into a tradition of embellished folklore . As early as 1608 , a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall from a pair of stairs as an easy way to get rid of one 's wife : " A politician did it . " In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best @-@ selling novel , Kenilworth , by Walter Scott . The novel 's arch @-@ villain is again called Varney . The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence ( and with it of poison rumours ) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude . Generally convinced of Leicester 's wretchedness , he concluded in 1863 : " she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne ; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far . " There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885 : here she was first poisoned and then , that method failing , killed by violent means . Rye 's main sources were Cecil 's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley 's death and , again , Leicester 's Commonwealth . Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard , Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester , which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation . By 1910 , A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart 's death caused suspicion was " as natural as it was incredible … But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth 's or even Dudley 's would have perceived that murder would make the [ ir ] marriage impossible . " 
 = = = Modern theories = = = 
 The coroner 's report came to light in The National Archives in 2008 and is compatible with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence . In the absence of the forensic findings of 1560 , it was often assumed that a simple accident could not be the explanation — on the basis of near @-@ contemporary tales that Amy Dudley was found at the bottom of a short flight of stairs with a broken neck , her headdress still standing undisturbed " upon her head " , a detail that first appeared as a satirical remark in Leicester 's Commonwealth and has ever since been repeated for a fact . To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill , it was suggested in 1956 by Ian Aird , a professor of medicine , that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer , which through metastatic cancerous deposits in the spine , could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain , such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs . This explanation has gained wide acceptance . 
 Another popular theory has been that Amy Dudley took her own life ; because of illness or depression , her melancholy and " desperation " being traceable in some sources . As further arguments for suicide have been forwarded the fact that she insisted on sending her servants away and that her maid Picto , Thomas Blount , and perhaps Robert Dudley himself alluded to the possibility . 
 A few modern historians have considered murder as an option . Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley 's death on the grounds that , if Amy was mortally ill , he had the strongest murder motive and that he was the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal . Against this idea it has been argued that he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth 's reputation nor his own position . The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her ( with and without his master 's knowledge ) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c . 1563 chronicle by John Hales ( also called Journal of Matters of State ) and the 1584 libel Leicester 's Commonwealth . This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip , poison being a stock @-@ in @-@ trade accusation in the 16th century . 
 That Robert Dudley might have influenced the jury has been argued by George Bernard , Susan Doran , and by Chris Skidmore . The foreman , Sir Richard Smith ( mayor of Abingdon in 1564 / 1565 ) , had been a household servant of Princess Elizabeth and is described as a former " Queen 's man " and a " lewd " person in Hales ' 1563 chronicle , while Dudley gave a " Mr. Smith " , also a " Queen 's man " , a present of some stuffs to make a gown from in 1566 ; six years after the inquest . It has , however , not been established that Sir Richard Smith and the " Mr. Smith " of 1566 are one and the same person , Smith being a " very common " name . Susan Doran has pointed out that any interference with the jury could be as easily explained by the desire to cover up a suicide rather than a murder . 
 Most modern historians have exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover @-@ up . Apart from alternatives for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart 's death , his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil in the days following has been cited as proofs of his innocence ; the letters , which show signs of an agitated mind , making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness . It has also been judged as highly unlikely that he would have orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal .

 = Lactarius repraesentaneus = 
 Lactarius repraesentaneus , commonly known as the northern bearded milkcap , the northern milkcap , or the purple @-@ staining milkcap , is a species of fungus in the Russulaceae family . It has a northerly distribution , and is found in temperate regions of North America and Europe , associated with spruce trees . Distinguishing features of its fruit body include the large orange @-@ yellow cap up to 18 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) wide , cream to pale yellow gills , and a yellow coarsely @-@ pitted stem that is up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . Cut fruit bodies ooze a white latex that will stain mushroom tissue lilac to purple . Several chemicals have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies that can modify the growth of plants , and the mushroom also has antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus . L. repraesentaneus is poisonous , and consumption causes stomach aches . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Lactarius repraesentaneus was first described by German mycologist Max <unk> in 1885 , based on material collected from Bavaria . The variety Lactarius scrobiculatus var. repraesentaneus , proposed by <unk> in 1933 , is considered a synonym . Rolf Singer in 1942 defined the subspecies L. repraesentaneus ssp. speciosus to include fruit bodies with matted fibers ( " felt " ) arranged in concentric rings on the cap ( zonate ) , in comparison with the nominate subspecies , where in young specimens the felt was evenly distributed on the cap surface , only becoming zonate at the cap margins in maturity . 
 According to the classification proposed by Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their 1979 monograph of North American Lactarius species , L. repraesentaneus belongs in the stirps <unk> of the section <unk> , of the subgenus Piperites of genus Lactarius . Other species in stirps <unk> include L. <unk> , L. <unk> , and L. speciosus , all of which have a hairy cap edge . Singer 's 1986 classification of the Agaricales does not divide subsection <unk> into <unk> , instead grouping Lactarius repraesentaneus with L. <unk> , L. uvidus , L. <unk> , L. psammicola , and L. speciosus . 
 The mushroom is commonly known as the " northern bearded milkcap " , the " northern milkcap " , or the " purple @-@ staining milkcap " . The specific epithet repraesentaneus is Latin for " well @-@ represented " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of L. repraesentaneus is 6 – 18 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 1 in ) wide , convex to broadly funnel @-@ shaped . The margin ( the edge of the cap ) is conspicuously bearded on young specimens . The cap surface is faintly zoned to <unk> , with a thin layer of matted fibers , often becoming scurfy with age . It is dry to somewhat sticky , light yellow to orange @-@ yellow , sometimes with rusty tints when older . The attachment of the gills to the stem is slightly decurrent — running slightly down the length of the stem . The gills are moderately broad , close to crowded , sometimes forked near the stem . Normally a cream to pale ochraceous color , they will stain dull lilac to purple when bruised . 
 The stem is 5 – 12 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long , 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , nearly equal in width throughout or enlarged downward , hollow at maturity , sticky to dry , <unk> ( coarsely pitted ) , pale yellow to orange @-@ yellow , and stains dull lilac to purple . The flesh is firm , brittle , white , and will stain dull lilac to purple when cut . The odor is sometimes faintly fragrant or not distinctive , but when the mushroom is dry it smells intensely of soap . Its taste is mild to slightly acrid or somewhat bitter , and the flavor has been compared to sweet flag ( Acorus calamus ) . The abundant amount of latex produced by the mushroom is white to cream , unchanging , staining all tissues dull lilac to purple . It tastes mild to slightly acrid or somewhat bitter . The spore print is yellowish . The fruit bodies are poisonous and consumption will cause stomach aches , but the nature of the toxic agents has not been identified . 
 A new form , Lactarius repraesentaneus f. <unk> , was described from Le <unk> , in the Haute @-@ Savoie department of southeastern France in 2011 . It differs in the staining reaction of its injured flesh . 
 The spores are 8 – 12 by 6 @.@ 5 – 9 µm , broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid , ornamented with warts and ridges that do not form a reticulum , prominences up to 0 @.@ 8 µm high , hyaline , and amyloid . The cap cuticle is an ixocutis — with the hyphae embedded in a slimy or gelatinized layer . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Lactarius repraesentaneus is similar in appearance to Lactarius scrobiculatus , which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air , a different smell , a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali : in L. scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish @-@ orange while that of L. <unk> does not change color . Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction but it has a different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap . L. flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Like other Lactarius species , L. repraesentaneus is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees . This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees , forming a sheath of tissue . This enables the fungus to receive moisture , protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree , and affords the tree greater access to soil nutrients . The fruit bodies of L. repraesentaneus are found scattered or in groups on the ground under spruce from August to September . The fungus is distributed in higher elevations in the northern USA and southern Canada where spruce is present . It has also been reported from Alaska , California , and the Rocky Mountains . The frequency of its appearance is described as occasional to fairly common . In Europe , where it is fairly rare , it is found mainly underneath sallows ( Salix <unk> ) in forests at the foot of mountains on non @-@ calcareous soil . It has been collected in Czechoslovakia , Sweden , Switzerland , the French Alps and England ; overall , it is widely distributed throughout the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere . The fungus has also been collected under birch ( B. pubescens , B. nana , and B. glandulosa ) in Greenland . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 Lactarius repraesentaneus was reported to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947 . The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity , determined to be heat @-@ sensitive , was not identified . A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L. repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants . The chemicals , in a class called <unk> are named <unk> A , and two related sesquiterpenes , namely <unk> B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136 % , 118 % and 184 % at 67 ppm , respectively . Other compounds reported in 2006 are <unk> D , E , and F. <unk> E showed the strongest growth promotion activity , 164 % at 3 @.@ 6 µm , of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings . 
 = Curve @-@ billed thrasher = 
 The curve @-@ billed thrasher ( Toxostoma curvirostre ) is a medium @-@ sized mimid that is a member of the genus Toxostoma , native to the southwestern United States and much of Mexico . Referred to as the default desert bird , it is a non @-@ migratory species . Several subspecies have been classified since 1827 , though there is no consensus on the number . Allopatric speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve @-@ billed . It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member , Bendire 's thrasher . Nevertheless , it is recognized for its grey color and sickle @-@ shaped bill . It generally resides in desert regions of the United States and Mexico , but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans . 
 The demeanor of the curve @-@ billed has been described as " shy and rather wild " , but it allows humans to view it closely . It is very aggressive in driving out potential threats , whether competitors for food or predators of its chicks . The curve @-@ billed thrasher sometimes mimicks several other species , though not to the extent of other mimids . It has a variety of distinctive songs , and this extensive repertoire of melodies has led it to be known as <unk> ( songbird ) in Mexico . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first named Toxostoma curvirostre by William John Swainson in 1827 . Since then , six subspecies have been recognized , and have been divided into two branches . Genetic research has indicated that the curve @-@ billed thrasher is the sister species of a clade consisting of the ocellated thrasher , brown thrasher , long @-@ billed thrasher , and Cozumel thrasher . This contrasts with an earlier suggestion that curve @-@ billed and ocellated thrashers are closest relatives .

 Eastern : T. c. <unk> ( Law , 1928 ) Brownsville thrasher . Generally ranges from SE Texas to NE Mexico ( E Coahuila , Nuevo León and Tamaulipas ) 
 T. c curvirostre ( Swainson , 1827 ) Ranges from Central to South @-@ Central Mexico ( towards Pueblo , Oaxaca , and Veracruz ) . 
 T.c. <unk> ( R. T. Moore , 1941 ) plateau thrasher . Range spans from SE Colorado , SW Kansas , extreme NW Oklahoma to S / SE Arizona , S New Mexico and W Texas to Northern Mexico ( E Chihuahua to Guanajuato and Jalisco ) 
 Western : T. c. insularum ( van Rossem , 1930 ) San Esteban thrasher . Located in the Islands of San Esteban and <unk> off the coast of Sonora in the Gulf of California . 
 T. c. maculatum ( Nelson , 1900 ) spotted thrasher . Found in NW Mexico ( S Sonora , N Sinaloa , SW Chihuahua ) 
 T. c. occidentale ( Ridgway , 1882 ) Mazatlan thrasher . Located in Western Mexico ( from Sinaloa and Nayarit to Jalisco ) . 
 T. c. palmeri ( Coues , 1872 ) Palmer 's thrasher . Range is S Arizona , N <unk> and Chihuahua . This species is the representative of the western species , and was suggested to have enough variations to be considered a different species from T.c. curvirostre . T.c. palmeri was also used in a 2009 proposal by the American Ornithologists ' Union to be elevated to species status , along with the eastern T.c. <unk> representing the eastern curve @-@ billed thrashers . 
 = = Description = = 
 The curve @-@ billed thrasher generally measures 25 to 28 cm ( 10 to 11 in ) long , and is immediately recognized as a thrasher by its long tail and short wings . It is also recognized for its sickle @-@ shaped bill , almost as long as its head width and brownish @-@ black in color . The body is compact with a large head , short wings and long tail . However , the tail is short relative to other thrasher species . The chest is grayish @-@ brown with circular brown @-@ gray spots . The eyes are generally orange , shading to golden in adulthood . Juveniles are lacking in pale tips , <unk> , abdominal feathers are unkempt and upper parts and chest are washed <unk> . 
 Variations are markedly different with each subspecies . The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest , more white along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars . T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars . Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. <unk> ; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri and has more visible spotting on its breast . 
 One study published in 2003 suggested that curve @-@ billed speciation was due to climate , which could be explained by molt and feather wear . The same study suggested that the Sierra Madre Occidental acts as a barrier to initiate differentiation within the species .

 Because its coloration is similar to Bendire 's thrasher , the two birds are easily mistaken for one another . The bill of the curve @-@ billed is all black , while that of Bendire 's is paler down to the lower mandible , showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast . The upper and lower mandibles of the curve @-@ billed are curved , while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires ' . Although geographic variances for the curve @-@ billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult , the curve @-@ billed has a tendency to display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast , in contrast to the Bendires ' smaller , more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads . However , curve @-@ billed thrashers can also present this feature . Bendires ' typically have yellow eyes while curve @-@ billed eyes are typically orange , but Bendires ' can have variations that appear yellow @-@ orange while some curve @-@ billed eyes are red @-@ orange , yellow @-@ orange , or yellow . The curve @-@ billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions ; Bendires ' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around <unk> in agricultural areas . The song call of Bendire 's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck , while the curve @-@ billed is known for its whit @-@ wheet calls . 
 Some of the aforementioned differences , such as streaks on the breast , bill shape and eye color are even more prominent in juveniles of the two species . 
 = = Habitat and range = = 
 The curve @-@ billed thrasher is commonly found throughout the southwestern United States from Arizona 's Sonoran Desert across New Mexico to west Texas , southeastern Colorado and southwestern Kansas as well as most of Mexico from the Sonoran @-@ Chihuahuan Deserts and south through the Mexican Plateau into Central Tamaulipas , inland to Oaxaca , and on the coast of Sonora to Nayarit . Vagrants have been found in bordering states of its range , as far north as North Dakota , Alberta and Manitoba and as far east as Florida . Palmeri types have been spotted in Florida , while curvirostre have been found in Iowa on several occasions . Other than previously noted exceptions , the curve @-@ billed is essentially non @-@ vagrant . 
 In comparison with other desert thrashers , the curve @-@ billed is not as particular with habitats and can be found from ground level up to 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . It generally resides where cholla and saguaro cacti , <unk> , <unk> , palo verde , and creosote bushes are prevalent . It can also be located along woodland edges , piñon , dry desert bushland and areas within its region where cacti are present . If there is an adequate amount of desert vegetation near human habitation , along with feeders , the curve @-@ billed can adapt within these environments .

 The curve @-@ billed thrasher can generally be found running rapidly from cover to cover or flying near ground level from bush to bush . However , this bird is not shy about being in the open .

 The most distinctive voice of the curve @-@ billed is an abrupt and brash whit @-@ wheet , which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one 's attention . It is usually uttered from high perches . The songs are similar to that of the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly ; its voice is regarded as more pleasant . The curve @-@ billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times , the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds . Some phrases are nasal and buzzy ; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another .

 One recorded case of courtship behavior involving curve @-@ billed thrashers describes two males attacking each other vigorously and resorting to purring and <unk> sounds when neither bird appeared to relent .

The victor flew towards the female and both <unk> melodically before copulation . 
 = = Breeding = = 
 The curve @-@ billed breeding season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May ; however , new fledglings have been recorded as late as August . Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall . Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations , the cholla being favored . Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite , prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees . The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs . The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks , roots , coarse and fine grasses , rootlets or hair . 
 Both sexes build the nest ; the building periods can be as brief as three days to as long as four weeks . Egg count differs by location ; the number has been as low as two and as high as five . Egg color varies ; they can appear bluish @-@ green to pale yellowish @-@ blue , spotted abundantly in reddish @-@ brown . Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible as well as being the sole provider of brooding . Curve @-@ billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species ; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings . Curved @-@ billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds . In situations where food is scarce , parents feed older fledglings first .

 = Stefanie Rabatsch = 
 Stefanie Rabatsch ( née Isak ; born 28 December 1887 ) was an Austrian woman of the upper @-@ middle class known for being the unrequited love subject of Adolf Hitler , the future leader of the Nazi Party and dictator of Nazi Germany , when he was a teenager . Her Jewish @-@ sounding maiden name has been subject to much speculation . 
 Stefanie was born into a family of high social status . Hitler fell in love with her after she passed by him during her daily daughter @-@ mother stroll in Linz , glancing at him . Although madly in love with her to the point of suicide , Hitler never once spoke with her , and she later married an Austrian army officer . August Kubizek , a close childhood friend and later biographer of his childhood experience with Hitler , wrote about Hitler 's passion for her in his book , Adolf Hitler , My Childhood Friend . Stefanie stated in interviews that she was unaware of Hitler 's feelings towards her , and little is known about her life . 
 = = Background = = 
 August Kubizek , a music student from Linz , first met Hitler when the two were competing for a place to stand during an opera performance . According to him , Hitler 's passion for Stefanie began in spring 1905 , when he was 16 and attending school in Linz , and lasted until 1909 , when he was 20 . Kubizek recalls the first time he heard about Hitler 's obsession in his memoirs : 
 Born Stefanie Izak , she came from a family of higher social class than Hitler 's . She is thought to have been one or two years older than him . Stefanie had returned to Linz after professional training in Munich and Geneva . Kubizek describes her as " a distinguished @-@ looking girl , tall and slim . She had thick fair hair , which she mostly wore swept back in a bun . Her eyes were very beautiful " . Kubizek 's book was heavily edited during the Nazi period , especially the parts concerning the details of Hitler 's passion for Rabatsch , but was republished in many editions after the war . 
 = = Interaction with Hitler = = 
 According to Kubizek , Hitler never spoke to Stefanie , always saying he would do so " tomorrow " . He loathed those who flirted with her , especially the military officers , whom he called " conceited <unk> " ; he came to feel an " uncompromising enmity towards the officer class as a whole , and everything military in general . It annoyed him that Stefanie mixed with such idlers who , he insisted , wore corsets and used scent " . Hitler insisted that Kubizek stalk Stefanie and delivered daily reports on her activity while he was away visiting his mother or family . In one report , Kubizek wrote that Stefanie loved to dance and had taken lessons . Hitler disliked dancing and reportedly replied , " Stefanie only dances because she is forced to by society on which she unfortunately depends on . Once Stefanie is my wife , she won 't have the slightest desire to dance ! " In June 1906 , Stefanie gave Hitler a smile and a flower from her bouquet as she was passing him in her carriage . Kubizek later described the scene : 
 After Hitler 's mother died of breast cancer in 1907 , the funeral procession went through <unk> to Leonding . Kubizek remarks that Hitler said he had seen Stefanie at the funeral procession , which gave him some consolation . Kubizek claims that " Stefanie had no idea how deeply Adolf was in love with her ; she regarded him as a somewhat shy , but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful , admirer . When she responded with a smile to his inquiring glance , he was happy and his mood became unlike anything I had ever observed in him . But when Stefanie , as happened just as often , coldly ignored his gaze , he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and the whole world . " Hitler finally stated he planned to kidnap Stefanie and kill both her and himself by jumping off a bridge into the Danube . Instead he moved to Vienna , where an idealised image of Stefanie became his moral touchstone . Stefanie stated in later interviews that she was unaware of Hitler at the time , but that she had received an anonymous love letter asking her to wait for him to graduate and then to marry him , which she only realised after being questioned about him , must have been from Hitler . She recalled : 
 She became engaged in 1908 to an officer in the Hessian regiment stationed in Linz , and after the end of the Second World War she lived in Vienna . At Christmas in 1913 , when he was living in Munich , Hitler placed an anonymous personal ad in the Linz newspaper with his best wishes to her , but she was already married and in Vienna by then . She was interviewed and Hitler 's love for her dramatised in a 1973 Austro @-@ German television film called A Young Man From the <unk> . Little is known about her overall life . 
 = = Jewish @-@ sounding maiden name = = 
 Despite her Jewish @-@ sounding surname , Stefanie was not Jewish . However , most historians agree that Hitler would have assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin . American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred that she was Jewish , but saw no problems with this at the time . This view is supported by German historian Anton <unk> , who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname . British historian Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn 't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not . 
 = = Scholarly reactions = = 
 Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper considered Kubizek 's memoirs to be a valuable examination of Hitler 's early life , but also thought it did not answer all the questions historians would have wanted to see answered .

 Last Order is associated with the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII , a series of prequels and sequels to the original Final Fantasy VII . Although not an official Compilation installment or canon within it , the OVA has nonetheless been included in official guidebooks . The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII includes the games Before Crisis : Final Fantasy VII , Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII , and Crisis Core : Final Fantasy VII , as well as the film Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children and the collection of short stories On the Way to a Smile . Last Order 's soundtrack was released with the music of Before Crisis , and select songs were later remixed for Crisis Core . The OVA was created due to the success of promotional commercials for Before Crisis , with production lasting six months . 
 The plot of Last Order encompasses two events that occurred before the main events of Final Fantasy VII . One storyline revolves around the Nibelheim scenario that focuses on Zack Fair , Cloud Strife , Sephiroth and Tifa Lockhart . The other event follows Zack and Cloud as they run from the megacorporation Shinra . The OVA cuts back and forth between these two flashbacks , linked by the narration of Turk leader Tseng and his reflections on the Nibelheim event . Originally meant to focus on Zack , Last Order highlighted Tseng 's feelings and position in the Shinra company , as well as his moral values . 
 Although the 77 @,@ 777 copies of Advent Pieces : Limited that were released in Japan sold out months in advance of the official release date , Last Order received a negative fan response due to changes in content and presentation from the original Final Fantasy VII game , and because of this , the crew working on Crisis Core avoided recreating certain scenes from Last Order .

 Last Order explores situations shown and referenced within Final Fantasy VII and other Compilation titles . The world of Final Fantasy VII , referred to as " the Planet " , is dependent for its survival on a flow of spirit energy called the Lifestream . The megacorporation Shinra eventually rises to power and begins extracting the Lifestream through Mako reactors , killing the Planet . Shinra uses the Mako as an energy source and to manipulate the strength and abilities of their paramilitary organization , SOLDIER . Sephiroth , considered the strongest member of SOLDIER , is sent to investigate a Mako reactor in the secluded town of Nibelheim and is accompanied by the SOLDIER Zack and two grunts , one of whom is Cloud . While there , Sephiroth spends most of his time reading in the Shinra Mansion , which had previously been used by the Shinra scientist Hojo to conduct experiments . Through Hojo 's log books , Sephiroth comes to learn of his past , in which he was injected with Jenova 's cells . The Planet had once been inhabited by the Cetra ( or " Ancients " ) , who were almost completely destroyed by Jenova , an extraterrestrial lifeform that crashed onto the Planet 2 @,@ 000 years previously , and began infecting the Cetra with a virus . When Jenova was unearthed by a Shinra science team , it was mistakenly identified as a Cetra . This caused Sephiroth to believe he was also a Cetra , and that humans had betrayed his ancestors . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Narrated by Tseng , leader of the elite espionage and assassination division known as the Turks , Last Order switches between the Nibelheim incident and Zack Fair 's escape to Midgar with his unconscious friend , Cloud Strife . During the Nibelheim event , Sephiroth , insane after discovering his origins , sets fire to the village of Nibelheim . After killing many villagers , he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased . Tifa , a resident of Nibelheim , attacks him soon after he arrives . Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova 's body , preserved in a large glass tank filled with liquid . Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat , but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him . Sephiroth returns to Jenova 's body , but does not notice Cloud approaching . 
 Cloud immediately impales Sephiroth with his sword , cracking Jenova 's glass tank . He returns to Tifa and the two converse , while Sephiroth cuts off Jenova 's head . He carries the head with him towards Cloud and they engage in battle . During the fight , Cloud is impaled through the stomach and hung over the reactor 's core . In a feat of strength , he grabs Sephiroth 's sword and moves himself down the blade to solid ground and hurls Sephiroth aside . Sephiroth abandons the battle and jumps into the reactor core with Jenova 's head in an attempt to reach the " Promised Land " . Although Zack and Cloud survive the ordeal , they are taken to the Shinra Mansion by Hojo for experimentation . 
 The other event detailed in Last Order illustrates Zack and Cloud 's escape from Shinra . While at the Shinra Mansion , Cloud had succumbed to Mako poisoning caused by a surge of memories flooding through his mind , rendering him in an unconscious , non @-@ reactant state . Zack escapes with Cloud from the Mansion with the intention of returning to Midgar , the headquarters of Shinra . However , Shinra orders their paramilitary and the Turks to find and eliminate the two escapees . Tseng decides to capture them alive . 
 On a bluff overlooking Zack and Cloud , who had hitched a ride on a truck , Shinra operatives decide to ignore orders to wait for the Turks . One takes aim at the incapacitated Cloud . Zack jumps in front of Cloud , yelling at him to escape .

 = = Production and release = = 
 Last Order : Final Fantasy VII was produced and scripted by Madhouse and directed by Morio Asaka . The decision to create Last Order arose from the positive reaction towards a popular promotional clip created by Madhouse for the game Before Crisis . Madhouse was chosen to produce the OVA partly because of their success with the clip and because the president of Madhouse was very enthusiastic about the project . However , the main reason for choosing Madhouse was that the company " understood the significance " of making a Final Fantasy VII animation , as it was considered a large responsibility to animate " the most popular game in the FF [ Final Fantasy ] series . " Tetsuya Nomura , the character designer for the Final Fantasy VII series and co @-@ director of Advent Children , acted as the supervising director . He had the right to reject or accept concept drawings for Last Order . As a result , Nomura had a large quantity of images redrawn , to the extent that " the entire production was in jeopardy . " 
 Production lasted six months . The production crew considered the most challenging part of creating the OVA to be making " Nomura 's drawings move on screen . " Because Last Order was hand @-@ drawn , the crew faced difficulties creating uniform lines . Another issue was the overall feel of each scene ; original drawings were done by several artists , resulting in various scenes having different styles . Producer Akio Ofuji explained that they " wanted to make sure the final product was of very high quality , so [ they ] worked with the production company day and night , straight through to the deadline . " Nomura and Ofuji agreed that many scenes showing important events and feelings in Final Fantasy VII had been fragmented and disjointed , and so they had decided that those scenes would be the subject of Last Order , giving the audience of Advent Children ( the film Last Order was released with ) a " more enjoyable understanding . " They used the film as an opportunity to portray Zack " properly " as a " handsome , light @-@ hearted man [ who ] was in everyone 's memory " . Last Order also details Tseng 's growth and his feelings towards his both job and events depicted , wherein he attempts to " get his own ideas of justice heard " but later abandons his moral values " in order to carry out a cruel mission . " Ofuji commented that " those are the kind of scenes we wanted people to be more aware of . " 
 Last Order was originally released in Japan with the " Ultimate Edition " of the Advent Children movie , Advent Pieces : Limited , on September 14 , 2005 . The OVA was included in the North American " Limited Edition Collector 's Set " of Advent Children , released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on February 20 , 2007 . The North America release did not come with an English dub and the OVA is subtitled . Last Order was not included in the release of Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children Complete , a 2009 director 's cut of Advent Children with extra footage . 
 The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII is a series of prequels and sequels to the original Final Fantasy VII game . Last Order is not part of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and is considered an outside work . However , it has been associated with the Final Fantasy VII series since its creation , and is mentioned alongside official installments in official guidebooks and <unk> . Compilation titles include the film Advent Children and games Before Crisis ( mobile phone ) , Dirge of Cerberus ( PS2 ) , and Crisis Core ( PSP ) . Like Last Order , Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode : Final Fantasy VII ( a mobile phone spin @-@ off of Dirge of Cerberus ) is an outside work associated with the Compilation . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Last Order 's score was composed , arranged , and produced by Takeharu Ishimoto , including the ending theme entitled " Last Order " . The music was combined with the music from Before Crisis on a single soundtrack and released in Japan on December 19 , 2007 . The soundtrack was later made available in North America by Square Enix . Tracks 13 through 27 on the disc contain the score from Last Order , while tracks 1 through 12 contain music from Before Crisis . Select tracks on the soundtrack of Crisis Core contain music and remixes of music from the OVA . 
 OverClocked ReMix 's four @-@ disc tribute album , Voices of the Lifestream , has a disc entitled Order . The name was chosen to coincide with Last Order , and the music is themed after it .

 Only 77 @,@ 777 copies of Advent Pieces : Limited were produced in Japan , and they are no longer available , having been sold out months in advance of its release . They retailed for ¥ 29 @,@ 500 , or US $ 300 , each while the North American collector 's edition retailed for $ 49 @.@ 95 . 
 Overall , Last Order garnered positive feedback from Western critics . Chris Carle of IGN noted that Last Order was " the true meat of the new extras [ in the Advent Children collector 's set ] … a traditionally animated chapter for FF [ Final Fantasy ] fans that centers on the story of Zack and Cloud " and that " it adds even more dimension to the story [ of Final Fantasy VII ] . " Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk called Last Order " the real reason to check out the Limited Edition release for Advent Children " and commented that as " a long @-@ time anime fan and lover of Final Fantasy , " he " was enthralled by every minute to be had in Last Order . " However , Hideki Imaizumi , the producer of Crisis Core , stated that they had received " considerable negative feedback " from fans , who were displeased with changes made to the Nibelheim event in Last Order . Due to this , the scene was redone for Crisis Core , and the production crew was careful to avoid making the same decisions . 
 = Battle of Ismailia = 
 The Battle of Ismailia took place between the Egyptian Army and the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) during the last stages of the Yom Kippur War during October 18 – 22 , 1973 , south of the city of Ismailia , on the west bank of the Suez Canal in Egypt . The battle itself took place as part of the larger IDF @-@ launched Operation Abiray @-@ Lev , in an attempt to seize Ismailia and thereby sever the logistical and supply lines of most of Egypt 's Second Field Army across the Suez Canal . 
 Breaking out of their newly established bridgehead west of the Canal at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake , the IDF launched an offensive from Deversoir toward Ismailia . A combined force of Egyptian paratroopers and commandos fought a delaying battle , falling back upon defensive positions further north under increasing pressure from IDF infantry and armor . By October 22 , they were occupying a last line of defense , including positions along the Ismailia canal . Though outnumbered , they repulsed a final Israeli effort to capture the city ; a United Nations ceasefire was then imposed , bringing the battle to an end . The Egyptians registered a tactical and strategic victory in the defense of Ismailia , stopping an encirclement of their large forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal and ensuring their supply lines remained open . 
 = = Background = = 
 On October 6 , 1973 , Egypt launched Operation Badr , which started the Yom @-@ Kippur War . It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads on the east bank in Israeli @-@ occupied Sinai , and counter @-@ attacks by launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful . By October 10 , fighting along the front had come to a lull . Egyptian President Anwar Sadat soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes , despite protests and objections by his senior commanders against such an offensive . Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from the Syrians . The October 14 offensive was ill @-@ planned and ill @-@ executed , and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives . 
 The failed Egyptian offensive gave the initiative to the Israelis , who immediately launched Operation Abiray @-@ Lev , aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines . <unk> planned , the operation began smoothly , but quickly ran into problems . The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses , in what became known as the Battle of the Chinese Farm . After several days of heavy fighting , they were able to secure the roads to the canal , and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir , at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake . By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal . Two advanced south toward Suez City , while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General Ariel Sharon advanced north to seize Ismailia , hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The west bank of the canal was lined with a series of ramparts up to 30 meters ( 98 ft ) high , which the Egyptians referred to as " strong points " . These were used during the opening days of the war to allow Egyptian forces to directly fire on the Israelis on the east bank . There were five strong points between the Great Bitter Lake and the Ismailia Canal , from north to south : a pumping station at Deversoir , the village of Serabaeum , Touscan , Heneidac and Jebel Mariam . The area was largely agricultural , intersected with dikes and irrigation ditches , although these did not present significant obstacles . There were several villages and numerous farms , especially orchards of mango and orange trees . The density of foliage made the terrain unsuitable for vehicles . The Israelis called it the " jungle " or " Vietnam " . West of the Suez Canal , and running parallel to it , was the Sweetwater Canal , which distributed freshwater to the inhabitants of the canal zone and its cities . It branched from the Ismailia Canal , running east from the Nile River near Cairo to Lake Timsah at Ismailia . There were four bridges across the Ismailia Canal . The first was the Abu <unk> Bridge at Ismailia . Two bridges , one railroad and one vehicular , were located at the village of <unk> , on the western outskirts of Ismailia . Further west was the Upper Bridge , as it was called . Engineers had wired the bridges with demolition charges for destruction should they fall to the Israelis . Second Army 's reserve included the 10th and 118th Mechanized Infantry Brigades , with the latter occupying a series of fortified defenses on the northern bank of the Ismailia Canal . 
 The 182nd Paratrooper Brigade , comprising the 81st , 85th and 89th Battalions ( each composed of three companies ) under the command of Colonel Ismail Azmy , was assigned responsibility for defending the area south of Ismailia against an Israeli offensive . Azmy arrived at <unk> with the bulk of his brigade at midnight on October 17 , where he was briefed by Brigadier General Abd el @-@ Munim Khalil , commander of Second Army . Khalil identified the west bank strong points as objectives for the paratroopers to secure , as the ramparts could be used to provide fire support to Egyptian forces on the east bank . The paratroopers would also hold Serabaeum and the bridges there over the Sweetwater Canal . 
 The 85th Paratrooper Battalion , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel ' Atef <unk> , had been involved in a recent counter @-@ attack against Deversoir . Despite breaking through in certain areas and even seizing part of the airstrip at Deversoir , the paratroopers and their supporting armor were greatly outnumbered and the counter @-@ attack failed . The battalion suffered around a hundred dead , missing or wounded , and by dawn on October 18 it had been pulled back to <unk> Military Base for reorganizing . The only other Egyptian forces in the area were commandos , the 73rd Battalion of the 129th Sa 'iqa ( lightning ) Group . The Sa 'iqa had also been engaged in heavy fighting at Serabaeum , Deversoir and the nearby military base of Abu Sultan . By late October 17 , the battalion 's two companies had been ordered to withdraw from the vicinity of Deversoir northward to defend Serabaeum . 
 On October 18 , Sharon 's division across the canal included the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade under Colonel Danny Matt and an armored brigade under Colonel Haim Erez . Sharon , wanting to expand the Israeli bridgehead northward , received permission to cross a third unit , an armored brigade under Colonel Amnon Reshef , to the west bank , and did so on October 19 . The paratroopers and part of the armor had been holding the Israeli bridgehead since October 16 , facing little resistance , while Reshef 's brigade had been involved in heavy fighting at the Chinese Farm until it was relieved by Israeli reinforcements . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = First day = = = 
 On the morning of October 18 , Israeli paratroopers began their first push northward . Sharon ordered the attack , even though he had not yet received permission to launch an offensive in that direction . An Israeli battalion moved toward Serabaeum , spearheaded by a company mounted in half @-@ tracks . The village was then occupied by a company of the 73rd Sa 'iqa battalion , and the defenders received a platoon of reinforcements to compensate losses . The Israelis began receiving fire as they approached the town , but the battalion commander decided to push ahead . As they entered the village , they encountered heavy resistance , and the lead half @-@ track was cut off . Fourteen men including the company commander , Captain Asa Kadmoni , managed to take cover in one of the houses . Kadmoni took up a position covering several approaches and , with ammunition passed on to him by others , held his position for over three hours , engaging the Egyptians at ranges of 10 meters ( 33 ft ) to 15 meters ( 49 ft ) , hitting their positions with his LAW anti @-@ tank weapon . Other paratroopers with armor managed to reach the unit and retrieve them , before the Israelis withdrew under Egyptian pressure . The paratroopers suffered 11 killed and 27 wounded in the attack . Kadmoni would be awarded the Medal of Valor for his performance that day . 
 The Sa 'iqa battalion 's other company was occupying positions just north of Abu Sultan . Despite receiving the order to retreat during the night of October 17 – 18 , the Egyptians were heavily outnumbered and the intensity of the fighting prevented them from withdrawing from their positions . Consequently , Heikal ordered artillery barrages on the area , including the Sa 'iqa company 's position , inadvertently leading to friendly @-@ fire casualties . Soon after the firing subsided , Israeli paratroopers attacked at morning , and severe fighting , including hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , ensued . Both sides suffered heavy losses , but the Sa 'iqa held its position . At night , both companies retreated . The 73rd Battalion sustained 85 casualties , including 11 officers , throughout the fighting on October 18 , and subsequently was withdrawn to be reconstituted . 
 That morning , Azmy 's paratroopers moved south to their objectives , reaching them with relative ease . The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the pumping station . The commander made the mistake of separating his forces equally among all five strong points , rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points . However , from the rampart at the pumping station , the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir , and corrected artillery fire being directed against the bridge . Second Army 's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day , sometimes scoring hits on the bridge . Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis until the end of the war . 
 The accuracy of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis , who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it . Instead of concentrating forces for a counter @-@ attack , the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter @-@ attack to regain it , which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces . Meanwhile , the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses , mainly at a position south of the railway station , at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis . At this point , only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon 's division and the Ismailia Canal . 
 During the afternoon that day , Egyptian Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff Saad el @-@ Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia , at President Sadat 's request . Shazly sought to assess the situation and to work with Khalil on a plan to counter the Israeli advance . They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the east bank and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force , and to have Egyptian forces on the east bank attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli corridor to the canal . Azmy 's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal , and additional Sa 'iqa units would be committed . Shazly also solved a major problem concerning anti @-@ tank weaponry . Azmy 's brigade was almost completely lacking anti @-@ tank weapons ; it had been stripped of its anti @-@ tank guided missile ( ATGM ) battalion , equipped with AT @-@ 3 Saggers and RPG @-@ 7s , which was sent to the east bank to support the initial offensive . This battalion , and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade , were now withdrawn from the east bank throughout October 18 and brought back to their units . Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy , as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War , Ahmed Ismail , not to withdraw any units from the east bank . Several measures decided upon were not implemented however . 
 = = = Second day = = = 
 Amnon Reshef 's armored brigade completed its crossing that morning , and joined Sharon 's division , just as the latter received actual approval to begin an offensive toward Ismailia . In the meantime , the 85th Battalion had completed reorganizing at <unk> Base and returned to Ismailia , where it was placed under Azmy 's command once again . The 129th Sa 'iqa Group retreated to Abu <unk> , north of Ismailia , to reorganize , and Heikal was also informed of his group 's new area of operations , with the objective of defending the Upper Bridge , and the crucial Cairo @-@ Ismailia Desert Road that incorporated the bridge . 
 Sharon ordered Matt to push northward to Serabaeum again , where paratroopers of the 81st Battalion were occupying defenses . The attack failed once more , and Sharon now sent Reshef on Matt 's left flank . Using a battalion of some thirty tanks with mechanized infantry , Reshef used his superior maneuverability to flank the Egyptian position . There was heavy , close @-@ quarter fighting in the trenches , and extra units were brought up against the Orcha position . The paratroopers reported their defenses to have been penetrated during the afternoon , and they later withdrew after detonating the bridges over the Sweetwater Canal at Serabaeum . The Israelis captured Egyptian positions in the area , and discovered that Orcha Hill contained a major Egyptian radio intercept station . The capture of Orcha caused the collapse of Egyptian defenses in the area ; the paratroopers pulled back to the village of Ain Ghasin five kilometres north , and Azmy ordered the 89th Battalion to withdraw to the adjacent Touscan strong point , abandoning the ramparts at Serabaeum . These were occupied by the Israelis , which they used to fire on Egyptian positions across the canal . The Egyptians hastily organised defenses at Touscan . This new line of defenses was just over 12 kilometres south of Ismailia . 
 Meanwhile , Egyptian General Headquarters ( GHQ ) in Cairo , sent the 139th Sa 'iqa Group with its two battalions to Ismailia . They were given the objective of eliminating Israeli forces up to the Deversoir area and destroying Israeli bridges across the Suez Canal . A team of frogmen was attached for that end , and the group had no armor or heavy weaponry , and their only transports were large military trucks . GHQ did not include Second Army command in any of the planning , and in fact only notified Second Army of the operation on the morning of October 19 , when the Sa 'iqa Group had already begun moving to Ismailia from Cairo . This alarmed Second Army command , and Khalil ordered military police to stop the 139th Sa 'iqa Group 's vehicles at Abu <unk> , and have its commander , Colonel Osama Ibrahim , arrive at his headquarters in Ismailia . Ibrahim arrived that evening and met Khalil and Shazly . Both men were shocked when they learned of Ibrahim 's objectives , imaginary as they were and impossible to achieve , an indication of the state of confusion in GHQ at the time . Khalil canceled the entire operation and placed the Sa 'iqa unit under Second Army 's command instead , and Ibrahim in turn notified GHQ of his new orders . By midnight he was at Khalil 's headquarters once more , where he was informed GHQ 's reply : Ibrahim would proceed with his original mission . 
 = = = Third and fourth days = = = 
 Starting at sunrise on October 20 , the Israeli Air Force launched aerial attacks for the duration of the day , targeting Ismailia , the nearby al @-@ Galaa ' army base , and Jebel Mariam . Close air support was also provided to advancing ground forces . Israeli aircraft employed ordnance fitted with time fuses , as well as napalm to demoralize Egyptian troops . Shazly left Ismailia that evening , returning to Cairo where he presented a grim evaluation of the military situation to GHQ . His recommendation to withdraw armored forces to counter the Israeli threat on the west bank created a serious command crisis , and ultimately no withdrawal took place . 
 Sharon renewed his division 's attack that day , moving north from Serabaeum on a three brigade front , with Matt on the right , Erez in the center , and Reshef on the left . The advance spanned the entire area between the Suez Canal on the east and the Sweetwater Canal on the west . By dawn , both Touscan and Ain Ghasin were under attack . The 89th Battalion had concentrated all its forces at the Touscan strong point , where it was hard @-@ pressed by superior Israeli armored and mechanized forces . Azmy reported the situation to Second Army headquarters , and requested permission to detonate a nearby bridge on the Sweetwater Canal and flood the area before the advancing Israelis . Khalil however issued strict orders not to do so , since the canal was a crucial source of drinking water to civilians all the way up to Suez city . The situation was deteriorating for the paratroopers however , and Azmy soon had the bridge destroyed and broke down sections of nearby irrigation canals , flooding the entire area and submerging Israeli tanks up to their hulls in muddy water . This led to the paratroopers of Matt 's brigade spearheading the advance in the center instead , while the armored brigades were forced to have their mechanized infantry push ahead on foot . The Touscan position remained under heavy air and artillery attack , and by midday it was surrounded . Losses due to death and injury left the battalion with some 120 paratroopers still able to fight . 
 Meanwhile , the 81st Battalion was able to hold Ain Ghasin until the afternoon , when it retreated to Nefisha . As for the reconstituted 85th Battalion , it was ordered to occupy Jebel Mariam , Heneidac and Touscan . The battalion 's commander , Lt. Col. <unk> , found during a reconnaissance that Touscan was surrounded by large Israeli forces and under heavy fire , and so limited his battalion 's defenses to Jebel Mariam and Heneidac only , occupying the former with the battalion 's main forces , including two companies of paratroopers , and placing a single company at Heneidac . 
 The 139th Sa 'iqa Group , having had its mission confirmed by GHQ , began moving southward from Ismailia at sunset . Both battalions advanced in columns , each pushing a company ahead as a vanguard . Col. Ibrahim sent four patrols ahead to reconnoitre , and only one returned ; the rest were considered missing . As the Sa 'iqa group moved south , they encountered groups of Egyptian paratroopers from the 81st and 89th Battalions , retreating northward under Israeli pressure . When the unit neared Ain Ghasin they were ambushed by an Israeli force . An intense firefight took place as the vanguard engaged the Israelis , after some of their transports had been hit . Soldiers disembarked their vehicles and took cover in nearby farms and orchards . The vehicles and transports were turned back with great difficulty , and the entire Sa 'iqa group soon began to retreat to a position south of the village of Abu ' Atwa , itself roughly 3 kilometres south of Ismailia . Ibrahim called for artillery support , but the Israelis were jamming and interfering his radio net , and communicated with him in Arabic . This led to Israeli artillery fire falling on his forces instead . The Egyptians suffered few casualties though , due to the density of the mango trees , which minimized the hit radius of artillery rounds and provided cover from shrapnel . 
 = = = = Retreat to Ismailia Canal = = = = 
 Meanwhile , Heikal was able to contact Ibrahim and asked him to arrive at headquarters in Ismailia due to a change in orders , and he arrived sometime after midnight . Khalil had managed , after a lengthy and drawn @-@ out conversation , to convince GHQ to cancel the operation and place the 139th Sa 'iqa Group under his command to assist in fortifying Ismailia instead of sacrificing the elite force in a suicidal mission , and GHQ finally acquiesced . Ibrahim was now tasked with occupying and defending Abu ' Atwa and Nefisha . He reorganized his force , and occupied both villages with a battalion each by dawn on October 21 . 
 Despite the near @-@ debacle , the commitment of the Sa 'iqa , along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion , had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack . The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see @-@ saw fashion , raging back and forth , but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress , and the Egyptian paratroopers were firmly in control of Touscan . According to Trevor N. Dupuy , by this time Israeli artillery fire had made the main Cairo @-@ Ismailia road unusable . 
 Azmy lost contact with the 89th Battalion during the night , due to the intensity of Israeli bombardment on Touscan . At morning on October 21 the Israelis attacked again , and the paratroopers managed to repulse the attack again , before falling back . By dusk the battalion had abandoned the Touscan strong point and managed to retreat northward . Azmy had the 81st and 89th Battalions pulled back to the Ismailia Stadium , where they were to be reconstituted . The Israelis also attacked Heneidac at dawn that day using armor and infantry with air and artillery support , and captured the position before noon . The paratrooper company there pulled back north and joined the rest of the 85th Battalion at Jebel Mariam , now the only defensive position occupied by the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade , and the last position on the Suez Canal before Ismailia .

 During this time , Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar @-@ Lev , the heads of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon 's superiors , continued to press Sharon to send forces to the east bank to widen the corridor to the Israeli bridgehead , while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly , claiming that the attacks were unnecessary . Gonen finally issued a peremptory order to Sharon to transfer troops to the east bank and conduct a full @-@ scale attack to widen the corridor . Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the east bank tasked with launching the attack . Consequently , the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed . Gonen and Bar @-@ Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar , and ordered Sharon to renew the attack , this time transferring Reshef 's brigade . Sharon opposed this however , and argued that if he succeeded in his mission , the Egyptian Second Army would collapse , thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead . He retorted with the claim that had it not been for Southern Command 's hesitation , he could have encircled Ismailia by now . When his superiors remained adamant , Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense , Moshe Dayan , who called off any further attacks on the east bank . As a result , Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia .

 With Egyptian forces occupying a final line of defense , Khalil focused on preventing any Israeli crossing of the Ismailia Canal . To this end , he concentrated a large amount of firepower from various artillery units . Following the Israeli crossing , Brigadier General Abd al @-@ Halim Abu <unk> , commander of Second Army artillery , had managed to reorganize around ten artillery battalions in fire bases north of the Ismailia Canal , and incorporated the divisional artillery of Egyptian units on the east bank of the Suez Canal – an additional eight battalions . Abu Gazala thus had at his disposal between 12 and 16 battalions available for a single barrage incorporating a total of some 280 artillery guns . He also organized anti @-@ tank defenses , emplacing eight Sagger launchers at the easternmost Upper Bridge , and allocating six <unk> with Sagger launchers . 
 The 118th Mechanized Infantry Brigade was assigned positions occupying the bridges of the Ismailia Canal , and was to defend the city and nearby al @-@ Galaa ' army base . The 85th Paratrooper Battalion was directly ordered by Khalil to " hold Jebel Mariam to the last bullet and the last man " , due to its critical importance and dominance , overlooking Ismailia itself and the main approaches to the city . In addition to Second Army 's supporting artillery , the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade 's 120 mm mortar battalion , with eighteen mortars , was attached to the paratroopers at Jebel Mariam , significantly increasing their firepower . As for the 139th Sa 'iqa Group , its two battalions occupied Abu ' Atwa and Nefisha , and a company from the battalion at Nefisha was kept in reserve . While preparing defenses , the Sa 'iqa were confronted with huge numbers of civilians , mainly farmers , fleeing northward with as many belongings and livestock as possible , cluttering and blocking roads . 
 = = = = Final Israeli attack = = = = 
 Throughout the night of October 21 / 22 , the large artillery forces the Egyptians had concentrated began harassing the Israelis . The Egyptians had identified command posts and tank concentration areas for attack , especially at Serabaeum and Ain Ghasin , as well likely routes of attack , and continued to provide a withering fire support during the Israeli attack . At morning , Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions , concentrating on Jebel Mariam , Abu ' Atwa , Nefisha , and al @-@ Galaa ' base , and at noon they destroyed the Abu <unk> Bridge at Ismailia . At this time , company @-@ sized units of armor and infantry advanced against the Upper Bridge and the bridges at Nefisha but were repelled by Sagger missiles . 
 At around 10 : 00 am , the Israelis renewed the attack , moving toward Jebel Mariam , Abu ' Atwa and Nefisha . The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense fighting but , with their advantageous position , were able to repel the attack by late afternoon . Meanwhile , the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa 'iqa positions at Abu ' Atwa and Nefisha . At noon , advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa 'iqa reconnaissance unit , and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half @-@ track . At 1 : 00 pm , an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu ' Atwa without first scouting ahead , and was ambushed and annihilated . The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks . 
 At the same time , two tank companies and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha , supported with close air support . The Egyptian commando battalion in charge of Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged , heavy fighting that closed to very short distances . The Israelis lost three tanks , two half @-@ tracks , and a large number of men . For their part the Sa 'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos , including four officers , and 42 wounded , including three officers . Edgar O <unk> mentions a counterattack by the Sa 'iqa which took place during the afternoon and pushed some of Sharon 's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal . The Israeli attack had been thoroughly routed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With nightfall , the ceasefire imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 came into effect at 6 : 52 pm , ending the battle . A large number of Israeli wounded were still on the battlefield . Sharon requested helicopters to evacuate the wounded , but Bar @-@ Lev replied in the negative , as it was dark and too risky to land helicopters near the battlefield . The Israelis worked to extract the wounded from the battlefield anyway , and the rescue operations took some four hours before most of the wounded were finally evacuated . When sunrise arrived , Israeli paratroopers and Egyptian Sa 'iqa sometimes found that there were no more than 20 meters separating their positions , but the ceasefire held . 
 The combined Egyptian paratrooper @-@ commando force managed to achieve a tactical and strategic victory at a time when Egypt 's general situation on the battlefield was deteriorating , and GHQ was in a state of confusion . Sharon 's advance toward Ismailia had been halted , and Second Army 's logistical lines remained secure . According to Dupuy , the Israelis remained about ten kilometers south of Ismailia , now mostly a wrecked city . 
 While the Egyptians attribute their successful defense of the city to their staunch resistance , Sharon would remain adamant after the war that he had failed to capture Ismailia due to Southern Command 's interference . Sharon – who was a member of the political opposition in Israel – insisted that political issues played into hampering his advance against Ismailia . Sharon would frequently encourage his men by telling them " The secretary of the Likud Party is here with you . " 
 Ismail Azmy 's decision to detonate a bridge over the Sweetwater Canal on October 20 in order to stall an Israeli attack , in violation of direct orders not to do so , led to him being relieved of his command on October 25 , three days after the ceasefire . Captain Asa Kadmoni , who was awarded Israel 's highest military decoration for his actions on October 18 , later returned his medal as a protest against his government 's defense policy . 
 = = = Post cease @-@ fire reconciliation = = = 
 Israeli journalist Abraham Rabinovich , in his account of the Yom Kippur War , writes that despite being involved in intense fighting for several days , the Egyptian and Israeli soldiers in the Ismailia sector who survived the battle were among the first to reconcile , even when the first ceasefire was broken in the south and fighting resumed . On the morning of October 23 , an Israeli paratroop company under Captain Gideon Shamir was deploying near the Ismailia Canal , when Shamir saw Egyptian commandos , probably from the unit he had engaged the night before , encamped in an orchard less than 100 meters away . Wishing to ensure there would be no more killing in his sector , Shamir instructed his men to cover him and , taking a soldier who spoke Arabic , went to the commandos , shouting " Cease @-@ fire , peace " so as not to surprise the Egyptians . The commandos held their fire as the two Israelis presented themselves , and soon summoned their company commander , who identified himself as Major Ali . 
 Both men agreed to avoid shooting , and to avoid getting anyone on either side hurt . Ali even surprised Shamir by predicting that Sadat wanted peace with Israel , not just a cease @-@ fire . In coming days , soldiers from both sides would come out to the clearing between their positions and fraternized . When shooting erupted in nearby sectors , they would return to their respective positions . Initially , the Egyptians would fire if it was nighttime , but the Israelis held their fire , and soon the Egyptians stopped firing as well . Soon , the commandos and paratroopers would meet daily , drinking coffee , playing backgammon and soccer , getting to personally know each other , and occasionally holding a <unk> , with the Egyptians slaughtering a sheep and the Israelis presenting food parcels sent from home . The example set by the Egyptians and Israelis here was soon emulated in other sectors , and even Sharon came to see for himself the " local armistice " that had taken place . At one point , two officers came with Ali to meet with Shamir and said they hoped relations between Egypt and Israel would come to match the relations between Shamir 's and Ali 's men . 
 Rabinovich writes of this : 
 The Egyptian commandos and the Israeli paratroopers were at the spearheads of their respective armies . That these motivated fighters , left to themselves , chose at the first opportunity to lay aside their weapons and break bread together on the battlefield said something about what the war had wrought . 
 = Oswald of Northumbria = 
 Oswald ( c 604 – 5 August 642 ) was King of Northumbria from 634 until his death , and is venerated as a saint , of which there was a particular cult in the Middle Ages . 
 Oswald was the son of Æthelfrith of Bernicia and came to rule after spending a period in exile ; after defeating the British ruler Cadwallon ap Cadfan , Oswald brought the two Northumbrian kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira once again under a single ruler , and promoted the spread of Christianity in Northumbria . He was given a strongly positive assessment by the historian Bede , writing a little less than a century after Oswald 's death , who regarded Oswald as a saintly king ; it is also Bede who is the main source for present @-@ day historical knowledge of Oswald . After eight years of rule , in which he was the most powerful ruler in Britain , Oswald was killed in the Battle of Maserfield . 
 = = Background , youth , and exile = = 
 Oswald 's father Æthelfrith was a successful Bernician ruler who , after some years in power in Bernicia , also became king of Deira , and thus was the first to rule both of the kingdoms which would come to be considered the constituent kingdoms of Northumbria . It would , however , be anachronistic to refer to a " Northumbrian " people or identity at this early stage , when the Bernicians and the Deirans were still clearly distinct peoples . Oswald 's mother , Acha , was a member of the Deiran royal line whom Æthelfrith apparently married as part of his acquisition of Deira or consolidation of power there . Oswald was apparently born in or around the year 604 , since Bede says that he was killed at the age of 38 in 642 ; Æthelfrith 's acquisition of Deira is also believed to have occurred around 604 . 
 Æthelfrith , who was for years a successful war @-@ leader , especially against the native British , was eventually killed in battle around 616 by Raedwald of East Anglia at the River Idle . This defeat meant that an exiled member of the Deiran royal line , Edwin ( Acha 's brother ) , became king of Northumbria ; Oswald and his brothers fled to the north . Oswald thus spent the remainder of his youth in the Scottish kingdom of Dál Riata in northern Britain , where he was converted to Christianity . He may also have fought in Ireland during this period of exile . It has been considered that Oswald is one of the three Saxon princes mentioned in the Irish poem <unk> <unk> Dá <unk> , being named as ' <unk> ' in that work . 
 = = Victory over Cadwallon = = 
 After Cadwallon ap Cadfan , the king of Gwynedd , in alliance with the pagan Penda of Mercia , killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 ( or 632 , depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun ) , Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira . Oswald 's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia , but he was killed by Cadwallon in 634 ( or 633 ) after attempting to negotiate peace . Subsequently , Oswald , at the head of a small army ( possibly with the aid of allies from the north , the Scots and / or the Picts ) , met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield , near Hexham . Before the battle , Oswald had a wooden cross erected ; he knelt down , holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown in the hole to make it stand firm . He then prayed and asked his army to join in . 
 Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba offers a longer account , which Abbot <unk> had heard from Oswald himself . Oswald , he says , had a vision of Columba the night before the battle , in which he was told 
 Be strong and act manfully . Behold , I will be with thee . This coming night go out from your camp into battle , for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be delivered into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily . 
 Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle . In the battle that followed , the British were routed despite their superior numbers ; Cadwallon himself was killed . 
 = = Overlordship = = 
 Following the victory at Heavenfield , Oswald reunited Northumbria and re @-@ established the Bernician supremacy which had been interrupted by Edwin . Bede says that Oswald held imperium for the eight years of his rule ( both Bede and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle say that Oswald 's reign was actually considered to be nine years , the ninth year being accounted for by assigning to Oswald the year preceding his rule , " on account of the heathenism practised by those who had ruled that one year between him and Edwin " ) , and was the most powerful king in Britain . In the 9th @-@ century Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle he is referred to as a Bretwalda . Adomnán describes Oswald as " ordained by God as Emperor of all Britain " . 
 Oswald seems to have been widely recognized as overlord , although the extent of his authority is uncertain . Bede makes the claim that Oswald " brought under his dominion all the nations and provinces of Britain " , which , as Bede notes , was divided by language between the English , Britons , Scots , and Picts ; however , he seems to undermine his own claim when he mentions at another point in his history that it was Oswald 's brother Oswiu who made tributary the Picts and Scots . An Irish source , the Annals of Tigernach , records that the Anglo @-@ Saxons banded together against Oswald early in his reign ; this may indicate an attempt to put an end to Oswald 's overlordship south of the Humber , which presumably failed . 
 The Mercians , who participated in Edwin 's defeat in 633 , seem to have presented an obstacle to Oswald 's authority south of the Humber , although it has been generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield . It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith , a captured son of Edwin ( and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald ) , killed , although it is also possible that Penda had his own motives for the killing . 
 Oswald apparently controlled the Kingdom of Lindsey , given the evidence of a story told by Bede regarding the moving of Oswald 's bones to a monastery there ; Bede says that the monks rejected the bones initially because Oswald had ruled over them as a foreign king . To the north , it may have been Oswald who conquered the Gododdin . Irish annals record the siege of Edinburgh , thought to have been the royal stronghold of the Gododdin , in 638 , and this seems to mark the end of the kingdom ; that this siege was undertaken by Oswald is suggested by the apparent control of the area by his brother Oswiu in the 650s . 
 Oswald seems to have been on good terms with the West Saxons : he stood as sponsor to the baptism of their king , Cynegils , and married Cynegils ' daughter . Her name is reported by only one source , Reginald of Durham 's 12th century Vita S. Oswaldi , which says that it was <unk> . Although Oswald had one known son , Æthelwald , it is uncertain whether this was a son from his marriage to Cynegils ' daughter or from an earlier relationship — since Æthelwald began ruling in Deira in 651 , it has been argued that a son from this marriage would have been too young at the time to be trusted with this position , and therefore may have been older , the product of a relationship Oswald had during his exile . 
 = = Christianity = = 
 Although Edwin had previously converted to Christianity in 627 , it was Oswald who did the most to spread the religion in Northumbria . Shortly after becoming king , he asked the Irish of Dál Riata to send a bishop to facilitate the conversion of his people , and they sent Aidan for this purpose ; initially , the Irish sent an " austere " bishop who was unsuccessful in his mission , and Aidan , who proposed a gentler approach , was subsequently sent instead . Oswald gave the island of Lindisfarne to Aidan as his episcopal see , and Aidan achieved great success in spreading the Christian faith ; Bede mentions that Oswald acted as Aidan 's interpreter when the latter was preaching , since Aidan did not know English well and Oswald had learned Irish during his exile . 
 Bede puts a clear emphasis on Oswald being saintly as a king ; although he could be interpreted as a martyr for his subsequent death in battle , Bede portrays Oswald as being saintly for his deeds in life and does not focus on his martyrdom as being primary to his sainthood — indeed , it has been noted that Bede never uses the word " martyr " in reference to Oswald . In this respect , as a king regarded as saintly for his life while ruling — in contrast to a king who gives up the kingship in favour of religious life , or who is venerated because of the manner of his death — Bede 's portrayal of Oswald stands out as unusual . Bede recounts Oswald 's generosity to the poor and to strangers , and tells a story highlighting this characteristic : on one occasion , at Easter , Oswald was sitting at dinner with Aidan , and had " a silver dish full of dainties before him " , when a servant , whom Oswald " had appointed to relieve the poor " , came in and told Oswald that a crowd of the poor were in the streets begging alms from the king . Oswald , according to Bede , then immediately had his food given to the poor and even had the dish broken up and distributed . Aidan was greatly impressed and seized Oswald 's right hand , stating : " May this hand never perish . " Accordingly , Bede reports that the hand and arm remained uncorrupted after Oswald 's death . 
 = = Downfall = = 
 It was a conflict with the pagan Mercians under Penda that proved to be Oswald 's undoing . He was killed by the Mercians at the Battle of Maserfield , at a place generally identified with Oswestry ( although other candidates for the location of the battle have been suggested ) in 642 , and his body was dismembered . Bede mentions the story that Oswald " ended his life in prayer " : he prayed for the souls of his soldiers when he saw that he was about to die . Oswald 's head and limbs were placed on stakes . 
 The traditional identification of the battle site with Oswestry , probably in the territory of Powys at the time , suggests that Penda may have had British allies in this battle , and this is also suggested by surviving Welsh poetry which has been thought to indicate the participation of the men of Powys in the battle . It has also been considered that , if the traditional identification of the site as Oswestry is correct , Oswald was on the offensive , in the territory of his enemies . This could conflict with Bede 's saintly portrayal of Oswald , since an aggressive war could hardly qualify as a just war , perhaps explaining why Bede is silent on the cause of the war — he says only that Oswald died " fighting for his fatherland " — as well as his failure to mention other offensive warfare Oswald is presumed to have engaged in between Heavenfield and Maserfield . Oswald may have had an ally in Penda 's brother Eowa , who was also killed in the battle , according to the Historia <unk> and Annales Cambriae ; while the source only mentions that Eowa was killed , not the side on which he fought , it has been speculated that Eowa was subject to Oswald and fighting alongside him in the battle , in opposition to Penda . 
 = = After death = = 
 Oswald soon came to be regarded as a saint . Bede says that the spot where he died came to be associated with miracles , and people took dirt from the site , which led to a hole being dug as deep as a man 's height . Reginald of Durham recounts another miracle , saying that his right arm was taken by a bird ( perhaps a raven ) to an ash tree , which gave the tree ageless vigor ; when the bird dropped the arm onto the ground , a spring emerged from the ground . Both the tree and the spring were , according to Reginald , subsequently associated with healing miracles . Aspects of the legend have been considered to have pagan overtones or influences — this may represent a fusion of his status as a traditional Germanic warrior @-@ king with Christianity . The name of the site , Oswestry , or " Oswald 's Tree " , is generally thought to be derived from Oswald 's death there and the legends surrounding it . His feast day is 5 August . The cult surrounding him even gained prominence in parts of continental Europe . 
 Bede mentions that Oswald 's brother Oswiu , who succeeded Oswald in Bernicia , retrieved Oswald 's remains in the year after his death . In writing of one miracle associated with Oswald , Bede gives some indication of how Oswald was regarded in conquered lands : years later , when his niece Osthryth moved his bones to Bardney Abbey in Lindsey , its inmates initially refused to accept them , " though they knew him to be a holy man " , because " he was originally of another province , and had reigned over them as a foreign king " , and thus " they retained their ancient aversion to him , even after death " . It was only after Oswald 's bones were the focus of an awe @-@ inspiring miracle — in which , during the night , a pillar of light appeared over the wagon in which the bones were being carried and shone up into the sky — that they were accepted into the monastery : " in the morning , the brethren who had refused it the day before , began themselves earnestly to pray that those holy relics , so beloved by God , might be deposited among them " . 
 In the early 10th century , Bardney was in Viking territory , and in 909 , following a combined West Saxon and Mercian raid led by Æthelflæd , daughter of Alfred the Great , St Oswald 's relics were translated to a new minster in Gloucester , which was renamed St Oswald 's Priory in his honour . Æthelflæd , and her husband Æthelred , ealdorman of Mercia , were buried in the priory , and their nephew , King Æthelstan , was a major patron of Oswald 's cult . 
 Oswald 's head was interred in Durham Cathedral together with the remains of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne ( a saint with whom Oswald became posthumously associated , although the two were not associated in life ; Cuthbert became bishop of Lindisfarne more than forty years after Oswald 's death ) and other valuables in a quickly made coffin , where it is generally believed to remain , although there are at least four other claimed heads of Oswald in continental Europe . One of his arms is said to have ended up in Peterborough Abbey later in the Middle Ages . The story is that a small group of monks from Peterborough made their way to Bamburgh where Oswald 's uncorrupted arm was kept and stole it under the cover of darkness . They returned with it to Peterborough and in due time a chapel was created for the arm - Oswald 's Chapel . This - minus the arm - can be seen to this day in the south transept of the cathedral . When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - just big enough for a monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald 's Arm 24 hours a day , every day of the year . The monk had to stand because the tower is not large enough for him to sit - sitting could lull him to sleep - and they knew what could happen when no @-@ one was watching . 
 St Oswald 's Catholic Church lies to the north of Peterborough City Centre , with another situated in the centre of Grasmere ; purportedly on one of the sites he preached on , on a bank of the River <unk> , William Wordsworth 's grave is located in the cemetery here . 
 Some English place names record his reign , for example it has been claimed that Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire – meaning the <unk> of Oswald – is linked to the saint , although it 's more likely to be the name of the owner of the land . Kirkoswald in Cumbria is so named because it is believed that his body was taken there after his death . The local church is ascribed to him . Another Kirkoswald in Scotland also commemorates him . 
 The Church of Saint Oswald stands on the location of the wooden cross left by Oswald at Heavenfield , the night before the battle . This was rebuilt in 1717 . The site is visible from the <unk> Military Road . 
 = No Doubt ( No Doubt album ) = 
 No Doubt is the self @-@ titled debut studio album by the American rock band No Doubt , released March 17 , 1992 on Interscope Records . The album was originally recorded as an independent release , but was re @-@ recorded after the band was signed to Interscope . It was produced by Dito Godwin and recorded in a recording studio in Los Angeles . 
 The album was released during a period in which the United States was mainly focused on grunge music , an angst @-@ ridden genre that was almost the complete opposite of No Doubt 's upbeat commercial sound . Despite strong tours , the album failed to perform as well as the record company expected it to , selling only 30 @,@ 000 copies . The record company refused to fund the release of a single from it , so No Doubt released the album 's only single , " Trapped in a Box " , independently . Since the band signed out of Interscope , the band independently produced and released a follow @-@ up to No Doubt , The Beacon Street Collection , in 1995 . This album had a better commercial performance than the band 's debut album , selling 100 @,@ 000 copies , leading Interscope to finance and support their third album , Tragic Kingdom . 
 = = Background = = 
 John Spence , Eric Stefani , and Eric 's sister Gwen Stefani formed the band as Apple Core in 1986 , having worked together at a local Dairy Queen . It played small gigs around the Orange County area , with Spence 's on @-@ stage antics carrying its performances . Tony Kanal went to one of these early shows and soon joined the band as its bassist . After initially rejecting her advances , he began dating Gwen , but they kept their relationship secret for a year , feeling that it was an unspoken rule that nobody date her . 
 In December 1987 , Spence committed suicide several days before the band was to play a gig at The Roxy Theatre for record industry employees . No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks with Alan Meade taking over vocals . When Meade left the band , Gwen replaced him as lead singer , while No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California . In early 1988 , Tom Dumont left Rising , a heavy metal band of which he was a member with his sister , stating that local metal bands " were into drinking , wearing Spandex " but that he wanted to focus on music . He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band 's guitarist , adding a metal influence to its sound . Adrian Young replaced Chris Webb as the drummer the following year . 
 Impressed by the presence of stage diving at ska concerts and Gwen 's on @-@ stage presence , Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi @-@ album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1991 .

 In 1991 , No Doubt were signed to Interscope Records , which was a new label at the time . The band had just finished recording an indie CD that they were going to release themselves . When they were signed by the record label , they decided to take advantage of the offer to re @-@ record the CD in a professional studio . However , they weren 't receiving any support that they expected : 
 " And we thought we were recording in a really good studio , " " But looking back , we were naive . It was almost like an independent release , anyway - there was no push for the record [ by Interscope ] and no kind of support at all . Everything we did on that record , we did ourselves . 
 The band spent less than $ 13 @,@ 000 in the process of recording their debut album , featuring both songs written as long ago as 1987 and new songs written specifically for the disc . All of the band members continued going to school to finish their education while recording their debut album in a Los Angeles studio . 
 To promote their album , in the summer of 1992 the band went on two two @-@ week tours of the Western area of the United States . In the fall , they embarked on a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half month national tour . Due to the commercial failure of their album , Interscope refused to support the tour , leaving the band to finance it themselves . They played alongside bands such as Rage Against the Machine , Ugly Kid Joe , Sublime , Dance Hall Crashers , 311 , Public Enemy , Pato Banton and The Special Beat .

 After the disappointing sales of No Doubt , Interscope did not wish to finance the release of a single from the record . However , the band financed the shooting of a video for the song " Trapped in a Box " out of their own pockets . Roughly $ 5 @,@ 000 was spent on it . The video got local airplay in Orange County but , despite the band 's hopes , it was never aired on either MTV or VH1 , although it was played on MuchMusic in Canada . It failed to achieve status on any chart . In 2003 the song was released on No Doubt 's greatest hits compilation album The Singles 1992 @-@ 2003 and the video was released on the companion DVD of music videos , The Videos 1992 @-@ 2003 . 
 Within the booklet from The Singles 1992 @-@ 2003 is a blurb on each song . The short paragraph on " Trapped in a Box " states : 
 The oldest track in this collection , " Trapped in a Box " is the sole representative of No Doubt 's eponymous major label debut and a good barometer for their development . Beginning as a poem Tom wrote for school , bandleader at the time Eric Stefani then shaped the arrangement with everyone contributing lyrics . Together for six years when recorded , the band had moved beyond their ska roots . The horn section and quasi @-@ ska rhythms remain inspired by those early Madness / Fishbone influences , while the emerging sense of flow and pop bounce makes the track a benchmark for the time and a notable milestone today . Ostensibly their first official single , " Trapped " was admittedly too out there for the radio of the time . It wasn 't aggressively promoted and largely fell upon deaf ears in a world enthralled with an " alternative revolution " mainly centered on male aggression . That changed soon enough . 
 The song is based on a poem that guitarist Tom Dumont wrote about being addicted to television and how it can control one 's way of thinking . <unk> described the song as " <unk> " and " the weakest track [ on The Singles 1992 @-@ 2003 ] in the way of singing , but [ with ] smart lyrics " . Music OMH , however , described the song as a " kooky , almost novelty single " and CD Universe described the song as a " rhythmic workout " . Rhapsody , in a positive review , described it as " one of the album 's highlights " and Allmusic called it " as exciting " as two of No Doubt 's more successful singles , " Hella Good " and " Just a Girl " .

 = = = Significance = = = 
 The group 's ska sound contrasted greatly with the popular music genre in the USA at the time , grunge music . The album was a commercial failure , with only 30 @,@ 000 copies sold . In the words of the program director of KROQ , a Californian radio station on which it was one of the band 's driving ambitions to be played : " It would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio . " 
 The lack of record company support frustrated the band and led the band to self @-@ produce their next album , The Beacon Street Collection , in a home @-@ made studio , causing them to move away from the slick pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style . Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies in 1995 , the year of its release , over three times as many as No Doubt sold . To capitalize on this success , Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album , Tragic Kingdom , under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed . 
 The success of their third album , Tragic Kingdom , led to an interest by fans in the band 's earlier albums , No Doubt and The Beacon Street Collection , and many more copies of them were manufactured and sold . The Beacon Street Collection was re @-@ released in October 1997 as part of the band 's back catalog and , by the summer of 1997 , No Doubt had sold 250 @,@ 000 copies .

 Yahoo ! Music reviewer , Bill Holdship , called the album " a rather nondescript ska @-@ pop effort " . Allmusic gave the album a mixed review , calling it " a polished production " . It described the music on the album as " pop @-@ orientated " , with " new wave keyboards and punchy brass proving a foil to the basic ska framework " , and complimented Gwen Stefani 's " extroverted " vocals . Rhapsody also gave the album a positive review , albeit retrospectively , calling it " a far cry from the radio pop [ the band ] became known for " .

 = Enzyme kinetics = 
 Enzyme kinetics is the study of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes . In enzyme kinetics , the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated . Studying an enzyme 's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme , its role in metabolism , how its activity is controlled , and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme . 
 Enzymes are usually protein molecules that manipulate other molecules — the enzymes ' substrates . These target molecules bind to an enzyme 's active site and are transformed into products through a series of steps known as the enzymatic mechanism 
 E + S ⇄ ES ⇄ ES * ⇄ EP ⇄ E + P 
 These mechanisms can be divided into single @-@ substrate and multiple @-@ substrate mechanisms . Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate , such as <unk> isomerase , aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate . Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase , both of which are important for cellular respiration ( glycolysis ) .
