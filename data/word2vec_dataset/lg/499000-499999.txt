 Irving was still in London when Van Buren received word that the United States Senate had refused to confirm him as the new Minister . <unk> Van Buren , Irving predicted that the Senate 's partisan move would backfire . " I should not be surprised " , Irving said , " if this vote of the Senate goes far toward elevating him to the presidential chair " .

 Washington Irving arrived in New York , after seventeen years abroad , on May 21 , 1832 . That September , he accompanied the U.S. Commissioner on Indian Affairs , Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , along with companions Charles La Trobe and Count Albert @-@ Alexandre de <unk> , on a surveying mission deep in Indian Territory , now known as Oklahoma . At the completion of his western tour , Irving traveled through Washington , D.C. and Baltimore , where he became acquainted with the politician and novelist John Pendleton Kennedy . 
 Frustrated by bad investments , Irving turned to writing to generate additional income , beginning with A Tour on the Prairies , a work which related his recent travels on the frontier . The book was another popular success and also the first book written and published by Irving in the United States since A History of New York in 1809 . In 1834 , he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor , who convinced Irving to write a history of his fur trading colony in the American Northwest , now known as Astoria , Oregon . Irving made quick work of Astor 's project , shipping the fawning biographical account titled Astoria in February 1836 . In 1835 Irving , Astor and a few others founded the Saint Nicholas Society in the City of New York . 
 During an extended stay at Astor 's , Irving met the explorer Benjamin Bonneville , who intrigued Irving with his maps and stories of the territories beyond the Rocky Mountains . When the two met in Washington , D.C. several months later , Bonneville opted to sell his maps and rough notes to Irving for $ 1 @,@ 000 . Irving used these materials as the basis for his 1837 book The Adventures of Captain Bonneville . 
 These three works made up Irving 's " western " series of books and were written partly as a response to criticism that his time in England and Spain had made him more European than American . In the minds of some critics , especially James Fenimore Cooper and Philip Freneau , Irving had turned his back on his American heritage in favor of English aristocracy . Irving 's western books , particularly A Tour on the Prairies , were well received in the United States , though British critics accused Irving of " book @-@ making " . 
 In 1835 , Irving purchased a " neglected cottage " and its surrounding riverfront property in Tarrytown , New York . The house , which he named Sunnyside in 1841 , required constant repair and renovation over the next twenty years . With costs of Sunnyside escalating , Irving reluctantly agreed in 1839 to become a regular contributor to The Knickerbocker magazine , writing new essays and short stories under the Knickerbocker and Crayon pseudonyms . 
 He was regularly approached by aspiring young authors for advice or endorsement , including Edgar Allan Poe , who sought Irving 's comments on " William Wilson " and " The Fall of the House of Usher " . Irving also championed America 's maturing literature , advocating stronger copyright laws to protect writers from the kind of piracy that had initially plagued The Sketch Book . Writing in the January 1840 issue of Knickerbocker , he openly endorsed copyright legislation pending in the U.S. Congress . " We have a young literature " , he wrote , " springing up and daily unfolding itself with wonderful energy and luxuriance , which ... deserves all its fostering care " . The legislation did not pass . In 1841 , he was elected in the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician . 
 Irving at this time also began a friendly correspondence with the English writer Charles Dickens and hosted the author and his wife at Sunnyside during Dickens 's American tour in 1842 . 
 = = = Minister to Spain = = = 
 In 1842 , after an endorsement from Secretary of State Daniel Webster , President John Tyler appointed Irving as Minister to Spain . Irving was surprised and honored , writing , " It will be a severe trial to absent myself for a time from my dear little Sunnyside , but I shall return to it better enabled to carry it on comfortably " . 
 While Irving hoped his position as Minister would allow him plenty of time to write , Spain was in a state of perpetual political upheaval during most of his tenure , with a number of warring factions vying for control of the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Queen Isabella II . Irving maintained good relations with the various generals and politicians , as control of Spain rotated through <unk> , Bravo , then <unk> . However , the politics and warfare were exhausting , and Irving — homesick and suffering from a crippling skin condition — grew quickly disheartened : 
 I am wearied and at times heartsick of the wretched politics of this country . . . . The last ten or twelve years of my life , passed among sordid speculators in the United States , and political adventurers in Spain , has shewn me so much of the dark side of human nature , that I begin to have painful doubts of my fellow man ; and look back with regret to the confiding period of my literary career , when , poor as a rat , but rich in dreams , I beheld the world through the medium of my imagination and was apt to believe men as good as I wished them to be . 
 With the political situation in Spain relatively settled , Irving continued to closely monitor the development of the new government and the fate of Isabella . His official duties as Spanish Minister also involved negotiating American trade interests with Cuba and following the Spanish parliament 's debates over slave trade . He was also pressed into service by the American Minister to the Court of St. James 's in London , Louis McLane , to assist in negotiating the Anglo @-@ American disagreement over the Oregon border that newly elected president James K. Polk had vowed to resolve .

 Returning from Spain in 1846 , Irving took up permanent residence at Sunnyside and began work on an " Author 's Revised Edition " of his works for publisher George Palmer Putnam . For its publication , Irving had made a deal that guaranteed him 12 percent of the retail price of all copies sold . Such an agreement was unprecedented at that time . On the death of John Jacob Astor in 1848 , Irving was hired as an executor of Astor 's estate and appointed , by Astor 's will , as first chairman of the Astor library , a forerunner to the New York Public Library . 
 As he revised his older works for Putnam , Irving continued to write regularly , publishing biographies of the writer and poet Oliver Goldsmith in 1849 and the 1850 work about the Islamic prophet Muhammad . In 1855 , he produced Wolfert 's Roost , a collection of stories and essays he had originally written for The Knickerbocker and other publications , and began publishing at intervals a biography of his namesake , George Washington , a work which he expected to be his masterpiece . Five volumes of the biography were published between 1855 and 1859 . Irving traveled regularly to Mount Vernon and Washington , D.C. for his research , and struck up friendships with Presidents Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce . 
 He continued to socialize and keep up with his correspondence well into his seventies , and his fame and popularity continued to soar . " I don 't believe that any man , in any country , has ever had a more affectionate admiration for him than that given to you in America " , wrote Senator William C. Preston in a letter to Irving . " I believe that we have had but one man who is so much in the popular heart " . By 1859 , author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. noted that Sunnyside had become " next to Mount Vernon , the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land " . 
 On the night of November 28 , 1859 , at 9 : 00 pm , only eight months after completing the final volume of his Washington biography , Washington Irving died of a heart attack in his bedroom at Sunnyside at the age of 76 . Legend has it that his last words were : " Well , I must arrange my pillows for another night . When will this end ? " He was buried under a simple headstone at Sleepy Hollow cemetery on December 1 , 1859 . 
 Irving and his grave were commemorated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his 1876 poem , " In The Churchyard at Tarrytown " , which concludes with :

 = = = Literary reputation = = = 
 Irving is largely credited as the first American Man of Letters , and the first to earn his living solely by his pen . <unk> Irving before the Massachusetts Historical Society in December 1859 , his friend , the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , acknowledged Irving 's role in promoting American literature : " We feel a just pride in his renown as an author , not forgetting that , to his other claims upon our gratitude , he adds also that of having been the first to win for our country an honourable name and position in the History of Letters " . 
 Irving perfected the American short story , and was the first American writer to place his stories firmly in the United States , even as he poached from German or Dutch folklore . He is also generally credited as one of the first to write both in the vernacular , and without an obligation to the moral or didactic in his short stories , writing stories simply to entertain rather than to enlighten . Irving also encouraged would @-@ be writers . As George William Curtis noted , there " is not a young literary aspirant in the country , who , if he ever personally met Irving , did not hear from him the kindest words of sympathy , regard , and encouragement " . 
 Some critics , however — including Edgar Allan Poe — felt that while Irving should be given credit for being an innovator , the writing itself was often unsophisticated . " Irving is much over @-@ rated " , Poe wrote in 1838 , " and a nice distinction might be drawn between his just and his surreptitious and adventitious reputation — between what is due to the pioneer solely , and what to the writer " . A critic for the New @-@ York Mirror wrote : " No man in the Republic of Letters has been more overrated than Mr. Washington Irving " . Some critics noted especially that Irving , despite being an American , catered to British sensibilities and , as one critic noted , wrote " of and for England , rather than his own country " . 
 Other critics were inclined to be more forgiving of Irving 's style . William Makepeace Thackeray was the first to refer to Irving as the " ambassador whom the New World of Letters sent to the Old " , a banner picked up by writers and critics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries . " He is the first of the American humorists , as he is almost the first of the American writers " , wrote critic H.R. <unk> in 1881 , " yet belonging to the New World , there is a quaint Old World flavor about him " . 
 Early critics often had difficulty separating Irving the man from Irving the writer — " The life of Washington Irving was one of the brightest ever led by an author " , wrote Richard Henry Stoddard , an early Irving biographer — but as years passed and Irving 's celebrity personality faded into the background , critics often began to review his writings as all style , no substance . " The man had no message " , said critic Barrett Wendell . Yet , critics conceded that despite Irving 's lack of sophisticated themes — Irving biographer Stanley T. Williams could be scathing in his assessment of Irving 's work — most agreed he wrote elegantly .

 Irving popularized the nickname " Gotham " for New York City , later used in Batman comics and movies as the name of Gotham City , and is credited with inventing the expression " the almighty dollar " . 
 The surname of his Dutch historian , Diedrich Knickerbocker , is generally associated with New York and New Yorkers , and can still be seen across the jerseys of New York 's professional basketball team , albeit in its more familiar , abbreviated form , reading simply Knicks . In Bushwick , Brooklyn , a neighborhood of New York City , there are two parallel streets named Irving Avenue and Knickerbocker Avenue ; the latter forms the core of the neighborhood 's shopping district . 
 One of Irving 's most lasting contributions to American culture is in the way Americans perceive and celebrate Christmas . In his 1812 revisions to A History of New York , Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon — a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus . In his five Christmas stories in The Sketch Book , Irving portrayed an idealized celebration of old @-@ fashioned Christmas customs at a quaint English manor , that depicted harmonious warm @-@ hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall , Birmingham , England , that had largely been abandoned . He used text from The Vindication of Christmas ( London 1652 ) of old English Christmas traditions , he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories . The book contributed to the revival and reinterpretation of the Christmas holiday in the United States . 
 In his biography of Christopher Columbus , Irving introduced the erroneous idea that Europeans believed the world to be flat prior to the discovery of the New World . Borrowed from Irving , the flat @-@ Earth myth has been taught in schools as fact to many generations of Americans . 
 The American painter John Quidor based many of his paintings on scenes from the works of Irving about Dutch New York , including such paintings as Ichabod Crane Flying from the Headless Horseman ( 1828 ) , The Return of Rip Van Winkle ( 1849 ) , and The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane ( 1858 ) .

Influential residents of the village prevailed upon the Hudson River Railroad , which had reached the village by 1849 , to change the name of the train station to " Irvington " , and also convinced the Postmaster to change the name of the local post office as well . It was thus under the name of " Irvington " that the village incorporated on April 16 , 1872 .

 Chamba ( Hindi : <unk> ् <unk> ) is an ancient town in the Chamba district in the state of Himachal Pradesh , in northern India . According to the 2001 Indian census , Chamba has a population of 20 @,@ 312 people . Located at an altitude of 996 metres ( 3 @,@ 268 ft ) above mean sea level , the town is situated on the banks of the Ravi River ( a major tributary of the Trans @-@ Himalayan Indus River ) , at its confluence with the Sal River . <unk> were the Rulers of Chamba dynasty <unk> use suffix <unk> . 
 Though historical records date the history of the Chamba region to the <unk> tribes in the 2nd century BC , the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty , starting with the Raju Maru from around 500 AD , ruling from the ancient capital of Bharmour , which is located 75 kilometres ( 47 mi ) from the town of Chamba . In 920 , Raja Sahil Varman ( or Raja Sahil Verma ) shifted the capital of the kingdom to Chamba , following the specific request of his daughter Champavati ( Chamba was named after her ) . From the time of Raju Maru , 67 Rajas of this dynasty have ruled over Chamba until it finally merged with the Indian Union in April 1948 , although Chamba was under British suzerainty from 1846 to this time . 
 The town has numerous temples and palaces , and hosts two popular <unk> ( fairs ) , the " Suhi Mata Mela " and the " Minjar Mela " , which last for several days of music and dancing . Chamba is also well noted for its arts and crafts , particularly its Pahari paintings , which originated in the Hill Kingdoms of North India between the 17th and 19th century , and its handicrafts and textiles .

 Chamba has an ancient history , which is inseparable from that of the surrounding district of Chamba . The earliest rulers were <unk> tribes . In the 2nd century BC the <unk> and <unk> were in power in the region . In the 4th century AD during the Gupta period , the <unk> and <unk> ruled . From the 7th century , the Gurjara Pratiharas or the Rajput dynasty came into power . 
 The recorded history of the Rajput rulers is traced to an eminent individual named Maru who is said to have moved to northwest India from <unk> , around 500 AD . He founded his capital in the <unk> river valley at a place called Brahmaputra , which later became known as Bharmour or <unk> , which is situated 75 kilometres ( 47 mi ) to the east of the present day Chamba town . For three hundred years , kings of Rajput Dynasty ruled from their capital in Bharmour . 
 However , in 920 , Raja Sahil Varman ( or Raja Sahila Verma ) , King of Bharmour , shifted his capital from Bharmour to a more centrally located plateau in the lower Ravi valley , and named the city Champavati , after his daughter . There is some variation in the story to how exactly this transition came about in the historical records of Chamba . One version tells how Varman , who , after being childless for a significant period , was blessed with ten sons and a daughter , named " Champavati " . It was Champavati who urged her father to build a new capital town in the valley . However , obstacles stood in the way to relocating his capital , given that the king had previously granted the land in the modern Chamba vicinity to the <unk> Brahmins . A solution was found in the form of offering a gift of eight copper coins called <unk> on the occasion of every marriage that took place in the Brahmin family , if they would agree to surrender their land to pave the way for the new capital . With the land thus obtained , the new capital was built and named as Champa after <unk> , the King ’ s daughter , which , over the years , was simply shortened to " Chamba ' . 
 A variation of this origin of Chamba is that it originated as a hermitage which Champavati , a devout Hindu , used to frequent . The king , being suspicious of his daughter 's fidelity , one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage , but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there . Suddenly he was said to have heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill founded , admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment of his lack of trust in her morals . The King , fully chastened , sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple , named in his daughter ’ s honour and built a city around the temple . Today this temple , called the Champavati Temple , belongs to the Royal family and the King ’ s daughter is venerated as a goddess . Every year , since 935 , the Minjar festival or fair has been held . It lasts for 21 days , coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi . 
 Since Raja Sahil Varman , the dynasty ruled without successful invasion for around a millennium , until the British gained power . The isolation of the town and its rugged hilly terrain is believed to have been a contributing factor to this unusual state of security . Later , Mughal emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb did attempt to annex Chamba but were unsuccessful in subjugating this territory into their kingdoms . Raja Prithvi Singh ( 1641 @-@ 1664 AD ) , who was on amiable terms with Emperor <unk> was instrumental in introducing the court life styles of the Mughals .

 In 1806 A.D. , the combined forces of Gurkhas and local hills chiefs attacked the forces of Raja Sansar Chand in the battle and forced a crushing defeat on him along with family took shelter in the Kangra fort . The Gurkhas sieged the Kangra fort and ruthlessly looted the area between the fort of Kangra and Mahal <unk> and virtually destroyed the villages . The siege of the fort continued for three years . In 1809 A.D. , Raja Ranjit Singh , the Sikh ruler of Lahore , on the request of Sansar Chand , waged war against the Gurkhas and defeated them in But Sansar Chand had to pay a heavy price whereby he had to lose Kangra fort and 66 villages to the Sikhs . Ranjit Singh controlled the region and had even placed a garrison at Chamba , forced the hill states to pay tribute to them . Ranjit Singh deposed the hill princes , including the more powerful Kangra ruler , Sansar Chand <unk> , but spared Chamba , given that the Wazir Nathu of Chamba had been important as an ambassador in negotiations with <unk> in 1809 and had saved his life in 1817 by succumbing his horse to King Singh to escape during a winter campaign in Kashmir . 
 In 1845 , the Sikh army invaded the British territory . The result was disastrous , with the British defeating the army , leaving Chamba in a poor position . Wazir Bagha of Chamba was important in negotiations in its aftermath , and the Rajas of Chamba , on the advice of Bagha , agreed to the British suzerainty as part of Jammu and Kashmir in favour of an annuity of Rs 12 @,@ 000 . The Treaty of Lahore was signed in 1846 , in which the Rajas agreed to ceding the territory of Chamba district . From then on , relations with the British were cordial , and all of the Rajas of Chamba under the British rule , Sri Singh , Gopal Singh , Sham Singh , Bhuri Singh , Ram Singh , and Laxman Singh , were on good terms with the British army officers . 
 Many progressive reforms and developments were made in Chamba under the British . In 1863 , the first Post office was established in Chamba and a daily mail service and a primary school . In December , 1866 , a hospital was opened by Doctor Elmslie of the Kashmir Medical Mission . In the late 1860s two new roads to Dalhousie via <unk> and <unk> were built . Gopal Singh , who ruled from 1870 to 1873 , after abdicating , was responsible for building the grand <unk> Palace as his summer residence . 
 After India becoming an independent nation in August 1947 , the princely state of Chamba finally merged with India on April 15 , 1948 along with the other princedoms of Mandi @-@ <unk> State , <unk> State and all of those in the Shimla hills .

 The town , the district and the valley where the town is located , share the name of Chamba . The town of Chamba is located at the junction of Ravi River and its tributary , the Sal River , with the Shah Madar hill forming the backdrop on its eastern side . The Ravi flows in east @-@ west direction forming deep canyons . During the spring and summer months , the levels of the river rise significantly from snow melt and pose a flooding risk . Record levels were experienced in early July 2005 , when the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation was forced to shut down the power generation on its 300 @-@ MW <unk> Power Station . 
 Located on the right bank of the Ravi river valley , built on successive flat terraces , the town is bounded topographically by the <unk> and <unk> ranges , south of the inner Himalayas . Chamba , despite its hill location , is well connected by road to the rest of the state and country , including Shimla , Delhi and Chandigarh along several routes . The nearest broad gauge railway stations are at <unk> Bank and Pathankot , the latter of which is 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) away by road .

 As of 2001 India census , Chamba had a population of 20 @,@ 312 . Males constituted 52 % of the population and females 48 % . Chamba has an average literacy rate of 81 % , higher than the national average of 59 @.@ 5 % ; with a male literacy of 85 % and female literacy of 77 % . The administrative language is Hindi , the local language of Pahari , and <unk> is common language spoken by inhabitants . There are some speakers of Punjabi , mostly of Sikh and Hindu descent . 
 Away from the urban centre , the tribal people of Chamba are divided into two major groups ; the <unk> and the Gaddis . The <unk> , mainly nomads , came to Chamba across the state border from Kashmir along the trade routes . They belong to nomadic herdsmen of the Islamic community , and travel to lowland Punjab in the autumn with their livestock to avoid the harsh winter of the Chamba hills . Their features are Turkic and have a distinct language and culture aloof from the main town . 
 The Gaddis comprise several ethnic groups ; namely the Brahmans , Rajputs , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> , who form the majority . They are agricultural peoples , and the name " Gaddi " means " shepherd " . They mainly inhabit an area of the Chamba district in the <unk> Dhar mountains , known as <unk> <unk> or " <unk> " , located between Chamba and Kangra . " Gadar " means sheep , so their land is informally referred to as " <unk> " , literally meaning " sheep country " . They are believed to have come to Chamba in the 10th century , although an influx of Gaddi people migrated to Chamba from Lahore in the 18th century , during the Mughal Empire . They are said to practice animism combined with the worship of Lord Shiva .

 There have been a total of 67 rajas who have ruled Chamba district since the Principality of Bharmour was established in the 6th century , beginning with Raja Maru . Indeed , it is believed to have been an isolated case in the history of India that the Chamba kingdom remained independent without interference for over 1000 years . Before Raja Sahila Varman , however , the territorial extent of the state of Chamba was ill @-@ defined and was more a loosely based territory , marked by disunity . Chamba state was run by <unk> , petty rulers who were allocated locally governed areas known as " fiefdoms " and treated them as their own virtually independent kingdoms . It wasn 't until the reign of Sahila Varman that these Raja lords were subjugated and the district of Chamba was consolidated formally as a unified entity . The rajas of the Chamba Kingdom , ruling from the capital in Chamba divided the kingdom into 5 mandalas , later termed <unk> . These sub @-@ territories consisted of Chamba , Bharmour , Bhatti , <unk> and <unk> .

 The city layout can be distinctly demarcated into two zones ; namely the ' Old Town ' before the British introduced their urban architectural styles and the British period of contemporary monuments , bridges and buildings . In a study of the architecture of Chamba , instituted by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage ( INTACH ) , with the objective of conserving and restoring individual heritage buildings , it has been observed that the urban architecture of Chamba evolved under three distinct phases . The first phase from 930 , dating from the Rajput dynasty establishing the capital at Chamba until 1846 , the second phase during the British period ; and the third phase constituting the post independent period after its merger with the Indian Union in April 1948 . 
 = = = Monuments built prior to 1846 = = = 
 Buildings in Chamba were traditionally constructed using local materials . Buildings were made out of dry stone masonry , with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow @-@ dung . Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls , paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes , and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas . The staircases and doors were made from wood , with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night . Before the arrival of the British , who introduced slate roofs to Chamba , roofs were covered with planks , coated in clay . Few of these houses <unk> today , although a number still have wood @-@ clay roofs in villages in the suburbs . 
 The old heritage monuments , which are palaces and temples are located in the old town ( east of the <unk> ) , on the lower slopes of Shah Madar hill . They were built in the lower valley where the two rivers and steep thickly forested hillsides provided a strong defense . Located here is the 10th century Champavati Temple , said to have marked the birth of the town , the Lakshmi Narayan group of temples ( built from 10th @-@ 19th century ) , the 10th century Sita Ram Temple , Bansi Gopal temple , <unk> <unk> and Hari Rai temple , the 11th century Sui Mata Temple and Chamunda Devi Temple , and the Akhand Chandi palace , overlooking the Chaugan , which has since been converted into a college . Additions were made to the palace in the form of the Zenana Mahal and the Rang Mahal in the 18th century . The temples built in Chamba demonstrate a strong Kashmiri influence with their stone temple architecture and temple iconography . Given their age however , only their unicellular layout with fluted pillars has been retained .

 This temple was built by Raja Sahil Varman in memory of his daughter Champavati . The temple , located near the Police Post and the Treasury building , is built in the Shikhara style , with intricate stone carvings . It has a wheel roof and is large as the Laxmi Narayan Temple . An idol of the goddess Mahishasuramardini ( Durga ) is worshipped in the temple . The walls of the temple are full of exquisite stone sculptures . On account of its historical and archaeological importance , the temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India . Champavati Temple , located in the heart of the city of Chamba , is a pilgrim destination for many Hindus . It is named after Champavati , the daughter of King Sahil Varman , the founder of the temple . The temple holds great historical and religious relevance for many Hindus . Champavati Temple enshrines an idol of Goddess <unk> , the avatar of Goddess Durga . According to the legend , the daughter of King Sahil Varman Champavati was a religious person and used to visit temples and sadhu ’ s ashrams regularly . 
 The king , after getting suspicious of her actions , once followed her to a sadhu ’ s place , with a dagger in his cloak . Once he reached the ashram , he found that there was no one inside . To his surprise , both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished . When he was about to return , he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion . The voice also asked him to build a temple , on the name of his daughter Champavati , if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities . 
 The king ordered the construction of the Champavati Temple . Now , the temple is under the Archaeological Survey of India , for its historical and archaeological importance . The major attraction of the temple is its Shikhara style architecture . Stone carved walls , full with sculptures , make the temple an attractive tourist spot . The temple has a large wheel on the rooftop , which adores it and makes it a distinguished temple in North India . The Champavati Temple is often compared with Laxmi Narayan Temple , in its grandeur .

 The Akhand Chandi Palace , noted for its distinct green roof , was built by Raja Umed Singh between 1747 and 1765 and used as his residence . Later , Raja Sham Singh refurbished it with the assistance of British engineers . In 1879 , the Darbar Hall ( also named ' Marshal Hall ' after the builder ) was built . Raja Bhuri Singh added the Zenana Mahal ( residence of Royal ladies ) . The building was exemplary of the fusion of Mughal and British architectural influences . In 1973 , the Royal family of Chamba sold the palace to the Government of Himachal Pradesh , who in turn converted it into a Government College and District Library . Maintenance of the attractive palace , however , which has painted walls and glass work and intricate woodwork , has not been satisfactory , due to the lack of funds allocated to refurbish it . The palace provides scenic views of the Chaugan , Laxmi Narayana Temple , Sui Mata , Chamunda Devi Temple , Rang <unk> , Hari Rai Temple and Bansi Gopal Temple .

 In the second half of the nineteenth century , the British administration drew up an urban plan for the development of Chamba . They laid emphasis on the building of civic buildings around the Chaugan to conceal the unorthodox structural layout of the residential complexes . The western oriented development programme grew particularly active after the arrival of Major Blair Reid in January 1863 , during the reign of Raja Shri Singh . The next fourteen years in particular , until his retirement in March 1877 , were characterised by large scale building projects in Chamba , with Reid fully revising the administrative and revenue departments of Chamba and reorganizing the state machinery to make development more efficient . 
 Orderly new building complexes with " simple visual discipline with white plastered walls , lancer arch windows , cornices , sloping sheet roofs , wooden eaves and deep verandahs were planned and built " . Road communications were dramatically improved , with the approach road to the town being diverted , to provide a way for vehicular traffic to enter from the western end of the <unk> . A cabled suspension bridge was built across the Ravi River in the lower outskirts of the town , and many important public welfare projects were started , and well as many temples , gates , gardens and churches between 1863 and 1910 . Notable works built during the colonial period include the temples in the <unk> Bazar , Gandhi Gate ( Curzon Gate ) , Shiva Temple , the <unk> , the Police Lines , the Church of Scotland , the Shyam Singh Hospital ( built in 1891 ) , Chamba Library , the Post Office building , Bhuri Singh Museum , the State Forces barracks , and the administrative buildings of the British period .

Bhuri Singh donated his family collection of paintings to the museum , including royal portraits which ranged from Basohli to Guler @-@ Kangra in style , and embroidered Pahari miniatures . Numerous artifacts , important to the heritage of Chamba were added , including coins , hill jewelry and royal and <unk> costumes , arms and armour , musical instruments and other items .

 Chamba is noted for its miniature Pahari paintings , where Basohli style of Pahari paintings took roots with <unk> , the artist of Basohli migrating from Guler to Chamba in the eighteenth century . Raja Udai Singh and Raja Jai Singh patronized this school of painting . During the reign of Raja <unk> Singh , folk art developed and had a lasting influence on local artists . The paintings of Chamba encompass both miniatures and murals and the Mughal influence is clearly discerned in these paintings . Distinguished artists of Chamba who have painted in this art form include <unk> , Durga and Miyan Jara Singh . The paintings were generally painted with Hindu religious themes , particularly the legends of Hindu mythology such as Radha Krishna , Shiva @-@ Parvati , Rama Darbar , Yashoda and Krishna , <unk> , love scenes , deer , birds and women , Daya Saptashati and Krishna - Sudama .

 Chamba is an important centre for the making of traditional handicrafts , and the town has numerous small workshops maintained by the artisans . Many of the items produced are exquisite and lavish , testament to the towns ' aristocratic heritage . 
 Casting metalware in Chamba is an ancient tradition , dating back to the Bronze Age period , with items typically made out of copper or brass , and also iron , especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths . Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs , commonly used for wall decoration . The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba and often the golden <unk> or vessel crowning them is produced here . 
 Chamba has its own unique traditional system of men ’ s and women ’ s foot wares . The foot wares were originally made from locally produced leather but is today transported to Chamba from the south of India . Women 's foot wares are embroidered as are the " vegetarian " foot wares which are purposefully made without leather for use in places where leather is prohibited for religious reasons . <unk> and shawls are also made in abundance in Chamba . Traditionally handspun , they are designed in such a way as to make both sides of the cloth look identical , and are beautifully embroidered . Chamba shawls are woven on hand looms in wool and typically have a bright border in a traditional design . A similar woven design is used for making caps .

 Chamba is one of those places where Basohli effect actually reached . Two melas or fairs , also known as <unk> , are of particular note in Chamba ; " Suhi Mata Mela " and " Minjar Mela " . A notable event of such fairs is when the ‘ <unk> ’ . a subordinate of the deity who is being worshipped goes into a trance and answers the queries and prayers of the devotees . 
 An important festival held in Chamba is known as the " Suhi Mata Mela " . It is held annually in March – April for four days to commemorate the sacrifice made by the queen of Chamba with her life , to bring water to the town . The legend associated with this festival and the Sui Mata temple , built in memory of the queen ( wife of Raja Sahil Varman ) , relates to the sacrifice she made to fulfill a prophecy in a dream , which said that water from the <unk> stream could only be accessed through an aqueduct if the queen or her son was sacrificed . Rather than kill her own son she sacrificed her own life for the town . To commemorate this event , women and children take a lead role in the festival . An image of Champavati , with banners of the Rajput solar emblem , are taken by them in a procession , dancing and singing , through the Chaugan to the Suhi Mata temple . 
 Another popular festival held in Chamba is the " Minjar Mela " , held on the second Sunday of the <unk> month , corresponding to the month of August in the Gregorian calendar . It marks the triumph of the Raja of Chamba over the ruler of <unk> ( now called as Kangra ) , in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown at this time of the year . The festival commences with offerings of ' <unk> ' , consisting of a bunch of paddy plant and golden silk wrapped in red fabric . The offerings also include a rupee , a seasonal fruit , and a coconut . This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes . The image of the deity , Lord <unk> , and more than 200 other deities , are taken in a procession , in a chariot pulled by ropes . Folk dances and music performances known as ' <unk> Malhar ' are part of the festivities . On the last day of the festival , a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River , where offerings are made to the river . This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil <unk> changed the course of the river , to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees .

The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose @-@ fitting white woolen garments known as a chola , tied around the waist with a black wool rope . A local custom in Chamba was to give the <unk> of the <unk> sect a cotton <unk> sheet to wear over the head during the <unk> ceremony to honour Lord Siva . Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries . 
 " The <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and the Vinaya of the <unk> mention the beautifully embroidered <unk> clothes of the <unk> country ( Pathankot and Chamba ) and the fine textiles captured in the lot of Kangra Fort in 1009 around the astonishment of the soldiers of Mahmud of Ghazni . A heavier , though not less luxurious type of <unk> dresses can be traced on the fountain stones , which had been erected by the local aristocracy of <unk> , in western Chamba in the 11th to 12th centuries . " - Hermann Goetz

 = Shrek = 
 Shrek is a 2001 American computer @-@ animated fantasy @-@ comedy film directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson at their directorial debut . It features the voices of Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , Cameron Diaz , and John Lithgow . It is loosely based on William Steig 's 1990 fairy tale picture book Shrek ! , and somewhat serves as a parody film , targeting other films adapted from numerous children 's fantasies ( mainly animated Disney films ) . The film 's soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth , Eels , Joan Jett , The Proclaimers , Jason Wade , Baha Men , and John Cale ( covering Leonard Cohen ) . 
 The rights to the books were originally bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991 , before the founding of DreamWorks , when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book . However , John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to DreamWorks in 1994 , the time the studio was founded , and the film was put quickly into active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995 . Shrek originally cast Chris Farley to do the voice for the title character , recording about 80 % – 90 % of his dialogue . After Farley died in 1997 before he could finish , Mike Myers was brought in to work for the character , who after his first recording decided to record his voice in a Scottish accent . The film was also originally planned to be motion @-@ captured , but after poor results , the studio decided to get PDI to help Shrek get its final computer @-@ animated look . 
 The film grossed $ 484 @.@ 4 million at the worldwide box office , and an estimated 47 million tickets were sold in the US . Shrek also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin @-@ Robbins ( promoting the film 's DVD release ) and Burger King . It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest , with many adult @-@ oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children . Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay . The film was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards , including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice @-@ over performance as Donkey , and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay . The film 's main ( and title ) character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010 . 
 Shrek established DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in feature film animation , particularly in computer animation . The film 's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels — Shrek 2 ( 2004 ) , Shrek the Third ( 2007 ) , and Shrek Forever After ( 2010 ) , two holiday specials — Shrek the Halls ( 2007 ) and Scared <unk> ( 2010 ) , and a spin @-@ off film — Puss in Boots ( 2011 ) . A fifth film , planned as the last of the series , was cancelled in 2009 with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series . The film 's success also inspired other merchandise , such as video games , a stage musical , and even a comic book by Dark Horse Comics .

 At the time DreamWorks was founded , producer John H. Williams got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks , it caught Jeffrey Katzenberg 's attention and the studio decided to make it into a film . Recounting the inspiration of making the film , Williams said : 
 " Every development deal starts with a pitch and my pitch came from my then kindergartner , in collaboration with his pre @-@ school brother . Upon our second reading of Shrek , the kindergartner started quoting large segments of the book pretending he could read them . Even as an adult , I thought Shrek was outrageous , irreverent , iconoclastic , gross , and just a lot of fun . He was a great movie character in search of a movie . " 
 After buying the rights to the film , Katzenberg quickly put it in active development in November 1995 . Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before , when he bought the rights to the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks , where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey . In the beginning of production , co @-@ director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults . Katzenberg wanted both audiences , but he found some of Adamson 's ideas about adding sexual jokes and Guns N ' Roses music to the soundtrack a bit too outrageous . Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co @-@ direct the film . However , Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson . Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half , so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film 's sequences ; " We both ended up doing a lot of everything , " Adamson said . " We 're both kinda control freaks , and we both wanted to do everything . " 
 Some early sketches of Shrek 's house were done between 1996 and 1997 using Photoshop , with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek . It was also thought one time that he lived with his parents and kept rotting fish in his bedroom . Donkey was modeled after Pericles ( born 1994 ; also known as Perry ) , a real miniature donkey from Barron Park in Palo Alto , California . Raman Hui , supervising animator of Shrek , stated that Fiona " wasn 't based on any real person . " and he did many different sketches for her . He had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors chose the final design . In early development , the art directors visited Hearst Castle , Stratford upon Avon , and Dordogne for inspiration . Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston , South Carolina for inspiration of Shrek 's swamp . Planned characters not used in the film include Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Nicolas Cage was initially offered the role of Shrek but he turned it down because he did not want to look like an ogre . In 2013 , Cage explained furthermore : " When you 're drawn , in a way it says more about how children are going to see you than anything else , and I so care about that . " 
 Chris Farley was planned to do the voice for Shrek which he recorded 80 to 90 % ( or 95 % according to Farley 's brother Tom ) of the dialogue for the character , but died before completing the project . A story reel featuring a sample of Farley 's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015 . DreamWorks then re @-@ cast the voice role to Mike Myers , who insisted on a complete script rewrite , to leave no traces of Farley 's version of Shrek . According to Myers , he wanted to voice the character " for two reasons : I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg ; and [ the book is ] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are . " 
 After Myers had completed providing the voice for the character , when the film was well into production , he asked to re @-@ record all of his lines with a Scottish accent , similar to that his mother used when she told him bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films , such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me . According to the DVD commentary , he had also tried using country and Canadian accents . After hearing the alternative , Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film , saying , " It was so good we took $ 4m worth of animation out and did it again . " A point Myers disputes , saying " it didn ’ t cost the studio “ millions of dollars , ” as rumored . “ What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions , I went in for twenty sessions . I got paid the same . " . Because of Myers voicing the character , more ideas began to come . There were clearer story points , fresher gags and comedy bits . " I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character " Myers said . " and he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie . " 
 Another person planned to voice a character in the film was Janeane Garofalo , who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona . However , she was fired from the project with little explanation . Years later , Garofalo stated " I was never told why [ I was fired ] . I assume because I sound like a man sometimes ? I don 't know why . Nobody told me ... But , you know , the movie didn 't do anything , so who cares ? "

 Shrek was originally set up to be a live @-@ action / CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion @-@ captured computer graphics , using an <unk> <unk> Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters . A sizable crew was hired to run a test , and after a year and a half of R & D , the test was finally screened in May 1997 . The results were not satisfactory , with Katzenberg stating " It looked terrible , it didn 't work , it wasn 't funny , and we didn 't like it . " The studio then turned to its production partners at PDI , who began production with the studio in 1998 and helped Shrek get to its final , computer @-@ animated look . At this time , Antz was still in production by the studio and Effects Supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by Aron Warner " to start development for Shrek . " Similar to previous PDI films , PDI used its own proprietary software ( like its own Fluid Animation System ) for its animated movies . For some elements , however , it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software in the market . This is particularly true with Maya , which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad . 
 " We did a lot of work on character and set @-@ up , and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation , " Hui noted . " In Antz , we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin . In Shrek , we applied that to whole body . So , if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks , you see that when he opens his jaw , he forms a double chin , because we have the fat and the muscles underneath . That kind of detail took us a long time to get right . " One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey 's fur flow smoothly so that it didn 't look like that of a Chia Pet . This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes ( ability to change directions , lie flat , swirl , etc . ) . It was then the job of the visual effects group , led by Ken Bielenberg , to make the fur react to environment conditions . Once the technology was mastered , it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass , moss , beards , eyebrows , and even threads on Shrek 's tunic . Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey 's fur , requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams . 
 Shrek has 31 sequences , with 1 @,@ 288 shots in every sequence total . Aron Warner said that the creators " envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into . " Shrek includes 36 separate in @-@ film locations to make the world of the film , which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer @-@ animated feature before . In @-@ film locations were finalized and as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies , color and mood was of the utmost importance .

 Shrek is the third DreamWorks animated film ( and the only film in the Shrek series ) to have Harry Gregson @-@ Williams team up with John Powell to compose the score ( after Antz ( 1998 ) and Chicken Run ( 2000 ) ) . John Powell was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Williams due to a conflict . The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios by Nick <unk> and <unk> Andrews , with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan @-@ <unk> handling mastering . 
 Shrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel . The film used pop music and other Oldies to make the story more forward . Covers of songs like " On the Road Again " and " Try a Little Tenderness " were integrated in the film 's score . As the film was about to be completed , Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film 's ending to " go out with a big laugh " ; Instead of ending film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset , they decided to add a song " I 'm a Believer " covered by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film . 
 Although Rufus Wainwright 's version of the song " Hallelujah " appeared in the soundtrack album , it was John Cale 's version that appeared in the film ; in a radio interview , Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of " Hallelujah " did not appear in the film due to the " glass ceiling " he was hitting because of his sexuality . An alternate explanation posits that because Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks and John Cale was not , thus licensing issues prohibited Cale 's version from appearing in the soundtrack album , despite having the filmmakers wanting to have Cale 's version appear in the film . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 In many places the film references classic movies , predominantly those by Disney . When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey and he says " I can fly " and people around including the Three Little Pigs say " He can fly , he can fly " ; this is a reference to Disney 's Peter Pan . This scene is also a reference to the Disney film Dumbo , where Donkey says , while flying , " You might have seen a house fly , maybe even a super fly , but I bet you ain 't never seen a Donkey fly " The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . The transformation scene at the end of the film strongly references to Disney 's Beauty and the Beast . 
 When Shrek crosses the bridge to the Castle and says , " That 'll do , Donkey , that 'll do , " this is a reference to the movie Babe . The scene where Princess Fiona is fighting the Merry Men is a lengthy reference to the film The Matrix . At the end of the film , the Gingerbread Man at the end with a crutch ( and one leg ) says " God bless us , everyone " which is a reference to Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol . 
 In the scene where the Magic Mirror gives Lord Farquaad the option to marry three princesses , it parodies popular American television show The Dating Game featuring : Cinderella and Snow White . In addition , Lord Farquaad 's theme park style kingdom Duloc heavily mimics Disneyland , even in so far as parodying the famous ' It 's A Small World <unk> ' musical ride in the scene with the singing puppets .

 In 2000 , IMAX released CyberWorld onto its branded large @-@ screen theaters . It was a compilation film that featured stereoscopic conversions of various animated shorts and sequences , including the bar sequence in Antz . DreamWorks was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence 's " stereoscopic translation " , that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big @-@ screen 3D version of Shrek . The film would have been re @-@ released during the Christmas season of 2001 , or the following summer , after its conventional 2D release . The re @-@ release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending . Plans for this was dropped due to " creative changes " instituted by DreamWorks and resulted in a loss of $ 1 @.@ 18 million , down from IMAX 's profit of $ 3 @.@ 24 million . 
 Radio Disney was told not to allow any ads for the film to air on the station , stating , " Due to recent initiatives with The Walt Disney Company , we are being asked not to align ourselves promotionally with this new release Shrek . Stations may accept spot dollars only in individual markets . " The restriction was later relaxed to allow ads for the film 's soundtrack album onto the network . 
 On May 7 , 2001 , Burger King began promotions for the film , giving out a selection of nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the Shrek characters , in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders .

 The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 2 , 2001 . Both releases included Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party , a 3 @-@ minute musical short film , that takes up right after Shrek 's ending , with film 's characters performing a medley of modern pop songs . 
 Shrek was released to video the same day that Pixar 's Monsters , Inc. hit theaters . Since videos were traditionally released on Tuesdays , Disney 's executives did not receive this well , saying that the move " seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film 's steam " . DreamWorks responded that it " simply shifted the release to a Friday to make it more of an event and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films . " Monsters , Inc. earned that weekend more than $ 62 million , breaking the record for an animated film , while Shrek 's video release made more than $ 100 million , and eventually became the biggest selling DVD of all time with over 5 @.@ 5 million sales . 
 A 3D version of the film was released on Blu @-@ ray 3D on December 1 , 2010 , along with its sequels . The films were sold separately in 2012 .

 John Anderson of Newsday wrote " The kind of movie that will entertain everyone of every age and probably for ages to come .

 = Mattias Öhlund = 
 Kenneth Mattias Öhlund ( born September 9 , 1976 ) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman who last played for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Prior to joining the Lightning , he played eleven seasons with the Vancouver Canucks . Öhlund played two seasons in the Swedish Allsvenskan , the second highest tier of hockey in Sweden , with Piteå HC before being selected by the Canucks thirteenth overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft ; he then joined Luleå HF of the Elitserien , the highest league in Sweden , winning the Le Mat Trophy as league champions in 1996 . He began his NHL career with Vancouver in 1997 – 98 , the start of an eleven @-@ year tenure with the club . A serious eye injury before his third NHL season was the first of many injuries Öhlund has sustained over his career , and he has only played a full season twice in eleven years . A four @-@ time winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy as the team 's best defenceman , Öhlund is the Canucks ' all @-@ time leading goal and point @-@ scorer among defencemen . 
 Internationally , Öhlund has represented Sweden in numerous tournaments , beginning with three World Junior Championships that included Best Defenceman honours as part of a silver medal effort in 1996 . He has since competed in three World Championships , earning gold in 1998 , and three Winter Olympics , earning gold in 2006 .

 Öhlund began his playing career with Piteå HC in his hometown , playing two seasons with the team . As a large , mobile defenceman , he was heavily scouted by scouts from several NHL teams during his final season with Piteå . He was the Vancouver Canucks ' first pick , thirteenth overall , in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft . Rather than join the Canucks , Öhlund stayed in Sweden as a result of a dispute over his contract with the team . He joined a new team , Luleå HF of the top Swedish league , the Elitserien . In his first season in the premier league in Sweden , Öhlund scored 16 points in 34 games . The following season Öhlund had 14 points in 38 games as Luleå won the Le Mat Trophy as champions of the Elitserien , their first league championship . Appearing in 47 games with Luleå during the 1996 – 97 season , Öhlund scored seven goals and had an additional nine assists . 
 = = = Vancouver Canucks = = = 
 Four years after being drafted by the Canucks , Öhlund was set to be eligible to re @-@ enter the NHL Entry Draft when he signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 1 , 1997 . Worth US $ 10 million over five years , including a signing bonus of $ 7 @.@ 5 million , it was considerably more than the maximum rookie contract of $ 850 @,@ 000 per year the Canucks , as the team that drafted Öhlund , were allowed to offer . Under league rules , the Canucks were given one week to either match the contract or trade Öhlund 's NHL rights to the Maple Leafs . Rather than lose him , the Canucks agreed to the contract on August 7 . 
 As part of a promotion for the 1998 Winter Olympics , the first to allow NHL participation in the ice hockey tournament , the Canucks opened the 1997 – 98 NHL season with a pair of games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo . Öhlund thus played his first NHL game in Japan on October 3 , 1997 . He scored his first goal against Felix Potvin of the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 9 , as well as earning his first assist in that game . Playing 77 games as a rookie , he tied Jyrki Lumme for the team lead in scoring among defencemen with seven goals and 30 points . In recognition of his play during the season , he was awarded the Babe Pratt Trophy , given to the Canucks ' best defenceman . In addition , Öhlund was nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the best rookie in the league , finishing second in voting to Sergei Samsonov of the Boston Bruins with 11 first @-@ place ballots to Samsonov 's 43 . His 30 points , the fifth best total among first year players and highest by a rookie defenceman , helped him earn a position on the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team . 
 In his second season in the NHL , Öhlund was selected to the annual NHL All @-@ Star Game as a replacement for an injured player . Playing for the World team , composed of NHLers from outside North America , Öhlund scored one goal and had an assist as the North American team won , 8 – 6 . With nine goals and 35 points in 74 games , Öhlund led the Canucks ' defencemen in scoring and placed fifth overall on the team . 
 Prior to the start of the 1999 – 2000 NHL season , in a pre @-@ season game against the Ottawa Senators on September 21 , 1999 , a puck deflected off Öhlund 's stick and struck him in the right eye . The injury forced Öhlund to miss the first 38 games of the season . He underwent surgery to correct his vision and returned to the Canucks the same season and scored 20 points in 42 games , again winning the Babe Pratt Trophy as the Canucks ' best defenceman . The following year , he missed an additional 17 games after undergoing surgery once more to relieve building internal pressure on his eye . Playing in his first game back in the lineup on November 28 , 2000 , Öhlund scored the game @-@ winning goal for the Canucks in a 4 – 1 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . Öhlund played the final 65 games of the season , scoring eight goals and 28 points . He also made his NHL playoff debut , recording four points in four games . 
 The 2001 – 02 season saw Öhlund play 81 games and record a career @-@ high 36 points , with an additional two points in six playoff games . A knee injury during the 2002 – 03 season led Öhlund to miss several games ; while he only scored 2 goals in the 59 games he played in , Öhlund set a career @-@ high in assists with 27 . That was followed by appearing in a career @-@ high 13 playoff games , where he had three goals and four assists for seven points . In 2003 – 04 , Öhlund tallied a career @-@ high 14 goals and played in all 82 games with Vancouver for the first time in his career . For his efforts , Öhlund was named the winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy .. 
 The 2004 – 05 season was cancelled due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout . Like many other NHL players , Öhlund played in Europe , joining his former team , Luleå HF , on December 21 . However eight days later , after playing two games with the team and scoring one goal , Öhlund left the team . As well as briefly playing in Sweden , Öhlund took part in a charity hockey match set up by Canucks teammate Brad May and held in Vancouver on December 12 , 2004 . Including several NHL players , the game raised nearly $ 1 million for charity . The NHL resumed play for the 2005 – 06 season ; Öhlund recorded 33 points in 78 games , including leading Canucks defencemen with 13 goals , winning the Babe Pratt Trophy for the fourth time in his career . 
 Early in the 2007 – 08 season , Öhlund received a four @-@ game suspension , the first of his career , for an incident near the end of a November 16 , 2007 , game against the Minnesota Wild . In the third period , Wild forward Mikko Koivu hit Öhlund in the head with his elbow , and Öhlund retaliated by slashing Koivu in the leg with his stick , breaking Koivu 's fibula . After returning from the suspension , Öhlund became the Canucks ' all @-@ time leader in goals among defencemen , scoring the game @-@ tying goal against the Edmonton Oilers on December 15 , 2007 , to pass former teammate Jyrki Lumme with 84 goals . After bone chips were detected in his knee in early March 2008 , Öhlund underwent knee surgery on March 13 and missed the remainder of the season . The leading scorer amongst Canuck defenceman at the time of the surgery , Öhlund finished second amongst defenceman with 24 points in 53 games . 
 With the departure of Markus Näslund in the 2008 off @-@ season , Öhlund became the longest serving player on the Canucks ' roster . Before the beginning of the 2008 – 09 season , Öhlund was named , along with Ryan Kesler and Willie Mitchell as alternate captains to goaltender Roberto Luongo , who replaced Näslund as captain . Due to the limitations of having a goalie as captain , Öhlund was designated the captain 's traditional duty of taking ceremonial faceoffs . Beginning the season 22 points behind Jyrki Lumme and Dennis Kearns for the franchise 's all @-@ time point @-@ scoring record for a defenceman , Öhlund surpassed the mark on March 15 , 2009 , with an assist in a 4 – 2 win against the Colorado Avalanche for his 322nd point as a Canuck . He played all 82 games for the second time in his career , and finished tied for third on the team for points by a defenceman with 25 . 
 Over 11 seasons with the Canucks , Ohlund registered team records of 93 goals and 325 points as a defenceman . His 232 assists ranked fourth among all @-@ time Canucks defencemen , while his 770 games played was second among defencemen and fifth overall . In his latter years with the Canucks , Ohlund served as a mentor while being paired with fellow defenceman and Swedish native Alexander Edler , who was beginning his NHL career .

 Captain Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) returns to his team in spectacular fashion , walking into the middle of a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish , shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head . At the Hub , his team question why he left them , and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood . The team is then alerted to a death near a multi @-@ storey car park , where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse . Jack , to even his surprise , gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises , and leaves the team to talk to him . 
 The person is Captain John Hart ( James Marsters ) , a fellow Time Agent and former lover of Jack . He is responsible for the death , and a public disturbance at a nightclub . After a passionate kiss and brief fight at the nightclub , John tells Jack that the Time Agency was disbanded and he has since undergone several rehabilitation programmes , before the team catch up with Jack and are introduced to John . John accompanies the team back to the Hub , where he tells the team of three cylindrical devices scattered throughout Cardiff , which he explains are radioactive cluster bombs , and he requires help to defuse them . Thus , they split into three pairs : Jack and administrator Ianto Jones ( Gareth David @-@ Lloyd ) search an office block ( during which Jack successfully asks Ianto out on a date ) , doctor Owen Harper ( Burn Gorman ) and technical expert Toshiko Sato ( Naoko Mori ) search a warehouse , and police liaison Gwen Cooper ( Eve Myles ) and John search the nearby docks . 
 It is clear that John has an ulterior motive ; first , he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling her that if she is not found in two hours , her main organs will stop working and she would die . He then finds Owen and Tosh , shooting the former in the hip . After letting Ianto go , he finally confronts Jack , who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick . Jack throws the device over the building , and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation . 
 John returns to Torchwood , where he takes a pyramid @-@ shaped object from the Blowfish in the morgue . Gwen ( who was saved by the rest of the team ) and the others arrive , including Jack , who survived due to his immortality . They hold John at gunpoint , where he admits that the " bombs " will simply triangulate the location of a diamond he stole off a former lover . However , by using the devices and the pyramid , he discovers there is no diamond ; John 's former lover anticipated dying , and thus set a trap to kill her murderer . The device turns out to be a bomb which attaches itself to John and begins a ten @-@ minute countdown . 
 Unwilling to be murdered , John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key . Gwen formulates a plan to use the Rift at the car park to contain the explosion , but at the penalty of her own life . Jack and Owen catch John and the rest of the team at the car park where John arrived and inject him with the team 's DNA , thus confusing the device into detaching from John . Jack throws the bomb into the rift where it detonates . John then agrees to free Gwen and leave , but before leaving , tells Jack that he " found Gray " , visibly disturbing Jack , who just asks his team to get back to work .

 Originally , Captain John was going to come through the Rift on a " <unk> surfboard " similar to the one found in the Doctor Who episode " Boom Town " , Chibnall changed it because the production team decided that " it would look cooler if John just calmly walked out of the Rift , as if it was the sort of thing he might do every day " . 
 The episode was filmed in Cardiff in July 2007 . The first meeting between Jack and John at the nightclub was written to be akin to a Spaghetti Western . Instead of fighting , it was decided that they would kiss first , so that the audience " don 't see it coming " . The following fight scene was intended to be " sexy , rather than brutal " , similar to the naked wrestling scene in the film Women in Love . While the scene only lasted one minute on screen , much more was filmed , so much that it took a whole day to shoot . 80 % of the acting in the scene was done by Marsters and Barrowman themselves , instead of stuntmen . The style of fighting was similar to what Marsters was used to , and was , according to stunt co @-@ ordinator Tom Lucy , a cross between Western , martial arts , and Bourne . 
 The building used to film searching for one of the canisters was a British Gas building in Cardiff . The scene with Jack falling off the building was performed by Curtis Rivers , John Barrowman 's stunt double . Though Rivers made the stunt to make Jack " look good " , Barrowman had to lie on a box over green screen . Marsters and Barrowman were used for filming close to the roof 's edge . 
 = = = Visual effects and animatronics = = = 
 While the most noticeable visual effect was John 's entrance through the Rift , The Mill also made inconspicuous visual effects , such as extending the number of crates at the docks . The visual effect used for the Rift was redesigned for the second series , due to a decision among the visual effects team at The Mill that separate manifestations of the Rift appear different — in this case , orange and gold was used to make the Rift appear " warmer and more magical " . The Mill also made three different types of holograms . The projection from Jack 's wriststrap device was coloured blue to match earlier appearances , John 's wriststrap projected a flashier , full colour image due to specifications in the script , and the golden hue in the projection of John 's ex @-@ lover was based on the prop . 
 The blowfish in the opening scene was intended by executive producer Russell T Davies to be " like Finding Nemo , but evil " and the producer of the episode , Richard Stokes , wanted the designs to be as flamboyant as " the lionfish in The Spy Who Loved Me " . The first designs of the costume were visibly different from the final design ; the first designs were more fish @-@ like than humanoid . After a humanoid design was approved by the production team , Millennium FX , who previously created the prosthetics for Doctor Who and the first series of Torchwood , immediately sculpted the costume to Paul Kasey 's dimensions . Two versions of the mask were created ; one was animatronic , which included mechanical fins , and one was used for the stunt where the blowfish was shot in the head .

The Times commented that the episode was " good , salacious , knockabout fun " , the best thing about Torchwood that " everyday Cardiff hums alongside psychotic blowfish and time loops " , and asked " when extraterrestrial push comes to intergalactic shove , how could anyone object to a series that begins with a blowfish driving a sports car ? " . The Guardian stated that parts were " very , very , funny " and the episode was largely " a hoot " .

 = Robert Winchelsey = 
 Robert Winchelsey ( or Winchelsea ; c . 1245 – 1313 ) was an English Christian theologian and Archbishop of Canterbury . He studied at the universities of Paris and Oxford , and later taught at both . Influenced by Thomas Aquinas , he was a scholastic theologian . Winchelsey held various benefices in England , and was the Chancellor of Oxford University before being elected to Canterbury in early 1293 . Although he initially had the support of Edward I , Winchelsey later became a forceful opponent of the king . The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward 's attempts to tax the clergy . Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king 's treasurer Walter Langton as well as other clergy . On one occasion he rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack . 
 Following the election of a former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305 , the king was able to secure the archbishop 's exile that same year . Upon the succession of Edward 's son , Edward II , Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return . Winchelsey soon joined the king 's enemies , however , and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king 's favourite , Piers Gaveston . Winchelsey died in 1313 . Although miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb , an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Winchelsey studied and taught at the universities of Paris and Oxford , and became the Rector of Paris , and Chancellor of Oxford . While in Paris , he read , and possibly met , Thomas Aquinas , and his own theology was thereafter purely scholastic . In 1283 , he was appointed canon of St. Paul 's in London , but it is unclear exactly when he returned to England . He held the prebend of <unk> in the diocese of London , and was made Archdeacon of Essex , also in the London diocese , in about 1288 . 
 = = Archbishop = = 
 = = = Election = = = 
 John Peckham , Archbishop of Canterbury , died in December 1292 , and on 13 February 1293 Winchelsey was elected as his successor . Unusually , neither the pope nor the king had a hand in his election . On 1 April Winchelsey left England for Rome to get papal confirmation . He was not consecrated immediately because of a papal vacancy ; Celestine V eventually performed the ceremony at Aquila on 12 September 1294 . 
 = = = Disputes with Edward I = = = 
 Winchelsey was a fearless opponent of Edward I. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward , he offended the king by adding a declaration that he was only swearing fealty for the temporalities , not the spiritualities . All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels , and withstood severe pressure to change his mind . In August 1295 , he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues , less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy . Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France , which was what the money was requested to fund , continued into the following year , then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions . 
 Following the issue of the papal bull <unk> <unk> in 1296 , forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power , Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse payments to Edward . However , the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues . Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws , and ordered their property to be seized . He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues , exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation . The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines , and in March , the southern clergy met again , and after a long debate , Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or not to pay the fine . It appears that most chose to pay , but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution , and so Edward seized his lands . They were returned to him in July 1297 , when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster . Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls , who also objected to Edward 's tax demands . 
 Winchelsey further irritated Edward with his opposition to the Bishop of Lichfield , Walter Langton , who was the king 's treasurer . The king was not the only one to be upset by the archbishop ; the abbot of <unk> , in 1297 , was so affected by a rebuke from him that he suffered a fatal heart attack . In 1299 , Winchelsey and the king briefly reconciled , and the archbishop presided at the king 's second marriage , to Margaret of France , at Canterbury . Winchelsey vigorously asserted his authority over his suffragan , or <unk> bishops , quarrelled with Pope Boniface VIII over a Sussex living , and was excommunicated by one of the pope 's clerks in 1301 . He was absolved in 1302 . 
 = = = Exile and return = = = 
 Winchelsey and the barons joined in demanding reforms from the king at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301 , but Winchelsey 's support of Boniface VIII 's claim to be the protector of Scotland , broke the alliance . One of the reasons which led the archbishop to ally with the barons was his hostility to Edward 's adviser , Walter Langton , Bishop of Lichfield . The king took no action against Winchelsey until the Gascon and former royal clerk Bertrand de Got was named Pope Clement V in 1305 . Edward then sent two envoys – Langton and Henry Lacy – to the pope , to press his claim that Winchelsey was plotting against him . Clement suspended the archbishop on 12 February 1306 . Winchelsey left England and went to the papal court at Bordeaux , where he stayed until Edward 's death in July 1307 . Only Antony Bek , Bishop of Durham supported the archbishop . 
 After the death of Edward I , the new king , Edward II , asked that Winchelsey be restored , which the pope agreed to on 22 January 1308 . Soon after his return to England in early 1308 the archbishop joined the king 's enemies . The archbishop , along with the Earl of Warwick , were the only people to object to the return of the new king 's favourite Piers Gaveston to England in 1309 . Winchelsey aided the barons in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their enemies to excommunication . He was appointed an <unk> in 1310 , and died at Otford on 11 May 1313 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Winchelsey was a preacher of some note , and when preaching at St. Paul 's he attracted large crowds to his sermons and lectures . Winchelsey 's theological writings date primarily from his time at St. Paul 's , where he delivered a number of <unk> . The <unk> <unk> from those sessions survive , and illustrate his highly orthodox trinitarian views and his scholastic method . Miracles were said to have been worked at his tomb in Canterbury cathedral , but efforts to have him declared a saint were unsuccessful . 
 = Sideling Hill Tunnel = 
 Sideling Hill Tunnel is one of three original Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels abandoned ( this one in 1968 ) after two massive realignment projects . The others are nearby Rays Hill Tunnel , and farther west , the Laurel Hill Tunnel . It was less expensive to realign the Turnpike than to bore a second tube for four lane traffic . Sideling Hill Tunnel is 6 @,@ 782 feet ( 2 @,@ 067 m ) long . It was the longest of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike . The Ray 's Hill Tunnel and Sideling Hill Tunnel are now part of the <unk> Trail . Together , the two tunnels as well as the roadway are commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike . 
 From the Turnpike 's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects , the tunnels were bottlenecks ; opposing traffic in the same tubes reduced speeds . Four other tunnels on the Turnpike – Allegheny Mountain , Tuscarora Mountain , Kittatinny Mountain , and Blue Mountain – each had a second tube bored , the least expensive option . All of the original tunnels except for the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel were part of " Vanderbilt 's Folly " , the never @-@ completed South Pennsylvania Railroad . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The Sideling Hill Tunnel 's original plans date back to the year 1881 , when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began . Construction began that year , with the plans for nine brand @-@ new tunnels , most of which were drilled by 1885 . The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O 'Brien , an engineer from Rhinebeck , New York . On July 6 , 1885 , a blast occurred at the end of the Sideling Hill Tunnel . The blast , which was caused by dynamite , claimed the lives of three people , including O 'Brien . Several other people were injured in the blast . Just sixteen days later , another blast occurred in the tunnel , taking the lives of a Hungarian worker , along with two African @-@ Americans , two Italians , and one Irishman . The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast , that the people were almost unidentifiable . Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt , who had started the plans for the railroad , noticed that expenses began to inflate , and he began to look for a second way to work things out . The construction was abandoned and never finished . In 1938 , the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway . 
 The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission started construction on a new toll highway from Carlisle , Pennsylvania to Irwin , Pennsylvania in 1938 . When the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened on October 25 , 1940 , the Sideling Hill Tunnel was one of the seven original tunnels along the highway , six of which were built from the old railroad tunnels from the 1880s . The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was constructed from scratch rather than from the tunnels because of structural concerns . 
 Beginning in 1951 , the eastbound traffic at the Laurel Hill Tunnel would back up during the summer weekends . By 1958 , the Laurel Hill experienced congestion anytime from June to November . Because of the long bottlenecks , the Commission started looking into ways to remove the congestion . There were studies that began in the mid @-@ 1950s to decide on what to do with the tunnels . The studies looked into the major tunnels , the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain , and the possibility of adding a second tube , or " twinning " , to them . 
 = = = Tunnel bypass actions = = = 
 Studies were completed for the remaining five mainline tunnels to determine the cost benefit of twinning of the tunnels , or complete bypass . After the studies completed , the decision was made to go ahead with a US $ 100 million construction project to work with the tunnels . Construction began on September 6 , 1962 , with the first subproject being a bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel . On October 30 , 1964 , just two years after construction began , the Laurel Hill Bypass was completed and opened . The Laurel Hill Tunnel was permanently closed on that day . However , this was not the last bypass to occur for tunnels along the turnpike . Two years after the closing of the Laurel Hill , the Allegheny Mountain became the first tunnel to be twinned , and opened on August 25 , 1966 . With the twinning of the Blue Mountain , Kittatinny Mountain and Tuscarora Mountain tunnels under construction , the Commission turned its focus to the remaining two mainline tunnels , the Rays Hill Tunnel ( the shortest tunnel ) and the Sideling Hill Tunnel ( the longest tunnel ) . 
 An engineering report dating back to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels was the best way to solve the congestion . The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967 . The contracts cost $ 17 @.@ 2 million for roadway and another $ 2 @.@ 5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza , to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza , which was along the to @-@ be @-@ bypassed alignment . The $ 2 @.@ 5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza , so it could serve both directions . The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass . On November 26 , 1968 , the three twinned tunnels opened , and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened . The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four ( two in each direction ) or five ( two in each direction , plus a climbing lane going uphill ) . 
 In 2001 , the Turnpike Commission gave control of the 13 @.@ 5 miles ( 21 @.@ 7 km ) length of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels and other roadways to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy , who began work to convert the stretch into a bicycle trail . The trail is used by hundreds of bicycle riders , and studies occurred in 2004 and 2005 to figure how to best safely construct the trail . Because there is a lack of good lighting in the tunnels the conservancy wants to look into how to solve it . The system is called the <unk> Trail and is planned to be an 18 miles ( 29 km ) mountain bicycle loop that serves access to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation 's <unk> Route S. 
 = Ben Nevis = 
 Ben Nevis ( Scottish Gaelic : Beinn Nibheis , pronounced [ <unk> ] ) is the highest mountain in the British Isles , located in Scotland . Standing at 1 @,@ 346 metres ( 4 @,@ 414 ft ) above sea level , it is located at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands , close to the town of Fort William . 
 The mountain is a popular destination , attracting an estimated 100 @,@ 000 ascents a year , around three @-@ quarters of which use the Pony Track from Glen Nevis . The 700 @-@ metre ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland , providing classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties for climbers and mountaineers . They are also the principal locations in Scotland for ice climbing . 
 The summit , which is the collapsed dome of an ancient volcano , features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904 . The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather . C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to invent the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 " Ben Nevis " is an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic name " Beinn Nibheis " . " Beinn " is the most common Gaelic word for " mountain " , " Nibheis " is variously understood , though the word is commonly translated as " malicious " or " venomous " . An alternative interpretation is that " Beinn Nibheis " derives from " <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> " , from " <unk> " " heavens , clouds " and " <unk> " " top of a man 's head " . One translation would therefore be " the mountain with its head in the clouds " , though " mountain of Heaven " is also frequently given . 
 As is common for many Scottish mountains , it is known both to locals and visitors as simply " the Ben " . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Ben Nevis forms a massif with its neighbour to the northeast , Càrn Mòr Dearg , to which it is linked by the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête . Both mountains are among the nine in Scotland over 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) ; <unk> Beag and <unk> Mòr are also on the Nevis massif . 
 The western and southern flanks of Ben Nevis rise 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) in about 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the floor of Glen Nevis – the longest and steepest hill slope in Britain – with the result that the mountain presents an aspect of massive bulk on this side . To the north , by contrast , cliffs drop some 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) to Coire Leis . This corrie contains the Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut ( known as the CIC Hut ) , a private mountain hut located at 680 metres ( 2 @,@ 230 ft ) above sea level , owned by the Scottish Mountaineering Club and used as a base for the many climbing routes on the mountain 's north face . 
 In addition to the main 1 @,@ 345 metres ( 4 @,@ 411 ft ) summit , Ben Nevis has two subsidiary " tops " listed in Munro 's Tables , both of which are called Càrn Dearg ( " red hill " ) . The higher of these , at 1 @,@ 221 metres ( 4 @,@ 006 ft ) , is situated to the northwest , and is often mistaken for Ben Nevis itself in views from the Fort William area . The other Càrn Dearg ( 1 @,@ 020 m ) juts out into Glen Nevis on the mountain 's southwestern side . A lower hill , Meall an t @-@ Suidhe ( 711 metres ( 2 @,@ 333 ft ) ) , is located further west , forming a saddle with Ben Nevis which contains a small loch , Lochan Meall an t @-@ Suidhe . The popular tourist path from Glen Nevis skirts the side of this hill before ascending Ben Nevis ' broad western flank . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Ben Nevis is all that remains of a Devonian volcano that met a cataclysmic end in the Carboniferous period around 350 million years ago . Evidence near the summit shows light coloured granite ( which had cooled in subterranean chambers several kilometres beneath the surface ) lies among dark basaltic lavas ( that only form on the surface ) . The two lying side @-@ by @-@ side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to Thera ( 2nd millennium BC ) or Krakatoa ( 1883 ) . The mountain is now all that remains of the imploded inner dome of the volcano . Its form has been extensively shaped by glaciation . 
 Research has shown igneous rock from the Devonian period ( around 400 million years ago ) intrudes into the surrounding metamorphic schists ; the intrusions take the form of a series of concentric ring dikes . The innermost of these , known as the Inner Granite , constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t @-@ Suidhe , and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg ; Meall an t @-@ Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite , which is redder in colour . The summit dome itself , together with the steep northern cliffs , are composed of andesite and basaltic lavas . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Ben Nevis has a highland ( alpine ) maritime ( oceanic ) Polar climate ( ET climate in Köppen 's classification ) . Ben Nevis ' altitude , maritime location and topography frequently lead to cool and cloudy weather conditions , which can pose a danger to ill @-@ equipped walkers . According to the observations carried out at the summit observatory from 1883 – 1904 , fog was present on the summit for almost 80 % of the time between November and January , and 55 % of the time in May and June . The average winter temperature was around − 5 ° C ( 23 ° F ) , and the mean monthly temperature for the year was − 0 @.@ 5 ° C ( 31 @.@ 1 ° F ) . In an average year the summit sees 261 gales , and receives 4 @,@ 350 millimetres ( 171 in ) of rainfall , compared to only 2 @,@ 050 millimetres ( 81 in ) in nearby Fort William , 840 millimetres ( 33 in ) in Inverness and 580 millimetres ( 23 in ) in London . Rainfall on Ben Nevis is about twice as high in the winter as it is in the spring and summer . Snow can be found on the mountain almost all year round , particularly in the gullies of the north face – with the higher reaches of Observatory Gully holding snow until September most years and sometimes until the new snows of the following season . 
 = = History = = 
 The first recorded ascent of Ben Nevis was made on the 17 August 1771 by James Robertson , an Edinburgh botanist , who was in the region to collect botanical specimens . Another early ascent was in 1774 by John Williams , who provided the first account of the mountain 's geological structure . John Keats climbed the mountain in 1818 , comparing the ascent to " mounting ten St. Pauls without the convenience of a staircase " . The following year William MacGillivray , who was later to become a distinguished naturalist , reached the summit only to find " fragments of earthen and glass ware , chicken bones , corks , and bits of paper " . It was not until 1847 that Ben Nevis was confirmed by the Ordnance Survey as the highest mountain in Britain and Ireland , ahead of its rival Ben <unk> . 
 The summit observatory was built in the summer of 1883 , and would remain in operation for 21 years . The first path to the summit was built at the same time as the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies , with a maximum gradient of one in five . The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular , all the more so after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894 . Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway to the summit , none of which came to fruition . 
 In 2000 , the Ben Nevis Estate , comprising all of the south side of the mountain including the summit , was bought by the Scottish conservation charity the John Muir Trust . 
 = = Ascent routes = = 
 The 1883 Pony Track to the summit ( also known as the Ben Path , the Mountain Path or the Tourist Route ) remains the simplest and most popular route of ascent . It begins at Achintee on the east side of Glen Nevis about 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from Fort William town centre , at around 20 metres above sea level . Bridges from the Visitor Centre and the youth hostel now allow access from the west side of Glen Nevis . The path climbs steeply to the saddle by Lochan Meall an t @-@ Suidhe ( also known as the ' Halfway Lochan ' ) at 570 m , then ascends the remaining 700 metres up the stony west flank of Ben Nevis in a series of zig @-@ zags . The path is regularly maintained but running water , uneven rocks and loose scree make it hazardous and slippery in places . Thanks to the zig @-@ zags , the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages , but inexperienced walkers should be aware that the descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees . 
 A route popular with experienced hillwalkers starts at <unk> , a few miles north @-@ east of Fort William on the A82 road , and follows the path alongside the Allt a ' <unk> . It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t @-@ Suidhe , then descending slightly to the CIC Hut . The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ( " <unk> Arête " ) before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis . This route involves a total of 1 @,@ 500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights . In common with other approaches on this side of the mountain , it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face , which are hidden from the Pony Track . 
 It is also possible to climb Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at Steal at the head of the road up Glen Nevis , either by the south @-@ east ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg ( south @-@ west ) . These routes require mild scrambling , are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track , and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers . 
 = = Summit = = 
 The summit of Ben Nevis comprises a large stony plateau of about 40 hectares ( 100 acres ) . The highest point is marked with a large , solidly built cairn atop which sits an Ordnance Survey trig point . The summit is the highest ground for over 400 miles ( 644 kilometres ) , before the Scandinavian Mountains in western Norway are reached , which contain many peaks higher than Ben Nevis . The summit is much higher than the Faroe Islands and well as the rest of the British Isles . 
 The ruined walls of the observatory are a prominent feature on the summit . An emergency shelter has been built on top of the observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather , and , although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain , the roof of the shelter <unk> the trig point by several feet , making it the highest man @-@ made structure in the UK . A war memorial to the dead of World War II is located next to the observatory . 
 On 17 May 2006 , a piano that had been buried under one of the cairns on the peak was uncovered by the John Muir Trust , which owns much of the mountain . The piano is believed to have been carried up for charity by removal men from Dundee over 20 years earlier . 
 The view from the UK 's highest point is extensive . Under ideal conditions , it can extend to over 190 kilometres ( 120 mi ) , including such mountains as the <unk> Hills , Morven in Caithness , <unk> , Ben Lomond , Barra Head and to <unk> in County Antrim , Northern Ireland . 
 = = = Observatory = = = 
 A meteorological observatory on the summit was first proposed by the Scottish Meteorological Society ( SMS ) in the late 1870s , at a time when similar observatories were being built around the world to study the weather at high altitude . In the summer of 1881 , Clement Lindley Wragge climbed the mountain daily to make observations ( earning him the nickname " Inclement Rag " ) , leading to the opening on 17 October 1883 of a permanent observatory run by the SMS . The building was manned full @-@ time until 1904 , when it was closed due to inadequate Government funding . The twenty years ' worth of readings still provide the most comprehensive set of data on mountain weather in Great Britain . 
 In September 1894 , C. T. R. Wilson was employed at the observatory for a couple of weeks , as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff . During this period , he witnessed a <unk> spectre and glory , caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer . He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory , resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber , used to detect ionising radiation . 
 Marjory Roy , a member of the Scottish Meteorological Society is the author of the book The Ben Nevis <unk> which is in print and available from SMC or from the West Highland Museum in Fort William . This tells the story of the funding , building and operating of the Ben Nevis Observatory in Fort William , Scotland 
 = = Navigation and safety = = 
 Ben Nevis ' popularity , climate and complex topography contribute to a high number of mountain rescue incidents . In 1999 , for example , there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain . Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit , especially in poor visibility . The problem stems from the fact that the summit plateau is roughly kidney @-@ shaped , and surrounded by cliffs on three sides ; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow . Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank , from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety . 
 In the late 1990s , Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts on the summit plateau , to assist walkers attempting the descent in foggy conditions . These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers , sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions . Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man @-@ made intrusion into the natural landscape , which create a false sense of security and could lessen mountaineers ' sense of responsibility for their own safety . Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain ( between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities , although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error ) , the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit , and the potentially life @-@ saving role they could play . A series of solidly @-@ constructed cairns currently ( September 2009 ) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track .

 The north face of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses , ridges , towers and pinnacles , and contains many classic scrambles and rock climbs . It is of major importance for British winter climbing , with many of its routes holding snow often until late April . It was one of the first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers , with a descent of Tower Ridge in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben . ( It was not climbed from bottom to top for another two years ) . The Scottish Mountaineering Club 's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the north face in Coire Leis in 1929 . Because of its remote location , it is said to be the only genuine alpine hut in Britain . It remains popular with climbers , especially in winter . 
 Tower Ridge is the longest of the north face 's four main ridges , with around 600 metres of ascent . It is not technically demanding ( its grade is Difficult ) , and most pitches can be tackled <unk> by competent climbers , but it is committing and very exposed . Castle Ridge ( Moderate ) , the northernmost of the main ridges , is an easier scramble , while Observatory Ridge ( Very Difficult ) , the closest ridge to the summit , is " technically the hardest of the Nevis ridges in summer and winter " . Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges are the Tower and <unk> <unk> ; the latter takes its name from the cry of " garde à l 'eau " ( French for " watch out for the water " ) formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops ( and worse ) out of a tenement window into the street . The gully 's top wall was the refuse pit for the now @-@ disused summit observatory . The North @-@ east Buttress ( Very Difficult ) is the southernmost and bulkiest of the four ridges ; it is as serious as Observatory Ridge but not as technically demanding , mainly because an " infamous " rock problem , the ' Man @-@ trap ' , can be avoided on either side . 
 The north face contains dozens of graded rock climbs along its entire length , with particular concentrations on the Càrn Dearg Buttress ( below the Munro top of Càrn Dearg NW ) and around the North @-@ east Buttress and Observatory Ridge . Classic rock routes include Rubicon Wall on Observatory Buttress ( Severe ) – whose second ascent in 1937 , when it was considered the hardest route on the mountain , is described by W. H. Murray in Mountaineering in Scotland – and , on Càrn Dearg , Centurion and The <unk> ( both <unk> ) , Torro ( E2 ) , and Titan 's Wall ( E3 ) , these four described in the SMC 's guide as among " the best climbs of their class in Scotland " . 
 Many seminal lines were recorded before the First World War by pioneering Scottish climbers like J N Collie , Willie Naismith , Harold Raeburn , and William and Jane Inglis Clark . Other classic routes were put up by G. Graham Macphee , Dr James H. B. Bell and others between the Wars ; these include Bell 's ' Long Climb ' , at 1 @,@ 400 ft ( 430 m ) reputedly the longest sustained climb on the British mainland . In summer 1943 conscientious objector Brian Kellett made a phenomenal seventy @-@ four repeat climbs and seventeen first ascents including fourteen solos , returning in 1944 to add fifteen more new lines , eleven solo , including his eponymous <unk> on <unk> buttress . Much more recently , an extreme and as @-@ yet ungraded climb on Echo Wall was completed by Dave MacLeod in 2008 after two years of preparation . 
 The north face is also one of Scotland 's foremost venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing , and holds snow until quite late in the year ; in a good year , routes may remain in winter condition until mid @-@ spring . Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs , including the four main ridges ; Tower Ridge , for example , is grade IV on the Scottish winter grading system , having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team , there being numerous <unk> and incidents every winter season . Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis is The Curtain ( IV , 5 ) on the left side of the Càrn Dearg Buttress . At the top end of the scale , Centurion in winter is a grade VIII , 8 face climb . 
 In February 1960 James R. Marshall and Robin Clark Smith recorded six major new ice routes in only eight days including Orion Direct ( V , 5 400m ) ; this winter version of Bell 's Long Climb was " the climax of a magnificent week 's climbing by Smith and Marshall , and the highpoint of the step @-@ cutting era . " 
 = = Ben Nevis Race = = 
 The history of hill running on Ben Nevis dates back to 1895 . William Swan , a barber from Fort William , made the first recorded timed ascent up the mountain on or around 27 September of that year , when he ran from the old post office in Fort William to the summit and back in 2 hours 41 minutes . The following years saw several improvements on Swan 's record , but the first competitive race was held on 3 June 1898 under Scottish Amateur Athletic Association rules . Ten competitors ran the course , which started at the Lochiel Arms Hotel in <unk> and was thus longer than the route from Fort William ; the winner was 21 @-@ year @-@ old Hugh Kennedy , a gamekeeper at Tor Castle , who finished ( coincidentally with Swan 's original run ) in 2 hours 41 minutes . 
 Regular races were organised until 1903 , when two events were held ; these were the last for 24 years , perhaps due to the closure of the summit observatory the following year . The first was from Achintee , at the foot of the Pony Track , and finished at the summit ; It was won in just over an hour by Ewen MacKenzie , the observatory <unk> . The second race ran from new Fort William post office , and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2 hours 10 minutes , a record he held for 34 years . 
 The Ben Nevis Race has been run in its current form since 1937 . It now takes place on the first Saturday in September every year , with a maximum of 500 competitors taking part . It starts and finishes at the <unk> Park football ground on the outskirts of Fort William , and is 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) long with 1 @,@ 340 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 ft ) of ascent . Due to the seriousness of the mountain environment , entry is restricted to those who have completed three hill races , and runners must carry waterproofs , a hat , gloves and a whistle ; anyone who has not reached the summit after two hours is turned back . As of 2010 the records have stood unbroken since 1984 , when Kenny Stuart and Pauline Haworth of Keswick Athletic Club won the men 's and the women 's races with times of 1 : 25 : 34 and 1 : 43 : 25 respectively . 
 = = Environmental Issues & Nevis Landscape Partnership = = 
 Ben Nevis ' popularity and high profile have led to concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on the fragile mountain environment . These concerns contributed to the creation of The Nevis Landscape Partnership , a five @-@ year programme which aims to protect , enhance and future @-@ proof Ben Nevis by delivering nineteen ambitious environmental projects between 2014 and 2019 . The Nevis Landscape Partnership is supported by five partner organisations ( John Muir Trust , Forestry Commission Scotland , The Highland Council , Scottish Natural Heritage & The Nevis Partnership ) and has been made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding . 
 Now in project year three ( March 2016 – March 2017 ) , there have been significant positive changes implemented by Nevis Landscape Partnership and their projects , most significantly the upgrades to the Ben Nevis Mountain Track . Work to upgrade the mountain track started in November 2015 after two contracts were awarded to McGowan Ltd . & Cairngorm Wilderness Contracts . Both contractors immediately started bagging stone from high up Ben Nevis to be brought down to by helicopter to replace crumbling steps and stabilise eroding parts of the path . The project will eventually upgrade 3 @.@ 5 km of the mountain track from the starting point at Achintee all the way up to John 's Wall ; this year the maintenance was focused on a difficult middle section which was most in need of attention . After six months of hard work and battling with the weather , the contractors have now upgraded 1 km of the mountain track which is roughly 30 % of the overall maintenance this project will carry out . The next contracted works will resume towards the end of September , after the Ben Nevis Race , for stage two of the project . 
 Volunteer effort has already been a huge help and will continue to be a large contributing factor to the overall upgrade of the mountain track . Nevis Landscape Partnership are working closely with National Trust for Scotland to run Thistle Camp Working Holidays which will focus on much @-@ needed maintenance on the first section of the Ben Nevis footpath and allow outdoor enthusiasts to actively be a part of maintaining and protecting the United Kingdom 's highest mountain for this generation and many more to come .

 The Ben Nevis Distillery is a single malt whisky distillery at the foot of the mountain , located by Victoria Bridge to the north of Fort William . Founded in 1825 by John McDonald ( known as " Long John " ) , it is one of the oldest licensed distilleries in Scotland , and is a popular visitor attraction in Fort William . The water used to make the whisky comes from the Allt a ' <unk> , the stream that flows from Ben Nevis ' northern corrie . " Ben Nevis " 80 / - organic ale is , by contrast , brewed in Bridge of Allan near Stirling .

 Ben Nevis was the name of a White Star Line packet ship which in 1854 carried the group of immigrants who were to become the Wends of Texas . At least another eight vessels have carried the name since then . 
 A mountain in Svalbard is also named Ben Nevis , after the Scottish peak . It is 922 meters high , and located south of the head of <unk> , Albert I Land , in the northwestern part of the island of Spitsbergen . 
 A comic strip character , Wee Ben Nevis , about a Scottish Highlands boarding school student with superhuman strength and his antics were featured in the British comic The Beano from 1974 to 1977 , was named after the mountain .

 = Hurricane Gladys ( 1975 ) = 
 Hurricane Gladys was the farthest tropical cyclone from the United States to be observed by radar in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Carla in 1961 . The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season , Gladys developed from a tropical wave while several hundred miles southwest of Cape Verde on September 22 . Initially , the tropical depression failed to strengthened significantly , but due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear , it became Tropical Storm Gladys by September 24 . Despite entering a more unfavorable environment several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward Islands , Gladys became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind <unk> September 28 . Shortly thereafter , the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening . Eventually , a well @-@ defined eye became visible on satellite imagery . 
 As the storm tracked to the east of the Bahamas , a curve to the north began , at which time an anticyclone developed atop the cyclone . This subsequently allowed Gladys to rapidly intensify into a Category 4 hurricane , reaching maximum sustained winds of 140 mph ( 230 km / h ) on October 2 . Thereafter , Gladys began to weaken and passed very close to Cape Race , Newfoundland before merging with a large extratropical cyclone the next day . Effects from the system along the East Coast of the United States were minimal , although heavy rainfall and rough seas were reported . In Newfoundland , strong winds and light precipitation were observed . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 17 , a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Africa . The disturbance followed another tropical wave which became Hurricane Faye several days later , before turning west near the 11th parallel . Based on estimates from the Dvorak Technique , the wave was designated a tropical depression at 18 : 00 UTC on September 22 . Due to favorable conditions such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Gladys by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) on September 24 . After becoming a tropical storm , Gladys slowly intensified as winds increased to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The storm then moved west @-@ northwest , and on September 25 , Gladys strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) . Despite strong wind shear , the storm maintained minimal hurricane status . However , early on September 28 , the barometric pressure increased to 1 @,@ 000 mb ( 30 inHg ) ; the NHC notes that Gladys may have briefly weakened into a tropical storm at this time . 
 After passing through the trough that generated the wind shear , the storm began to strengthen again . While moving about 350 miles ( 560 km ) north of Puerto Rico on September 30 , the winds of the storm increased to 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . By this time , an eye was clearly visible on satellite imagery . After holding steady for 36 hours , the storm recurved around a ridge on October 1 . Gladys then began to undergo rapid deepening , becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18 : 00 UTC and Category 3 hurricane the following day . Early on October 2 , the storm strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane . At 08 : 46 UTC on October 2 , Hurricane Hunters measured maximum sustained winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 939 mbar ( 27 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Moving northeast , the hurricane hunters soon observed a pressure of 940 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , making it the one of the most intense high @-@ latitude storms ever observed . Despite its distance from Cape Hatteras , the system was briefly observed on radar . It became one of few hurricanes at the time to be seen on radar over 150 mi ( 240 km ) from the continental United States . Thereafter , the storm weakened slightly , and was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane early on October 3 . Accelerating at unusually high speeds , Gladys passed 70 miles ( 115 km ) southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland on October 3 . The storm finally merged with a large extratropical cyclone on October 4 . 
 = = Observation , preparations and impact = = 
 While over the Atlantic Ocean , a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) C @-@ 130 hurricane hunter aircraft flew into Gladys on October 1 on a research mission . The mission was to study the storm and use the information to improve seeding operations for the now @-@ defunct Project Stormfury . 
 Gladys was the strongest storm to threaten the East Coast of the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954 . Although initially not expected to threaten , meteorologists at the NHC forecast the storm to make landfall along the East Coast of the United States within three days . A hurricane watch was issued for North Carolina 's Outer Banks on October 1 , extending from Cape Lookout to Kitty Hawk . However , the watch discontinued as Gladys pulled away , though the storm was still considered a threat to the nation . In Manteo , residents began laying sandbags and filling their cars up with fuel in anticipation for possible evacuation , and the United States Coast Guard sent a plane equipped with a loudspeaker to warn fishermen of the hurricane . However , despite warnings , about 40 fishermen went to Cape Point near Cape Hatteras due to the " increased feeding activities " of fish during rough seas . All small crafts were advised to stay out of the water . Elsewhere in the Outer Banks , residents evacuated to hotels in Elizabeth City and four United States Coast Guard servicemen stationed at a lighthouse in Cape Hatteras were evacuated . 
 While passing the Outer Banks , a campground and road was closed due to 8 ft ( 2 m ) waves . As the cyclone moved northward . In all , the effects of the storm on North Carolina were minimal . While tracking rapidly to the southeast of Newfoundland , light rainfall was observed , including 1 @.@ 46 in ( 37 mm ) of precipitation in St. John 's . Strong winds were also reported on the island . 
 = No. 1 Initial Flying Training School RAAF = 
 No. 1 Initial Flying Training School ( No. 1 IFTS ) was a flying training school of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . It was formed in 1951 as No. 1 Initial Training School , in response to increased demand for aircrew during the Korean War and Malayan Emergency . Headquartered at RAAF Station Archerfield , Queensland , and operating de Havilland Tiger Moths , the unit was renamed No. 1 Initial Flying Training School in 1952 . Ground staff from the school won the Hewitt Trophy for small arms proficiency in 1953 . Aircrew training requirements eased following the end of the Korean War , and No . IFTS merged with No. 1 Basic Flying Training School at RAAF Base Uranquinty , New South Wales , in 1955 . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to World War II , all aircrew training in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) was conducted under the auspices of one unit , No. 1 Flying Training School ( No. 1 FTS ) , at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria . With the dramatic expansion of pilot training under the wartime Empire Air Training Scheme , No. 1 FTS was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . Rationalisation as the war progressed and came to an end saw all the EFTSs and SFTSs disbanded . No. 1 FTS , re @-@ formed using the personnel and equipment of No. 5 Service Flying Training School in Uranquinty , New South Wales , returned to Point Cook and again became the RAAF 's sole facility for training new pilots . 
 In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia 's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency , flying training in the RAAF was again expanded in 1951 – 52 , with the functions of No. 1 FTS being split among three separately located units . On 28 November 1951 , No. 1 Initial Training School ( No. 1 ITS ) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield , Queensland , to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge , after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on de Havilland Tiger Moths . Graduate pilots of No. 1 ITS went on to another new unit , No. 1 Basic Flying Training School ( No. 1 BFTS ) at RAAF Base Uranquinty , New South Wales , where they underwent further aerial instruction that included instrument , formation and night flying on Tiger Moths and CAC Wirraways . Successful students finally transferred to No. 1 FTS , which was renamed No. 1 Applied Flying Training School in March 1952 , for advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways , before graduating as sergeant pilots . 
 No. 1 ITS 's <unk> commanding officer was Wing Commander Wilfred Lampe . Tiger Moths began arriving at Archerfield on 4 January 1952 , and the first course commenced two days later . It graduated on 27 March , having flown a total of some 1 @,@ 000 hours . The unit was renamed No. 1 Initial Flying Training School on 28 May . As well as RAAF pilots , the school trained students from the Royal Australian Navy 's Fleet Air Arm , and gave Air Training Corps cadets flying experience . Six of its Tiger Moths went on a recruiting drive around Kingaroy and Bundaberg in August 1952 , the same month that its first graduates commenced the next phase of their training at No. 1 BFTS . Those students selected to be navigators rather than pilots went on to the School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale , Victoria . No. 1 IFTS was responsible for staging aerial pageants as part of Air Force Week in September 1952 , and again in September 1953 . Ground staff from the school won the Hewitt Trophy for small arms proficiency held at Liverpool , New South Wales , in December 1953 . In April 1954 , the Tiger Moths practised bombing and strafing troops in an exercise with the Australian Army 's 9th Battalion . 
 By November 1954 , following the end of the Korean War , the RAAF 's need for further aircrew to help meet the Australian military 's international obligations had eased and the decision was made to combine the syllabus of No. 1 IFTS with No. 1 BFTS starting in the new year . No. 1 IFTS was disbanded on 24 January 1955 , and its base facilities handed over to No. 23 Squadron . 
 = Lionel Luthor = 
 Lionel Luthor is a fictional character portrayed by John Glover in the television series Smallville . The character was initially a recurring guest in season one , and became a series regular in season two and continued until being written out of the show in season seven . The character returned to the show in season ten again as a recurring guest role as the Earth @-@ 2 version of the character . In Smallville , Lionel Luthor is the father of Lex Luthor ( Michael Rosenbaum ) , and founder and CEO of LuthorCorp . Lex Luthor 's father was first introduced in Superman comics by Jerry Siegel in 1961 and has since appeared in other Superman @-@ related media under different names . Smallville is the first appearance in which the character has been an intricate part of a Superman adaptation . Series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar created Lionel Luthor for Smallville to provide an antithesis to the parenting style of Jonathan Kent ( John Schneider ) and Martha Kent ( Annette O 'Toole ) . 
 During the story of Smallville , Lionel evolves from being a nemesis of Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) who develops multiple schemes to uncover Clark 's secrets , to becoming an ally who eventually dies to protect Clark 's secret from his own son . Lionel has a strained relationship with Lex and regularly tries to test him . He attempts to develop a romantic relationship with Martha Kent following the death of Jonathan Kent , helping her advance toward the United States Senate . 
 Lionel 's development from a main antagonist to an ally was difficult for the writers , who felt the character 's arc failed to achieve the status they wanted . Although they continued with the story arc , Lionel returned to using deception to protect Clark rather than exploit him . He is characterized as a sinister character who tried hard to further his own ambitions . Lionel 's relationship with his son has been likened to that of Harry Osborn and Norman Osborn from Spider @-@ Man comics . 
 = = Role in Smallville = = 
 In 1989 , Lionel visits Smallville to buy the Ross <unk> Corn company immediately before a meteor shower occurs . Twelve years later during season one , Lionel exiles his son Lex Luthor ( Michael Rosenbaum ) to Smallville to run LuthorCorp 's local fertilizer plant as a test . When Lex makes a profit for the first time in years , Lionel closes the plant and blames Lex 's poor managerial skills . Lionel later confronts his son at the Luthor mansion when Lex tries to orchestrate an employee buyout to save the fertilizer plant . When strong winds force debris to smash through the mansion , Lionel is pinned under a fallen support beam and Lex hesitates to save his father . In Season two , Lex saves Lionel but loses his sight because of Lex 's judgment to rush into surgery . Season two 's first half shows Lionel as blind . Lex and Lucas Luthor ( Paul Wasilewski ) — Lionel 's illegitimate son — devise a plan to uncover Lionel 's deception ; it is revealed that Lionel was blind but that his eyes healed and he intentionally neglected to tell <unk> so he could watch how they acted around him . Season two 's second half shows Lionel is aware of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mysterious symbols there , to the dismay of Clark Kent ( Tom Welling ) . 
 Season three revealed that Lionel conspired with Morgan Edge ( Rutger Hauer ) to murder Lionel 's parents and use the insurance money to fund the start of LuthorCorp . Lionel has Lex committed to a mental institution , when his son discovers what Lionel did . When Chloe Sullivan ( Allison Mack ) discovers the truth , that evidence is used to assist Lex have Lionel arrested for his parents ' murder . Season three also revealed why Lionel is angry with Lex ; he blames his son for the death of his youngest son Julian Luthor , although Lex took the blame to protect the true killer , the mentally unwell Lillian Luthor ( <unk> Down ) , Lionel 's wife and Lex 's mother . Lionel also learns that he has a terminal liver disease , which he divulges to Lex while awaiting arraignment . 
 Lionel is sentenced to prison for his parents ' murder in season four . Lionel attempts to switch bodies with Lex using a stone from Clark 's homeworld of Krypton but Clark intervenes and Lionel switches bodies with Clark instead . When he and Clark switch back , Lionel discovers his terminal liver disease is healed . Lionel is released from prison by Genevieve Teague ( Jane Seymour ) , and begins searching for three stones of knowledge . During this quest , Lionel falls into a catatonic state after being uploaded with Kryptonian knowledge . Lionel recovers from his catatonic state in season five when the Kryptonian artificial intelligence Jor @-@ El takes over his body to speak with Clark . With Jor @-@ El guiding him , Lionel begins helping Clark by making excuses for Clark 's behavior and unexplained disappearances throughout seasons five and six . Season seven revealed that Lionel and three other wealthy families formed the secret society called Veritas to protect an alien visitor known as the Traveler ( Clark ) . When the secret is uncovered , Lex murders his father , realizing he has been covering up the Traveler 's existence . 
 Season ten reveals that Tess Mercer ( Cassidy Freeman ) is Lionel 's illegitimate daughter . The same season also features a parallel universe where a version of the character found and adopted Clark 's counterpart as his adopted son raised to be a killer , favoring Clark 's counterpart over his own son in his reality . Clark visits this world and unintentionally allows for the alternate doppelganger to follow . Posing as his own doppelganger , Lionel tries to make amends when he attempts twice to bring " Alexander Luthor " / Conner Kent ( Lucas Grabeel ) , a hybrid clone of Clark and Lex that develops Clark 's powers , to his side but fails . Lionel also assumes control of LuthorCorp from Tess but loses the company when his daughter proves he is an imposter . At his nadir , Lionel is approached by the evil alien entity Darkseid . In the series finale , Lionel discovers Lex 's defective clones were grafted to create a perfect composite clone , but a compatible heart could not be found among the clones . Lionel tries to give Tess 's heart to Lex , but when Tess shoots Lionel and escapes . Lionel surrenders his soul to Darkseid , giving Lionel 's heart to restore Lex . Afterward , Darkseid possesses Lionel 's corpse to attack Clark , however , Clark destroy Lionel 's body , dispelling the threat posed by Darkseid .

 Lionel Luthor was created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar specifically for " Smallville " to provide a parallel to the Kents as an " experiment in extreme parenting " . The character Chloe Sullivan ( Allison Mack ) was also created for the show . Lex 's father has previously been depicted in other media . 
 Lionel Luthor is portrayed in the program by John Glover ; Glover said he appreciates the " clear canvas " he had to work with when developing his portrayal of Lionel . In season one , Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time . When portraying the character 's struggle with terminal liver disease , Glover was inspired by a friend 's battle with cancer ; he said his friend was a " cheerleader to people " , who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad . When Glover 's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it , but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later . This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide — which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal .

 In season two , Lionel moves from being recurring figure to a regular character . This season features the gradual unveiling of Lionel 's increasing involvement with the characters of the show . It begins with more direct involvement when Luthor hires Martha Kent as his assistant , and then indirectly when he becomes the conservator of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mystery of the symbols on the cave walls . During season three , Lionel becomes the villain of the show when he tries to discover Clark 's secret and drives Lex into a psychotic breakdown . This allows Lionel to use electroshock therapy on Lex to erase his knowledge of Lionel 's co @-@ opting of Morgan Edge to kill Lionel 's parents for their life insurance . The creative team experimented with Lionel 's character in season four , creating a storyline in which Lionel is reformed . Executive producer Greg Beeman said the character development failed , and as a result Lionel returned to his normal self . John Glover found playing Lionel as a straight arrow was " boring " . 
 Season five explores the relationship between Martha and Lionel . Both Annette O 'Toole and Al Gough said Lionel was slightly attracted to Martha , but that she would never act on that feeling . The producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters . Most of Lionel 's motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery . Glover said he could not determine whether his character is good or bad , so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was " good " . Glover said he believes Lincoln Cole 's ( Ian Tracey ) actions in " Mercy " made Lionel rethink everything his past behavior and his own character . By the end of the fifth season , Lionel has learned that people have a responsibility to each other . 
 Smallville 's writer and executive producer Brian Peterson said the creative team wanted to remind the audience that Lionel was still the same Lionel Luthor they had come know , so they delayed revealing Lionel 's usual antics until season six 's " Promise " in which he blackmails Lana into marrying Lex . Peterson wanted to " slap [ the audience ] in the face " with a reminder of Lionel 's former character . Although Lionel blackmails Lana into marrying Lex , John Glover said Lionel was trying to protect Clark , for which he needed Lana 's help . By the time season six began airing , John Glover realized Lex was starting to become more villainous and that his time on the show would be limited . Glover hoped Lionel would still be able to influence his son as the show progressed ; he believed his character would be useless on the show without such influencing abilities . Glover said the conflict between Lex and his father is very positive for the show because Lionel 's attempt to bond with Lex and the distrust between them " makes drama " . 
 = = = Characterization = = = 
 John Glover characterizes Lionel as a businessman who is disappointed with his son . To Glover , Lionel is this " rich and powerful businessman " who sees his son as a " <unk> " and " <unk> @-@ cat " . It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible ; Glover said he does not want to simply " twirl [ his ] mustache " . Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants . He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily . Lionel uses that ability to further his goals . The character can also get past people 's defenses and manipulate them . Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel . Lionel 's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him ; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the " sinister " nature of the character . Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or " clinical blue " background . Lionel 's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power — by growing it out and refusing to style it , Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 The relationship between Lionel and his son Lex is strained ; it has been likened to the relationship between Norman and Harry Osborn in the Spider @-@ Man movie . Glover tried to make Lionel appear as though he is trying to " toughen [ Lex ] up " . The character is made to " go out of his way , to give [ Lex ] tests , so [ Lex ] can prove himself " . Glover sees the character as a rich and powerful businessman who is disappointed in his son . Glover 's goal for season one was to show Lionel 's attempts to make Lex tougher ; he interprets the character 's motto in his raising of Lex as " no risk , no rewards " . 
 Glover believes Lionel has two competing agendas with Lex — for Lex to become his own man and for Lex to follow in his father 's steps . This becomes frustrating for Lex because Lionel wants his son to be both " loyal follower " and the " best person he can be " . This all plays into Lionel 's " pretty huge ego " . John Glover believes if Lionel and Lex were not related Lionel would have " destroyed " Lex early on because he views his son as " weak " . Lionel is also bound by the fact that Lex is his heir , although he does not trust Lex . Lionel 's distrust of Lex partially arises because he believes Lex is a coward . John Glover said , " It 's not that [ Lionel is ] meant to be a foe ; it 's just that the poor boy 's weak , so [ Lionel must ] mold him . Lionel is continually trying to strengthen his son , to teach him . [ Lex is ] just a hard student . " 
 Lionel also has a key relationship with Martha Kent , Clark Kent 's adoptive mother . This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant ; it is further developed in season five . Glover felt Lionel 's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable ; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha 's " goodness " and the attraction is not based on lust . When Lionel is in Martha 's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with ; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior . Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex 's relationship with Lana ; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side . Annette O 'Toole said Martha 's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal ; " It 's that attraction you have for a very beautiful , dangerous animal . You know you can 't stop watching it , but at the same time you feel , ' Oh my God , he 's going to kill me . ' " O 'Toole also said she believes Martha 's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark . When Martha left the show , writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character " more of a send @-@ off " than they achieved on screen . Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in . The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate , creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage . O 'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it . 
 Glover believes Martha influenced Lionel to start believing that sacrifice is necessary to make the world a better place . When she leaves at the end of season six , Lionel no longer has that influence . He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality . According to series writer Caroline Dries , the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act . Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex , later revealing it was to protect Clark . Glover describes his off @-@ screen relationship with Annette O 'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry . Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O 'Toole are sharing a conversation , and that trust is visualized on the camera .

 = Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla = 
 Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla Abu ' l @-@ Ma 'ali Sharif , more commonly known by his laqab ( honorific epithet ) , Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla ( Arabic : <unk> الدولة ) , was the second ruler of the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo , encompassing most of northern Syria . The son of the emirate 's founder , Sayf al @-@ Dawla , he inherited the throne at a young age and in the midst of a major Byzantine offensive that within two years conquered the western portions of his realm and turned Aleppo into a tributary state . Facing a multitude of rebellions and desertions until 977 , Sa 'd was unable even to enter his own capital , which was in the hands of his father 's chief minister , Qarquya . By maintaining close relations with the Buyids , he managed to re @-@ establish his authority in parts of the Jazira , but his rule was soon challenged by the rebellion of his governor Bakjur , who was supported by the Fatimids of Egypt . In turn , Sa 'd came to rely increasingly on Byzantine assistance , although he continued to fluctuate in his allegiance between Byzantium , the Buyids , and the Fatimids . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla was the son of Sayf al @-@ Dawla , the first Emir of Aleppo , and Sakhinah , the sister of Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's cousin and court poet , Abu Firas . At the time of his father 's death , in February 967 , he was only fifteen , and resided at the emirate 's Jaziran capital , Mayyafariqin . His succession to the emirate was unopposed , but the state his father had left him was crumbling : the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II had just conquered Cilicia and was raiding its northern and western provinces , while rebellions of his closest lieutenants had plagued Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's last years . 
 Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla reached Aleppo , which for years had been governed by Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's chief minister and chamberlain ( hajib ) , Qarquya , in June / July 967 . Almost immediately he was confronted by a rebellion of his uncle , Abu Firas , at the time governor of Homs , which lasted until the latter 's death in battle in April 968 . At the same time , Aleppo itself was threatened by the Byzantines , and Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla , on the advice of Qarquya , left the city . The Byzantines did not attack the city , but Qarquya and his fellow ghilman ( military slaves ) seized the moment to claim the city for themselves . Accompanied by 300 faithful followers , Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla was thus reduced to wandering from city to city across the lands that were nominally his , hoping to gain entry : Saruj , Manbij and Harran refused to support him , while at Mayyafariqin his own mother refused to let him in . Finally , he found refuge at Homs . In the meantime , many of his father 's old supporters left to join his cousin Abu Taghlib , Emir of Mosul , who used the opportunity to expand his own territory . Immediately after Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's death , he captured al @-@ Raqqah , and by 971 extended his control over the provinces of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar . Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla , unable to offer any resistance , tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin 's suzerainty . 
 The year 969 was a crucial one in Syrian history , as it marked the climax of the Byzantine advance . In October , the generals Michael Bourtzes and Peter captured Antioch , securing their control over the north Syrian littoral . Soon after , the Byzantines marched against Aleppo itself and forced Qarquya to sign a treaty ( December 969 or January 970 ) making Aleppo a tributary Byzantine protectorate with Qarquya as emir and his deputy , Bakjur , as his designated successor . At the same time , in Egypt , the Fatimids defeated the Ikhshidids and gained control of the country , from where they advanced into southern Syria . The competition between these two powers , Byzantium and the Fatimids , would shape the history of Syria and of Aleppo for the next fifty years . 
 = = = Recovery of Aleppo , conflicts with Bakjur , the Fatimids and Byzantium = = = 
 It was not until 977 that Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla managed to regain his capital , which by now was under the control of Bakjur , who in 975 had deposed and imprisoned Qarquya . Aided by some of his father 's ghilman , and , crucially , the powerful Banu Kilab tribe living around Aleppo , Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla besieged Aleppo and captured it . Qarquya was set free and again entrusted with the affairs of state until his death a few years later , while Bakjur was given the governorship of Homs . Soon after , in 979 , he was able to capitalize upon Abu Taghlib 's conflict with the Buyids of Iraq to recover some of his father 's domains in the Jazira : after acknowledging Buyid suzerainty , he received governorship of the Diyar Mudar , except for al @-@ Raqqah and Rahba . At the same time , he also received from the Abbasid Caliph — who was a puppet of the Buyids — the honorific laqab by which he is known . 
 Bakjur , in the meantime , had used his new post at Homs to open contacts with the Fatimids , who intended to use him as a pawn to subdue Aleppo and complete their conquest of the entirety of Syria . Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla himself oscillated between the Fatimids and Byzantium : on the one hand he resented Byzantine overlordship and was willing to acknowledge the Fatimid Caliph , but on the other hand was did not want to see his domain become merely another Fatimid province like southern Syria . His first attempt to shake free of the Byzantine protectorate , in 981 , thus ended in failure due to lack of outside support , when a Byzantine army appeared before Aleppo 's walls to enforce compliance . The Fatimids now induced Bakjur to act , and in September 983 , the latter launched an attack on Aleppo with the support of Fatimid troops . Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor Basil II for help , and the siege was raised by a Byzantine army under Bardas Phokas the Younger . The Byzantines then proceeded to sack Homs in October . The city was returned to Hamdanid control , while Bakjur fled to Fatimid territory , where he assumed the governorship of Damascus . It is an indication of the strained relations between Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla and his " saviours " that after Bakjur 's flight , there were clashes between Byzantine and Hamdanid troops , which were settled only when the Hamdanid emir agreed to pay twice the usual yearly amount of tribute of 20 @,@ 000 gold dinars . 
 Hamdanid relations with Byzantium collapsed completely in 985 – 986 , after the Fatimids took the Byzantine fortress of <unk> . Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla refused to continue paying tribute . As a result , the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas invaded his territory and sacked Killis before retracing their steps and marching south to an unsuccessful siege of Apamea . In retaliation , Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla sent his troops to raze the famous monastery of Qal 'at Sim 'an . However , soon after that , in May 986 , the prospect of an imminent conclusion of a peace between Byzantium and Egypt forced Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla to return to his earlier allegiance , and he re @-@ affirmed his tributary status on the same terms as before . This did not prevent Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla from supporting the Byzantine general Bardas Skleros in his second rebellion against Basil II , once he was released from Buyid captivity in December 896 , nor of recognizing Fatimid suzerainty in the same month , especially as Byzantium now descended into a civil war that lasted until 989 . 
 Warfare with the Fatimids once again threatened in 991 , again because of Bakjur . He had governed Damascus until 988 , when he was deposed , and then fled to Raqqah . From there , though with little support from the Fatimids , he tried to attack Aleppo . Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla , with Byzantine assistance in the form of troops under the doux of Antioch , Michael Bourtzes , was able to defeat and capture Bakjur at Na <unk> east of Aleppo in April 991 , and later had him executed . Nevertheless , relations with the Fatimids soured over Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla 's arrest of Bakjur 's children , and it was only his death of hemiplegia in December 991 that stopped him from attacking Fatimid possessions . 
 Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla was succeeded by his son , Sa 'id Abu ' l @-@ Fada 'il Sa 'id al @-@ Dawla , but real power rested in the hands of Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla 's former chamberlain , Lu 'lu ' . Several of the Hamdanid ghilman , resenting the influence of Lu 'lu ' , went over to the Fatimids , who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin . Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest . Warfare lasted until 1000 , when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo 's continued existence as a buffer state between the two powers . Finally , in 1002 , Lu 'lu ' assassinated Sa 'id al @-@ Dawla and assumed control of Aleppo in his own name .

 Black Holes and Revelations is the fourth studio album by English alternative rock band Muse , released on 3 July 2006 in the United Kingdom . It gets its title from a line in the song " Starlight " , which is the second track on the album . Recording was split between New York and France , and it was the first time Muse had taken a more active role in the album 's production . The album was a change in style from Muse 's previous albums , and the band cited influences that included Depeche Mode , Millionaire , Lightning Bolt , Sly and the Family Stone , and music from southern Italy . 
 Black Holes and Revelations was placed at number 34 in a public vote conducted by Q Magazine for " The Best British Albums of all time " in February 2008 . 
 Like their two previous albums , Black Holes and Revelations has political and science @-@ fiction undertones , with the lyrics covering topics as varied as political corruption , alien invasion , revolution and New World Order conspiracies as well as more conventional love songs . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 Muse 's previous album , Absolution , was released in 2003 to critical acclaim . Absolution had brought the band mainstream exposure in the United States for the first time . 
 The band retired to an old château in France to write for a new album . Lead singer Matthew Bellamy said that this was because the band wanted to be free from distractions so that they could " concentrate , spend time and be surrounded by different musical influences " . The album was partially recorded in the same studio in France as Pink Floyd 's album The Wall , of which fact bassist Chris Wolstenholme said it was a " great feeling to know that something big had been done [ there ] " . However , the band found recording there very slow and had difficulties deciding which songs to include on the album . They travelled to New York to finish the recording . 
 Wolstenholme considered writing and recording for Black Holes and Revelations more relaxed than it had been for previous albums , as the band did not have a deadline to work to . It was the first time they had learned about the technology in the studio , having previously left the use of it to the sound engineers . Bellamy said that this was the first time Muse made an album without being concerned about how they would play it live . 
 " Soldier 's Poem " , stood out as being " quite unlike anything [ they 'd ] ever done before " . Drummer Dominic Howard said they were originally going to record it with a " massive , epic " approach , but then decided to strip it down and record it in a small studio with vintage equipment and a few microphones . Muse were pleased with the result and Howard described it as a " real highlight " , describing the vocals as " some of the most amazing vocals I 've ever heard Matt do " . 
 = = Lyrical content = = 
 Black Holes and Revelations was said by some reviewers to carry a political message . The album begins with the track " Take a Bow " , which is an " attack on an all but unnamed political leader " , incorporating lyrics such as " Corrupt , you corrupt and bring corruption to all that you touch " . These themes are carried through the album in the tracks " Exo @-@ Politics " and " Assassin " . The album often touches on controversial subject matters , such as " The New World Order conspiracy , unjustifiable war , abusive power , conspiratorial manipulation and populist revolt , " and is influenced by the conspiracy theories that the band are interested in . Matt Bellamy stated that he finds " the unknown in general a stimulating area for the imagination " , and this interest is reflected throughout the album , which features alien invasion ( in " Exo @-@ Politics " ) and rebellious paranoia ( particularly during " Assassin " ) . The album also includes more emotional themes , including regret , ambition , and love . 
 The title , taken from lyrics in " Starlight " , is explained by Bellamy in his September 2006 interview for Q magazine : " Black holes and revelations – they 're the two areas of songwriting for me that make up the majority of this album . A revelation about yourself , something personal , something genuine of an everyday nature that maybe people can relate to . Then the black holes are these songs that are from the more ... unknown regions of the imagination . "

 The sleeve 's designer Storm Thorgerson said : " This design was executed on location in Bardenas … The central motif came from ' galloping ' horses ( ' Knights of Cydonia ' , ' Invincible ' ) and from the biblical allusion to horsemen , namely the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , now represented in contemporary mode .

Hoard went on to describe " Knights of Cydonia " and " City of Delusion " " ridiculous " , but concluded that it was " surprising " , that the album worked . The A.V. Club 's Noel Murray , on the other hand , gave the band credit for reworking themselves , but called the album a " nightmare " and gave it a D + . The album also garnered some crossover appeal , with Oakland hip hop group Zion I releasing a notable remix of " Knights of Cydonia " in 2008 .

 The Simpsons end up staying inside during an acid rainstorm caused by The Republican Party 's latest decision to make caring for the environment a felony offense to play a game of Monopoly . When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces , Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him . Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart , but this escalates to Lisa fighting with Marge . Despite her inability to talk , Maggie calls the police on her family .

 After a short time in jail , they are released by a man named Gabriel , whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven , moves in with the family to help them be functional again . After observing the family 's quirks , Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family 's problems accordingly : Marge tries to prove her self @-@ worth to the family by medicating them with food , Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention , and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon . Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree . The object is for the family to work together as a team to get it down .

 " Brawl in the Family " was directed by Matthew Nastuk and was the first episode Joel H. Cohen received a sole writing credit for . Cohen had previously received a credit for " Hex and the City " , the first segment of " Treehouse of Horror XII " which aired the previous year . " Brawl in the Family " originally aired on January 6 , 2002 on the Fox network . It was the first episode for which current showrunner Al Jean served as sole showrunner . It was the second of his episodes to air however , since the Christmas @-@ themed " She of Little Faith " , the second episode he produced , was chosen to air first as it would coincide with the holiday . The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean , who wanted to make a follow @-@ up to the season 10 episode " Viva Ned Flanders " . In it , Homer takes Ned to Las Vegas to teach him how to have fun . While there , the two get intoxicated and wake up the next morning to find that they have gotten married to two cocktail waitresses , Amber and Ginger . The episode ends with Homer and Ned walking home from Vegas . Jean felt that the ending to " Viva Ned Flanders " was " a bit loose " because " ... if you leave a wife in Vegas , they track you down . " He pitched " Brawl in the Family " in order to " resolve it [ the ending to ' Viva Ned Flanders ' ] . " Amber and Ginger were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively . 
 " Brawl in the Family " features British actor and theater director Delroy Lindo as Gabriel , the social worker . According to Jean , Lindo was chosen to guest star because of his " great voice . " Gabriel was then designed to match Lindo 's voice . In the DVD commentary for the episode , Lindo expressed dissatisfaction with the character 's design . He said " Were I an audience member , looking at this [ the episode ] I 'd think , ' That guy doesn 't sound like he looks . ' " However , he added that his appearance in the episode earned him " much cred " among his nieces and nephews . In an interview with The A.V. Club , he said " After I did that voiceover , I was very aware of the power of The Simpsons , because in certain quarters , I got instant credibility . " The episode also features Jane Kaczmarek as Judge Constance Harm .

 On its original American broadcast on January 6 , 2002 , " Brawl in the Family " was watched by approximately 12 @.@ 8 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . It became the 28th most watched program of the week it aired , beating such shows as ABC 's 8 Simple Rules and NBC 's Crossing Jordan and Mister Sterling . Later that year , the episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Award in the category " Television Episodic - Comedy " , which it ultimately lost to the Dharma & Greg episode " Protecting the Ego @-@ System " . Its nomination was based solely on a scene in which " a bigger fish eats a smaller three @-@ eyed fish " , according to Jean , and because the award show was short on nominees . On August 24 , 2010 , " Brawl in the Family " was released as part of The Simpsons : The Complete Thirteenth Season DVD and Blu @-@ ray set . Al Jean , Joel H. Cohen , Max Pross , Delroy Lindo , Matt Warburton and David Silverman participated in the audio commentary of the episode . 
 Following its home video release , " Brawl in the Family " received negative reviews from critics . Aaron Peck of High @-@ Def Digest criticized the episode for being unoriginal , writing " Homer is always doing something that jeopardizes his marriage to Marge . When Homer 's ' Vegas Wife ' shows up unexpectedly [ ... ] the same thing happens . This is a storyline that has worn out its welcome , but it still continues . " 411Mania 's Ron Martin described the episode as having a " ridiculous set up " . Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well , calling it " <unk> to the point of ridiculousness . " While he didn 't consider it the worst episode he 's ever seen , he criticized the episode 's pacing and lack of satire , writing " it ’ s just that the plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags . [ ... ] the satire is gone ; it ’ s just incident after incident to set up gags ( some of which are funny ) and get the show to an end time . " 
 Writing for DVD Movie Guide , Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode " seems like two story fragments combined into one ; it ’ s like the writers couldn ’ t flesh out either tale for an entire 22 minutes so they just stuck two half @-@ programs together . " He added that it still " manages some laughs " , and also argued that the episode was very similar to the season 1 episode " There 's No Disgrace Like Home " , which was also noted by Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk . Despite receiving negative reviews , " Brawl in the Family " is often considered a fan favourite , and R. L. Shaffer of IGN called it one of the season 's " gems " . 
 = Helmuth Raithel = 
 Helmuth Raithel ( 9 April 1907 – 12 September 1990 ) was a German officer who held the rank of SS @-@ Standartenführer ( colonel ) in the Waffen @-@ SS during World War II . While still at school , Raithel was swept up in the excitement of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler , and was subsequently awarded the coveted Blood Order , even though he was not a member of the Nazi Party . He joined the Reichswehr ( interwar German Army ) in 1926 . After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941 , then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen @-@ SS in 1943 . 
 Raithel subsequently commanded a regiment of the newly formed 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar ( 1st Croatian ) and led it during fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia . Raithel was seriously wounded in mid @-@ 1944 and was replaced . When a new Waffen @-@ SS division was to be raised in June 1944 , the cadre was provided by the 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander . The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama ( 2nd Croatian ) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation , but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944 . Raithel quickly suppressed a mutiny by the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the division in mid @-@ October 1944 , but it was disbanded and its reliable troops were absorbed by the 13th SS Division and the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division . Raithel was then appointed to command a regiment of 6th SS Mountain Division Nord in Alsace , where his regiment fought the United States Army . He received a serious head wound during fighting northeast of Frankfurt in early April 1945 and was captured by the Americans . 
 Raithel recovered from his wounds and had a career in agriculture after the war , working in South Africa for many years . He returned to Bavaria when he retired and earned a doctorate of history from the University of Munich . His interest in mountaineering continued and he regularly climbed in the Alps into his seventies . He maintained contact with his former comrades from the 6th SS Division , attending many reunions . On 12 September 1990 at the age of 82 , he was returning home from the Semmering Pass in eastern Austria when he was killed in a traffic accident . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born Helmuth Hans Walter Paul Raithel in Ingolstadt , Kingdom of Bavaria , a federated state of the German Empire , on 9 April 1907 , he was the second son of a Bavarian Army officer . Raithel attended primary school then the <unk> @-@ Gymnasium München ( secondary school ) until 1926 . On 9 November 1923 at the age of 16 , Raithel was walking his bicycle in Munich when he stumbled across the Beer Hall Putsch being led by Adolf Hitler . Swept up in the excitement , he fell in with a group led by Freikorps veteran Gerhard <unk> . After shots were fired , he took cover with some of the group in an alley , one of whom wrote down Raithel 's name as one of the " party faithful " present that day . He was subsequently awarded the highly prized Nazi Party Blood Order , although he apparently did not have any political beliefs and was not a member of the Party at the time . 
 After he successfully completed secondary school in early 1926 , he joined the Reichswehr as a <unk> ( officer cadet ) on 1 April 1926 . He was posted to the 19th Infantry Regiment during which he spent four years commanding a Gebirgsjäger ( mountain infantry ) platoon . While he was with the regiment , the Reichswehr was absorbed by the Wehrmacht . Now part of the Gebirgs Brigade , Raithel gained experience as a signals officer and company commander , and was promoted to Hauptmann ( captain ) . With the creation of the 1st Gebirgs Division in April 1938 he was appointed as the adjutant of the 99th Gebirgsjäger Regiment . At the outbreak of war in September 1939 he was an instructor at the mountain infantry school at <unk> in the <unk> Alps . He was married and he and his wife had two daughters .

 In August 1940 , Raithel was transferred from instructional duties to command a battalion of the newly formed 6th Gebirgs Division , which had been deployed to France on occupation duty in anticipation of involvement in the planned invasion of the United Kingdom , Operation Sealion . When Sealion was abandoned , the division was sent first to Poland then in spring 1941 took part in the invasion of Greece . During the Battle of Metaxas Line in early April 1941 , the division , led by Generalmajor ( Brigadier ) Ferdinand Schörner , breached the formidable Greek defences by crossing a 2 @,@ 100 @-@ metre ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) snow @-@ covered mountain pass considered inaccessible by the Greeks . This enabled the division to cut the rail line to Thessaloniki . 
 Raithel was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class in late April 1941 . Following the defeat of Greece and its allies , the division was deployed to Lapland in northern Finland in September 1941 . Raithel remained as a battalion commander with the 143rd Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the division in Finland and was promoted to Major on 1 November 1941 . Schörner became Raithel 's mentor during their service with the 6th Gebirgs Division . In January 1942 he was awarded the German Cross in Gold . In August 1942 he was transferred to the Oberkommando des Heeres ( Army Headquarters ) reserve pool for an extended period , during which he returned to the mountain infantry school then served briefly with the 133rd Fortress Division on Crete . He was promoted to Oberstleutnant ( lieutenant colonel ) on 1 October 1943 .

 In 1943 , his mentor Schörner , now a General der <unk> ( lieutenant general ) , advised him to transfer to the quickly expanding Waffen @-@ SS where regimental command would be easier to come by , particularly as his Blood Order was especially prized in the Waffen @-@ SS . Raithel subsequently transferred to the Waffen @-@ SS ( and Allgemeine SS ) on 30 November 1943 , but still did not join the Nazi Party . He was immediately appointed to command a regiment of the newly formed 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar ( 1st Croatian ) , the rank @-@ and @-@ file of which were mostly Bosnian Muslims . Initially appointed as an SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer ( lieutenant colonel ) commanding the 28th Waffen Gebirgsjäger Regiment , he oversaw the completion of his regiment 's training at the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany ( present @-@ day Poland ) then led his regiment to fight the Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) in February 1944 . The division was given the primary role of securing around 6 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 2 @,@ 300 sq mi ) of territory ( the designated security zone ) in north @-@ eastern Bosnia within the NDH . The security zone encompassed the Posavina , Semberija and Majevica regions between the Sava , Bosna , Drina and Spreča rivers . Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler saw this task as critical to the safeguarding of important agricultural areas and Volksdeutsche ( ethnic German ) settlements in the Syrmia region to the north . 
 Between March and June 1944 Raithel commanded his regiment during several major operations , including what may have been the largest anti @-@ Partisan sweep of the war , Operation Maibaum ( Maypole ) . He was promoted to SS @-@ Standartenführer ( colonel ) on 1 April 1944 . Raithel led his regiment well , resulting in a serious wound in June 1944 . On 11 June 1944 , he was recommended for an award of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross citing his leadership and courage while commanding the regiment , but it was not approved . While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter @-@ insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia between March and August 1944 , the 13th SS Division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery , not only during combat operations , but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone . 
 When a second Bosnian Muslim Waffen @-@ SS division was to be raised in June 1944 , the cadre was provided by the 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander . The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama ( 2nd Croatian ) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation , but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944 . The Bosnian Muslim members of the division mutinied on 17 October 1944 , but Raithel quickly gained control over the situation . Following the mutiny , the division was formally disbanded on 31 October and reliable elements were absorbed by the 13th SS Division and the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division .

 After a short time convalescing as part of the SS Führungshauptamt ( SS headquarters ) reserve pool , Raithel was appointed to command the 11th Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord in December 1944 . In early January 1945 , the division was located around <unk> near the French @-@ Reich border , reeling from their losses in what was the last major German offensive of World War II on the Western Front , Operation Nordwind . Committed to a series of desperate counterattacks against the United States Army XV Corps , on one occasion Raithel 's regiment infiltrated the American positions , surrounding five US infantry companies and taking 450 prisoners of war . The fighting depleted the already understrength regiment , with one company numbering only eight men by 20 January . The commander of one of the US battalions they fought in January 1945 ruefully described Raithel 's regiment as , " the best men we ever ran into , extremely aggressive , and impossible to capture . There was no driving them out , for they fought until they were killed " . 
 After a quiet period in February 1945 absorbing replacements , the division was withdrawn from the defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army . This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz . By 19 March , Raithel 's regiment had been converted into a kampfgruppe ( battlegroup ) consisting of two <unk> battalions , a mountain artillery battalion , a pioneer company and eight anti @-@ tank guns . Two weeks later they were fighting their way out of encirclement near Limburg . On 1 April 1945 , " Kampfgruppe Raithel " and the rest of what remained of the division drove east . Shortly afterwards , Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured . The remnants of the division disintegrated over the next few days and weeks and were captured by the Americans .
